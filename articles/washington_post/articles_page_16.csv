Tim Kaine says he'll seek re-election in 2018 but is ruling out a presidential bid in 2020. The former Democratic vice presidential nominee said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday that his place is in the Senate and his decision not to run in 2020 is final.  ""Period. Full stop,"" Kaine said. With a heightened national profile after campaigning across the country for more than three months as Hillary Clinton's running mate, Kaine could have chosen to pursue his own White House ambitions or tried and play a leading role charting a reeling Democratic Party's direction in the Donald Trump era. But the first-term senator and former governor said he belongs in the upper chamber, where he will be part of a Democratic minority whose ability to filibuster will be ""the only emergency brake there is"" on Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. Kaine has already been a vocal critic of Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon as a senior advisor. Kaine said Bannon's ties to white nationalism and anti-Semitism disqualify him from a senior role in the White House. Kaine said he would continue to guard against the ""normalization"" by Trump of what Kaine said were un-American values, but he added that he's keeping an open mind about the billionaire businessman's presidency.  ""I have a lot of concerns, but I don't think it's fair to the administration to just assume everything that was said during the campaign will be done,"" Kaine said, noting that Trump had already shown some post-Election Day flexibility on issues like gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act. Kaine said there were some issues Democrats could work with Trump on, including increased infrastructure spending and raising the tax rate on carried interest, which is often used by managers for private equity firms and hedge funds to reduce tax payments. Kaine said he plans to use his higher national profile to continue to advocate for issues he's long cared about, notably on increasing Congress' role in war-making powers.  ""I've been willing to stand up and do that with a president of my own party and I tell you, I'm sure going to be willing to stand up to President Trump,"" Kaine said. Kaine has twice come close to being vice president. He was on President Barack Obama's shortlist in 2008 and many expected Clinton to win this year. On the campaign trail this year, the deeply spiritual Kaine often told supporters that the election would work out the way things are supposed to. Kaine said Clinton's loss was ""hard"" to take but didn't shake his faith that the outcome was for a reason, even if not immediately obvious.  ""Maybe the whole reason I'm in the Senate was less being in the Senate when there was President Obama, who was a friend of mine. Maybe the reason I'm in the Senate is for the next four years,"" Kaine said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Trump must choose thousands of appointees and nominees who will oversee the nation's security, economy, foreign affairs and domestic policies. His picks so far suggest that loyalty is paramount. Early backers and those who served key roles in Trump's campaign will continue to form the inner circle of a Trump administration filled with a combination of experienced, Washington insiders and controversial outsiders, including some whose selection has sparked anger and alarm. Here's who he's chosen so far. -- WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Reince Priebus The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Priebus earned Trump's trust and confidence over the campaign. The 44-year-old Wisconsin political operative, who has spent his career as a Republican party official, is poised to be one of Trump's most important gatekeepers, controlling access to the president and providing counsel. -- CHIEF STRATEGIST and SENIOR COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Steve Bannon One of Trump's most controversial hires to date, Bannon joined Trump's campaign as CEO in August after serving as the head of Breitbart News -- a far-right outlet that is one of Trump's biggest backers. Bannon, 62, worked for Goldman Sachs, then started his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm. After selling the business, he became a film producer, which introduced him to conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart and author Peter Schweizer. Jewish groups and a long list of Democratic leaders have denounced Bannon's hiring and called on Trump to reconsider. -- ATTORNEY GENERAL: Sen. Jeff Sessions The first senator to endorse the president elect, Alabama's Sessions is known for his tough stance on immigration enforcement policies. Sessions, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and Alabama attorney general before his election to the U.S. Senate, is expected to push the Justice Department to the right. Sessions, 69, could, however, face confirmation hiccups: His last confirmation hearing, in 1986 for a federal judgeship, was derailed over allegations that he'd made racially charged remarks while U.S. attorney in Alabama. -- ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY: Michael Flynn A retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn was another early Trump backer and served as the president-elect's top military adviser during the campaign. After retiring in 2014, Flynn quickly turned on the Obama administration and accused it of being soft on terrorism.In recent public comments, Flynn has emphasized his view that Islamic State extremists pose an existential threat on a global scale and demanded a far more aggressive U.S. military campaign against the group. In August, he declared that Islam ""is a political ideology"" and that it ""definitely hides behind being a religion."" DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: Rep. Mike Pompeo -- The Kansas congressman is a relatively new face in Trump's circle. The hard-line Republican shares much of Trump's worldview. He has heavily criticized the landmark Iran nuclear deal, blasted Hillary Clinton over the attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya and her use of a private email server, and believes Edward Snowden is a traitor who deserves a death sentence.

Pompeo has heavily criticized the landmark Iran nuclear deal, blasted Hillary Clinton over the attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya and her use of a private email server and has said former National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden is a traitor who deserves a death sentence. The Kansas lawmaker supports restoring the National Security Agency's bulk collection of telephone metadata, a contentious terror-fighting tool Congress eliminated after Snowden's revelations. It's unclear if Pompeo's views on using harsh interrogation techniques completely mirror those of Trump, who says: ""We should go tougher than waterboarding,"" which simulates drowning. One statement issued by Pompeo in 2014 offers a glimpse into his views. After the Senate released its report on the enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA, Pompeo rejected accusations that U.S. intelligence and military personnel were ""torturers"" for harshly interrogating terror suspects captured after 9/11. ""These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots,"" Pompeo said That issue likely will come up in his confirmation hearing in the Republican-led Senate. A smooth confirmation is not assured because many Democrats oppose his partisan work on the Benghazi committee and Republican libertarians would challenge his view on NSA bulk collection. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence committee, said she would challenge Pompeo about his statements on the torture report. She said he was wrong in 2014 when he said the CIA's detention and interrogation program was within the law.  ""The torture used during that time was beyond any legal justification, it certainly was not supported by the Constitution and the full Senate Intelligence committee was only briefed on this program hours before President (George W.) Bush made it public,"" said Feinstein, who called the interrogation program ""ineffective"" and ""brutal."" Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said Pompeo can be partisan, but that he was a ""good choice -- a solid choice -- for CIA.""  ""I'm confident that he can take the party hat off and provide good, unbiased intelligence to both the administration and Congress,"" Schiff said. Pompeo, who was elected to Congress during the tea party wave of 2010, served on the House Select Benghazi Committee to probe the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The panel's final report this summer sharply criticized the Obama administration for a series of mistakes but produced no new evidence pointing to wrongdoing by Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time. Pompeo and fellow Republican Jim Jordan of Ohio, however, issued a separate report slamming Clinton and the administration. Pompeo called the former first lady and senator ""morally reprehensible."" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who will be the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence committee beginning in January, said in a statement that he would vigorously oversee the CIA to ensure it adheres ""to America's principles and international obligations."" Leon Panetta, who also served as CIA director, said his impression of Pompeo ""is that he is a serious-minded supporter of strong, credible intelligence."" Pompeo has been a fierce critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal, which granted Tehran sanctions relief for rolling back its nuclear weapons program. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in terrorist attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. Pompeo denounced Snowden, a former NSA contractor who stole and leaked highly classified documents to journalists, revealing the agency's program for gathering the phone records of millions of Americans. During an appearance on C-SPAN in February, Pompeo said Snowden should receive the death penalty for his actions.  ""He should be brought back from Russia and given due process and I think the proper outcome would be that he would be given a death sentence,"" Pompeo said. Snowden, who spoke Friday from Moscow via a video link during an event of the Norwegian chapter of PEN in Oslo, Norway, criticized Pompeo's selection to lead the spy agency. ""In my country, the new CIA director believes dissidents should be put to death,"" Snowden said. Pompeo also has fought against Obama's attempts to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and opposed moving prisoners to the U.S., including Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. Pompeo was born in Orange, California, and lives in Wichita, Kansas. He set up Thayer Aerospace and was its chief executive officer for more than 10 years. Later he was president of Sentry International, a company that sold equipment for oil fields and manufacturing. Pompeo graduated top of his class in from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1986 and went on to earn a degree from Harvard University where he edited the prestigious Harvard Law Review. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Gillum and Matthew Daly and Jan M.

Indictments name Lake County Sheriff John Buncich, Chief Deputy Tim Downs, Portage Mayor James Snyder and tow company owners William Szarmach of Chase Street Auto in Lake Station and John Cortina of Kustom Auto Body in Portage, U.S. Attorney David Capp said at a news conference. The FBI last week raided Buncich's offices in Crown Point, Indiana, 45 miles southeast of Chicago. The indictment alleges that between February 2014 and October 2016, Buncich, Downs and Szarmach worked to enrich Buncich and his campaign committee, Buncich Boosters, through towing contracts. Buncich received over $25,000 in cash and $7,000, often collected by Downs, in checks from Szarmach and an unnamed individual for towing contracts in Gary and Lake County, prosecutors said. The three men face wire fraud charges, and Buncich and Szarmach also are charged with bribery. Snyder, named in a separate indictment, is accused of receiving $12,000 from Cortina and the same unnamed individual for towing contracts in Portage, located in neighboring Porter County. He's also accused of accepting $13,000 for other city contracts or projects from 2013 to 2014. He's faces a charge of obstructing tax laws for impeding the government's collection of personal taxes he owed and payroll taxes owed by his mortgage business, First Financial Trust Mortgage LLC. Buncich, Downs, Szarmach and Cortina were all arrested and taken into custody Friday morning, Capp said. Snyder was to surrender to federal authorities later, officials said.  ""These investigations are not over,"" Capp said. ""Our public corruption team will continue its work, particularly into the towing contracts in both Lake and Porter counties."" Buncich is the chairman of the Lake County Democratic Party and was elected to his fourth term as sheriff in 2015. Snyder, a Republican, was elected to his second term as mayor in 2015. Snyder's attorney, Thomas Kirsch, issued a statement saying the mayor's indictment ""comes as a complete surprise.""  ""Mayor Snyder looks forward to fighting these charges in a court of law and to complete vindication,"" the statement said. Buncich issued a statement saying his department was ""continuing to run as normal."" Calls to Szarmach's towing company in Lake Station rang busy, while the person who answered the phone at Cortina's Portage business hung up on a reporter. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Nikki Haley speaks at the National Press Club in Washington in 2015. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley upbraided the Republican establishment on Friday, arguing the party lost its way by ignoring anger and frustration, and that it must return to its core values of limited government and being a party for all people -- including immigrants and people of color. Haley, speaking at the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington, offered some praise for President-elect Donald Trump, telling the crowd of conservative lawyers that while she was never Trump's ""biggest cheerleader,"" the Republican Party has an unprecedented opportunity to enact conservative policies and must take advantage of Trump's election. But she called for Republicans to conduct a detailed autopsy of the party's win -- as it would in defeat -- and said it must remind people that it is the party who will offer opportunities ""to all citizens, regardless of their race, gender or where they are born and raised."" Haley met with Trump on Thursday at Trump Tower in Manhattan, stoking speculation she is under consideration for a Cabinet post in the new administration. The governor's name has been floated for labor secretary, commerce secretary -- even secretary of state. On Friday, Haley spoke of her parents, Indian immigrants who left a comfortable life and came to the United States with $8 in their pockets in search of a better life.   [From the rumored to the named: The latest updates to the Trump Cabinet]   ""If we as Republicans are going to lead effectively and have staying power as a governing power, we must accept that Donald Trump's election was not an affirmation of the way Republicans have conducted themselves,"" she said. Voters, she said, rejected the political class, ""and we have no one to blame but ourselves"" because the party  ""moved toward big government rather than away from it . . . Republicans lost their way."" She also talked about the decision to take the Confederate flag down from the South Carolina statehouse grounds and the impact that the 2015 shooting deaths of nine people at a historically black Charleston church -- which she said were ""the act of a racist"" -- had on her and the state. ""What we saw in the extraordinary reaction to Charleston was people of all races coming together. We didn't have riots, we had vigils. We didn't have protests, we had hugs,"" she said. Haley noted that ""many honorable people"" support hanging the flag out of heritage. ""They are not racists,"" she said, noting they twice elected a black senator and Indian American governor. During the legislative debate over removing the flag, she said people listened to one another. ""The flag came down and South Carolina has moved forward."" Haley did not specifically mention the appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, to be Trump's chief strategist, a move that was blasted by Jewish groups and political operatives on both sides of the aisle who said he is too close to the alt-right and white nationalism, or the appointment Friday of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be attorney general. Sessions was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after former colleagues testified before a Senate committee that he joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were ""okay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana.""   [Sessions expected to bring sweeping changes to Justice Department]   Sen. Ted Cruz also spoke at the gathering and praised Sessions, saying the senator ""is going to make an extraordinary attorney general of the United States."" ""He is a committed and deeply principled conservative, and if those who serve in this administration have even a fraction of his integrity and his commitment to principle, we are going to see an administration that does remarkable things for the people of this country."" The Texas Republican, who met with Trump in New York on Tuesday, reversed himself when asked if he wants to serve on the Supreme Court. In May he said it was ""not a desire of my heart"" and had a different view today. ""What I will say is that history is long and can take unexpected paths,"" he said. ""I think it is absolutely vital that that seat and every other seat that comes vacant on the court be filled by principled constitutionalists who will be faithful to the law,"" he said. Cruz said he has spoken with Trump's transition team and that he has ""very much encouraged that team to use executive authority"" not only to roll back President Obama's executive orders but ""to use it in legitimate ways, to reduce the burdens of government."" Cruz urged the roomful of conservative lawyers to serve in a Trump administration -- but also to keep their moral and ethical compass. ""Be honest and trustworthy. If we are to be good stewards of the law we must be good stewards of our souls. Do not follow the example of the previous administration. The practice of law should be ... a deeply moral undertaking,"" he said. ""The law is not something to be shaped like a potter molds clay."""

Bernie Sanders called on Donald Trump to apologize for his inflammatory rhetoric during the presidential campaign and asked him cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. The president-elect named Bannon as a top White House adviser on Monday, sparking an outcry from Democrats who blasted the conservative media CEO as peddling conspiracy theories and white supremacy. Sanders, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton, says his office received ""many, many"" calls asking Trump to withdraw the appointment.  ""What we are seeing all over this country is extraordinary fear,"" Sanders said at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. He said Trump should try to ""make the American people feel comfortable"" by rescinding Bannon's nomination. The self-identified independent also said there may be opportunities for Democrats to work with Trump on some of his campaign promises including curbing high pharmaceutical drug pieces, renegotiating trade deals, cutting the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will ""improve life for working people.""  ""He said a whole lot of things. Was he serious or were these just campaign slogans?"" he said. ""We will hold him accountable."" Sanders told reporters that he hasn't spoken personally to Clinton but believes she has an important role to play in the party's future. She made her first public remarks since her concession speech in Washington on Wednesday evening, urging her supporters to ""stay engaged"" in political activism. Democrats, he said, must do some ""soul searching"" in the coming months. He's backing Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison head up the Democratic National Committee, arguing the first Muslim-American member of Congress could bring some fresh ideas to the party.  ""It is time for the Democratic party to reassess what it stands for and where it wants to go,"" he said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/17/rural-hispanic-voters-like-white-rural-voters-shifted-toward-trump-heres-why/	Rural Hispanic voters — like white rural voters — shifted toward Trump. Here’s why.	"   undefined  Many observers contend that Hispanic voters will shape the future of American politics. But it's not yet clear exactly what their influence will be. There's been debate about whether they may portend a permanent Democratic majority; vote according to ethnic backgrounds -- Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban American; or hold political points of view that vary by economics or region, much like other Americans. With the 2016 election, we have a new set of data to help us investigate this question. My county-by-county comparison of election results in 2016 and 2012, drawn from data available at CNN.com, Politico.com, PBS.org and other sites, shows that rural white and rural Hispanic voters have a lot in common. Or to put it another way, the election of 2016 revealed an urban/rural divide that was as strong as the white/Hispanic divide.   [How rural resentment helps explain Donald Trump's victory]   Election analysts have noted that Donald Trump ran up the vote in rural, largely white counties in the Rust Belt and the Midwest. He flipped or narrowed Hillary Clinton's margin of victory in others. Because these rural voters came out so strongly, states that hadn't helped elect a Republican for a long time -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and most likely Michigan -- delivered his electoral victory, however narrowly. And here's the surprise: many rural Southwestern counties with large Hispanic, predominantly Mexican populations, moved in Trump's direction as well. That wasn't true in Southwestern states as a whole. States like New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas remained blue or became less red. Hillary Clinton got strong Hispanic turnout in Sun Belt metropolises like Las Vegas, Phoenix, and San Antonio. But if you look closely at many largely Hispanic rural areas in these states, you find that Trump did better -- and Hillary did worse -- than did Mitt Romney or Barack Obama. Voting in these counties was much like that in similar counties in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. There's been contention about how Hispanics voted When postelection reports suggested that Trump performed surprisingly well among Hispanic voters, the polling firm Latino Decisions rejected the claim. The firm specializes in polling Latino voters, and enumerated the risks of relying on exit polls to understand that electorate's behavior. The firm vigorously defended its own election eve polls, which suggested that Clinton would rack up historically wide margins from Latinos.   [In record numbers, Latinos voted overwhelmingly against Trump. We did the research.]   But Latino Decisions, in defense of polls it conducted leading up to the election, has focused on overwhelmingly Hispanic precincts in more urban areas, not the rural communities that tell a different story. In dozens of rural counties throughout the Southwest, Clinton performed worse in 2016 than Obama did in 2012, as you can see in the figure below. In Guadalupe County, N.M., about an hour's drive east of Albuquerque, she received 17 percent less of the vote than Obama did four years ago -- 53 percent compared with Obama's 70 percent. In several other counties where Hispanics accounted for half to nearly all of the population -- Rio Arriba, N.M.; Costilla, Colo.; Greenlee, Ariz.; and Duval, Tex., for example -- Clinton took home roughly 10 percent fewer votes than did Obama in 2012. In many more heavily Latino counties, her votes lagged behind Obama's by 3 to 8 points.     Even in the South Texas counties that Latino Decisions has named bulwarks of Clinton support -- the Rio Grande Valley below San Antonio, where she won between 70 and 85 percent of the vote -- she didn't do as well as Obama had done four years earlier. In Brooks County, which, according to the 2015 American Community Survey, is 89.5 percent Hispanic, Clinton's tally was 3.9 percent less than Obama's. In Zavala County, which is 93.1 percent Hispanic, it was 5.6 percent less. In Duval County, which is 88.8 percent Hispanic, it was 9.8 percent less. Meanwhile, as you can see below, Trump did much better among Hispanics in the rural Southwest than Romney did. He received a greater share of the vote than Romney had in more than a dozen counties with large Hispanic populations: six percent more than Romney in Starr County, Tex., which is 95.8 percent Hispanic; 7.5 percent more in Costilla County, N.M., which is 63.6 percent Hispanic; and 9.1 percent more in Duval County, Texas, which is 88.8 percent Hispanic.     Clinton may have received more votes than Obama did in many parts of South Texas, where, as a politically-motivated student at Yale Law School, she knocked on doors in predominantly Mexican neighborhoods for the McGovern campaign. But Trump also received more votes in South Texas than Romney did. Clinton rallied thousands more voters, but so did Trump. His supporters there matched the enthusiasm of Clinton's, just as they did in dozens of rural counties with large Hispanic populations in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. In fact, two Colorado counties where Hispanics constitute about half the population flipped from blue to red. Conejos County, which is 53.7 percent Hispanic, went for Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016. So did Las Animas County, which is 42.6 percent Hispanic. In both counties, turnout was lower for Clinton than it had been for Obama, and higher for Trump than it was for Romney.   [Trump got more votes from people of color than Romney did. Here's the data.]   To be sure, some of these rural Southwestern counties are extremely small compared with the big cities where Hispanic support for Clinton was strong. In small counties, the Hispanic vote adds up to hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands -- while in cities, it totals hundreds of thousands. Therefore, rural Hispanics won't be credited with moving the needle much in one direction or the other. So yes, there was a Hispanic ""surge"" in big Southwestern cities that helped Clinton hold on to New Mexico, Colorado, and Nevada, and helped make Trump's margin of victory in Arizona and Texas narrower than it had been for any Republican in two decades. But that ignores the vote in rural counties across the country -- including those that are largely Hispanic -- that led to Trump's victory. Why would Hispanics vote for Trump, despite his many anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican statements? One answer: poverty. The Hispanic communities in the rural Southwest that moved toward Trump were some of the poorest in their states. Take San Miguel, Guadalupe, and Mora Counties in New Mexico, whose populations are 77.1, 79.2, and 80.2 percent Hispanic, respectively. These three counties have New Mexico's lowest median household income, highest rates of unemployment, and lowest rates of labor market participation. The median income in these counties for families with a head of household between the ages of 25 and 44 is between $25,000 and $30,000 per year, or about half the national median income ($55,000) for families with heads in the same age range. These counties lost, on average, about 5 percent of their population between 2010 and 2015. In other words, they've suffered the same tough economic circumstances as did some of the Midwestern counties that handed Trump the election. They're more similar to than different from other forgotten counties across the United States, where voters upended the predictions of pollsters and shouted against the status quo.   [The electoral college has serious problems. So do any alternatives.]   Ruben Navarette Jr. wrote in The Daily Beast that the election ""boiled down to a brutish tug-of-war between Latinos in the battleground states of the West ... and working class whites in the Rust Belt"" -- let's add the upper Midwest -- and ""in the end, Trump found enough white voters to offset losses with Latinos."" But that's only partly true. In reality, many rural Hispanics and working class whites pulled on the same side of the rope. Geraldo L.

Tim Kaine, right, and former president Bill Clinton applaud as former secretary of state Hillary Clinton delivers her concession speech on Nov. 9 in the presidential race. (Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images)  In last week's presidential election, Hillary Clinton lost nearly all the swing states. However, Clinton managed to cling to Virginia -- the home state of her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D). Did Kaine's presence on the ticket help save Virginia for the Democrats? We believe it did. Some political science research argues that vice-presidential candidates do not significantly impact the vote -- even in their home state. In contrast, our research shows that VP candidates add an average of nearly 3 percentage points to their ticket's vote in their home states. Our research relies on a new approach to measure the vice-presidential home state advantage, known as ""synthetic controls."" For each running mate, we use a combination of similar states to construct a ""synthetic"" version of their home state, which mirrors the electoral results of the home state over a series of past elections. For example, to estimate how much Vice President-elect Mike Pence helped the Republican ticket in Indiana, we constructed a ""synthetic Indiana"" that combines Nebraska, Montana, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Utah and Alabama. None of these states, on their own, perfectly match Indiana in the last several elections. But once combined, the Republican vote share in ""synthetic Indiana"" looks quite similar to that of Indiana from 1984 to 2012. The difference between Indiana and ""synthetic Indiana"" is that ""synthetic Indiana"" does not have a home state running mate on the ticket in 2016. The gap that emerges between the two versions of Indiana, in 2016, is our estimate of Pence's home-state advantage: 2.53 points. Given the GOP's strength there, Pence's presence on the ticket did not flip the state. Indeed, as we noted after Pence's selection, Indiana is a reliably Republican state. Trump would have received nearly 58 percent of the vote there even without Pence's support. Kaine's influence in Virginia is a different story. Our estimate is that Kaine added 2.81 points to Clinton's vote share. Given that she received only 52.78 percent of the two-party vote in Virginia, this means she could have lost Virginia  if not for Kaine -- although it would have been quite a nail-biter.    Of course, Kaine's presence on the ticket didn't change the overall outcome. At most, it might have prevented Trump from winning an even larger electoral college majority. Nevertheless, Kaine's potential impact on the outcome shows the value in selecting a running mate from a major swing state. If Clinton had performed slightly better in other swing states, while still needing Virginia to hit 270 electoral votes, Kaine could have been a true game-changer. Future presidential nominees should use this knowledge to their advantage. Boris Heersink is a PhD candidate in the Woodrow Wilson Department of Politics at the University of Virginia. Brenton D.

Small towns like Soave avoided the dilemma for years, even as cities coped with the tens of thousands of migrants rescued at sea. But the system is burgeoning amid persistent migrant arrivals -- a record 27,500 in October, bringing to nearly 160,000 total so far this year -- and tighter border controls under pressure from European neighbors. Prefects nationwide have been looking for space -- empty hotels, disused barracks -- and communities have been mounting increasing resistance. They succeeded in the Adriatic clamming town of Goro, and a round-the-clock presidio is being staffed near barracks in the Lombard town of Montichiari. The prefect in Cagliari in Sardinia last week received a package with a pair of bullets in protest of migrant relocations. In the latest demonstration, more than 1,000 people marched under torchlight through the Medieval center of Soave, an idyllic walled town of 7,100 in the province of Verona surrounded by vineyards tucked in Italy's industrial heartland. Many arrived from towns and cities nearby, marching behind a banner, ""Verona for Veronese,"" and chanting, ""Italy for Italians,"" slogans of a growing movement honing in on discontent as more communities stand up against the Rome government's plans to relocate asylum-seekers in their midst. Residents who joined them cited security concerns and the imperative to help Italians still stung by the economic crisis or suffering after the recent string of quakes. Organizers from the ""Verona for Veronese"" movement that has organized recent protests throughout the province, with some successes in delaying relocations, say they are convinced that the Trump vote will awaken support for fringe groups in Italy.  ""The vote in America shouldn't be seen as a springboard, but as a strong trampoline to re-establish order in our cities,"" protest organizer Luca Castellini said. ""The multiracial society is a failure. It has failed even in the country (the U.S.) that was born as a multiracial society."" In Castellini's view, the disenfranchised vote in Italy, the next time polls come around, won't go toward leading populist movements like the 5-Star Movement, or even the anti-migrant Northern League, which has played roles in past center-right governments. It's starting to align itself with more extreme right-wing movements in France, the Netherlands and Russia, he said.  ""It will go to movements outside the system that will succeed in having the possibility to rise above the media and make themselves seen in the public arena, movements like Forza Nuova,"" he said, citing a nationalist movement widely seen as neo-Fascist. The popular anger exuded by people marching through the heart of Soave's center was in contrast to the bureaucratic battle being waged by the mayor to prevent the resettlement of 100 migrants to a hotel in the town's industrial zone.  ""What worries me most in this moment isn't so much helping someone who could need help, it is the fact of uncertainty,"" Mayor Lino Gambaretto told The Associated Press. ""How much time? What will happen next? When the money from the EU, if they give it to us, won't be there anymore, who will be responsible for these people, when at this time I can't guarantee services to the people of Soave who are in difficulty."" Gambaretto, who heads a center-right administration with no political affiliation, didn't participate in the protests, but said he would if national officials imposed an excessive number of migrants. To help stop the project, Gambaretto has proposed enrolling Soave in the Interior Ministry's system to organize shelter for asylum-seekers, which has set proposed limits at three asylum-seekers for every 1,000 residents in participating towns. Under that, Soave's quota of about 21 would be nearly met by one community of about 10 asylum-seekers already in the village of Fitta' and another set to open soon with six to eight asylum-seekers in the neighboring village of Castelcerino, both under Soave's administration. The Rev. Paolo Pasetto, a Soave native, runs a transitional home in Fitta' for former drug addicts, the homeless and others who have fallen on hard luck. Building on that experience, he is working to open an asylum-seeker shelter in a closed trattoria in neighboring Castelcerino in December.  ""We feel in our hearts the need to respond even in small numbers to this drama, which we aren't capable of managing. And where we can't manage things, we find fear and anger. We understand the difficulties of the community,"" he said. Even as protesters claim that Italy needs to take care of Italians first, Pasetto notes that few have come to offer aid to the mostly Italians he has helped over the last dozen years. And he expressed disappointment that most residents of Castelcerino chose to boycott a recent meeting where he outlined plans to help the incoming asylum-seekers adjust to life in Italy. Still, he remains optimistic that people will come around.  ""We know it is a town of good people, tied to the land, who know how to work, people who once they get over this first phase of difficulties, there will be another phase where we are able to confront these difficulties together,"" he said.
