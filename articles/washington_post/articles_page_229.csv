Rolando ""Kerwin"" Espinosa Jr. arrived in handcuffs and flak jacket at Manila's airport with a police team that fetched him from Abu Dhabi. National police chief Ronald dela Rosa, who has assured Espinosa's safety, escorted him from the airport to a maximum-security facility at the police headquarters. Espinosa's father, town mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr., was arrested last month. He had agreed to cooperate with officials but was killed Nov. 5 in an alleged gun fight with police inside his jail cell. Senators investigating the case suspect it was an intentional killing. At a news conference at the police headquarters, the younger Espinosa apologized to Duterte and asked for a chance to turn a new leaf.  ""I ask forgiveness from President Duterte,"" he said. ""Whatever I have done in the past, I hope he can give me a chance to lead a new life."" He assured Duterte that ""all that I know about the drug trade will be revealed, all the names."" Human rights groups and Western governments have criticized Duterte's anti-drug campaign that has left more than 4,000 suspected addicts and pushers dead since July.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports (http://bit.ly/2glVrRs ) Thursday that Stone Park mayor and liquor commissioner Beniamino Mazzulla said Club Allure violates an ordinance that prohibits the sale of liquor within 100 feet of a church, school or home for the aged. Club Allure attorney and former investor Robert Itzkow says the ruling will be appealed to the state's Liquor Control Commission. He also says the club will continue to offer liquor. In January, a Cook County Circuit Court judge told the Missionary Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo to rework their 2013 lawsuit against the club. The judge dismissed arguments that the club violated prostitution regulations and local zoning laws. Stone Park is west of Chicago. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He has vowed to roll back Obama's signature effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, known as the Clean Power Plan, and to scrap a litany of other ""unnecessary"" rules, especially those imposed on the oil, gas and coal sectors. The man planning how a Trump administration can obliterate Obama's environmental legacy is Myron Ebell, a Washington fixture who has long been a cheerful warrior against what he sees as an alarmist, overzealous environmental movement that has used global warming as a pretext for expanding government. Ebell has argued for opening up more federal lands for logging, oil and gas exploration and coal mining, and for turning over more permitting authority to the states. And he has urged the Senate to vote to reject an international climate accord signed last year in Paris. The self-described public-policy wonk has for years made his home at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a conservative policy group that once received considerable funding from ExxonMobil. More recently, the organization has been funded in part by Donors Trust. The Virginia-based organization, which is not required by law to disclose its contributors, is staffed largely by people who have worked for Koch Industries or nonprofit groups supported by the conservative Koch brothers. Ebell, who is not a scientist, has long questioned the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity is fueling unprecedented global warming. He also has staunchly opposed what he calls energy rationing, instead arguing that the United States should unleash the full power of coal, oil and gas to fuel economic growth and job creation. All that makes him an ideal ambassador for Trump, who has repeatedly called the notion of man-made climate change a ""hoax.""      Donald Trump will enter the White House with an environmental policy agenda opposed to that of the Obama administration and many other nations that have pledged support to the Paris climate agreement. The Washington Post's Chris Mooney breaks down what a Donald Trump presidency will mean when it comes to climate change. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)     [Trump victory reverses U.S. energy and environmental priorities]   Ebell declined to comment this week on his work or the type of people likely to be appointed to run the EPA, instead referring inquiries to the Trump transition headquarters. But it doesn't take much imagination to figure out the likely list of priorities. The ""energy independence"" section of Trump's transition website -- there is no ""environment"" section -- reads like an oil-and-gas-industry wish list. ""Rather than continuing the current path to undermine and block America's fossil fuel producers, the Trump Administration will encourage the production of these resources by opening onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and waters,"" the site states. ""We will streamline the permitting process for all energy projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama, and rescind the job-destroying executive actions under his Administration. We will end the war on coal, and rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration."" The site does say that Trump is ""firmly committed to conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats."" But it has no specifics on what that might mean, other than ""America's environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas."" Presumably that means people such as Ebell. He has gleefully opposed environmentalists and railed against the policies of the Obama administration and others that take aim at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions -- and by extension weaning the United States off its dependence of fossil fuels. A 2007 Vanity Fair profile described Ebell as a ""sound-bite artist"" and an ""oil-industry mouthpiece."" ""Almost no scientist doubts that global warming is here, that man-made greenhouse gases are to blame, or that if we don't cut back on those gases fairly soon we'll be in a heap of trouble,"" the article said. ""But as the 'other hand' in all those news stories, Ebell and his quotable cohorts sustain the impression that a scientific debate is still raging. The more studies that confirm global warming, the more ink Ebell gets.""   [What it would really mean if Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement]   Last year, when Pope Francis in an encyclical wrote about the ""urgent challenge to protect our common home"" and said ""the earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor,"" Ebell was quick to pounce. ""The Vatican seems to have forgotten to consider the effects that energy-rationing policies to reduce emissions will also have on poor people in poor countries,"" he said on CEI's website. ""Putting the world on an energy-starvation diet will consign billions of people to perpetual energy poverty."" During an appearance on C-SPAN last year, Ebell criticized the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan as an example of the type of aggressive regulation that would hinder the U.S. economy while proclaiming to address what he said was the overblown issue of global warming. ""I think that the environmental movement has been proclaiming doom right around the corner since it was founded in the late 1960s,"" he said. ""It's how they fund the environmental movement. It's how they attract political support, by saying we have this crisis. We've had one crisis after another. Many of them were real problems, but not crises.""

The midday incident began after about 100 protesters confronted crews doing dirt work along the pipeline route where pipe had already been laid. Workers were safety evacuated, but protesters threw rocks, vandalized equipment, slashed tires on law enforcement vehicles, and used themselves and vehicles to block a county road and state Highway 6, according to Morton County sheriff's spokeswoman Donnell Hushka. Authorities shut down a 10-mile stretch of the highway for public safety reasons for about two hours before the skirmish died down early in the afternoon. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Highway Patrol Lt. Tom Iverson said six vehicles belonging to various law agencies were damaged. The clash happened about 20 miles to the northwest of a protest camp where hundreds of pipeline opponents have gathered for months. More than 470 people have now been arrested since August. Cody Hall, a spokesman for the protest camp, said he couldn't comment on Friday's clash because he wasn't present and didn't have details. The 1,200-mile pipeline that's to deliver oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois is complete except for under the Missouri River in North Dakota. Work on that stretch has been delayed while the Army Corps of Engineers reviews its permitting. The Standing Rock Sioux and other opponents say the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. The company insists it's safe. Energy Transfer Partners issued a statement Friday saying that it would agree to a Corps request to suspend work in the area to defuse tension, ""if we can agree on a date certain upon which we can complete construction."" The Corps didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday, which was a federal holiday. The company also said it's made an offer to the state to help pay law enforcement costs related to the protests ""but it has not moved beyond that at this time."" A spokesman for Gov. Jack Dalrymple said the governor's office hadn't seen the offer yet and wouldn't speculate on whether the state would accept. ___ Associated Press writer James MacPherson in Bismarck contributed to this story.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/06/the-frightening-effect-of-trump-talk-on-americas-schools/	The frightening effect of ‘Trump Talk’ on America’s schools	"   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally on November 5, 2016 in Tampa, Florida. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  A report issued in April titled, ""The Trump Effect: The Impact of the Presidential Campaign on Our Nation's Schools,"" said that the primary campaign was so divisive that it was having a ""profoundly negative effect on children and classrooms."" The report, by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Teacher Tolerance project said: It's producing an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color and inflaming racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom. Many students worry about being deported. Other students have been emboldened by the divisive, often juvenile rhetoric in the campaign. Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail. Since the report was issued, concerns about many things that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said about women, Muslims, Mexicans and other people have only heightened, and teachers increasingly find themselves handling the fallout. In this post, Mica Pollock, a professor of education at the University of California at San Diego, looks at the effect that she calls ""Trump Talk"" has on students, teachers and school climate, and discusses how educators should respond. Pollock is the author of several books on race talk in schools, including the forthcoming ""Schooltalk: Rethinking What We Say About -- and To -- Students Every Day."" An anthropologist and design researcher, she is professor of education studies and director of the Center for Research on Educational Equity, Assessment and Teaching Excellence (CREATE) at the University of California at San Diego. As director of the center, Pollock works with colleagues to network the university's people, resources and opportunities to the diverse K-12 educators, students, and families of the San Diego region, with the particular goal of supporting low-income, underrepresented students toward college and rewarding careers.    ['If Donald Trump gets elected, will me and my family be deported?' -- and other questions from 9-year-olds]     [Teachers are expected to remain politically neutral. These Teachers of the Year say they can't.]   By Mica Pollock Children and youth hear the words adults hear. They hear them on the Internet, over a shoulder and repeated by other kids on the playground or in the classroom. And words matter. They shape what young people think about themselves, each other, adults and their country. From Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for president, young people have heard distorting claims about Mexicans as rapists to deport and distrust, of Muslims as violent anti-Americans who should be banned from entry to the United States, of African Americans as people living in hellish inner cities, of women as people to grope without permission, and of violence toward critics as admirable passion, to name just a few examples.      Real estate mogul Donald Trump said during his presidential announcement that Mexican migrants to the U.S. are drug traffickers and rapists, as well as ""some ... good people."" (AP)   Such comments echo through school hallways, too. Anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim ""chalking"" occurred last spring on college campuses nationwide.  On my own campus in California, several self-proclaimed ""Tritons for Trump"" chalked anti-Mexican graffiti on the ground right before an event designed to attract admitted students. Vandals up the coast scrawled pro-Trump messages and ""Black Lives Suck"" on high school bathrooms and benches. And the Southern Poverty Law Center's Teaching Tolerance project issued a report several months ago about the ""Trump Effect"" -- the impact of Trump's campaign talk on K-12 students nationally. Teachers reported that children and youth across the country were hearing Trump's language on the news and restated in the mouths of peers. The report documents Latino, African American, and Muslim children, and children of immigrants, terrified and fighting with peers; reporting slurs and threats from peers that Trump would hurt or kill their families; and asking teachers whether their entire families (even as American citizens) would be deported, walled off or worse by Trump. The National Education Association has been sharing teachers' stories of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and bullying talk on the rise as students cite and extend Trump's rhetoric. Fall incidents include homemade ""white pride"" Trump T-shirts at high school homecoming; increasing incidents of Muslim students bullied on buses and in classrooms; and even explicit ""Nazi"" talk among students. And students are now hearing Trump supporters threaten armed rebellion if he doesn't win. ""Trump Talk"" has unleashed a wave of explicit hate and intimidation for educators to address. And to have a presidential candidate unleash such talk -- especially without reproach from many powerful politicians -- sets an extremely confusing example. That's because schools are places where hate speech, harassment and encouragement of violence are supposed to be challenged. In schools, students are taught not to bully other people. And there are actual laws saying schools can't just let hateful and violent speech go. As a professor colleague put it, ""Trump speech on public campuses creates a very real tension between the civil liberty of speech and the civil right not to be intimidated."" Civil-rights lawyer friends have clarified for me that any campus receiving federal funds has to debate a key issue in the era of Trump. When does speech -- even speech protected under the First Amendment -- produce a hostile environment, prohibited by federal and state civil-rights laws? Such laws forbid educators in federally funded public schools from tolerating or allowing an education environment in which harassment based on race, color or national origin (or sex, or disability) is ""sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or opportunities offered by a school."" Because a school ""has a duty to provide a nondiscriminatory environment that is conducive to learning,"" when hostile environments are impeding the right to learn, educators must take action to ""end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and prevent the harassment from recurring."" To prevent racially hostile environments, experts suggest, proactive educators respond to all incidents of racially hostile speech or reports of racially harassing conduct; they continually ask speakers to respect and value others so all can learn. Most powerfully, educators know that hostile speech that doesn't ""rise to the level"" of harassment or a hostile environment in legal terms can prompt discussion about when words distort or harm other people, or condone violence. Indeed, educators' primary antidote to racial hostility is ongoing speech: routinely fostering thoughtful discussion about the facts about complex social issues, the value and real experiences of other people, and the consequences of our claims. As educators, we cannot and should not censor talk about Trump, nor censor debate about any issue he raises, such as immigration policy. Schools must foster dialogue on controversial issues, not squelch it. And we can't simply outlaw ""offensive"" speech from our schools, because freedom of speech protects us all. But as educators, we are also fundamentally responsible for denouncing speech that denigrates or threatens people -- and for protecting all students' rights to participate in and benefit from school. The complexity of Trump's own hostile speech is that he explicitly denigrates groups of people only some of the time, and then he just implies or denies the hate previously stated. Others then harass critics anonymously on his behalf or even just scrawl his name to intimidate children. But because Trump Talk in many mouths has embodied, urged, and catalyzed hate and violence, many students across the country are afraid. You could say a hostile environment has developed nationally -- one that might last long past the election. Now more than ever, teachers and students have to actively reject hate talk and bullying in order to create learning environments that let us all debate complex political positions without denigrating entire populations. Together, educators and students can proactively learn to ""attack"" the thing said, not the speaker, by asking people for the evidence behind their claims and offering evidence behind our own. Together, we can consider when our words misrepresent or disrespect others. Together, we can seek accurate information about social issues and learn about other people's actual experiences and perspectives. We can refuse intimidation talk and insist instead on engaging ideas. And together, we can consider when we're fully informed or have more to learn. As the Teaching Tolerance report noted, what many teachers said they most needed to handle Trump-era dialogue in their classrooms was ""facts."" This is the line we walk as educators and students. This is not political correctness. This is training young people to participate civilly and nonviolently in democracy. This is about debating complicated issues using evidence. This is about basic respect. Hate and intimidation are not welcomed in the hallways, classrooms, and playgrounds of our nation's schools. Teachers and kids don't have to accept them from the Republican nominee.
