Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Boston have been working with the Boston Public Library to compile an online archive of demo tapes by the city's top hip-hop and rap artists of the 1980s. Opening to the public on Saturday, the Massachusetts Hip-Hop Archive was created in part to reclaim the city's role in the genres' history.  ""It's been an untold story,"" said Pacey Foster, a rap historian and professor at UMass. ""Boston is not a city that has had its rightful place in the early stories of hip-hop history."" The archive aims to connect new audiences to early rap artists such as the Almighty RSO, Guru, and others who have faded from memory even in Boston. But the project is also intended to spark academic interest in the city's rap and hip-hop roots. Like a growing number of U.S. colleges, UMass is encouraging students to approach hip-hop as a scholarly subject. Several students have already started research tied to the archive, and the university launched a new course on hip-hop in 2014. It joins dozens of other schools nationwide that have added classes on hip-hop in recent years, analyzing its value to fields from sociology to women's studies. At Bowie State University, a historically black college in Maryland, students can earn a minor in hip-hop studies. The University of Arizona says it offered the nation's first hip-hop minor in 2012. A year later, the rapper Nasir Jones -- known as Nas -- established a fellowship at Harvard University for scholars of hip-hop.  ""There are so many dimensions to the culture,"" said Murray Forman, a media studies professor at Northeastern University. ""It's really rich for analysis in all kinds of contexts."" Some scholars still question whether hip-hop has a place in academia, but its acceptance is growing, said Forman, who was a Nasir Jones fellow last year. University presses have published dozens of textbooks on rap and hip-hop's political and cultural importance. Scores of graduate students have taken on similar topics for their dissertations. For archivists in particular, there has been a surge of interest in preserving the artifacts of hip-hop, especially from its early days in the 1970s and 1980s, Forman said.  ""A lot of the early materials are at risk of disappearing,"" he said. ""People don't want to be carrying around all the ephemera, the concert fliers and promotional materials."" Other schools with major hip-hop archives include Harvard and Cornell University. Four historically black colleges in Atlanta house the notebooks and letters of rap icon Tupac Shakur. The new archive at UMass features almost 300 demo tapes, along with audio from a local radio show whose host was credited with discovering many of Boston's biggest acts. Most of the artists aren't household names, but Foster said their work captures the youthful spirit of a time when artists were seeking a new sound.  ""It will have natural interest for academics,"" Foster said. ""This collection is a very complete look at a scene that nobody has heard about, at a moment when rap was just exploding.""

Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said at the Halifax International Security Forum that any attempt to bring back harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would quickly be challenged in court.  ""I don't give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do. We will not waterboard. We will not do it,"" McCain said to applause during a panel discussion. McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, said extreme interrogation techniques are banned under U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. During the campaign, Trump said he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding, which was used against suspected terrorists during the George W. Bush administration. McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, said waterboarding doesn't work and makes it hard for the U.S. to claim moral superiority.  ""What does it say about America if we're going to inflict torture on people,"" he said. McCain also expressed support for the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and said the United States should not back out of the not-yet-implemented Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a candidate, Trump said NAFTA should be renegotiated and opposed the TPP, arguing that such trade agreements cause significant job losses in the U.S.  ""I think we are going to pay a terrible price for abandoning the TPP,"" McCain said. ""You are going to see Chinese assertion of economic influence in the region, and possible dominance. All of these countries are now going to join with China in trade agreements and we're going to be out in the cold. Historians will judge us very harshly."" In its eighth year, the Halifax International Security Forum has attracted top defense and security officials from Western democracies. Trump has dominated the discussions. Rose Gottemoeller, NATO's Deputy Secretary General, said in a panel discussion that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had spoken with Trump on Friday.  ""The two men agreed about the enduring importance of the NATO alliance and the enduring importance of increased defense spending,"" Gottemoeller said. Trump suggested during the campaign that he might review NATO members' financial contributions before deciding whether to honor commitments under the alliance's mutual defense clause. He also raised concerns among U.S. allies with his effusive comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(VH1)  Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg have so much in common! The kitchen queen was denied entry into the U.K. in 2008, reportedly because of her conviction for obstruction of justice. Britain also briefly banned Dogg after he got into a fight at Heathrow Airport in 2006. So really, what better pair to host a cooking show? ""Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party"" airs at 10 p.m. Mondays on VH1. (Confession: It took me a while to get the ""pot"" pun.) At the start of the show, the co-hosts create a cool cocktail. Then they cook. Last week's fried chicken contest prompted Martha to declare, ""I can't lose to the 'hood."" Tonight she and Snoop turn to lobster. She's much chiller than he is about picking up a live crustacean. But let's be honest: No one is watching for cooking tips. We want to see if the show is as weird as it sounds. And it is: like when Martha dons what she calls her first ""real bling"" -- a cheese grater on a chain.  But ""Martha & Snoop"" is also a shining example of reinvention (Martha gains street cred while Snoop tilts toward mainstream) and racial harmony. Martha mixes with hip-hop royalty guests, like Wiz Khalifa and Ice Cube. They defy political correctness with frank, funny (and sometimes tasteless) remarks about race, sex and drugs. As Martha preps a buttermilk bath for her chicken, she informs Snoop, ""If you took a buttermilk bath, you'd be whiter."" I'm not sure what she meant, but she's clearly not afraid to tease Snoop, who teases right back. And at a time when racial tensions are a concern in the U.S., it's refreshing to watch a 75-year-old Connecticut Yankee and boyz from the hood having a good time. One of tonight's guests, hip-hop impresario Rick Ross, sweet-talks Martha by telling her, ""Baby's got back."" And she politely replies, ""Thank you."""

James Woolsey, in an opinion piece published in the South China Morning Post on Thursday, said the new administration would need to reverse defense budget cuts and make sure the U.S. was still the leading military force in the world.  ""The U.S. sees itself as the holder of the balance of power in Asia and is likely to remain quite determined to protect its allies against Chinese overreach,"" said Woolsey, who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton. ""China should realize that our reflexes in Asia are not driven by territorial ambitions."" Over U.S. objections, Beijing has moved to cement its claim to most of the South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and military airstrips atop coral reefs. With Trump's election, many analysts said Trump's isolationist foreign policy will give China more maneuvering room to pursue its territorial claims in the East and South China seas. During the election campaign, Trump in April said that China's building of man-made islands in the disputed waters was a sign of Beijing's disrespect for America. ___ NEW PHILIPPINE ENVOY TO CHINA SAYS DEAL POSSIBLE The new Philippine ambassador to China says it's possible to achieve a settlement with Beijing in the disputed South China Sea. Jose Santiago ""Chito"" Santa Romana says his country could learn from Vietnam and the former Soviet Union, which managed to reach a detente with China through good political relations and quiet diplomacy despite quarrels over territory. Vietnam, however, continues to be entangled in the dispute over the Paracel Islands while making progress with China over other border issues.  ""The basic lesson is, if you use hardball tactics with China, expect the same. ... So when you say, 'What is ours is ours,' they will say the same thing. And if you don't yield, and if you combine it with just megaphone diplomacy and forcing your way, expect that there'll be a stalemate,"" he said at a forum in Manila organized by the state-run China Daily. He said the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte is separating the disputes from economic relations with Beijing. Duterte's groundbreaking visit to Beijing resulted in China allowing Filipino fishermen back in the waters around the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012, a year before Manila launched and won an international arbitration case against China's claims. However, China's coast guard has remained at the shoal and Filipinos are not allowed to fish inside the lagoon. Santa Romana said that Scarborough was just an ""informal, friendly understanding,"" and there is a need to slowly formalize it and establish rules of engagement between the coast guards of the countries.  ""The Chinese, of course, still maintains their effective control because they have a sovereignty claim,"" he said. ""But now the Philippine coast guard is trying to have a roving presence so that, eventually, we could say we have not given up our sovereignty claim when we resolve it diplomatically."" ___ CHINA SAYS SOUTH CHINA SEA HAS STABILIZED China says tensions in the South China Sea have eased because of ""friendly cooperation"" with the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang says managing differences through negotiations is ""is back on the right track,"" the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Lu noted that China has border treaties with 12 out of its 14 land neighbors, and that as long as they are ""sincere and patient, most differences can be handled through consultation and negotiation."" ___ Follow Hrvoje Hranjski at www.twitter.com/hatbangkok Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Thank -- or blame -- the Founding Fathers for creating the possibility of a so-called ""divergent election"" when they set up the Electoral College. How and why the U.S. selects its presidents this way: ___ ORIGINS The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise meant to strike a balance between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. Alexander Hamilton wrote, ""If the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent."" At the time, the country had just 13 states, and the founders were worried about one state exercising outsized influence, according to a white paper from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Small states were worried that states with large populations would have extra sway. Southern states with slaves who couldn't vote worried that Northern states would have a louder voice. There were concerns that people in one state wouldn't know much about candidates from other states. The logistics of a national election were daunting. The thinking was that if candidates had to win multiple states rather than just the popular vote, they would have to attract broader support. ___ HOW IT WORKS The electoral system has been tweaked over the years, but the gist endures. The president is selected by a ""college"" of 538 electors from the states. Each state gets as many electoral votes as it has members of Congress, and the District of Columbia gets three. To be elected president, the winner must get at least half the total plus one -- or 270 electoral votes. Most states give all their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins the state's popular vote. So while Clinton is leading Trump in votes nationwide 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent, Trump's total in the Electoral College stands at 290, with races in Michigan and New Hampshire yet to be called. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore narrowly won the popular vote but lost to Republican George W. Bush in the Electoral College 271-266. Overall, there have been four such cases of divergent elections. ___ THE PROS A lot has changed since the Electoral College system was established, making many of the original reasons for its existence outdated: The U.S. now manages to run national elections quite well. Voters nationwide have no shortage of information about candidates. Slavery no longer exists. But there are still concerns that small states and rural areas would be ignored in favor of those with bigger populations if the race hinged strictly on the popular vote. ___ THE CONS In 1967, a commission of the American Bar Association recommended that the Electoral College system be scrapped, finding it to be ""archaic, undemocratic, complex, ambiguous and dangerous."" Fifty years later, critics are still complaining, arguing that the system results in huge swaths of the country being ignored while candidates focus on a dozen or so battleground states.  ""It's a terrible system,"" says George C. Edwards III, a Texas A&M professor who's written a book on the subject. Edwards tracks every campaign stop by the major candidates, and he says big states that are sure to vote for one candidate or another -- say, California for the Democrats or Texas for the Republicans -- now get completely ignored, and small states largely get overlooked, too. ___ IS CHANGE AFOOT? Don't count on it. Republicans have benefited the most from the system in recent years, and they're in control of Congress. However, there is an effort underway to get around the winner-take-all aspects of the system without abolishing the Electoral College. A group called National Popular Vote is pushing an interstate compact under which states would pledge to deliver all their electoral votes to the nationwide winner of the popular vote. Over the past decade, 11 states have approved such a bill. John Koza, chairman of the group, is quick to point out that both Trump and Clinton are on record in recent years saying the system is flawed. He's hopeful Trump's election won't make Republicans less amenable to changing it.  ""We're talking about a policy change that's largely dictated by the need to create a 50-state campaign for president instead of a 12-state campaign for president,"" says Koza. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Trump on Thursday refused to allow journalists to travel with him to Washington for his historic first meetings with President Barack Obama and congressional leaders. The Republican's top advisers rebuffed news organizations' requests for a small ""pool"" of journalists to trail him as he attended the meetings. The decision was part of an opaque pattern in Trump's moves since his victory Tuesday. He was entirely out of sight on Wednesday. His aides said he was huddled with advisers at his offices in New York. His team has not put out a daily schedule, or offered any detailed updates on how he has spent his time. They have not acknowledged phone calls or other contact with world leaders. When Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a congratulatory telegram to Trump on Wednesday, Moscow spread the word. A phone call with British Prime Minster Theresa May was announced in London. The pattern was repeated for calls with leaders of Israel, Egypt, South Korea and Australia. The White House typically releases statements on the president's phone calls with foreign leaders, providing some details about the conversation. Past presidents-elect have had early briefings with journalists, even in confusing first hours after Election Day. But early signs suggest Trump is willing to break protocol when it comes to press access and transparency. As a candidate, Trump railed against the press as ""disgusting"" and ""dishonest."" He refused to allow a pool of campaign reporters and photographers to fly on his plane to events, sometimes starting his rallies before his press corps had arrived. The practice did not extend to his running mate, Mike Pence, who was followed by a traditional pool of journalists. News organizations had tried for weeks to coordinate a pool of journalists to travel with Trump immediately after Election Day if he won. The Associated Press is among those reaching out to Trump advisers about press access. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the president-elect's team expects ""to operate a traditional pool and look forward to implementing our plans in the near future."" The White House Correspondents' Association, which coordinates press pools and advocates for transparency at the White House, urged Trump to allow journalists to cover his meetings and other movements.  ""This decision could leave Americans blind about his whereabouts and well-being in the event of a national crisis,"" said Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for Reuters and the group's president. ""Not allowing a pool of journalists to travel with and cover the next president of the United States is unacceptable."" Trump's meeting with Obama in the Oval Office was recorded by the pool of White House reporters, photographers and TV journalists who cover the president. Every president and president-elect in recent memory has traveled with a pool of journalists when leaving the White House grounds. A pool of reporters and photographers was in the motorcade when President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. The pool was just steps away from President Ronald Reagan when he was shot outside a hotel in the District of Columbia, and was stationed outside his hospital as he recovered. The pool also travels on vacation and foreign trips and at times captures personal, historic moments of the presidency. The practice makes journalists eyewitnesses to how the president conducts business, rather than relying on secondhand accounts. They often capture more intimate moments between the president and people he greets. The White House, meanwhile, depends on having journalists nearby at all times to relay the president's first comments on breaking news. News organizations take turns serving in the small group, paying their way and sharing the material collected in the pool with the larger press corps. The pool also covers official events at the White House when space doesn't allow for the full press corps. Because of safety concerns, presidents and presidents-elect travel in a bubble of security, with the exact timing of their travel kept secret and streets often blocked off around their events. That leaves news organizations dependent on the White House to facilitate the pool coverage by arranging security clearances and transportation. Obama also has looked for new ways to limit White House press access. On Thursday, photographers were not allowed to shoot a meeting between first lady Michelle Obama and Melania Trump, who joined her husband on the White House visit. The White House released a photo taken by a staff photographer and circulated it on social media. The AP does not distribute such photos. White House photographers were allowed to shoot a similar meeting between Mrs. Obama and then-first lady Laura Bush eight years ago. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Andrew Kelly/Reuters)  Donald Trump is the president-elect of the United States. Among many other things, this means he will take charge of U.S. foreign policy.  Trump will not manage foreign policy alone, but presidents have a lot of power nonetheless. Here are three things we know about leaders, advisers and foreign policy. Leaders' beliefs matter, and they tend not to change It is well-established in research on international relations and foreign policy that leaders' beliefs matter.  My own book found that leaders' beliefs about the nature of threats had important implications for when and how they decide to use military force.  I also found that leaders' beliefs are very stable over time. They tend to be formed before presidents take office, and then leaders view the events and crises of their tenures through the lens of those beliefs.  This is consistent with a long tradition of research on how beliefs and ideas matter. Other scholars have looked at leader attributes such as age, experience and gender and found that they affect how leaders behave in office.  In their book on the subject, Michael Horowitz, Allan Stam and Cali Ellis found that in democracies and mixed regimes, older leaders -- particularly those over 70, Trump's age -- are more prone to aggression.  Traits such as age may interact with core beliefs to affect how leaders make decisions. So what are Trump's beliefs?  The best analysis is Thomas Wright's, who early in the campaign identified the core beliefs that Trump has been articulating for decades.  As Wright summarized more recently, these boil down to three: ""opposition to America's alliance relationships; opposition to free trade; and support for authoritarianism, particularly in Russia.""  Whatever else Trump says or tries to do on foreign policy, we can expect these three core beliefs to shape his goals and to persist throughout his presidency. Advisers have a lot of power under an inexperienced president In July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suggested that Trump would not make radical moves on foreign policy because his Cabinet would restrain him.  There has been talk already of how his staff or advisers would be a significant constraint. But as I wrote in July after McConnell's statement, a smart team of advisers cannot substitute for an inexperienced leader. Worse still, as Dan Drezner has chronicled and reiterated last week, the team surrounding Trump lacks experience and is not from the usual ""bench"" of Republican foreign policy advisers that one would typically expect to surround the Republican nominee. This is partly the result of the ""Never Trump"" movement:  Trump's foreign policy positions and lack of experience have put him significantly at odds with much of the Republican foreign policy establishment.  Even if some Never Trumpers decide to serve in his administration (and he admits them back into the fold) or a few members of the team have experience (Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, for example, is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and rumored to be a candidate for secretary of state), the overall pool of experienced advisers for him to draw on is likely to be smaller. So Trump is likely to be served by a team of advisers with less overall foreign policy experience than we would usually expect. My research on advisory teams shows that the balance of experience between the leader and advisers matters: Inexperienced presidents are less able to monitor their advisers, question assumptions and plans and diversify advice. This means that these advisers will be greatly empowered, allowing them to pursue initiatives more independently -- and enabling or magnifying any biases they have.  The combination of an inexperienced president empowering a team of inexperienced advisers is not encouraging. Advisers can also send important signals to Congress and the public that have consequences for public support for war and approval of the president. I have found that when presidents act against the recommendation of their advisers when deciding to use military force -- whether the decision is to fight or stay out of a conflict -- public support for war and approval of the president can flip. Given that Trump has had a combative and contentious relationship with his advisers to date, and that he is at odds with much of the Republican foreign policy establishment on many issues, we would expect greater-than-average infighting -- even if experienced hands serve in a Trump administration. This infighting will have not only political consequences but also potential effects on decisions themselves: Leaks or public statements might affect public or congressional support for Trump's decisions, or he might listen to certain advisers because he fears the political ramifications of acting against them. Presidents have a lot of influence on foreign policy, much of it out of public view Presidents have significant power over foreign policy, and that power has only grown in recent years, including in the Obama era. Some aspects of presidential power are quite visible, such as the use of force, public diplomacy or major international agreements, and there is rightly discussion of how a Trump presidency will affect these aspects of foreign policy. But there are also other, less visible ways that presidents can shape foreign policy. Their staffing decisions and policy directives -- what I called ""policy investments"" in my book -- reflect their core beliefs and can reach deeply into the bureaucracy. Even when presidents do change their minds or are swayed by advisers to make a decision that is out of their ordinary line of thinking, it is hard to shift the bureaucracy on a dime. During the Iraq War, the Bush administration's later decision to shift toward nation-building was hampered by the initial decisions Bush made after taking office in 2001 to de-emphasize nation-building and fill his administration with like-minded advisers and staffers. Although many positions are filled by excellent, career civil servants, the direction from the White House is important, if only in the choices for political appointments at the tops of agencies. These appointments and decisions will matter for a host of decisions, large and small. But none of this means that Trump won't face accountability for his foreign policy choices. It is true that the public does not pay much attention to the day-to-day details of foreign policy, which is one source of presidential power on international affairs. But elites can be the foreign policy watchdogs -- and they are the key group to watch for the next four years. And although there are major partisan divides on foreign policy, there remains broad consensus among elites on how the United States should position itself in the world. Most foreign policy elites, in both parties, are internationalist, favor maintaining U.S. alliances and oppose authoritarianism. They will the ones to pay attention to the details of Trump's foreign policy and sound the alarm if it trends in dangerous directions. Even with Republican control of Congress, these voices may be heard, especially if the divide between Trump and Republican foreign policy elites persists.

In a high-stakes game of political chicken, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the EU wouldn't be able to reach the ""final point"" and end its ties with Turkey out of fears of jeopardizing a deal to curb the flow of migrants from Africa and the Middle East to Europe. Hours later, in Brussels, EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn bluntly said that ""it is time Ankara tells us what they really want,"" in the wake of a report assessing Turkey's status as a candidate for membership in the bloc. The report highlighted what the EU saw as backsliding on essential human rights and rule of law standards. The report, issued Wednesday, came after Turkey's recent clampdown on media freedoms and the arrests of 10 pro-Kurdish legislators.  ""These various actions, including considerations of reintroducing the death penalty, seem to be increasingly incompatible with Turkey's official desire to become a member of the European Union,"" Hahn said.  ""In its own interest, Turkey urgently needs to stop moving away from the EU,"" Hahn said. In the escalating standoff on Turkey's protracted membership bid, Erdogan rose to the challenge.  ""They say unabashedly and shamelessly that the EU should review its negotiations with Turkey,"" Erdogan told a business group in Istanbul. ""You are late, go and review them as soon as you can. But don't just review them -- go and make your final decision."" The Turkish leader added: ""You know those 3 million refugees in Turkey? They say there is a problem. What if the negotiations end and they open the gates, where would we put those 3 million refugees? That is their worry. That is why they cannot come to the end point."" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the EU had to stop its ""threatening"" attitude.  ""Make a decision, brother!"" Cavusoglu said. ""If you want the negotiations to stop, then stop them. If you want them to continue we are ready. But you have to treat us as equal partners. We cannot advance as long as you see us as second-rate country."" Omer Celik, the minister in charge of Turkey's EU negotiations, criticized the union's report. He called it ""far from being constructive or providing guidance"" and said EU leaders lacked ""vision and the ability to produce projects."" On the visa-free travel deal, Celik said Turkey was determined not to alter its anti-terrorism laws. He said EU Vice-President Frans Timmermans would arrive in Turkey for discussions on the issue.  ""If we can reach progress during talks with Timmermans, this will be recorded. If we cannot, then this process will have died toward the end of the year,"" Celik said. In March, Turkey and the EU reached an agreement in which Turkey would stem the flow of migrants to Greece in return for incentives including fast-tracked membership talks, billions of euros in aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens. The deal has hit a hurdle over Turkey's reluctance to change its anti-terrorism laws -- one of the conditions for the lifting of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens traveling to Europe. On Tuesday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, warned Turkey that its crackdown on political opponents and the media goes against EU values. Juncker also called on Erdogan to immediately say ""whether Turkey really wants to be -- yes or no -- a member of the European Union."" He added that the Turkish leader would only have himself to blame if the EU does not grant visa-free travel in Europe to Turkish citizens soon. Turkey has been in talks to join the European Union since October 2005, but progress has been held up, often by political opposition and particularly due to resistance from Cyprus, an EU member. The Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974, when Turkish troops occupied its northern third following a coup by supporters of a union with Greece. ___ Casert reported from Brussels Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

I hope Trump will be the positive version of the leader that you hoped he would be when you voted for him. To those who can't quite believe this is happening -- that someone so far from the mainstream of American political thought could win a presidential election -- I want to focus on a question likely to be very important in the future: When Congress considers exercising checks and balances on the power of President Trump, what is the break point? At what point does Congress decide that Trump has gone too far and should be countered? Here's why I think this is really important. The modern presidency comes with extraordinary power. The president has power over the entire executive branch, from the military to the Justice Department to the FBI to the administrative state. The Constitution provides for a number of checks on that power. The courts provide some very important checks, of course, at least when cases get to them. But the most important checks on a president come from Congress. On a routine basis, the president needs Congress to enact laws that allow and pay for what the president wants to do. The president needs the Senate to confirm nominees. And at the very extreme end, the president needs to avoid an outright rebellion in Congress that could lead to impeachment and removal. As a result, how far Trump can go depends a lot on how far Congress will let him go. But here's the interesting thing: Whether Congress counters presidential power depends on judgments about whether the president has gone too far. Those judgments aren't set in stone. They're mushy sorts of judgments based on what seems ""on the wall"" vs. ""off the wall."" Presumably there is always a break point somewhere -- a point at which Congress changes direction and counters a president who has seemingly gone too far. But where that break point might be is a political and cultural question that depends on a mix of public opinion and the views of those serving in Congress. I mention this because Trump was remarkable as a candidate for how little he followed traditional conventions. Throughout the campaign, Trump would do seemingly outrageous things that many thought would sink his candidacy. Trump enthusiastically embraced what was ""off the wall."" You know the list by now. He celebrated mob violence. He advocated war crimes. He urged the criminal prosecution of his opponent. He invoked conspiracy theories. You would have thought, before 2016, that a candidate couldn't do that without losing tons of support. The American people just wouldn't stand for it. And yet voters this time apparently didn't mind. What we thought was going way too far was apparently not considered too far at all. The old standards no longer apply. Now maybe the Trump we saw as a candidate was not the Trump we'll see as president. Trump has changed his mind before. Maybe the vindictive authoritarian streak seen in Trump the candidate won't be replicated in office. I certainly hope that's the case. But let's assume that the nasty side to Candidate Trump is carried over to the White House. If so, where is Congress's break point? Where is the point where members of the House and Senate will say, in response to what Trump has done, that he has just gone too far? Congress is a ""they,"" of course, not an ""it."" Different members will approach these issues differently. But the checks and balances of Congress really depend on these collective judgments. For example, will Congress follow the old standards, opposing the new president when they would have opposed presidents like Clinton, Bush or Obama? Will the old rules of propriety still apply? Or will Congress react to Trump's victory by moving the break point, letting Trump be Trump because apparently that is what the voters want? And if Congress moves to a new break point just for Trump, how far will that point move over time? For Democrats, this is a relatively easy set of questions to answer. They'll be the opposition. I gather they'll oppose Trump in the usual way. The harder and more important question is how Republicans will react, especially in the Senate. The House and Senate will stay in Republican hands in 2017. For Republicans in Congress, Trump's base is largely their base. Opposing Trump will mean going up against their base, at least so long as Trump remains popular within the GOP. For these politicians, where will the break point be? Here's an example to make my concerns concrete. FBI Director James Comey is serving a 10-year term that is set to expire in 2023. Comey has been a lightning rod of controversy this year. Justly so. But whatever you think of Comey's judgment, he is very independent. Comey is the guy who famously stood up to President George W. Bush over illegal surveillance, ready to offer his resignation from the Justice Department, in 2004. If you're looking for a check on lawlessness from President Trump, Comey is actually a good place to start. It may seem counterintuitive now, when a lot of people fear that Comey helped Trump win the election. But I think it's a good bet going forward. Say President Trump wants the FBI to do something that Comey refuses to do because it's likely illegal. The traditional view would be that it's tough for the president to fire an FBI director for that reason (or to have the FBI director resign for that reason) because the political blowback would be severe. Sure, the president has the legal authority to do it. Just ask William Sessions. But firing the FBI director for refusing to break the law would traditionally be thought to hit a break point. It would raise a lot of fears about the FBI's independence, and it would trigger a strong political response from Congress. In all likelihood, it wouldn't happen. But will the next Congress apply those old norms to President Trump? Imagine Comey refuses an illegal Trump order. Trump promptly fires Comey, and he then nominates a Trump loyalist to be the new FBI director. How would the Republican Congress respond? Would senators say, ""well, Trump is Trump,"" shrug it off and confirm Trump's pick? Or would they rebel against Trump not only for the illegal order but also for removing an independent FBI director who merely wanted to follow the law? And is their judgment going to be their own view, or are they going to defer to what the polls say or just what the GOP base and talk radio thinks? That's just one example, of course. You can ask the same questions about the full parade of horribles that Trump critics fear from a Trump presidency. Maybe we'll get lucky and Trump won't go there, making these concerns moot. But if he does, figuring out the break point will become the question on which the country's future rests. The fear among Trump critics, of course, is that a Trump presidency would see the same-party break point move so far that the checks and balances the Constitution provides will be more symbol than force. Time will tell. As always, stay tuned."

He was right.	"    Donald Trump greets supporters before speaking at the state fair in Oklahoma City on Sept. 25, 2015. (J. Pat Carter/Associated Press)  On Sept. 25 last year, several thousand people gathered on a Friday night around a bandshell at the Great State Fair of Oklahoma for what felt like a rock concert.  The opening acts included a live bald eagle named Uncle Sam, a young singer who belted out pop covers and a fiddler. The audience included an Elvis impersonator, a bearded member of the ""Duck Dynasty"" family and a group of young Democrats from a nearby college who couldn't stop themselves from dancing along with the crowd.  And then there was the featured act: Donald Trump.  For 50 minutes, the unlikely Republican presidential candidate ordered journalists to pan the sprawling crowd with their cameras, mocked 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, imitated political pundits, bragged about his poll numbers, plugged an upcoming ""60 Minutes"" interview and promised that he would make the country wealthy again. He vowed to self-fund his campaign, bully U.S. companies that try to move to Mexico, let Russia handle the Islamic State terrorist group and get rid of birthright citizenship for ""anchor babies."" The audience pulsed with laughter, cheers and chants of his name. Why were they there?  Political pundits had said for months that it was just for the show, while Trump insisted that he had sparked a political movement. He was right.  Standing toward the back that night was Charlie Bevers, a retired social studies teacher in his 60s from Moore, Okla., who said he was increasingly frustrated by what he viewed as the federal government's minimal respect for the U.S. Constitution. ""At first, when he said he was going to run, I thought it was a joke. When he got out there and did his 'Trumpisms,' I listened because I thought it was funny,"" Bevers said that night. ""Then I realized he was saying what I want to hear.""      Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump spoke about his personal wealth, China, Secretary of State John F. Kerry's bike accident and more in his announcement that he would be running for president. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   It was a sentiment that I would hear again and again over the next year, as I followed Trump to more than 170 rallies in 35 states and talked with thousands of his supporters. The first question I usually asked: Why do you like him? The answers were nearly always the same: He's saying what I'm saying, thinking, feeling or wanting to hear. He's not a politician and not part of a corrupt system. He's honest and speaks his mind, even if it gets him in trouble. And he's tough.  ['Finally. Someone who thinks like me.']  Plus, Trump told his supporters that it was okay to blame their financial problems on undocumented immigrants and the Chinese, that it was okay to be fearful of Muslims and those who don't speak English, that it was okay to punch back at Black Lives Matter activists, that it was okay to hate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  In those early days, Trump had no Secret Service protection and nothing to lose. He took kids on rides in his helicopter in Iowa and stopped by a high school homecoming. There were no fundraisers, no sprawling staff, no teleprompters, no one telling him no. He held rallies in struggling former industrial towns with low median incomes and high rates of anger -- and thousands showed up.  The rally in Oklahoma foreshadowed what would come. There was the crowd -- loud and adoring, no matter what Trump said or did or what might be revealed about his past. There was the palpable outrage, the sharing of conspiracy theories, the mob mentality. ""Pick up your pitchfork!"" a local politician shouted, firing up the crowd before Trump arrived. ""Follow our next commander in chief! Join the Trump brigade and take back America once and for all!""  And there was the candidate, basking in the glow. ""No matter where I go, we have these incredible crowds,"" Trump said that night. ""Something is happening that is amazing. It's amazing.""     Trump gestures to the cameras while greeting supporters at a campaign rally in Worcester, Mass., on Nov. 18, 2015. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)   Nov. 18, 2015: Worcester, Mass.  On a Wednesday night in mid-November, more than 12,000 Trump supporters and a small group of protesters gathered at an arena in downtown Worcester, a city with many more registered Democrats than Republicans.  [Nine things that happened during Donald Trump's visit to Worcester]   Generations ago, waves of immigrants moved here to work in textile factories, many of which closed decades ago. The town has tried to reinvent itself as a biotech and health-care hub. Although less than 70 percent of Worcester is white, it seemed like nearly 100 percent of Trump's crowd that night was.   Earlier that month, Trump received Secret Service protection, a sign of just how far he and his movement had come. Photos of the packed arena in a blue town in a blue state would stun those who were convinced that at any moment, Trump would implode and drop out, allowing them to resume the traditional process of selecting a nominee.  Sitting close to the stage were Tom and Sandy Morrissey, who drove in from Rhode Island and spoke longingly of the days when the nation was, in their eyes, a better place.  ""When I grew up in Miami, it was English-speaking, and now 75 percent of the households are non-English-speaking,"" said Tom Morrissey, a Vietnam War veteran in his late 60s wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat.  ""And people say they like to go to Miami because they like to go down there for the Cuban music. Well, I love Cuban music -- I like to go to Cuba for Cuban music.""   ""I want my home town back,"" he continued. ""And you can call me a racist or whatever.""  The Morrisseys said they once tried to buy a get-well card in a Miami convenience store but there were no options in English. Another time they went into a bakery and, they said, the woman working there refused to sell them pastries unless they ordered in Spanish.  ""They would not serve us,"" Sandy Morrissey said. ""That's how bold people have gotten because they can be bold. That's the only reason why."" ""So if you want that to happen to this whole nation,"" Tom Morrissey said, ""you go ahead and vote for Hillary."" ""People don't want to know the truth,"" Sandy Morrissey added later. ""I don't think people care -- and I think God has withheld his judgment on America. We are in deep trouble. This is not the America I knew as a child. It just isn't. And I feel bad about that."" On the stage that night, Trump marveled at the crowd. ""Look at the people pouring in,"" he said. ""This has been a movement. No matter where I go -- and I don't even know if it's for me. It's for me, I guess, a little bit. It's for the message.""       Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has found a groove for his campaign rallies -- poll numbers, protesters, Vladimir Putin, and of course, making America great again. Here we break down a rally on Dec 21 into the required parts. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)    Dec. 21, 2015: Grand Rapids, Mich.  A few days before Christmas, Trump traveled to an aging arena in Grand Rapids on a cold, dark, rainy night. As traffic backed up, some parked near the railroad tracks. Generations ago, the city was known for its furniture factories that have mostly closed, although the economy here has been rapidly growing the past few years.  The rally felt like a Christmas party. The stage was decorated with huge wreaths and a red ""Merry Christmas"" sign written in elegant script. ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" blared. Many in the crowd said they couldn't wait for the country to again say ""Merry Christmas"" under President Trump.  Sitting near the top of the bleachers was Kevin Steinke, a self-employed consultant in his 50s from a nearby suburb. He and his wife, a part-time music teacher, have two teenage sons, and they feel as though they are financially stuck in place, maybe falling behind. It had become difficult for Steinke to find clients, and he thought about once again working for a company instead of for himself -- but it's hard to get hired over 50, he said. Sitting with his sons, he said the country needs a chief executive more than a ""politician in chief"" -- someone who can cut government bloat without destroying the government, who can ease taxes without destroying schools, who can get rid of regulations without wiping them all out. ""People are getting frustrated by the fact that we don't seem like we're getting anywhere as a nation,"" Steinke said. ""A lot of us feel like we're going backward."" Steinke has always been a Republican and has always voted for Republicans, and he doesn't understand why the GOP continues to allow the Affordable Care Act to stand. He's glad the party received a much-needed jolt from an outsider.  ""It's causing some of the establishment people to panic,"" he said, ""and I kind of like that."" On stage that night, the Republican front-runner triumphantly declared: ""This isn't really a silent majority anymore, folks. This is a very, very aggressive, very, very noisy, loud majority. Very, very noisy. Very, very loud.""     Trump acknowledges photographers after speaking at a campaign rally in Baton Rouge on Feb. 11. (Gerald Herbert/Associated Press)   Feb. 11, 2016: Baton Rouge  Ten days after losing the Iowa caucuses and two days after winning the New Hampshire primary -- his first ballot victory -- Trump traveled to an arena in Louisiana's capital that pulsated with gleeful energy matching his new burst of momentum.   [The target on Trump grows larger]  The South was home to Trump's biggest and rowdiest crowds, and a pre-rally speaker noted that the candidate didn't have a ""Southern nickname,"" dubbing him ""Donny John."" Sitting near the stage were Matthew Stirling and Darrin Hahn, brothers-in-law who live just outside town and hustle for every dollar they make. Stirling kept apologizing for Hahn's bad language.  Stirling, then 40, said he installs security fences and had seen a huge spike in business because so many people ""feel pretty damn unsafe."" Hahn, then 45, is a commercial electrician. ""We've got to go drum it up,"" Hahn said. ""If I don't go drum up work, then I've got 11 guys who don't work the next day, so I constantly have to go, literally, business to business."" And that's why they like Trump. He hustles, just like them. ""He's a regular guy,"" Stirling said. ""He eats Wendy's on his plane."" ""But he owns a plane!"" I responded.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump documented the changes he made to his 757 jet in a 2011 video on his YouTube channel. (Donald Trump/YouTube)   I was endlessly surprised that people said they related to Trump -- who grew up wealthy, attended boarding school, received a $1 million loan from his father as a young man and lives in a gold-and-marble tower in Manhattan with his third wife, a former model. He is a germophobe who doesn't like shaking hands and will drink soda only from a sealed can or bottle. Backstage at a rally in New Hampshire in January, I asked Trump to tell me about one interaction he had with a supporter that stuck with him -- and he called his campaign manager over to answer the question. ""Doesn't matter,"" Hahn said, shaking his head. ""He's actually out there and hustled it and built it."" Said Stirling: ""He can come over to my house, and I will boil him crawfish. He can land his plane in the cul-de-sac. I mean, if he wants to go hang out with all of those VIP donors, that's fine. But come hang out with a real hard-working American man. I'll buy his beer, I'll buy him Wendy's, I'll boil his crawfish. Don't matter.""      Trump waves to the crowd as he arrives at a rally at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington on Aug. 9. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)   Aug. 9, 2016: Wilmington, N.C.  It was early August on the North Carolina coast, and it was miserably hot. Hundreds of people were lined up outside a small coliseum at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.  [From Trump's controversial words, a pattern: Outrage, headlines and then denial]  In June, after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump attacked a federal judge assigned to one of his civil cases, saying he was unable to be impartial because his parents were born in Mexico. In July, after becoming the nominee, Trump attacked the Muslim American parents of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq, saying they had no right to question him from the stage of the Democratic National Convention.  In the spring, Trump had appeared poised to topple Clinton. Now, it seemed as though the race was over. Instead of focusing on the messages that resonated with Americans, he was obsessed with defending himself. Yet his most avid supporters were still standing with him, still waiting hours to see him.   I was there with them, fanning myself with a reporter's notebook and sweating off my sunscreen. In June, Trump banned The Washington Post from covering his events, although reporters could attend most of his rallies by entering with the general public. For three months, I attended his gatherings like his fans did -- signing up for a free ticket online, arriving to venues hours early and waiting in line.  That gave me a direct look at the chronic disorganization of Trump's campaign. He had sparked a movement, but his campaign seemed to be doing little to harness it. The lines were often long, sometimes stretching more than half a mile. Food and water were rarely available, and neither were separate entrances for the elderly or the disabled. Occasionally, local Republican organizers would sign people up to vote and recruit volunteers, but the campaign never did.  At many political rallies -- including those of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Clinton's Democratic primary challenger -- campaign staff members count off the line and let supporters at a certain point know that there is no chance they will get inside. This never happened as I waited. Those around me assumed that if they had a ticket, they would get in.  Either the campaign was too disorganized to grant this kindness to its most devoted supporters -- or, as I came to suspect, they cared more about creating a spectacle for reporters to document and for Trump to point to as proof of his broad support.  In a rare move ahead of the Wilmington rally, the campaign limited the number of tickets to 5,800 -- although no one was checking tickets at the door. ""That's not fair,"" a retiree said when she heard the news from those around her, tears welling up in her eyes. (She was one of the last people admitted.)  Frustration grew as the start time neared. As the Trump supporters waited, protesters on the other side of the street behind a barricade screamed at them. A young woman yelled out Bible verses while holding a pink sign that read, ""Jesus was a socialist."" A guy in a banana costume quietly held a sign reading, ""This s--- is bananas.""  Trump's supporters were hot and tired, and now they were being attacked. Many yelled back.  ""Your food stamps are in the mail!""  ""Deport Obama!"" Soon the venue was filled and workers closed the doors. There were disappointed groans, but I couldn't find anyone who blamed Trump. After all, they said, it's not his fault that he's so popular. People hung around for a few minutes, not sure what to do. Some went back to their cars. Others made an angry beeline for the protesters. Inside, Trump bragged about the ""thousands of people outside that can't get in."" ""I'm the messenger,"" Trump said, trying to make this movement about more than just him. ""But I'll tell you what, the message is the right message.""     Supporters packed the Pier Park Amphitheater in Panama City Beach, Fla., for Trump's Oct. 11 rally. (Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)   Oct. 11, 2016: Panama City Beach, Fla.  In early October, Trump traveled to the Florida Panhandle, one of his hotbeds of support. More than 8,000 showed up at an outdoor rally on the water, a much-needed confidence boost for Trump. He had just apologized for recorded comments revealed by The Washington Post in which he bragged in 2005 about sexually assaulting women, and he faced accusations from a growing number of women that he had forced himself on them. Leaders of the party were distancing themselves, resigned to a loss of the White House but hoping to keep as many seats as possible in Congress.   [For Donald Trump's supporters, this election is about him, not the GOP]  ""Paul Ryan's an idiot,"" said Marla Clark, 52, a legal assistant at a private law firm who lives in Panama City, referring to the House speaker. ""They need to get rid of the parties. Everybody needs to be independent because when the Republican Party doesn't stand by their own people, then they don't need to have a party. The parties are nothing but a problem. That was great in my parents' generation, but in this generation?""  She was also mad at Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, for not standing more firmly with Trump when controversy hit. (""Does an officer leave his canine behind? No."") She was mad at those offended by Trump's crude comments. (""They've never spewed anything nasty out of their mouth?"") She was mad at Clinton, the ""rigged system"" and the media. (""They're desperate."") And she was even a little mad at Trump.  ""I was worried that he gets angry too fast,"" she said. ""I was worried that he doesn't think about what he says. And there have been many times where I'm like: I want him for president, but his mouth does tend to just get out of line once in a while."" She wanted Trump to win, and she was still hopeful he could -- as long as people realized how bad things had gotten and how much worse they could still get.  ""I'm truly scared,"" she said. ""I'm just scared for the world. I'm scared for the United States. I really am.""     Trump at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Oct. 31. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)   Oct. 31, 2016: Grand Rapids, Mich.  Eight days before the election, Trump returned to the aging arena in Grand Rapids. It was Halloween, and his campaign had decorated the stage with pumpkins, buckets of crimson mums and bales of hay.  ""Monster Mash"" and other Halloween songs blared. The audience included Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, Lady Liberty and ""Crooked Hillary"" in an orange jumpsuit. Sitting near the top of the bleachers for that afternoon rally was Robert Donley, 74, who retired from IBM in 1999, drove a commercial truck for five years, and now splits his time between Michigan and Arizona. For most of his life he was a Democrat, but he said he began voting for Republicans after President Bill Clinton was caught lying about having an affair with a young intern.  He likes that Trump wants to go after companies that exploit workers or move jobs overseas. He agrees with Trump on cracking down on illegal immigration but is conflicted on the nominee's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country, although he doesn't have a better idea. He likes that Trump doesn't dwell too much on social issues such as same-sex marriage.  But he doubts that Trump will win. Instead of hammering on the messages that resonate with voters like him -- job creation, trade, taxes and the economy -- Trump obsessed over his personal feuds. Donley was stunned when Trump attacked the Hispanic judge, calling it ""low-class, lowbrow."" But Hillary Clinton's email server was once again in the news, and Trump seemed to have one last opening. ""It opens a window, but the problem with Donald -- I mean, he can turn a good thing into a defeat really fast with his mouth,"" Donley said. On the stage that day, Trump insisted that he would win. ""We've created a movement. This is like a great movement that the whole world is talking about,"" he said. ""And honestly you'll never have this chance; in four years, I don't care who it is that runs, you're never gonna have this chance. So you have to get out and vote. Vote with all of your heart, vote with all of your soul, because this is it.""          1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail      View Photos   The GOP presidential nominee is pressing his case ahead of Election Day.
