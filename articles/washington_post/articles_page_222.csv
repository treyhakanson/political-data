James Otis, 52, faces a maximum of three years in jail or a $10,000 fine, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said Thursday. Otis destroyed the star of the president-elect in the pre-dawn hours of Oct. 27, when Trump was still a candidate, police said. He was arrested soon after. Otis, who is free on bail and scheduled to be arraigned on Friday, could not immediately be reached for comment and it's unclear if he has an attorney. The star, given to Trump in 2007 for his work on the reality show ""The Apprentice,"" has since been repaired. Otis said at the time that he smashed the star in protest of Trump's treatment of women, and had initially planned to steal the star, sell it off and give the money to the 11 women who had said Trump groped them. He said he would be happy to pay for the repairs. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

The dead included 10 Abu Sayyaf rebels, although troops recovered only three bodies, said military spokesman Maj. Filemon Tan. Four were killed and nine wounded on the government side, he said. The fighting began when army units encountered some 150 militants in Patikul township in Sulu province and exchanged fire until the extremists withdrew, Tan said. Soldiers then pounded the rebels' position with artillery fire and put up checkpoints as they pursued the militants. The Abu Sayyaf, which is blacklisted by the U.S. and the Philippines as a terrorist organization, holds more than a dozen foreign and local hostages. President Rodrigo Duterte, who took office in June, has ordered troops to destroy the Abu Sayyaf, known for its brutality and ties to foreign militants. He has ruled out the possibility of any peace talks with them as he pursues negotiations with two other larger Muslim insurgent groups. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Then it denied him three times.	"   Donald Trump poses for photographers during the July 2014 ground breaking ceremony of the Trump International Hotel project in D.C. (Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency)  Shortly after President-elect Donald Trump's victory, the head of the American Institute of Architects -- a 159-year-old professional architecture group that has almost 300 chapters across the United States -- issued a pledge of support on behalf of its members. ""The AIA and its 89,000 members are committed to working with President-elect Trump to address the issues our country faces, particularly strengthening the nation's aging infrastructure,"" said the group's chief executive and vice president, Robert Ivy, in the post-Election Day statement. ""During the campaign, President-elect Trump called for committing at least $500 billion to infrastructure spending over five years."" Amid Trump's many campaign promises, declarations to improve infrastructure were a constant theme. ""We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none,"" Trump said during his acceptance speech on Nov. 9. The AIA vowed to work with Trump and the incoming Congress, to ""ensure that investments in schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure"" remained ""a major priority."" Noting the election was ""hard-fought"" and ""contentious,"" the statement said, ""It is now time for all of us to work together to advance policies that help our country move forward."" In the declaration to embrace Trump, the AIA joined a group that includes corporations like shoemaker New Balance and Pennsylvania brewery D.G. Yuengling & Son. And like the sneaker fires and beer boycotts that raged on social media, the blowback within the architectural community was fierce.   [We live in crazy times: Neo-Nazis have declared New Balance the 'Official Shoes of White People']   On Nov. 11, the editorial board of the Architect's Newspaper issued a blistering critique of the AIA pledge. The board ""strongly disagrees with Ivy's conciliatory note"" in the aftermath of a Trump campaign it called ""racist, misogynist, and hateful."" The trade publication warned that architects who contributed to the ""proposed border wall or its attendant detention centers, federal and private prisons, and militarized infrastructure"" would be perpetuating inequality and the ""racist patriarchy of Trump's ideology."" Some architects were dismayed by AIA's tone, which they saw less as congratulatory than salivatory, toward the incoming Trump administration. The AIA's ""only serious interest as an organization has become a craven interest in securing our piece of the action,""said Baltimore-based architect Frederick Read. Read resigned from the AIA on the Thursday after Election Day, over objections that the organization ""does not represent my personal or professional interests,"" according to a letter he sent to the Baltimore chapter and obtained by the Architect's Newspaper. Other AIA members were critical of the statement in light of architecture's historical reputation as a career dominated by white men. A group of architects with the Equity Alliance argued that Ivy had ""perpetuated our profession's white, male privilege when you offered the Institute's support for a person known for promoting a worldview that threatens to pit us against one another on the basis of our race, gender, creed, or sexual orientation."" Trump's beliefs ran counter to the architectural values of ""climate action, promotion of domestic and global projects that are humane and socially just, and equity, diversity and inclusion in both practice and representation,"" the architects said. Students at the Yale School of Architecture lamented that the AIA ""resigned itself to a cowardly position of economic and political subservience"" in an open letter denouncing the endorsement. ""We have an ethical responsibility not to erect walls that divide,"" the students wrote, ""but to lay the foundation for a more unified, just, and safe society."" First by inches and then by yards, the AIA heads walked back from the statement. On Saturday, Ivy and President Russell Davidson wrote to the Architect's Newspaper. As a bipartisan organization, the men wrote, ""The AIA remains firmly committed to advocating for the values and principles that will create a more sustainable, inclusive and humane world. The spirit and intention behind our statement is consistent with and in support of President Obama's eloquent call for us all to unite for the best interest of America's future."" Subsequently, on Tuesday, Ivy and Davidson issued a video statement, calling the initial commitment to work with President-elect Trump ""tone deaf.""    By Thursday, a written apology also appeared on the AIA website. ""We deeply regret the harm that our statement caused,""  said Ivy and Davidson in the third, latest message. ""We understand why our members are upset. Many of the president-elect's statements and policies run counter to the values of AIA and its members. Let us be clear: we will be unwavering in our adherence to these values with this new administration.""

Then his prediction disappeared.	"   Russian President Vladimir Putin holds a glass during a ceremony receiving diplomatic credentials from foreign ambassadors at the Kremlin in Moscow on Nov. 9. (Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters)  Valery Solovei is a professor at Russia's prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He is well-respected within Russia-watching circles, known for a proximity to Kremlin circles that has enabled him to accurately predict several recent government appointments. On Thursday, an interview with Solovei was published in the Moscow-based newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets. In the interview, Solovei made a number of interesting claims -- most surprisingly, that Russian President Vladimir Putin would step down in 2017. That Putin would leave office is big news. The Russian president has few real rivals in the country's political system, which he has effectively led since 2000. However, if you want to read it now on MK's website, you are out of luck. The article has been removed, though the tweet that announced it still remains.   Groza 2017 goda: vozmozhno, Putina cherez neskol'ko mesiatsev zamenit preemnik https://t.co/BGe82vmSML -- MK (@mkomsomolets) November 10, 2016   You can, thankfully, still find the article on some Internet archives. In the interview, Solovei suggested that Putin will have ""some problems"" next year that will force him out of the limelight for a few months. He also suggests that the Kremlin will call early elections to replace him before this, in part because under Putin, it will be difficult to work to get better relations with the United States. Former president Dmitry Medvedev will replace him: ""Deja vu,"" Solovei observes. The political scientist also indicates that the Kremlin isn't quite sure what to make of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. ""No one today knows what to expect from Trump,"" Solovei said. It's important to note that Solovei doesn't say this authoritively. He concedes at a number of points that he is not sure of the accuracy of his information. He also refuses to give more details, demuring when asked specifically if Putin has a health problem. Later in the interview, he speculates more broadly about the future of Russia, suggesting that the Russian opposition, embattled for years, will gain more support in the next few years. Whether it is pure speculation or not, the removal of the story has prompted many to wonder whether there really was a bombshell contained in the interview. According to the U.S.-funded RFE/RL, Solovei may have immediately left Moscow after the interview to head to an unknown location, though he still appears to be posting on social media. The Moscow Times reports that MK editor Pavel Gusov has said that the article was simply removed because there were factual errors in it and that it will be republished in a few days.

The run-up to the vote was fraught, with unsupported claims by the Republican presidential candidate of a rigged election and fears that hackers might attack voting systems. He reiterated his claims on Election Day, after his campaign announced it was seeking an investigation in the battleground state of Nevada over reports that some early voting locations had allowed people to join lines to vote after polls were scheduled to close. Asked on Fox News if he would accept Tuesday's results, Trump continued to demur.  ""We're going to see how things play out today and hopefully they will play out well and hopefully we won't have to worry about it,"" he said. Later in the interview, he said, ""It's largely a rigged system."" Concerns of voter intimidation and fraud led to a flurry of lawsuits in the run-up to Election Day, and new voter regulations in more than a dozen states also held the potential to sow confusion at polling places. But at least in the early going, most of the problems were routine -- the kinds of snags that come every four years, like the lines, machines not working properly, and trouble with ballots or voter rolls. One New Jersey voter reported waiting three hours because there were too few voting machines at her polling place in Jersey City. In Texas, a computer malfunctioned at a polling place inside a high school in suburban Houston, forcing officials to briefly send voters to another polling place more than two miles away. Fort Bend County Elections Administrator John Oldham said the malfunctioning console was later replaced with a backup and voting resumed. Andrea Patience, a 50-year-old pharmacy technician, was among those standing in line when the computer malfunctioned. She said she waited an hour for it to be fixed. Patience said as many as 100 people were in line at the time, and about half of them left.  ""There were a lot of upset people,"" Patience said. ""I don't know if they will come back later or decide not to vote."" Election officials in Utah said voting machine problems in the southern part of the state forced poll workers early in the day to use paper ballots. A computer problem in Durham County, North Carolina -- a Democratic stronghold in a state that has been a key battleground in the presidential race -- triggered long lines when election officials had to rely on a paper check-in process. There were also sporadic reports of people in North Carolina who said they were not put on the voter rolls despite registering through the Division of Motor Vehicles. The question this year was whether problems would be widespread and indicate a pattern of fraud or voter intimidation. Trump had suggested that Philadelphia was among those places ripe for fraud. The city's district attorney, Seth Williams, said in mid-afternoon that his office had investigated 68 complaints about voter intimidation, broken machines or other problems, a number consistent with the past three presidential elections. He said all had proved unfounded. In the last week alone, Democrats went to court in seven states seeking to halt what they claim were efforts by Republicans and the Trump campaign to deploy a network of poll watchers hunting for voter fraud. Republicans have disputed claims they are planning to intimidate voters, and judges largely found no evidence of efforts to suppress voters. While there were concerns that the heated rhetoric of the campaign would lead to confrontations at the polls, only a few skirmishes were reported. In southeastern Michigan, authorities said an argument outside a polling place between a woman supporting Hillary Clinton and another backing Trump led a man to shove one of the women and spurred others to join in. No arrests were made. This is the first presidential election in which a key provision of the Voting Rights Act was not in place. A 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down a portion of the law that had required certain states and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to receive pre-approval from the U.S. Justice Department for any election law change. This allowed a number of states, most led by GOP legislatures and governors, to enact strict voter ID laws and reduce early voting. Legal challenges to some of those voter ID laws have led to a multitude of court rulings in recent months that blocked or struck down some provisions while upholding or reinstating others. That triggered concerns of misinformation among voters, election officials and poll workers. The Supreme Court ruling also prompted the Justice Department to send fewer election observers to polling places around the country than in previous years, with the reduction likely to diminish the department's ability to detect intimidation or other problems. Meanwhile, state election officials were guarding against any attempt to breach their systems. Forty-eight states have accepted ""cyberhygiene"" help from the Homeland Security Department to patch their networks so that they're more difficult for hackers to penetrate, and the remaining two states had contracted such services, officials said. Cybersecurity experts say it is highly unlikely that the official vote counts will be affected by hackers. ___ Associated Press writers Diana Heidgerd in Dallas; Ron Todt in Philadelphia; and Desmond O.
