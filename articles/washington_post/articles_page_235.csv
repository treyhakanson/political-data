U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had ordered Adam Crapser deported because of criminal convictions, including assault and being a felon in possession of a weapon. His life story highlights the failings of an adoption system that put him in the homes of one set of parents who abandoned him and another that physically abused him and other adopted children, his Seattle attorney, Lori Walls, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson told AP in an email that the 41-year-old Crapser arrived in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday morning aboard a commercial airline flight escorted by ICE deportation officers. Richeson said Crapser was arrested by ICE on Feb. 8 after serving a 60-day sentence for menacing constituting domestic violence and attempted coercion. He had been held in an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington since then. A judge could have allowed Crapser to stay in America but decided on deportation. Crapser's supporters said he waived an appeal because he couldn't stand to stay in the detention center any longer. Walls said she is astonished that the fact that Crapser ""was adopted, abandoned and abused ... carried relatively little weight in the decision that the immigration court made.""  ""The U.S. government facilitated the adoption out of Korea,"" she said. ""No one followed up to make sure he was safe. When that first family abandoned him to foster care he was not visible -- there was no follow-up."" No one ever sought U.S. citizenship for him. He and his older sister were adopted by a family who lived in Michigan and who later abandoned them after they moved to Oregon, Walls said. Brother and sister were split up. Crapser was eventually adopted by parents in Oregon who assaulted him and other children in their care. His adoptive parents were convicted of multiple crimes. Crapser eventually left the home and was arrested after he broke in to retrieve some of his belongings from his orphanage in South Korea, Walls said. Crapser later got into further trouble with the law. He came under the scrutiny of federal immigration authorities after he applied for a Green Card and they saw his criminal record.  ""I'm hopeful Adam figures out how to make a life in that country, where he doesn't speak the language read the language or know anything about the culture,"" Walls said. His birth mother in South Korea, who had put her son and daughter up for adoption because she couldn't afford to keep him, is learning English so she can communicate with him when they're reunited, The New York Times reported recently.  ""His birth mother, because of publicity in South Korea, came forward,"" Walls said, adding that a DNA test proved the relationship. Walls noted that the mother is disabled, has a low income ""and can't be much help for him.""  ""I spoke with Adam a couple of days ago,"" Walls said. ""He was trying to stay positive, but I mean it was clear talking to him that he was scared. He's going to a country where he can't even read the street signs."" Walls said there might be legal remedies for Crapser to return to the U.S. but that it would be ""an uphill battle."" __ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at http://twitter.com/andrewselsky Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Flynn, que ha sido director de la Agencia de Inteligencia de Defensa, ha asesorado a Trump en cuestiones de seguridad nacional desde hace meses. Con el puesto que le ofrecen laboraria en la Casa Blanca y tendria acceso frecuente al presidente. Lo anterior lo informo un alto funcionario del equipo del magnate, el cual pidio guardar el anonimato porque carece de autorizacion para hablar sobre la oferta. No dijo si Flynn acepto el puesto. Trump sostuvo su primera reunion con un lider mundial desde que gano los comicios presidenciales, entrevistandose en privado con el primer ministro japones Shinzo Abe. El magnate no hizo comentarios tras la reunion.  ""Creo que sin confianza entre ambas naciones la alianza nunca funcionaria en el futuro, y (despues) del desenlace de la conversacion de hoy estoy convencido de que el senor Trump es un lider en el que puedo tener gran confianza"", afirmo Abe despues de la entrevista. Horas antes el jueves, Trump efectuo consultas con el exsecretario de Estado Henry Kissinger y se entrevisto con Nikki Haley, gobernadora de South Carolina y posible candidata a encabezar el Departamento de Estado. En Washington, el vicepresidente electo Mike Pence se reunio con los lideres republicanos en el Congreso. Posteriormente se entrevisto con Nancy Pelosi, lider de la minoria en la Camara de Representantes, y con Chuck Schumer, recien elegido para encabezar a los democratas del Senado, en busca de transmitirles respeto en momentos en que los democratas se preparan para un control republicano en ambas camaras y en la Casa Blanca por primera vez en una decada.  ""Esperamos hallar formas en las que podamos encontrar puntos de vista en comun y hacer avanzar al pais"", afirmo Pence afuera de la oficina de Schumer en el Senado. En un gesto de reconciliacion por separado con la clase dirigente republicana, Trump tiene planeado reunirse con Mitt Romney, candidato presidencial republicano en 2012, que critico a Trump como un ""estafador"" y un ""fraude"" en un duro discurso en marzo pasado. El magnate respondio refiriendose repetidas veces a Romney como un ""perdedor"". Ambos comenzaron a reconciliarse despues de la victoria de Trump, cuando Romney le llamo para felicitarlo. Se reuniran este fin de semana, dijo un funcionario del equipo de transicion, quien hablo a condicion de guardar el anonimato porque carece de autorizacion para declarar acerca de la agenda del presidente electo. Kellyanne Conway, jefa de su campana, dijo que aun estan ""trabajando"" en organizar la reunion. Con sus acciones del jueves, Trump busca mostrarles a los lideres en Estados Unidos y en el extranjero que el puede suavizar su retorica, ofrecer pragmatismo en la Casa Blanca y reafirmar las anejas alianzas estadounidenses. Desde su sorprendente victoria sobre Hillary Clinton la semana pasada, el presidente electo ha hablado por telefono con el presidente ruso Vladimir Putin, la primera ministra britanica Theresa May y casi tres decenas de otros lideres mundiales. Pero la visita de Abe al rascacielos de Trump en la region central de Manhattan es su primera reunion en persona con un lider extranjero desde que la campana concluyo. Ron Dermer, embajador israeli ante Estados Unidos, tambien visito el edificio y dijo que Trump es ""un verdadero amigo de Israel"". Trump, astro televisivo, empresario y recien llegado a la politica, dio ademas a conocer nuevos equipos que interactuaran con el Departamento de Estado, el Pentagono, el Departamento de Justicia y otras agencias de seguridad nacional. Todo forma parte de la transicion gubernamental antes de que Trump asuma la presidencia el 20 de enero. Durante su reunion con Kissinger, que encabezo el Departamento de Estado en los gobiernos de los presidentes Richard Nixon y Gerald Ford, ambos conversaron sobre las relaciones con China, Rusia, Iran y la Union Europea. ___ Thomas reporto desde Washington.

The states -- Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky and Iowa -- failed to show how the law would affect them and not just individual egg farmers, a unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. The court upheld a lower court decision that dismissed the lawsuit. California voters approved a ballot initiative in 2008 that set the space requirements for egg-laying hens in the state. The standards say chickens must spend most of their day with enough space to lie down, stand up, turn around and fully extend their limbs. The measure gave farmers until 2015 to comply. California egg farmers raised concerns that the measure would put them at a competitive disadvantage with their counterparts in other states. In 2010, California legislators expanded the law to ban the sale of eggs from any hens that were not raised in compliance with California's animal care standards. The California law cites concerns about protecting people from salmonella and other illnesses. The six states argued that the law would force their egg farmers to stop selling in California or spend hundreds of millions of dollars complying with the California standard. Ninth Circuit Judge Susan Graber said that argument did not give the states standing to file suit.  ""Large egg producers certainly could file an action like this one on their own,"" she said. The states also argued that the price of eggs for their consumers would change. Graber said that argument was speculative since the suit was filed before the law took effect. But even if prices went up, the states would still not have standing to challenge the law because nothing in the law directs farmers to raise prices and that eggs -- unlike products such as natural gas, are not of ""central economic significance"" to a state, Graber said. A call to the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which argued the case for the states, was not immediately returned. The 9th Circuit ordered the case dismissed without prejudice, which gives the states the right to bring another lawsuit against the law in the future. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   MOON TOWNSHIP, PA. -- Gov. Mike Pence stood on the tarmac at Atlantic Aviation after one of the campaign's last rallies and told me about the goals of a Trump administration. ""It all begins with Donald Trump's contract with the American voter,"" he said. Pence discussed tax reform, ethics reform, infrastructure improvements, better trade deals and a cheaper replacement for Obamacare. No mention of building walls, rounding up illegal immigrants or banning Muslims. Was he just playing the role of grace and steadiness to contrast Trump's more outrageous rhetoric? Maybe. But Pence's outline was not exactly the hell and brimstone that critics warned -- and Trump often promised -- a Trump presidency would bring to Washington's institutions. Nor did it sound like it would furnish the radical break with the status quo that Trump supporters say they want. of Trump supporters as portrayed in so many news stories. Over the past two years, though, I spoke to more than 3,000 voters in more than two dozen states. And the sense I picked up over and over was that they liked Trump for something deeper and less specific than the promises he made -- ""Make America great again"" meant putting strength, grit and change on their side, not enacting a particular policy agenda. To a lot of his voters, that was the tangible benefit he offered. The policies he talked about were how he signaled he was on their side. He made a raft of grand promises during the campaign, and he won't be able to keep them all, even with a solid majority in the House and a slim one in the Senate. For them, as long as he shows that he has their back and makes a sincere effort to get things done -- even if that requires compromise -- his voters say they'll keep faith in him. * * * Yes, some Trump voters would love to see a border wall, and some of them do want refugees turned away. But what drove the Trump supporters I met on the campaign trail was a sense that the Obama administration -- and Hillary Clinton, by extension -- hasn't been on their side and that Trump would be.   [Meet Trump's Pennsylvania supporters]   Shelley Sullens, a Trump supporter from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has high hopes for the president-elect but not ridiculous expectations. ""I have a pretty good idea how Washington works. It was designed to move at a snail's pace,"" she told me in October. The small-business woman said she never particularly agreed with Trump's call for a wall on the border with Mexico or a ban on Muslims entering the country. ""What I am looking for,"" she said, ""is a serious approach to picking jurists, working with Speaker [Paul] Ryan on fixing our health-care system and tax reform."" Robert Hughes of Bulger, Pa., also said Trump should work with Congress. ""I'm not looking for drama, I am looking for him to get behind closed doors and work with Ryan on taxes, regulation reform,"" the retired military veteran said. Hughes also wants a Republican president making Supreme Court appointments. All through the campaign, there was a gap between what Trump said and what he seemed to think he could actually achieve if he won. When I interviewed him in September , Trump came off as more serious than the flamboyant purveyor of blunt, sometimes racially insensitive rhetoric. When I asked what he thought his initial focus would be in the first year, he cited nearly the same issues Pence did later: a comprehensive energy plan, taxes and Obamacare. ""We have to start with healing the country by finding ways to work together,"" he said. ""One of those ways can be with rebuilding our infrastructure."" In the early-morning hours Wednesday, when Trump delivered his victory speech, the only policy he mentioned was his aspiration to ""rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals."" Would that work for Sullens? ""Absolutely. This is a guy who said he had our back; working on our infrastructure is certainly an example of that. We, or at least I, never expected him to walk into the White House, turn on the switch and give America everything we want,"" she said. Presidents usually do try to keep their campaign promises, research has found, making a good-faith effort to do about two-thirds of what they said they would do while seeking the job. George W. Bush pledged that he would cut taxes and take steps to end ""the soft bigotry of low expectations "" in schools, and he did both shortly after taking office. Barack Obama promised to address health care, and he pushed the Affordable Care Act through Congress. One of Trump's promises, of course, is to repeal that law and replace it -- which may be a reminder that there can be a political cost to keeping promises just as much as breaking them. I met voters who had backed Obama in 2008 and 2012 but said they were supporting Trump this year because of the increase in insurance premiums since the law passed. For a lot of Trump supporters, Obamacare contributed to a sense that Washington was no longer looking out for them. They believed their concerns burdening some people with new costs for the benefit of others wasn't heeded.   [I'm an Obama supporter. But Obamacare has hurt my family.]   They grew frustrated with mainstream Republicans, who won a majority in the House with a promise to scrap the law, even though they knew they couldn't deliver with Obama still in the White House. The establishment Trump ran against in the primaries were the same as Democrats were, Trump's voters felt -- they just wanted to win. Trump sounded different. Antonio Ripepi, a surgeon from Peter's Township, Pa., said he went to bed smiling when he realized that Trump had won. ""I started operating a couple of hours later still smiling,"" he said. ""I think there is this understanding in the press that we expect him to peel off everything he talked about doing as a candidate immediately as president. No. What was most appealing about Trump -- for at least me -- was that he had our back."" For Ripepi and others, ""having our back"" is not about economic misfortune but rather a perceived loss of strength in the fabric of America. Not in terms of politics and policy, necessarily; he worries that his children and future grandchildren will not be able to experience the same things he did, while living in the same community that his father and his father's father did. Will his kids be able to find livelihoods near home and enjoy the same traditions he did? Under Obama, voters like Ripepi told me, people from less mobile, socially conservative places felt they had no voice. Under Trump, they believe they will. To many voters, economic arguments were more important than Trump's explosive rhetoric. When China subsidizes steel production, it cripples manufacturing and makes it impossible for American companies to compete, said Hughes, a registered Democrat, who spent the second half of his career in manufacturing in western Pennsylvania. During the campaign, Trump promised to crack down on China, which he said is manipulating its currency, by lifting domestic regulations on the steel industry and halting steel dumping. But economists say that some of the trade policies Trump has proposed to punish China and Mexico for what he calls unfair practices would also hurt U.S. workers, potentially costing millions of jobs. Keeping that promise, then, might be in neither Trump's interests nor his voters'. * * * How many Trump supporters really sound, now that he's won the election, is hopeful -- the same way Obama voters sounded after his victory in 2008. Eight years later, the people who backed the Republican candidate are the ones who think the capital will change to serve their needs better. ""If he takes it slow and steady and shows us he is working for everyone's best interest rather than just special interests, we'll be patient,"" Hughes said. Mostly, Hughes thinks Trump will engage with everyone. ""That was part of the problem with President Barack Obama,"" he said, adding he never saw Obama talk to congressional members of his own party, let alone Republicans. ""Even the suggestion that that kind of back and forth is happening is a solid beginning."" Of course, Obama never managed to change the culture of Washington the way he pledged in his first ""hope and change"" campaign. On the other hand, his base never abandoned him for falling short."

Eva Lewis, who helped organize the Black Lives Matter demonstration planned by youth in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood, said it was called off after the group received online death threats. She said the activists would voice their safety concerns during a meeting Friday afternoon with Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, the Marist High School principal, local officials and others. The meeting comes amid increased tensions in the predominantly white neighborhood that is home to many police officers, firefighters and other city employees. An off-duty police officer fatally shot Joshua Beal, a 25-year-old Indianapolis resident. Police say Beal pointed a gun at the officer during a melee that began when an off-duty firefighter told the driver of the vehicle Beal was in that it needed to be moved because it was blocking a fire station's driveway. Since then, activists have held at least two demonstrations -- both of which attracted largely white crowds that shouted profanity and racially-charged language at the protesters. The school said in a statement on Friday that it called off classes to ""ensure safety and limit learning disruptions."" School officials have launched an investigation of the students' text messages, telling parents in a message posted online that they were ""devastated by this incident"" and that security at the school had been increased. The school said that ""disciplinary action"" was taken but did not elaborate. In his own message on the Archdiocese of Chicago website, Archbishop Blase Cupich said he supports the school taking ""the necessary steps to deal with this situation swiftly and take appropriate disciplinary action."" And, he said, ""Racism is a sin and has no place in the Church, including the Archdiocese of Chicago."" In a group text, female students at the school discussed the shooting and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests. The Daily Southtown reported one girl used the N-word, according to a screen shot shared on Twitter, while at least four others reaffirmed the racist message. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In July, the agency triggered panic when it sent letters to more than 250 immigrants saying federal regulations required the state to cancel their commercial licenses -- which authorize them to drive trucks, buses or tractor-trailers -- unless the immigrants could prove U.S. citizenship or permanent residency. After an outcry from elected officials and immigrant rights groups, the state agency delayed the action and has now clarified the federal rules. ""We have determined that you can retain your CDL and that no additional information is needed,"" the agency's letter said. ""You may continue to renew your commercial driver's license as long as you reside in Maryland"" and provide a work permit, unexpired passport or qualifying visa. State Sen. Victor R. Ramirez (D-Prince George's) applauded the MVA's reversal and said Friday that he was pleased the affected individuals can continue to drive and ""provide for their families."" Many of the drivers had spent thousands of dollars on commercial driver's license training and exams, purchased their own transport vehicles or started their own delivery or transport businesses. Most are from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and other countries that the secretary of homeland security has designated for the temporary protected status. That program allows people to stay in the United States because of an ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another extraordinary condition, such as violence, in their countries of origin. The immigrants have to renew their status regularly to keep their employment permits, while also undergoing criminal background checks. ""Thank God. Now I don't have to worry about moving or finding a new job,"" said Abraham Ventura, a Prince George's County trucker and father of three. Originally from El Salvador, he has had protected status since 2001. Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez (D-Montgomery), who has advocated on behalf of the affected drivers, said the state agency should apologize for its mistake and for threatening the livelihoods of immigrants unnecessarily. It is not clear whether President-elect Donald Trump (R), who campaigned on a promise of shutting down illegal immigration, will appoint a homeland security secretary who would significantly change which countries of origin qualify for the protected-status program. The program for citizens of El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras next comes up for review in 2018. Yemen, Sudan and Somalia are on the list for 2017. "

Portland Resistance spokesman Gregory McKelvey says the activist group hoped to provide a constructive outlet for the shared fear, anger and frustration that followed Tuesday's election. He says the vandalism late Thursday had nothing to do with his group. Video shows it was largely committed by young men with masks partially covering their faces. Police described them as anarchists who ignored the calls of peaceful protesters to stop destroying property. More than two dozen people were arrested. McKelvey apologized to businesses that were damaged. He said the group planned to help clean up and raise money for repairs. A rally for healing has been scheduled for Friday afternoon. ___ 8:30 a.m. Police arrested at least 11 people during anti-Donald Trump protests that spilled into the streets of downtown Oakland for a third straight night. Police say protesters lit fires on streets and in trash cans, smashed windows and sprayed graffiti on at least seven businesses Thursday night. The San Francisco Chronicle reports (http://bit.ly/2fVFPoj ) that officers in riot gear stood across sections of a street, trying to limit the crowd's access to the city's central business district. By 11 p.m., most protesters had returned to the plaza in front of City Hall, where they chanted against Trump's election and police. They numbered a few hundred, down from about 1,000 who attended an initial rally earlier in the day. ___ 8:30 a.m. Los Angeles police say they arrested about 185 people protesting Donald Trump's election, mostly for blocking streets. Thursday night's protest was mostly peaceful, but some demonstrators briefly shut down highways and caused property damage. Officer Norma Eisenman said the only serious incident involved an injury to an officer near police headquarters. A person was arrested for that, but Eisenman had no details. The officer was treated and released. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, condemned what he called a ""very, very small group of people"" that damaged property or blocked traffic but said he was proud of the thousands more that peacefully protested. Juveniles were cited for curfew violations. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

When President Barack Obama tried to do it, a Republican Congress fought him at almost every turn, and Trump would have to contend with his party's deep-seated dislike for government spending and higher taxes to meet the $1 trillion tab for his proposals. The transportation industry sees hope in Trump's plans, which he made the first policy issue in his Wednesday victory speech.  ""We are going to fix our inner cities ... We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none,"" he said. ""And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it."" But Trump has been vague what about he'd do and what it would cost. During the campaign he said he'd double the $275 billion boost in government infrastructure spending proposed by his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. A recent paper by Trump advisers calls for using federal tax credits to generate $1 trillion in private sector infrastructure investment over a decade. To offset the cost of the credits, U.S. corporations would be encouraged to bring home profits parked overseas to avoid taxes, in exchange for a low tax rate. If that corporate tax ""repatriation"" idea sounds familiar, it's probably because Obama has been urging Congress to do that, and Clinton cited repatriation as the way she would pay for her infrastructure plan. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have also expressed support for the concept. But other Republicans and influential conservative pressure groups who want to shrink government have said the idea sounds too much like a tax increase because it raises money. Trump's vice president-elect, Mike Pence, was among a vocal minority of Republicans in the House who favored going in the other direction by stripping the federal government of most of its transportation responsibilities. There's been bipartisan support in Congress for addressing the nation's aging and inadequate infrastructure if funding questions can be resolved. Congress passed transportation bills in 2012 and 2015 to shore up the strained federal Highway Trust Fund, which provides highway and transit aid to states, and to provide modest increases in transportation spending -- far short of what Obama and congressional Democrats said was needed. Lawmakers struggled to pay for the plans by cobbling together spending cuts and revenue increases elsewhere in the federal budget, some of them more fiscal sleight of hand than real money. By 2021, the fund is expected to show a $18 billion gap between spending and gas-tax revenue. Raising money for infrastructure through corporate tax repatriation has a greater likelihood of success if can be part of a larger tax overhaul effort that also cuts rates more generally, said Robert Poole, transportation policy director for the libertarian-leaning Reason Foundation. Repatriation is also just a temporary fix. Some industry lobbyists are pushing for a longer-term solution to the Highway Trust Fund's woes, such as raising the federal gas tax and tying future increases to inflation. But Trump's advisers aren't ""going to want Trump to sign onto big increases in taxes of any kind,"" Poole said. Even with tax credits, infrastructure projects like roads and bridges are only attractive to investors if they have a guaranteed revenue stream such as highway tolls to make them profitable. There are only a very few projects in the country that meet the conditions needed to make them work.  ""You aren't going to find those projects in all 50 states, and you may only find those projects in the most heavily populated states,"" said Pete Ruane, president of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. ""There's a political problem with that."" Trump's support has been strongest in rural and rust belt areas that are less likely to have such mega projects. The importance that Trump, a real estate developer, places on using tax credits to leverage private sector investment is highlighted by his choice of Shirley Ybarra to head his transportation transition team. Ybarra, a former Virginia transportation secretary and Reason Foundation policy analyst, is best-known for her advocacy of such public-private partnerships. Standard & Poor's has estimated that each government dollar spent on infrastructure would return $1.30 in economic growth, which could be a boost to the economy and job creation. But financing construction projects through tax credits might minimize the benefits, said Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. This is because the credits often improve the profit margins for existing projects while failing to help projects in impoverished communities that are less likely to generate a sizeable return.  ""You run the risk of using the money to provide a windfall to people who would have been building anyway,"" Bivens said. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.

You might also want to caffeinate because it could be a late night. The tumult and tedium of Campaign 2016 finally culminates Tuesday as the nation chooses among Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and a variety of third-party types. The action will roll from east coast to west, from pre-dawn voting in New Hampshire to late-night poll closes in Alaska. Some things to watch for as the autumn of our campaign discontent hurtles to a close (all times are EST): THE TIMELINE Look for the first burst of results when polls close at 7 p.m. in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. Look for bigger blasts of numbers just after 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., when polls close in a combined 30 states and the District of Columbia. The 11 p.m. batch of states includes big kahuna California, with 55 electoral votes. Alaska, where polls close at 1 a.m. on Wednesday, brings up the rear. ___ MOM WAS RIGHT Math really does matter. Election Day is all about which candidate can win enough states to get to 270 electoral votes. News organizations will keep a running tally. But you can go full nerd and play around with a Road to 270 calculator to get your favored candidate to the magic number. Beware: It can take a while for the picture on election night to clarify, simply because of how the vote rolls in across the country. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney was still ahead in the electoral and popular vote at 10:30 p.m.; an hour later, President Barack Obama was on the brink of re-election. ___ NEW YORK, NEW YORK Thanks to early voting, more than 50 million people may have voted before Election Day. Not Clinton or Trump. Both are expected to make a show of trekking to their local polling places on Tuesday, Clinton in Chappaqua, New York, and Trump in New York City. Their running mates -- Democrat Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Mike Pence of Indiana -- will vote where they live, and later team up with their principals in New York. ___ EARLY TEA LEAVES For an early read on how things are going, keep an eye on Virginia in the presidential contest. If Clinton doesn't get a winner's call there by 9 p.m. or 10 p.m., it could be a positive sign for Trump. Watch Indiana for an early indicator in the tug-of-war for control of the Senate; if Evan Bayh can manage a comeback, that'll be a good sign for Democrats hoping to retake the Senate. ___ EXIT POLL EXPLANATIONS Data collected from polling-place interviews with voters will offer a wealth of information to help explain why people voted the way they did. Among the questions to be answered by the exit polls: -- Do voters cast ballots for their candidates enthusiastically or holding their noses? -- Do blacks give strong backing to Clinton after recent worries about their turnout in early voting? -- Who wins college-educated whites, who typically skew Republican but are being courted by Clinton? -- In a race so often roiled by Trump's comments about women, what does the gender gap look like? -- Did people care about Clinton's problems with her private email setup? -- Were they worried about Trump's temperament? ___ UTAH. REALLY. The reddest of the red states actually offers some drama this year. Keep an eye on the Utah vote for independent Evan McMullin, who's been giving Trump heartburn in a state that should be a lock for him. (Polls close at 10 p.m. EST) ___ MAKING HISTORY If Clinton emerges the victor, it will be a historic moment for women as she shatters that ""highest, hardest glass ceiling."" ___ THE BIG QUESTION The question has been dangling out there: Will Trump accept the results of the presidential election if he loses? ""I'll keep you in suspense,"" he said at the last debate. The world is waiting for his answer. ___ A TIME TO HEAL Election night speeches have ""tremendous power to heal,"" says public speaking coach Ruth Sherman. Will the candidates rise to the moment? After such a long, ugly campaign, both winner and loser will have a responsibility to help to bring the country together. ___ WAIT, THERE'S MORE! The presidential race has sucked up most of the oxygen over the past year, but there will be lots more to take in on election night, with control of the Senate and House at stake, 12 states electing governors, and assorted ballot proposals around the country. In the House: Republicans hold a 247-188 majority, including three vacancies. Democrats could pick up 10 or more seats, perhaps even more than 20, but don't expect to take control. In the Senate: Republicans are furiously working to protect their 54-46 majority, with a half-dozen races seen as toss-ups. A dozen governor's offices also are up for grabs, at least seven appearing competitive. Among issues on ballot proposals: the death penalty, gun control and marijuana legalization. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Though the book won't close on his presidency until Inauguration Day, Obama's frenzied, last-minute push for Clinton was a farewell tour of the nation. As he crisscrossed Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania Monday, he waxed nostalgic, told old stories and teared up as he thanked the nation for betting, improbably, on ""a skinny guy with a funny name."" He said he'd been asked recently whether the hope that defined his campaign had somehow survived eight trying years.  ""The answer's yes,"" Obama said in Independence Mall, not far from the Liberty Bell. He said he was still a believer, ""and that's because of you.""  ""In the letters you've written me, in the tears you've shed for a lost loved one, I've seen again and again your goodness and your strength and your heart,"" Obama said. Then the Obamas and the Clintons embraced onstage: The last Democratic president and the current one; the first black president and the woman who, on Tuesday, may break yet another historic barrier. It was left to Michelle Obama, whose visceral speeches this campaign hit a nerve with many Americans, to cast both families as part of a singular American story: One of inclusive opportunity that she hoped would contrast powerfully with the vision of Republican Donald Trump. She said she marveled at a country where ""a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great-great-grandfather was a slave, can go to some of the finest universities on earth. Where the biracial son of a single mother from Hawaii and the son of a single mother from Hope, Arkansas, can both make it to the White House.""  ""Thank you for welcoming us into your communities, for giving us a chance whether you agreed with our politics or not,"" Mrs. Obama said, in her own send-off to the nation. She said ensuring Clinton wins the election was ""perhaps the last and most important thing that I can do for my country as first lady."" It wasn't always this way. In 2008, when Obama defeated Clinton in a grinding primary, there was naked bitterness between the two Democrats that only began to soften when Obama named her secretary of state. Nearly a decade later, the Obamas need Clinton as much as she needs them, to prevent their legacy from being eviscerated by a victorious Trump. After all, the president told supporters earlier in Ann Arbor, Michigan, all his accomplishments ""go out the window if we don't win tomorrow."" Clinton, too, was meditative about the bruising battles that have led her to this moment.  ""I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became,"" Clinton said, without naming Trump. In a less-than-subtle display of political symbolism, she spoke from behind the presidential seal affixed to the podium from which Obama introduced her. The Obamas are keenly aware that whether or not Clinton wins Tuesday, their era is coming to an end, a reality punctuated by both Obamas' insistence that neither will ever run for office again. So in a parting gift to Clinton, Obama offered her his campaign mantra -- ""Fired up, ready to go"" -- and told rally-goers in New Hampshire how it had been coined by a supporter he'd never met who showed up at an obscure event eight years ago in South Carolina.  ""It just goes to show you how one voice can change a room,"" Obama said -- and then a city, a state and a nation. ""And if it can change a nation, it can change the world."" ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
