(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Hundreds of people protesting the election of Donald Trump took to the streets in cities across the country for a third straight night on Friday, as police bolstered their forces in the wake of rioting in Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles. More than 225 people have been arrested across various cities -- at least 185 in Los Angeles alone, the Associated Press reported -- amid demonstrations that have included highway blockades, angry chants of ""not my president"" and a rampage through Portland. Police in New York on Friday erected barricades and placed sand-filled trucks in front of Trump Tower. Protesters illuminated by the flashing red and blue of police car lights chanted, ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go."" And in Atlanta, protesters marched through the Georgia State University campus and blocked roads. ""Tonight appears to be the largest group yet,"" tweeted Justin Wilfon, a reporter with Atlanta's WSB-TV Channel 2. President Obama, President-elect Trump, and political leaders on both sides of the aisle appealed for unity, even as protests veered into violence. In Portland, protesters convened for a ""heal-in"" Friday night at city hall, a day after the protests there had turned violent. Hundreds gathered with signs and were led in a group activity where people divided by neighborhood and discussed their reasons for being at the event. But the Portland gathering intensified as the night progressed. The group that formed around 5 p.m. splintered, spreading around the city. Police in riot gear stood firm across one downtown street until after 8 p.m. when protesters threw glass bottles at the police. By 10 p.m., the police had deployed tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets, warning protesters that they would be arrested if they remained on scene. An hour later, hundreds of people were still gathered downtown, with police closing in from the east and west to send a clear message: leave or be arrested.

(Leah Sottile for The Washington Post)  Earlier Friday in Miami, hundreds of demonstrators clogged a major thoroughfare, the MacArthur Causeway, halting traffic for more than an hour shortly after dusk. They eventually moved downtown and by 9 p.m. had blocked northbound lanes on Interstate 95. Protest organizer David Michael, a 30-year-old community activist who voted for Jill Stein, carried a bullhorn to direct the orders to the Miami demonstrators. ""Once I saw other people protesting white supremacy, I said, 'You know what? We need to do one in Miami,'"" Michael said. ""We got the word out on social media like Facebook, all of that.""    Protesters opposed to Donald Trump took to the streets of Miami on Friday. (Francisco Alvarado for The Washington Post)  The sense of potential crisis in protests across the nation was reinforced by clashes that included the vicious beating, caught on video, of a 49-year-old man, David Wilcox, being viciously beaten by a group of young men and women in Chicago. The attackers screamed phrases such as ""You voted Trump"" and ""Don't vote Trump."" ""What's happening to America?"" Wilcox asked in a recorded interview with the Chicago Tribune. At Arlington National Cemetery, Obama used his Veterans Day remarks to try to remind the country of its common bonds -- even though Obama himself had derided Trump during the campaign and described him as unfit for the presidency. ""When the election is over, as we search for ways to come together, to reconnect with one another and with the principles that are more enduring than transitory politics, some of our best examples are the men and women we salute on Veterans Day,"" Obama said. For the moment, Portland has emerged as a bellwether for signs of the scope and tone of the protests. At the peak of Portland's demonstration late Thursday, about 4,000 people took to the streets, confronting drivers, spray-painting buildings and smashing electrical boxes with baseball bats, Pete Simpson, public information officer for the Portland Police Department, told The Washington Post. Police used pepper spray and ""rubber baton rounds,"" among other things, in efforts to disperse protesters. What began as a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest at about 6 p.m. escalated as the night wore on because of demonstrators not affiliated with the group, said Teressa Raiford, a community organizer in Portland. ""They're not coming to show solidarity, they're coming because they know there's going to be a big crowd,"" Raiford said. ""They don't respect our movement."" Simpson said anarchists ""aligned with the Black Bloc groups"" infiltrated the peaceful demonstration ""covered head-to-toe and carrying weapons."" ""Their tactic is go out and destroy property,"" Simpson said. Peaceful protesters tried to stop the more violent individuals, but ""they're not having any luck,"" he said.

(Alex Milan Tracy/AP)  After protesters began throwing objects at police and refusing orders to disperse, authorities used nonlethal flash grenades to move the crowd. ""It's definitely fair to say we are significantly outnumbered,"" Simpson said. Thursday's protest was ""one of the larger marches we've seen in the last few years,"" he said. Anger at the outcome of the election and a professed unwillingness to accept it are widespread on the Internet, despite conciliatory words from Hillary Clinton and Obama. Thousands of people have declared on social media that the president-elect is ""never my president"" or ""not my president,"" phrases that showed up on signs at protests. But only a relative few sharing that sentiment have actually taken to the streets. Trump and some of his supporters were heavily criticized during the campaign when they suggested they might not accept the result if Trump lost.   [Forget reconciliation. For thousands, it's #nevermypresident when it comes to Donald Trump.]   Protests began early Wednesday in the biggest U.S. cities -- New York, Los Angeles and Chicago -- and flared in places from Portland and Seattle to Philadelphia and Richmond, along with cities in red states such as Atlanta, Dallas, Omaha and Kansas City, Mo. On Thursday, about 600 ""anti-Trump"" protesters marched to downtown Baltimore and blocked streets. Following a rally in downtown Minneapolis, several thousand protesters blocked the heavily traveled Interstate 94 for about an hour Thursday night, causing a major traffic backup in both directions, the Star Tribune reported. In Oakland, Calif., officials pleaded with demonstrators to remain peaceful Thursday after the previous night's violence. Several incidents of graffiti -- with phrases such as ""Kill Trump"" -- were reported. Protesters set many small street fires and smashed a handful of windows, but the disorder did not appear as widespread as the night before, SF Gate reported. At least a half-dozen arrests were made. More than 300 people marched through downtown Los Angeles on Thursday night, many yelling, ""We reject the president-elect!"" Protesters halted traffic, threw bottles at officers, tagged police cars with graffiti and launched fireworks, the Los Angeles Times reported. But the protest was mostly peaceful, and it drew many fewer participants than the crowd of thousands on Wednesday night.   ['Not my president': Thousands protest Trump in rallies across the U.S.]   By 1 a.m., multiple arrests had been made by the Los Angeles Police Department for vandalism or disobeying a lawful order, Los Angeles Times reporter James Queally tweeted. The protests drew a rebuke from Trump, who met with Obama at the White House on Thursday morning. ""Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!"" Trump said on Twitter. He did not specify what he meant by ""incited by the media."" It was his first comment about the protests and one of the few statements he has made since claiming victory over Clinton early Wednesday morning. In 2012, after Obama was elected to a second term, Trump tweeted: ""We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!"" Early Friday morning, Trump took a different tone, tweeting this message: ""Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!"" On Thursday, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Trump supporter, chimed in, calling the protesters ""a bunch of spoiled crybabies"" in a Fox News interview. In Portland, the Oregonian newspaper reported, protesters chanted ""Not my president"" while carrying signs that read: ""Oppression thrives off isolation. Stand united,"" ""We reject the fascist agenda"" and ""You're fired!"" Mike Bivins, a local freelance journalist, said the protest took a noticeable turn as demonstrators passed a Northeast Portland car dealership, where some started breaking car windows. A dumpster and a newsstand were set on fire.    Numerous cars at a Toyota dealership were smashed as protesters marched through the streets of Portland. (Alex Milan Tracy/AP)  As protesters reached the Pearl District, a wealthy Northwest Portland neighborhood, ""it became a free for all"" of property damage, Simpson said. Protesters lit fires and shot flares into the air, and some dragged newspaper boxes into lines across streets. Other demonstrators took photos of themselves -- giving the camera a thumbs-up sign -- in front of a line of cops wearing riot gear.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2016/11/03/talk-of-the-nation/	Voters sound off about what they want — and don’t want — for their country	"After enduring months of presidential campaign rhetoric stifled on issues yet long on one-ups and personal attacks, the electorate is pondering what's next for America. Photographer T.J. Kirkpatrick set out to give this population a voice: ""The country has fractured along political lines, and I looked for a way to counter the partisanship and vitriol."" Kirkpatrick's resulting Polaroid images and accompanying interviews are portraits of voters from some of the key battleground states. It's a project he began on the campaign trail in January. ""One way to begin breaking down political boundaries is to look someone in the eye and have a conversation. Learn where people are coming from, what's informing their feelings on this election and, more generally, their views on the nation's future."" -- Dudley M. Brooks Clodomir Jean-Louis, 27 DES MOINES     People are very passionate about their views and who they want to support. They put a lot of stock into the people running for office, and once they get those people elected they disconnect from the process. That's the most serious crime of being a citizen in a country that requires its citizens to be engaged. In a democratic republic it doesn't work if people don't pay attention. This country has a long history of injustice. We like to focus on the glory of having conquered the westward expansion and having the entire North American continent or piece of it to ourselves. American exceptionalism and all that, but really it's, at the root, based on injustice. This election cycle seems to focus on pieces of that injustice, so I'm hopeful about that because that's a national dialogue we have not seen before. Not on this scale. What I fear for the country is the sort of rhetoric I hear from most of the Republican candidates. Where we have the sort of policies that really alienate us on an international level. We truly are a nation of immigrants. America would not exist without immigrants, so if you tell immigrants to stop coming here, what is America? Maggie Laube, 49 PERRYSBURG, OHIO     I went to public schools, which were not very conservative, until I hit high school. I went to a Catholic school, which was very conservative. Where you live, you kind of have the same beliefs because you're in the same circumstances, so I saw both sides of it between [the] different schools. I mean, I'm conservative. I think conservative things offer more protection. I don't ever want to be dependent on things like my mom had to be to survive, to make sure we had something to eat and a roof over our head. I want people to be able to sustain themselves. I value my vote. I will always vote. I'm not going to be told by any political party who to vote for. I'm not going to let somebody's money tell me who is going to be the candidate. But I don't think it matters what I believe and what I want. I could vote somebody in; it's not going to mean anything. Once they get in there, they're going to go with whatever keeps them there. We're at a point of pivotal change. I'm not afraid of change, I'm just afraid that what we see now is not a real change. It's just more of the same. Carmen Mendoza, 44 ARLINGTON, VA.     When Obama came into power, it was the first time I felt like an American, even though I've been here since I was a kid. I always felt like an outsider. Like there's another president, another white guy that's going to take power, and hopefully the decisions they make are good for everybody, not just white middle America. [Obama] was different. He wasn't an old white dude. That's where America is turning. There are people of mixed races now everywhere. It's been there, but people ignored it. He brought all that to the surface. This is the America that made America what it is. You have to look and learn, then go forward. The faces of America are not white, blond kids with ponytails. When I go at my sisters' schools and volunteer, and I see those faces, they're from Somalia and Nigeria and El Salvador and Nicaragua. That's the future of the country, and you have to accept that it's changing. I still have the belief that when people go and vote, they look at their children and they want something better for them. All that rhetoric [Donald Trump] brought with his campaign, I don't think it's actually going to happen. But what he brought is this segregation. I don't think that's going away. He's stirred something in society, and unless something gets done, it's not going anywhere positively. That really terrifies me. Tres Johnson, 46 COUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA     If you work really hard, you can make something happen. I've spent 21/2 years diving into this business [a coffee shop], and I've created my own livelihood. I get out of my life what I put into it now, and when I talk to immigrants when they come into the country, that's what their dream is, too. I was politically active when I was 18 years old. I didn't care about turning 16 and being able to drive, and I didn't care about turning 21 and being able to drink. I cared about turning 18 and being able to be a part of the voting process. And I got to vote one time, and then I lost my rights. My criminal past slowed me down from moving forward. You start to overthink things and don't fix the problems, and then at some point I woke up and I'm like, ""Okay, it's time to fix this and not blame the system anymore."" So I broke the law 25 years ago. If I want a gun now to protect myself or whatever, I'm not allowed that same right as some meathead militia man that's overtaking government offices. Why does he get to protect himself where I can't? I paid my debt. I've done everything. I have a reconciled relationship with the person that I ripped off. So at what point do I get to be an American again? Kelly Coffee, 38 AUSTIN     When you don't agree with someone, people take it as personal attacks. There's a mentality in this country of ""It's us against them."" No matter what side you're on. The media focuses on the sensationalism because, let's be honest, the media is in the business of making money. What sells? Outrageous, sensationalized stories. Then everybody gets more divisive and we're more away from that inclusiveness America was supposed to be about. It's gotten way lost. We've gotten back into a civil war. It's not the North and the South, it's the reds and the blues. We want to blame everybody else for something. We want to blame ISIS for this, we want to blame so-and-so for guns and mass murders. It's easy to point fingers at somebody else instead of yourself. I'm not pessimistic. Things can be better. There's more good in the world than bad. Most people just want to live their lives and pay their bills and love their children. They don't want to be scared. I understand the importance of Barack Obama being president. Not only will little black and African American boys and girls grow up and realize that they can be president, but little white kids will grow up and accept the idea of a black man being president because it won't mean anything to them. Harry Roberts Sr., 89 ORANGEBURG, S.C.     I've lived all of my life in South Carolina, born in 1927. I like to see the right people going in, the right man going in so that we can get this country back on an even keel, because there's so many things going on. The civil rights is all right, but when they separated the schools down here and the blacks went to school with the whites, trouble started. The mixtures like that and all these foreign people coming in over here, and the government let them come in. They're going to take jobs away from the young people, and it just ain't going to mix. We're going to have a war, right here. All these people that's got their cities and stuff bombed out, we don't have room to accept them. You've got so many young people now that does not have a college education. I like Donald Trump. The things that he's saying is something that we really ought to do. Lower the drug costs, lower the food costs and put the right man in Washington. And of course, the man that goes in, it's going to take him two years to straighten out the things that Obama's done. I'm not prejudiced. Most of my customers are black. The only thing I care about is what color is your money. Rita Cheng, 49 POTOMAC, MD.     People are very skeptical because they saw their parents lose money in the stock market. They saw their parents lose equity in their home. They saw their parents lose their jobs. I'd like skepticism to come down, and I'd like trust to come up. I don't know how to do that, other than it takes time to rebuild people's trust. I believe America is a place of opportunity. Many people from across the world come here to get educated. Talking about opportunity, one thing that does concern me -- I'm a certified financial planner -- I'm concerned about debts. I'm concerned about global debts in Japan and in Europe. I'm also concerned about our debt here, because debt can impact our opportunity set. I was the first in my family to go to school. I didn't borrow any money. My parents didn't borrow any money. I worked. I was able to graduate from school debt-free. That's [not] possible today. I'm multicultural: My dad is Chinese, and my mom is Irish and Czech. My dad came here with $17 and landed in Wisconsin. He told me it was so cold and he didn't even have a coat, but he made something of himself. I would like us to really focus on what does make America great. It's not perfect, but we have a lot to be thankful for. Nelson Vazquez, 60 CLEMSON, S.C.     We have these candidates who are very family-oriented and very positive, and you've got one especially that's very negative, so my overall view is trying to see what comes out of this that can make families stronger. That's really my hope, because with 70 percent of black mothers raising kids without fathers, [40] percent of the Latinos. When your family is stronger, your neighborhood is stronger, your community is stronger, your state is stronger, the country is stronger. But it is still difficult to think that it's going to be all that positive. I left Miami and the big city to be in a community like Clemson, where there's a lot of family values. That was my part in giving my children a good surrounding of other families. I just think that the way that this country was founded, that they had Christian values, that's what brought this country together. And those values coincide with family values, so that would be my biggest hope: that that can improve rather than disintegrate, which is what I think has been happening. Morris Christie, 61 PHILADELPHIA     I'm a veteran. I fought for people to come here to be free, so how you going to say you don't want people to come here to have a chance? That's wrong. They ain't saying nothing they going to do education-wise, or nothing, you know? Trump's saying: If your mother and father can't send you to college, that ain't their problem. That ain't no leader, and I hate to see how the presidential election is going. What's with politicians? They want to cut funds on this and that, they're shutting the schools, shutting libraries, shutting youth programs. There's only one way for kids to go, and that's the streets. My parents had it hard bringing me up, but I said I was going to amount to something because of the respect I had in my home. Politicians don't care no more about the children's educations, but they're building prisons and jails, and closing youth centers, and closing schools. I hope if somebody do get in office they'll think of the American people instead of overseas all the time. Help us here first. There's people starving in America. I'm going to be honest, what I see coming. We had the Civil War, now it's going to be overthrow the government. If ISIS don't do it, somebody's going to because minimum wages ain't take care of no families now. Demri Scott, 20 CASTLE PINES, COLO.     What I find pleasure in life is doing what I do for College Republicans: I love doing outreach on [the George Washington University] campus. Sometimes the Republican Party is missing out on the values that it once stood for, and that frustrates me, but [it's] also why I want to be more involved in the party. Politics nowadays is not about policy anymore, especially this election. How do you expect to make your party look good, or expect people to understand your policy, if you're just bashing the other side constantly? It's good to be critical of your political affiliation, and I'm critical of the Republican Party because I care. Many of the girls in my sorority are Democrats and they know I'm a Republican, but they still love me and appreciate me for who I am. We realize we have the same goal, to make America great. Maybe not in Trump's sense, or Hillary's sense, but we respect each other. After November I want the country to be able to look past people's differences. You're not a good or a bad person because you're a Democrat or a Republican. You're a good person because you do good things. Polaroid photos and interviews by T.J. Kirkpatrick/Redux"
