Steinmeier was speaking in Ankara a day after EU foreign ministers struggled to forge a common stance on Turkey amid deepening concerns about rights abuses, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested calling a referendum next year on whether his country should join the bloc. During a joint news conference with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu, Steinmeier said some within the EU wanted to break off Turkey's EU membership talks.""  ""Whether Turkey grows closer or distances itself from the EU is not a decision that can be taken in any European capital. It is a decision that needs to be taken by Turkey,"" Steinmeier said. ""I personally favor a good and close cooperation based on trust ... I wish these relations to continue."" Cavusoglu said the Turkish nation was frustrated by what he said was the EU's ""hypocrisy and double standards"" toward Turkey and that was why the government was considering holding a referendum.  ""Every day, one EU foreign minister comes up and says: 'let's throw Turkey out, let's throw them out of the negotiations, let's throw them out of NATO,'"" Cavusoglu said.  ""We don't deserve this treatment. Therefore let's ask our people and let the people decide. We are truly fed up with this approach that humiliates Turkey,"" Cavusoglu said. Ties between Turkey and Germany have become increasingly strained. Erdogan has accused Germany of supporting terrorism after German authorities suggested that Berlin may not extradite suspects wanted by Turkey over the failed coup attempt in July, if it considers the cases are politically motivated. Erdogan has also accused Berlin of failing to clamp down on Kurdish militants allegedly operating in Germany. Steinmeier said his country failed to understand claims by Erdogan that Germany had become ""a safe haven"" for terrorists and said Berlin stood with Turkey in its fight against the Islamic State group and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. On Monday in Brussels, EU foreign ministers struggled to find a common position that would balance their need for Ankara's continued support to stop a wave of migrants heading to Europe with concerns about rights abuses in Turkey in the wake of the quashed military coup in July. Last week, 10 legislators from Turkey's pro-Kurdish party and several senior staff of the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper were arrested on terrorism-related charges. Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people in its investigation into the failed coup, and dismissed or suspended more than 100,000 people from government jobs for their links to U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of masterminding the attempt.

Politicians of all stripes gathered in Georgetown for the time-honored tradition of Return Day, where they will settle their partisan differences, if only for the moment. Winners and losers of Tuesday's election rode together in horse-drawn carriages around the town circle, a symbolic gesture indicating that any hard feelings are left behind. After a town crier in tuxedo and top hat announced the Sussex County tallies in statewide and local contests from a courthouse balcony, local party leaders joined ceremoniously bury a hatchet in a box of sand. Democratic Gov.-elect John Carney Jr., who rode in a carriage with his Republican opponent, state Sen. Colin Bonini, said the ritual is a reminder that members of both parties must put political differences aside and work together for the public good. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It has brought hundreds of millions of people online and has become a vast marketplace for digital commerce, yet it is also heavily policed by censors to snuff out any challenge to the ruling Communist Party. Under President Xi Jinping, the censors are working overtime to keep 721 million Internet users under control. The latest effort came Monday. China's national parliament approved a cybersecurity law that can be used to restrict free speech and force foreign Internet companies to heed the demands of China's security services. Censorship is not new in China; a huge phalanx of officials are devoted to it, harsh punishments are meted out, and the country is ringed by a content-blocking Great Firewall. But now censorship will be more fully enshrined in the legal code. Article 12 of the new law prohibits use of the Internet for ""inciting subversion of the national regime"" or ""the overthrow of the Socialist system."" Also banned is inciting separatism or ethnic hatred, ""endangering national unity,"" or ""fabricating"" or disseminating false information about the economy. These are all touchstones of Chinese authoritarianism, vague enough to be deployed in many circumstances to smother dissent. Article 37 of the new law requires ""critical information infrastructure operators"" to store users' data, including that of foreign companies, on Chinese territory, making it easier for the security services to snoop. Article 24 requires Internet providers to demand the real identity of those they provide services to -- making it easier for security services to track down those who would like to speak their mind. Many foreign businesses are also alarmed that the new law may give the Chinese authorities access to their technology and data. Offering a glimpse of how censorship actually works in China, Ronald Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, released a report recently on digital streaming services. Similar to Periscope (which is banned in China), these apps, such as YY, 9158 and Sina Show, have become a craze. Mr. Deibert's researchers downloaded these three, and between February 2015 and October 2016 extracted 19,464 keywords that trigger censorship on chats associated with each application. Rather than monolithic control, they found censorship is decentralized and somewhat chaotic; the platforms are often expected to adhere to a kind of ""self-discipline"" rather than direct orders. Mr. Deibert's group discovered that the most popular app, YY, with 844 million registered users, automatically sends a report back when a user types a banned keyword; the report includes not only the user's name but also who the message was sent to and the message itself. In law and in practice, China is creating the world's largest online thought prison. It turns the idea of the Internet as a force for freedom on its head, and as China goes, so go other tyrants. From Vietnam to Saudi Arabia, from Russia to Turkey, the age of Internet repression has blossomed. Online:  http://www.washingtonpost.com  ___ Nov. 10 The New York Times on Afghan refugees: Pakistan is turning them back. Thousands who spent their life savings on a bid to resettle in Europe are being told it's time to head home. Inside Afghanistan, tens of thousands have become internally displaced in recent months as fighting between the Taliban and government security forces rages in several provinces. The refugee crisis could reach unprecedented numbers, with as many as 1.5 million returning home, many involuntarily, by the end of the year, according to humanitarian organizations. Yet, there is no plan to adequately address this humanitarian emergency. Its scale and the international community's dismissive attitude toward the plight of vulnerable Afghans is shameful. Pakistan, home to 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees and some 700,000 undocumented Afghans, has begun to crack down on those refugees living in the country without permission. By the end of this year, as many as 360,000 could be forced to return to Afghanistan, if current rates hold, according to the United Nations refugee agency. This year's number of returnees is about four times higher than last year's. Among those caught in Pakistan's toughening stance is Sharbat Gula, the subject of a famous photo that was published on a cover of National Geographic magazine in 1985. That photo was taken at a refugee camp in Pakistan when she was about 12. Ms. Gula, now in her 40s, was recently arrested and deported back to Afghanistan because she had been living in Pakistan without legitimate papers. As Afghans become ever more hopeless about the future of their country, a rising number have set out on long and perilous journeys to Europe. Last year, 213,000 Afghans made it to Europe, where leaders have been grappling with the even larger influx of Syrians. While Syrians are not being forced to return home, European leaders last month struck a deal with the government of Afghanistan to establish a mechanism for the return of tens of thousands of Afghans who have failed to get asylum or legal residency in Europe. Under the deal, the Afghan government agreed to accept even citizens who fear for their safety if they were to return home. Those who go back home, often having spent all their money on smugglers, face grinding poverty and violence. Within the country, about 221,000 Afghans fled their homes between January and August, according to the United Nations. For many, the only option is to pitch a tent in one of the country's bulging and poorly serviced refugee camps. The United Nations refugee agency has been making desperate pleas to donors for more assistance as winter approaches. Last month, it said it needed $181 million to cover basic operations in the months ahead. Fulfilling that need immediately is the least the international community can do. Beyond that, it will need to rethink its long-term approach to Afghan refugees and how to resettle more abroad in the years ahead. Online:  http://www.nytimes.com  ___ Nov. 9 China Daily on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Japan: As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi starts his three-day official visit to Japan on Thursday, he will be expecting to see the already close bilateral relationship rise to a new height, with several major deals set to be inked. Among them will be a civil nuclear cooperation agreement, which allows Japan to export its nuclear plant technologies to India, and one on India's purchase of 12 amphibious rescue aircraft from a Japanese manufacturer worth up to $1.6 billion. These deals are especially significant given that India has yet to ratify the international Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that the aircraft deal will be one of Japan's first sales of military equipment since it lifted a 50-year ban on arms exports. The very good personal chemistry between Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is said to have played a part in deepening relations between the two nations. It is reported that Modi is one of the few people Abe follows on Twitter. Modi, on his part, first visited Japan back when he was chief minister of India's Gujarat province. It would be just another diplomatic anecdote if it stopped there. Yet some have tried to describe the visit as a mutual effort by New Delhi and Tokyo to ""counter an assertive China"", or ""to keep a rising China in check"". They hope that an anti-China alliance could be forged between the world's second most populous nation and third-largest economy, because of China's longstanding territorial dispute with India and its spat with Japan over the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. People with such thinking have too simplistic an idea of international relations that are not a zero-sum game. Modi has always sought ""to lead India's foreign policy with its economic interests in mind"". And Japan's trade with India is still less than a quarter of that between India and China. China, as the top trade partner of both, is more than happy to see deepened economic, trade and political relations between its neighbors if they contribute to peace and stability in the region. While some in Japan may continue to trumpet ""the rule of law in the South China Sea"" or ""freedom and openness in the Indian and Pacific Oceans"", as Abe did with Modi in September on the sidelines of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos, Sino-Indian relations are strong enough to withstand differences and external interferences. Online:  https://usa.chinadaily.com.cn  ___ Nov. 9 The Dallas Morning News on why Donald Trump should be a statesman: Congratulations, Mr. Trump. You're hired. The presidency is the biggest job America has to offer, and come Jan. 20, it's yours. We wish you every success. All of us who live in this great nation depend on strong leadership from you now. In winning the election you have proved many millions of your supporters right. They said you heard their concerns, while Hillary Clinton and establishment figures in government, media and pop culture did not. We've questioned whether your temperament, experience and values are right for this office. We'd like nothing better than to be proved wrong. You made a strong start with your elegant victory speech early Wednesday. You pledged ""to bind the wounds of division"" and to be ""president for all Americans."" Those are noble goals, ones we share. As you build your Cabinet, we hope its members reflect those aspirations, that they indeed work with you in building a government that works for everyone. We, too, will use this time to consider anew what lessons we take from this long campaign and the results it produced on Election Day. Will establishment figures, from both the Democratic and Republican parties, who dismissed the concerns of Trump supporters re-examine their hostility, and look for ways to bridge cultural chasms? Now that the election is over, it's imperative that all Americans, including Republican leaders, broad-minded Democrats and Trump supporters alike, seek out their ""better angels"" and recommit to what's best for America. We exhort them to chart a way forward that truly will make Americans safe and secure, that will more equitably distribute economic prosperity, that will inspire free enterprise, personal liberty and a stronger sense of shared community. Mr. Trump, we call on you to show the way, to lead the country toward these broadly shared goals in ways consistent with the constitutional ideals that have served the United States for more than two centuries. That will take selflessness and leadership by example to build unity and equal opportunity. We are going to be hopeful. We are going to be aspirational for you and for our country. This election gives you the opportunity to prove yourself a statesman. We very much hope you do. Online:  http://www.dallasnews.com/  ___ Nov. 10 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Trump and Obama's Thursday meeting: President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump met face-to-face and shook hands for the first time Thursday. First time ever. A worried American public needed badly to witness this moment and be reassured that a peaceful, respectful transfer of power will happen. The meeting had high potential to be tense and uncomfortable, given their years of animosity. Perhaps because of the possibility of confrontation, schedulers had initially planned for a light, 10-minute get-together. Instead, it turned into a 90-minute discussion delving into substantive national and international issues. Thursday's meeting was perhaps the most sobering one of Trump's life. No one can enter the Oval Office without being struck by the awesome responsibility of the president's job. Trump now receives the same daily, top-secret briefings that Obama receives from CIA and National Security Agency officials. This newspaper, like every major metropolitan daily in the country, had strongly opposed the notion of a Trump presidency. When Tuesday's election results came in, our initial reaction was that the nation was headed for disaster. Protesters have taken to the streets threatening violence and insisting that Trump is ""not my president."" To them we say: Get over it. The nation cannot continue the kinds of destructive sniping that dominated the campaign -- sniping that, yes, this newspaper participated in. Thursday's meeting provided some very necessary reassurance that the world around us isn't going to collapse. Trump can, if he works at it, be presidential. It truly is time for Americans to set aside the rancor and harsh words. For Obama, the meeting was a chance to show his human face to Trump, an opponent who spent many years treating the president as an object of ridicule and illegitimacy. It was because of Trump's sustained public campaign challenging Obama's status as an American-born Christian that the president felt compelled to fight back hard, starting with a lengthy roasting of Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents dinner. It endured up to the last day of campaigning this week. Some say it was the humiliation of Obama's roasting that motivated Trump to run for president. They never had a chance to clear the air until Thursday. And because of Trump's penchant for off-the-cuff, abrasive comments during the campaign, there was little reason for Obama or the American public to see him in any light other than one of callous abrasiveness. We stand by our criticism of his offensive campaign rhetoric and believe he must repudiate it. He should make certain that his followers don't assume his election signals an open season on insulting and demeaning their fellow citizens, and noncitizens, with reckless abandon. Now, as president-elect, Trump has shown some recognition that it's time to assume a more dignified and statesmanlike demeanor. We sincerely hope what was on display Thursday marks Trump's new beginning. Online:  http://www.stltoday.com/  ___ Nov. 9 The Philadelphia Inquirer on division in America: At press time Tuesday night, the presidential election was going into extra innings, in a nail-biter that makes the seventh game of the World Series game feel like a nap. While we don't at this point know who won, what we do know is that many expectations were turned on their heads: mainly, that a bombastic, unqualified candidate with no record of public service with a disorganized, undisciplined organization and little support from his party was still able to attract votes at the same rate as a seasoned, experienced candidate who has prepared for this job much of her life. Throughout this campaign, much of the debate focused on the undecided voter, but in this case ""undecided"" meant that neither candidate held much appeal. Still, the high voting turnout numbers from Tuesday for two ""unpopular"" candidates suggests that people were indeed engaged in this election. Maybe that's not so surprising, and we suspect that one big motivator for the crowds at the polls was fear: Clearly, those who voted for Donald Trump bought into the fear that their candidate instilled in rally after rally: that America is no longer great, that we are a laughingstock, that immigrants are going to take over, and if they don't, the terrorists will. While Hillary Clinton's campaign reacted with a message of ""love trumps hate,"" and sold unity with ""Stronger Together,"" the fact is that Democrats also capitalized on fear to galvanize voters: the fear of a Trump presidency. With no clear winner apparent late Tuesday night, we don't know which fear was the bigger motivator. So we'll talk about our fear: that the United States of America is less united than we'd like to believe. We fear that there are two Americas: one America that is inclusive, progressive, and looks to the future, and another America that is suspicious of outsiders, wants to return to a simpler time that no longer exists (if it ever did) and that is restrictive of human, civil, and reproductive rights. A companion fear: that this country could be forfeiting the leadership role it has held in the world since World War II, with an unstable leader at its head. As Tuesday night's electoral map was filled in with results, what was striking was how the nation's divisions appear to be equal in size. And among the jobs faced by whoever is the final winner of this strange, painfully long election, this will be the most important: finding and building more bridges between these two separate countries. Forget the actual problems of our roads, highways and bridges - the infrastructure of our democracy needs the most work of all. Unfortunately, we believe that only one of the candidates is open to that task. Online:  http://www.philly.com/  Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

3	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/09/one-unusual-election-doesnt-disprove-everything-we-know-about-campaigns/	One unusual election doesn’t disprove everything we know about campaigns	"   Donald Trump gestures as he speaks at his election-night rally in New York City on Nov. 8. (Mike Segar/Reuters)  Michael Wolff is a media columnist who now writes for the Hollywood Reporter. I couldn't say to what extent he knows anything in particular about politics, but I can say, without qualification, that he doesn't know anything about political campaigns. Wolff ground out a column on Wednesday arguing in the sweeping fashion of the practiced scold that The Media(tm) at large is to blame for the presidency of Donald Trump. The broad reason, in his articulation, is that the media at which he constantly rails was, on this occasion, too smug for its own good. There's a hilarious irony in that, in part because Wolff's column is the sort of knee-jerk, hyperreactive know-it-allism that was sprinkled throughout social media this morning as the equal and opposite reaction to people who claimed to have a sense of where the election was going. So here's Wolff, opining on how The Media(tm) erred in the Time of Trump. ""It was the day the data died,"" he says of the electoral results. ""All of the money poured by a financially challenged media industry into polls and polling analysis was for naught. It profoundly misinformed. It created a compelling and powerful narrative that was the opposite of what was actually happening."" The subhead takes this idea to another level, echoing sentiment that's been pervasive in the wake of Trump's victory. ""Ads don't work, polls don't work, celebrities don't work, media endorsements don't work and ground games don't work,"" it says. This is not only premature, it's stupid. On Tuesday, there were 10 times as many elections for the House of Representatives as there have been elections in the entire history of presidential politics. There were another few dozen Senate races, a bunch of gubernatorial races, hundreds of state legislature races and thousands of other things on the ballot from local candidacies to statewide ballot initiatives. Some huge proportion of those efforts relied on ads, polls, endorsements and ground games. (Few, we will admit, relied on celebrities -- but no one serious ever argued that celebrities did a whole lot anyway.) They relied on those things through a mixture of experience and superstition. In some cases, incumbents were doing what they'd always done, whether or not it was ideal; in others, candidates were doing what's been shown, time and again, to work. There's a lot of money spent in politics, as we readily admit in other contexts, and there's been a lot of research, both corporate and academic, into how that money can or should be best spent. Read The Monkey Cage every once in a while. There's some spaghetti-at-the-wall stuff, but there's also a lot of demonstrable positive effects for candidates who lack the immediate name recognition of a Hillary Clinton or a Trump. Wolff's goal here is to complain about the media because that's unerringly what he does. Fine. He heard a thing about data and looped that in, but really the point is that the media is full of itself. But he's wrong about the data. It is the case that national poll data consistently suggested that Clinton would be elected the next president of the United States. It is also the case that she was not. But it is not the case that the national polls missed widely. All of the ballots haven't yet been counted, but it's nearly certain that Clinton's popular vote lead will grow. (There are a lot of ballots still to be counted in California, our biggest, bluest state.) As it does, the extent to which national polls got the result wrong will narrow. They showed Clinton with a lead of a little over three points. She'll probably end up winning by about two points. The problem for her is that her lead was built in states that were already solidly red or blue.   National polls will wind up being **more accurate** than they were in 2012:2012: Obama up 1, won by 42014: Clinton up 3-4, will win by 1-2 -- Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 9, 2016   Where polls were further from the mark was at the state level. This likely happened for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there simply weren't a lot of state polls for much of the election. I'm not ready to declare polling an unalloyed success, by any stretch, but late polls showed much closer races in swing states than President Obama saw in 2012. Thanks to an unbalanced voter turnout that worked to Trump's favor, those swing states swung his way. Our automated tool showed a near tie Tuesday afternoon; a Trump-favorable electorate flipped the math of the electoral college. It's indisputable that Trump didn't spend much on television ads, didn't get many newspaper endorsements, lost the debates, didn't seem to care much about traditional get-out-the-vote efforts and seemed apathetic about polling. But that doesn't mean those things are useless. After all, Trump did advertise, spending millions on digital ads that were aimed at bolstering turnout efforts. We're going to be hearing about those ads for some time to come, no doubt, but he also spent on television late in the cycle. He didn't invest much in field efforts, but the Republican Party picked up some or most of that slack. He wasn't without a turnout operation. He may have been indifferent to polling, but he still polled, with reports on Tuesday night suggesting that his internal numbers also misread the electoral wave that was coming. Over the next few months (years), people directly and tangentially related to Trump's effort will make the case that they've Cracked the Code of winning a modern campaign. Politicians, as I noted earlier, are both superstitious and often subject to snake-oil tactics. There will be a buyer's market on anyone peddling the idea that they helped Trump get over the finish line, just as there was for anyone with ""Obama For America"" on their resume in 2009. Some of those folks will have deserved to make the case they cracked the code, to some extent. Most won't -- but the narrative will spread. And maybe they did crack the code! But we should come back to the original point: This was one weird, high-profile election out of thousands. It featured two exceptionally well-known and exceptionally disliked candidates facing off in the first national contest in an era of social media maturity. It very well could be the case that the new media landscape will undercut past practices for campaigns. This one contest doesn't prove that, though, especially given the extent to which Trump gleefully broke the established rules in a way that it's hard to see other politicians doing. The race wasn't necessarily sui generis, but we also don't know that Trump created a new way that will be effective for others. It has been 12 hours. Twelve hours is a very short period of time during which to decide that all polling is bad and all data is bad and everything that Clinton did was wrong. That is particularly the case if political campaigns are not your area of expertise."

"    President Obama arrives for a private game of basketball at Fort McNair in Washington on Nov. 8. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)   He already voted early back home in Chicago, so all that was left for President Obama on Election Day was to take part in the ritual he had observed with his own name on the ballot -- a pickup basketball game -- and to make a final pitch to the electorate. ""Go vote. It's up to you,"" Obama said Tuesday, pointing at television news cameras during a stroll along the White House colonnade after returning from the game at Fort McNair. A reporter asked the president, who has campaigned intensively for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whether he was nervous about the outcome.  [Live updates: Election 2016 and race results]  ""As long as the American people vote, I think we'll do a good job,"" he replied. ""I hope everybody's voted early. If not, get out there."" Obama then disappeared into the White House, but his last-minute get-out-the-vote effort had not yet finished. Aides said he taped interviews with six radio stations in three swing states -- Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio -- imploring people to get to the polls.      President Obama brought his tried-and-true campaign slogans and humor-filled attacks on Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton's defense in the final days of the presidential campaign. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   As the election results began to come in Tuesday night, however, it appeared that Obama's frantic final campaigning for Clinton might not be enough to avoid a monumental upset to Republican nominee Donald Trump. Called upon as a chief surrogate for a candidate who has struggled to make a personal connection with voters, Obama had put his suddenly robust approval ratings and star power to work for Clinton with increasing urgency in the final weeks in a bid to boost Democratic turnout with his own legacy on the line. But the early election results told another story. First Florida, which Obama had won in 2008 and 2012, fell out of Clinton's grasp. Then North Carolina, where Obama, who won in 2008 before narrowly losing in 2012, had warned supporters just last week that ""the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders.""  Late into the night, Wisconsin looked grim for Clinton, and even Michigan, in which Obama had bragged of bailing out the auto industry during an emergency campaign stop Monday in Ann Arbor, was in danger. It was a stunning twist of fortune for Clinton, but also for the president.  Obama had pounded the lectern and wagged his finger, given stern instructions and laughed easily, introduced new lines and brought back old ones. When the crowds have called, ""We love you!"" he still has said, ""Love you back"" -- but has made quite clear he has an ask. ""Tomorrow, you will choose whether we continue this journey of progress,"" he told the crowd at the University of Michigan, ""or whether it all goes out the window."" Sixteen times over the past two months, Obama had delivered his stump speech for Clinton -- including three times on Monday in a final swing through Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. He and his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, had fanned out across the radio and television airways for dozens of interviews, many with stations targeting African American audiences. All told, the president attended 72 fundraising events over two years on behalf of Clinton and the Democratic Party, according to party operatives. ""I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,"" Obama told a Congressional Black Caucus gala in a fiery speech in September. ""You want to give me a good send-off? Go vote.""  [Obama's Legacy: An interactive museum of his presidency]  For Obama, who said during his State of the Union address in January that his chief regret is that political polarization has become worse, the campaign appearances offered him a final chance to convince the public that his brand of political optimism would outlast the bitterness and ugly tone of the 2016 campaign season.      Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win View Graphic     Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win  But the president acknowledged the skepticism that it would not. At a rally with 33,000 Clinton supporters on Philadelphia's Independence Mall on Monday night, Obama told the crowd that a journalist had asked him last week whether he still believed in the politics of ""hope"" on which he campaigned in 2008. ""Maybe your vision was misguided -- or at least very naive,"" the reporter had suggested, according to Obama. The president considered the question out loud for a moment, ruminating over a social-media discourse that sows partisanship and an unbalanced economic system that has left many Americans more skeptical about their futures. ""Despite all that, I told him the answer is, 'Yes, I still believe in hope,' "" Obama declared. ""I'm still as optimistic as ever."" It has not been an easy sell. Obama's personal approval ratings, comfortably above 50 percent, are at some of the highest levels since his first year in office. But Clinton and Trump are saddled with far worse approval ratings and even lower levels of public trust. Which is why Obama's last campaign had been, at heart, less about Clinton and more about his personal connection with the supporters who propelled his unlikely rise. ""I have seen again and again your goodness and your strength and your heart,"" Obama told the crowd in Philadelphia. ""In 2008, you gave me a chance -- a skinny guy with a funny name. . . . America, I'm betting on you one more time.""  [Changing demographics could decide election result]  Obama used his final barnstorming trip as a chance to thank his supporters and remind them of the high stakes, and he did so with notes of defiance about the prospect of a Trump presidency, and a touch of nostalgia about his own waning tenure in the White House. ""I'm feeling a little sentimental,"" Obama told a crowd of 9,000 on his first stop, at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.    President Obama campaigns for Hillary Clinton at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich. (Carlos Osorio/AP)  He wasn't the only one. More than eight years after they crowded into staff vans to canvass for votes in rural Iowa, several long-serving White House senior aides joined the president aboard Air Force One for one more get-out-the-vote effort. ""The election of the next president is the clearest, most tangible sign that this presidency is about to end,"" said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who knocked on doors for Obama in Iowa in 2007. ""It's a moment for reflection."" The nostalgia was flowing heavily in both directions. On Obama's second stop Monday, at the University of New Hampshire, a supporter in the crowd of 7,600 held up a blue sign from the president's 2012 reelection campaign. ""Four more years!"" someone else shouted. Others, especially in the African American community, have urged Michelle Obama to consider a run for political office. She has demurred. But the mother of two teenage daughters has become perhaps the Democratic Party's most potent messenger in making a personal case against Trump as a dangerous role model. Her use of the Obama family motto -- ""When they go low, we go high"" -- during the Democratic National Convention in July became a rallying cry.  [Long lines, intimidation and machine breakdowns reported across the country]  The president told his college audiences that the election amounted to a referendum on the progress of the past eight years. ""C'mon, man,"" he declared sarcastically on several occasions in exasperation at the notion that Trump could be taken seriously, given his lewd comments about women and insults against racial minorities. Offering a refresher course for students who were perhaps too young to remember much about the state of the nation when he took office, Obama recited a litany of accomplishments: rescuing the economy from the Great Recession, bailing out the auto industry, passing a landmark health-care law, killing al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. When the crowd booed a mention of Trump, the president recycled a 2012 campaign refrain: ""Don't boo -- vote!"" Trump ""can't hear you boo, but he can hear you vote,"" the president said, jabbing a finger in the air. Throughout the campaign, the president warned against complacency. Winding up his remarks in New Hampshire, Obama retold the story of how he was inspired during a low moment in his 2008 campaign by the chant of a diminutive county council member in Greenwood, S.C., named Edith Childs who was known to energize a room by shouting, ""Fired up! Ready to go!""    First lady Michelle Obama, President Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton greet supporters during a campaign rally on Independence Mall in Philadelphia. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  Emphasizing the power of a single voice to make a difference, Obama implored his audience to go to the polls: ""Let's go finish what we started."" But, before it was time to vote, there was one final stop in Philadelphia, where a sea of supporters was waiting for a final glimpse of the first couple. The Obamas did not disappoint. The first lady took a moment to tell the crowd ""how proud I am of all that he has done for this country,"" and the president responded by calling her ""my partner, my love, my rock."" Before long, however, they ceded the stage to Clinton. And when the rally was over, and the Democratic nominee headed off to another rally in North Carolina, the Obamas did not go with her. The presidential motorcade returned to the airport and the first couple ascended the stairs of Air Force One, which lifted into the night sky, leaving the crowds behind.

The Republican presidential nominee also continued to raise doubts about the integrity of the election system, warning of possible voter fraud as his campaign sought an investigation into early voting hours in battleground Nevada. While familiar charges from an unorthodox candidate, the Election Day statements challenged bedrock principles of American democracy: fair and free elections and the clean transfer of power They come as Trump eyes a challenging path to the 270 electoral needed for victory, although both sides paint the picture of a very close election that will likely come down to a handful of swing states.  ""We're going to see how things play out,"" Trump said on Fox News when asked if he would accept the election results. ""I want to see everything honest."" He offered a similarly non-committal answer earlier in the day as he cast voted in Manhattan. He noted he's ""always concerned"" about voter fraud when asked about the issue. The GOP nominee was joined by his wife, Melania, his daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his granddaughter Arabella while voting at a public school on Manhattan's East Side. He was booed loudly by onlookers gathered on the sidewalks outside of the school, which had been sealed off with police barricades. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in America. Such claims have become a regular part of Trump's warnings of a ""rigged election"" -- a central argument from an outsider candidate who has repeatedly challenged the norms of presidential politics. Trump's outsider status has both hurt and helped him over the last year. His political inexperience allowed him to cast himself as a change agent just as frustrated voters in both parties seemed hungry for change. The message was particularly effective against Clinton, a fixture in public service over the last three decades. Yet Trump's inexperience also fueled a series of self-created controversies, whether a days-long public feud with the parents of a slain soldier or late-night tweet storm citing a beauty queen's ""sex tape."" He insulted opponents from both parties in unusually personal terms, lowering the bar for political discourse in a way never seen before on the national stage. And he was unwilling to embrace the less-glamorous grunt work that typically defines successful campaigns. The Republican outsider did little to collect data on prospective supporters. He had no significant staffing presence on the ground in key states. And he refused to invest in a major advertising campaign to keep pace with Clinton. Ever the showman, his strategy relied almost exclusively on massive rallies to connect with voters. He has filled sports arenas, airport hangars and conference centers from Iowa to Michigan to Florida, often with little notice and little organization. Trump fell $34 million short of his false boast that he spent $100 million of his own money on his election. Publicly available fundraising reports show he put up about $66 million.  ""It was really hard to vote for Donald Trump,"" said Debra Sindler of Savannah, Georgia. The 60-year-old real estate agent said she continued to wrestle with even as she walked to the polls. ""I would have never voted for Hillary. And I voted for Donald Trump because I'm concerned about the Supreme Court,"" Sindler said. After voting, Trump spent most of the day behind closed doors, attending a reception with friends and family in the Manhattan skyscraper where he lives and works before heading to a Midtown hotel for his election night party. ___ Peoples reported from Washington.

Campaigns for governor shattered fundraising records in Missouri, drew national attention over transgender bathroom rights in North Carolina and took an unusual twist in Indiana, where Gov. Mike Pence pulled out to become the running mate of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The governors' contests are part of a battle for statehouse supremacy that also includes nearly 6,000 state legislative elections. Heading into Tuesday, Republicans controlled more than two-thirds of the nation's legislative chambers, as well as 31 of the 50 governors' offices. Eight of the 12 governorships up for election are currently held by Democrats. The states in play Tuesday include: ___ NORTH CAROLINA In the nation's highest-profile race, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory faces a strong challenge from Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper. The race has become a referendum on North Carolina's rightward shift under McCrory, highlighted by a law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and directs transgender people to use public restrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates. Cooper has vowed to try to repeal the law as governor. Recent flooding from Hurricane Matthew has also played into the race, as McCrory has been at the public forefront of response and recovery efforts. ___ MISSOURI Former Navy SEAL officer Eric Greitens, a first-time candidate, is locked in a close contest against Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster. Greitens has capitalized on his military service and his work as founder of the veterans' charity known as The Mission Continues. He casts himself as an outsider going up against a career politician. Koster, a former Republican state senator, has picked up key endorsements from the National Rifle Association and major agricultural groups. Including primary candidates, Missouri governors' campaigns have raised more than $72 million, easily doubling the previous record. The winner will succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon. ___ INDIANA When Pence dropped his re-election bid in July, Republicans tapped Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb as their new nominee to run against Democrat John Gregg, a former state House speaker. Gregg has cast Holcomb as a ""rubber stamp"" for Pence, pointing out Holcomb's support for a religious-objections law that Pence signed. Opponents said the law, which was later revised, sanctioned discrimination against same-sex couples by allowing businesses to refuse to serve them. Holcomb has highlighted his time as an aide to Pence's popular predecessor, Gov. Mitch Daniels, and seeks to continue a 12-year-run of Republican governors. ___ NEW HAMPSHIRE The governor's office is open because Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan is trying to oust Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The race to replace her features two members of the governor's Executive Council -- Democrat Colin Van Ostern and Republican Chris Sununu, the son of former Gov. John H. Sununu and the brother of former U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu. Democrats have controlled the governor's office for 18 of the past 20 years, but this year's race has been a closely contested undercard in this presidential battleground. ___ VERMONT Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Scott faces Democrat Sue Minter in what Republicans view as their best pick-up opportunity. Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin is not seeking another two-year term. Scott is currently the only Republican statewide officeholder in a liberal-leaning state but has tacked to the left by embracing abortion rights and gay marriage. Minter is a former transportation secretary for Shumlin. Under Vermont law, if neither candidate gets a majority of votes, the winner is decided by the state Legislature. ___ WEST VIRGINIA With Trump expected to easily win in West Virginia, the question is how long his coattails will reach. Republican candidate Bill Cole, the state Senate president, has linked himself closely to Trump and his pledge to revive the coal industry. But that seeming advantage is somewhat offset by Democratic nominee Jim Justice, himself a coal billionaire. Justice, like Trump, has cast himself as a political outsider adept at creating jobs. Republicans have made an issue of Justice's unpaid business taxes. ___ MONTANA Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock faces a challenge from Republican Greg Gianforte, a businessman who struck it rich when he sold his cloud-based software firm to Oracle five years ago. Gianforte has poured millions of his own money into the race, airing more TV ads than all other statewide executive candidates in the nation, according to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity of data from the tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. Bullock has been heavily aided by the Democratic Governors Association. ___ OTHER STATES Republican Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah and Democratic Govs. Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington were all expected to turn back challenges Tuesday. In Delaware, Democratic U.S. Rep. John Carney Jr. was favored to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Jack Markell. And in North Dakota, Republican businessman Doug Burgum was favored to succeed Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple, who is not seeking re-election. ___ Follow David A. Lieb at: http://twitter.com/DavidALieb . Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  Donald Trump's campaign will be remembered for many reasons, not the least of which is his tenuous relationship to the truth. PolitiFact has repeatedly documented Trump's unprecedented rate of false claims and in 2015 named him the recipient of the Lie of the Year Award. Despite this, Trump's support remains high in many states even as some of the most important Republican leaders have turned their backs on him. This has left many experts puzzled. Why do so many people continue to support Trump in the face of these false claims? Many commentators have noted what Thomas Edsall has called the ""great democratic inversion,"" where voters have become more polarized by education -- with less-educated voters gravitating to Trump. But focusing only on education obscures another key factor: whether voters have lower levels of knowledge about politics and less interest in using ideas to understand politics. These attributes do not simply reflect voters' level of formal education. Our research finds that Trump has attracted a disproportionate (and unprecedented) number of ""low-information voters"" to his campaign. Furthermore, these voters are more likely to respond to emotional appeals -- whether about the economy, immigration, Muslims, racial relations, sexism, and even hostility to the first African American U.S. president, Barack Obama. They are the ideal constituency for a candidate like Trump. We define low-information voters as those who do not know certain basic facts about government and lack what psychologists call a ""need for cognition."" Those with a high need for cognition have a positive attitude toward tasks that require reasoning and effortful thinking and are, therefore, more likely to invest the time and resources to do so when evaluating complex issues. Those with a low need for cognition, on the other hand, find little reward in the collection and evaluation of new information when it comes to problem solving and the consideration of competing issue positions. They are more likely to rely on cognitive shortcuts, such as ""experts"" or other opinion leaders, for cues. Drawing on data from the 2016 American National Election Studies Pilot Studies, we measured the need for cognition based on whether respondents agreed or disagreed that ""Thinking is not my idea of fun"" and ""I would rather do something that requires little thought than something that is sure to challenge my thinking abilities."" We measured knowledge of government based on a question asking how long senators' terms were and a question on which of four policy areas the government spends the least (the answer was foreign aid; the other options were Medicare, national defense and Social Security). We focused our analysis on whites because nonwhites were not supporting Trump in sufficient numbers.        Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made a campaign stop at at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich., on Monday. There, rally-goers said they believe some voters have been quiet about their support for Trump but they will make their voices heard on election day. (Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post)   Both of these measures were correlated with how much whites liked Trump, relative to Hillary Clinton, This was true even after accounting for education, income, age, gender, partisanship and ideology. For example, we found that people who did not know either of these questions about government evaluated Trump 20 points more favorably than Clinton, compared with those who knew both of those questions. This was not true in 2012: Knowledge of politics had little relationship with people's views of Mitt Romney and Obama. Similarly, people who expressed less ""need for cognition"" evaluated Trump 12 points more favorably than Clinton, while those who expressed more need for cognition evaluated the two candidates roughly equally. We also found that the effect of political knowledge and need for cognition may affect support for Trump via association with concern about the economy and attitudes toward Muslims, African Americans and immigrants. This suggests that voters who know less about politics may be attracted to Trump for these reasons, which also helps explain why they continue to support him in the face of his many mistruths. If they are willing to believe that Obama is a Muslim and that Muslims are inherently violent, for example, why wouldn't they believe that the election is ""rigged""? To be sure, we should use caution in interpreting these findings. These data are from January 2016, and Trump's support may well have shifted. He has lost ground among women in particular. Yet, his core constituency has proven remarkably stable. It is also important to note that ""low-information voters"" are not the entirety of Trump's base of support. They are, however, a sizable bloc. People have many good reasons for being mad about how the established political leadership has failed them, whether it is on trade deals, jobs, inequality, health care or other issues. Trump appeals to many of the disaffected. Nonetheless, a core part of his base is made up of low-information voters who appear more susceptible to Trump's appeals based on race and religion and less prepared to challenge his misstatements and untruths.

Wait, what?	"   Vladimir Putin on vacation in southern Siberia in 2009. (Alexsey Druginyn/Agence France-Press via Getty Images)  The dust has settled on Russia's latest legislative elections, held Sept. 18. United Russia, the party of President Vladimir Putin, won big, securing three-fourths of the seats. That's its highest share since the party was created in the early 2000s -- and it's more than enough to change Russia's constitution. No seats went to any of the real opposition. Lots of Russia observers have been speculating on how this happened and what it means for Russia. But few have paid much attention to how gender affected the elections. More women ran for office -- and that brought in more sexism. Over the last decade, Putin's Russia has simultaneously promoted women into politics while becoming more misogynist, as research shows. Here's what that means.   [Trump helps Putin -- and all dictators -- when he says U.S. elections are rigged]   Why has the Putin regime been recruiting women? In the months leading up to the 2007 elections, all major political parties increased the proportion of women on their party lists, with United Russia having almost 1 out of 5 for the 2011 elections. (In the 2007 and 2011 elections, all deputies were elected through proportional representation, where voters choose parties, not candidates, with the parties selecting the politicians to put in office.) This emphasis quickly produced results. Russia's Duma had its highest proportion of women to date with 14 percent female participation in 2007, dropping only slightly in the 2011 elections. In the upper house, the unelected Federation Council, Valentina Matvienko was made chair in 2011. Over the next few years, the proportion of women in the council more than tripled. The influx of women into the legislatures was matched by other increases, with prominent women in the executive branch, a woman at the head of Russia's central bank, and increasing numbers of female governors.    Percent women in formal legislaturesData: IPU; Figure: Janet Elise Johnson  This is not to say that the regime is feminist, by any means. Russia has not passed even the weak gender-equality legislation that has been under consideration for more than a decade. This summer, activists barely averted the decriminalization of battery, which domestic-violence victims use because there is no specific domestic-violence legislation.   [Putin made recent Duma elections the most tightly controlled in recent history]   Rather, women are being recruited into Russian politics to suit the needs of the regime. In the past two elections, some women have been used as ""showgirls,"" including a ballerina, a rhythmic gymnast and a former Playboy model, to attract voters. Other elite women have been recruited as ""political cleaners,"" a role especially for governors, to clean up the appearance of corruption. As one commentator told me, ""There is the perception that women are less corrupt."" In these apparently plum posts, women's power is quite limited. Once elected, the showgirls are portrayed at the Duma -- their workplace -- as being kissed on the hand by their male counterparts, putting on makeup or acting beautiful and silly. Most women in the Russian legislature strive to be ""ultimate loyalists"" who advocate nondemocratic (and often sexist or homophobic) legislation to protect the regime, overcompensating to try to save their hides. For example, Irina Yarovaya co-authored the law calling for NGOs with foreign funding to be labeled as ""foreign agents."" After advocating for women in the Duma during the 2000s, Yelena Mizulina has been championing restrictions on abortion, bans on ""gay propaganda"" and decriminalization of domestic violence. New roles for women in 2016? The importance of women for the 2016 elections was first highlighted in March, when Putin appointed Ella Pamfilova as head of the Central Electoral Commission. With a history of human rights advocacy, Pamfilova established new mechanisms for overseeing the elections and promised to resign if the elections weren't fair. Pamfilova, like other women, was used as a political cleaner, to create the appearance of cleaner elections, even as the Kremlin engineered a stronger grip on the Duma.   [Americans hate the Islamic State more than Putin or Assad. That matters for the elections.]   In the elections themselves, 23 percent of candidates were women. Estimated results are that 66 of the 450 Duma deputies will be women, the highest percentage in post-communist Russian history. Women were especially important, it seems, because the electoral rules changed for these elections. Half of the Duma was elected through proportional representation and half in single mandates that resemble legislative elections in the United States, with one candidate per district. This meant a lot more campaigning. As one of my insider informants explained, women are considered well-suited to winning such elections, being ""reliable, talkative and attractive"" while ""men tend to appear to loathe their constituents."" The most prominent showgirl was Natalia Poklonskaya. Poklonaksaya, once a Ukrainian citizen, changed sides when Crimea was annexed in 2014. Putin appointed her the general prosecutor of Crimea for Russia, a job where she gained attention as a Russian nationalist and sex symbol.   [Here's how attention to gender affected Colombia's peace process]   Meanwhile, Putin's regime used explicit sexism against the opposition. LifeNews, a tabloid with links to the Kremlin, published nude pictures of a Moscow member of the opposition and her (female) chief of staff. Such compromising materials (or kompromat, as the Russians call it) are used against men as well, but are sexist in different ways, often alleging abuse of office, disloyalty or incompetence while questioning the candidate's sexual behavior, orientation or masculinity. This is, of course, is the flip side of the frequent masculinity stunts by Putin -- earning him commendation by U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump and punk protests by Pussy Riot. In all this, Russia is like other authoritarian-leaning regimes where there have been marked increases in women in politics in the last decade, such as Algeria, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, and like the Soviet regime before it: It has learned how to subvert the connection between the increase of women in politics and gender equality.
