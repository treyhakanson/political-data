Royal Dutch Shell walked away from exploratory drilling in U.S. Arctic waters, and the Obama administration has taken steps to keep drill rigs out of Alaska's northern ocean for years to come. (AP/Elaine Thompson)  The Obama administration on Friday banned offshore drilling in the Arctic, setting a likely collision course with President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to ""unleash"" new energy production in the United States by rolling back restrictions on oil and gas companies. The move by the Interior Department, part of a new five-year plan for energy development in federal waters, would put a temporary end to exploration in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off the Alaskan coast. It also dropped plans to allow companies to drill for oil and natural gas in the Atlantic Ocean off of four southeastern states, including Virginia. ""The plan focuses on lease sales in the best places -- those with highest resource potential, lowest conflict, and established infrastructure -- and removes regions that are simply not right to lease,"" Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement Friday. ""Given the unique and challenging Arctic environment and industry's declining interest in the area, forgoing lease sales in the Arctic is the right path forward."" The areas off Alaska currently are considered by big oil companies to be too expensive to explore given low crude prices, the steep expenses of drilling in icy waters and the costly failure by Royal Dutch Shell to discover oil in 2015 after years of preparation. Shell spent more than $7 billion, and in the end the hole it drilled was virtually dry.   [Shell's big gamble: Oil wrangling on the Arctic frontier]   Even if the economics of Arctic drilling improve and a Trump administration wants to reopen the area to exploration, both oil company officials and environmental groups say, Trump would be unable to toss out the five-year plan immediately. To undo the Obama administration's ban, a new administration would have to prepare a supplemental report, which could take as long as two years, depending on whether it needs to prepare a new environmental impact statement. After that, the federal government would have to organize a lease sale for companies interested in drilling there. Environmental groups were quick to praise the Obama administration's action on Friday, even as they argued that there should be a permanent ban on Arctic drilling. Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice president for the marine-advocacy group Oceana, said the decision ""demonstrates a commitment to prioritizing common sense, economics and science ahead of industry favoritism and politics as usual."" She added, ""The decades-long push to drill in the Arctic has put this unique and diverse ecosystem at risk, cost tens of billions of dollars and created significant controversy without providing the promised benefits."" Lois Epstein, an Alaska-licensed engineer and Arctic program director for the Wilderness Society, argued that drilling in the Arctic is expensive and ultimately unnecessary. ""This oil is not needed because there likely will be ample world oil supply available for many years,"" she said, ""and the trans-Alaska pipeline system has enough oil throughput to operate for the next half-century."" Meanwhile, representatives of the oil and gas industry called the decision a short-sighted one that could cost American jobs. ""Our national energy security depends on our ability to produce oil and natural gas here in the U.S., and this decision could very well increase the cost of energy for American consumers and close the door on creating new jobs and new investments for years,"" said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute. ""We are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this decision.""   [Obama pulls plans to allow oil drilling off southern Atlantic coast]   Alaska's all-Republican congressional delegation also slammed the decision to strip leases from the government's five-year plan, saying it would prevent access to vast resources that could help grow the economy. ""We have shown that Arctic development is one of the best ways to create jobs, generate revenues, and refill the Trans-Alaska Pipeline,"" Sen. Lisa Murkowsi (R-Alaska), said in a statement, adding that she was ""infuriated"" by the Obama administration's decision. ""Why the president is willing to send all of those benefits overseas is beyond explanation."" The Interior Department on Friday said that in crafting its five-year oil-and-gas leasing plan, it had considered 3.3 million public comments and held three dozen public meetings. The final plan, which will dictate offshore drilling through 2022, offers 11 potential leases for sale off the nation's coasts. Ten of those are in the Gulf of Mexico, and one is off the coast of Alaska in the Cook Inlet area, near Anchorage. ""The proposal makes available more than 70 percent of the economically recoverable resources, which is ample opportunity for oil and gas development to meet the nation's energy needs,"" Abigail Hopper, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said in announcing the plan Friday. If the federal government ever does reopen the Arctic to drilling, one company that might be interested is Caelus, a privately-held, Dallas-based firm that has found new reserves of oil in the Oooguruk field on the North Slope of Alaska in state waters. If the field stretches beyond the three-mile limit of state waters, Caelus would need a federal lease to tap those reserves. Environmental groups are also worried about a possible push by the Trump administration to open up the Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge, a vast area of northeastern Alaska that so far has been off limits to oil and gas companies. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has been a persistent advocate of opening up the refuge, but other lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) have favored protecting the area. Opening up the refuge to drilling would require legislation in Congress. The state of Alaska has been watching all this carefully, in part because new supplies of petroleum would help fill both the state's coffers and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which is logistically challenged by a decline in crude oil production in Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's north coast. Production at Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field in North America and among the 20 largest fields in the world, peaked in 1987 and has dropped sharply in recent years. The U.S. Geological Survey in 1998 estimated that there could be as much as 5.7 billion to 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil within Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge, including state and Native American areas.      Donald Trump will enter the White House with an environmental policy agenda opposed to that of the Obama administration and many other nations that have pledged support to the Paris climate agreement.

Bannon, left, chief strategist to President-elect Donald Trump, is shown during a roundtable at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Aug. 25. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)  The Hollywood Reporter is out with a new profile of President-elect Donald Trump's chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and it features plenty of colorful quotes. One quote, in particular, sticks out. And it's liable to make House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) choke on his cheese curds: ""Like [Andrew] Jackson's populism, we're going to build an entirely new political movement,"" [Bannon] says. ""It's everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy. I'm the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it's the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We're just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution -- conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement."" That $1 trillion price tag on Bannon's infrastructure plan isn't exactly news; when CNBC hosts threw out the number $500 billion during an August interview, Trump said, ""You need a lot more than that to do it right."" And he said in his most recent book that infrastructure problems require ""a trillion-dollar rebuilding program."" Trump has also echoed Bannon's rhetoric about borrowing extensively to make it happen. He said in that CNBC interview: ""The interest rates are so low, I mean, the numbers are so low, that yes this is a time to borrow and borrow long-term. So that we have the money and rebuild our infrastructure."" And top Trump economic adviser Tom Barrack has suggested this borrowing could add $10 trillion to the current $19 trillion national debt.      The Post's Robert Costa and Paul Farhi discuss the appointments by President-elect Donald Trump of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor and Reince Priebus as chief of staff. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   As I've noted before, Trump is not a small-government Republican. He's shown a real willingness to spend heavily to Make America Great Again -- deficits and national debt be damned. But Bannon's quote really drives that home. While Trump's policy proposals have been known to oscillate depending on the day and his audience, this appears to be part of Bannon's grand vision for a Trump presidency. Bannon will be driving the bus. And not only does he talk about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure and borrowing extensively, he's also comparing what they're planning to do to the New Deal, which expanded the role of government in American life greatly. And he says ""conservatives are going to go crazy.""   [Trump's embrace of Bannon sparks divisions, angst among Jewish groups]   One of the more undersold questions of the new Trump presidency is precisely how much Ryan and other fiscal conservatives are going to go along with Trump's agenda if he does push for massive spending packages that aren't paid for -- because the scope of what Trump's talking about, despite his protesting to the controversy, can't merely be offset by cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse."" It will mean trillions in new debt. We pretty much know that Democrats are going to stand in the way of whatever Trump puts forward. But when it comes to things like massive infrastructure spending (that is nearly four times what Hillary Clinton was proposing, by the way), it's much easier to see Trump forging an alliance with them than getting fiscally conservative deficit hawks to come on board. Many of the congressional Republicans have been resolute when it comes to making sure President Obama's legislative priorities are paid for. If they take the same approach to Trump's presidency, there could be plenty of clashes ahead."

"  LONDON  For the United States and for Europe, the moment of reckoning has now arrived: The West as we know it is nearing the end of its life. The United States of America has just elected as president a man who not only brags about groping women and swindles his business partners but also openly dislikes America's traditional allies -- and Europeans most of all.  Don't take my word for it. Listen to what he has been saying for many, many years. As long ago as 2000, in his ghostwritten book ""The America We Deserve,"" Trump wrote that ""America has no vital interest in choosing between warring factions whose animosities go back centuries. . . . Their conflicts are not worth American lives. Pulling back from Europe would save this country millions of dollars annually. The cost of stationing NATO troops in Europe is enormous. And these are clearly funds that can be put to better use."" Throughout the election campaign, he has repeated these views over and over again, even as he has flip-flopped and changed his mind about almost everything else. On abortion, he can go either way, depending on his audience. He was for the Iraq War before he was against it. But on NATO -- and on Russia -- Trump never wavers. In March, he described NATO as ""obsolete."" In his first foreign policy speech, he proclaimed ""America First,"" using a famous isolationist slogan last heard in the 1940s. He has called for Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. At the same time, he has consistently praised the world's dictators, Russia's Vladimir Putin most of all. In 2014, he praised Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since then, he has spoken with admiration of Putin's ""strength,"" of his cruelty, even of his penchant for murdering journalists. Trump does not speak of Russia's economic decline or its fierce authoritarianism, perhaps because he does not know about them or perhaps because he does not care. His campaign received open assistance from Russia in the form of massive hacking and leaks, and he publicly called on Russia's security services to steal more.     In China, Russia and Israel we ask people what they think of the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States. We'll update this video as more voices come in. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)   Trump has also surrounded himself, from the beginning of his political career, with people linked to Putin, to Gazprom, and to Russian oligarchs. Newt Gingrich, the man who may be Trump's secretary of state and who is certainly a senior adviser, has recently described Estonia as a country ""in the suburbs of St. Petersburg"" and thus not worth defending. Whatever Trump says tomorrow or the next day, the doctrine of deterrence has been officially abandoned: It cannot be defended by a man who does not believe in it. A few weeks ago, I spoke at an event attended by commanders of land forces from all across Europe. To a man, they remained grimly committed to their job, which everyone in the room understood to be twofold: protect Europe from terrorism, and protect Europe from Russia. The meeting was led, as is natural in a NATO context, by American generals. Now we can no longer assume that American generals will always be leading such meetings. We also cannot assume that Russian military advances, or hybrid-warfare advances, into Ukraine or the Baltic states will be pushed back by an alliance of like-minded countries.  Under President Trump, we cannot assume that America is still the leader of the free world -- or the leader of anything. Protectionism, not free trade, has just won this election, and that will have consequences, too. We have to expect that transatlantic trade and transpacific trade treaties are not going to be passed. We have to assume that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be unpacked. Free trade had all kinds of consequences, but one of the advantages is that it kept countries closely linked politically as well as economically.

"  LONDON  For the United States and for Europe, the moment of reckoning has now arrived: The West as we know it is nearing the end of its life. The United States of America has just elected as president a man who not only brags about groping women and swindles his business partners but also openly dislikes America's traditional allies -- and Europeans most of all.  Don't take my word for it. Listen to what he has been saying for many, many years. As long ago as 2000, in his ghostwritten book ""The America We Deserve,"" Trump wrote that ""America has no vital interest in choosing between warring factions whose animosities go back centuries. . . . Their conflicts are not worth American lives. Pulling back from Europe would save this country millions of dollars annually. The cost of stationing NATO troops in Europe is enormous. And these are clearly funds that can be put to better use."" Throughout the election campaign, he has repeated these views over and over again, even as he has flip-flopped and changed his mind about almost everything else. On abortion, he can go either way, depending on his audience. He was for the Iraq War before he was against it. But on NATO -- and on Russia -- Trump never wavers. In March, he described NATO as ""obsolete."" In his first foreign policy speech, he proclaimed ""America First,"" using a famous isolationist slogan last heard in the 1940s. He has called for Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. At the same time, he has consistently praised the world's dictators, Russia's Vladimir Putin most of all. In 2014, he praised Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since then, he has spoken with admiration of Putin's ""strength,"" of his cruelty, even of his penchant for murdering journalists. Trump does not speak of Russia's economic decline or its fierce authoritarianism, perhaps because he does not know about them or perhaps because he does not care. His campaign received open assistance from Russia in the form of massive hacking and leaks, and he publicly called on Russia's security services to steal more.     In China, Russia and Israel we ask people what they think of the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States. We'll update this video as more voices come in. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)   Trump has also surrounded himself, from the beginning of his political career, with people linked to Putin, to Gazprom, and to Russian oligarchs. Newt Gingrich, the man who may be Trump's secretary of state and who is certainly a senior adviser, has recently described Estonia as a country ""in the suburbs of St. Petersburg"" and thus not worth defending. Whatever Trump says tomorrow or the next day, the doctrine of deterrence has been officially abandoned: It cannot be defended by a man who does not believe in it. A few weeks ago, I spoke at an event attended by commanders of land forces from all across Europe. To a man, they remained grimly committed to their job, which everyone in the room understood to be twofold: protect Europe from terrorism, and protect Europe from Russia. The meeting was led, as is natural in a NATO context, by American generals. Now we can no longer assume that American generals will always be leading such meetings. We also cannot assume that Russian military advances, or hybrid-warfare advances, into Ukraine or the Baltic states will be pushed back by an alliance of like-minded countries.  Under President Trump, we cannot assume that America is still the leader of the free world -- or the leader of anything. Protectionism, not free trade, has just won this election, and that will have consequences, too. We have to expect that transatlantic trade and transpacific trade treaties are not going to be passed. We have to assume that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be unpacked. Free trade had all kinds of consequences, but one of the advantages is that it kept countries closely linked politically as well as economically. Walls, both metaphorical and physical, will go up all over the world, between Western countries and against others. None of this will happen quickly. It will take time -- years and years -- for the consequences of the coming transformation of the international political system to unfold. The initial stock market plunge reversed itself, just as it did after the Brexit vote in Britain. Treaties take years to unravel, and a policy shift of this kind takes a generation. But change is coming, as the populists have been telling us in so many countries.

"   Women protest in Poland in early October to oppose proposed changes that would sharply limit abortions. (AFP)  PARIS -- An activist group is urging French women to stop working Monday at 4:34 p.m. local time to protest gender inequalities that still affect many French workplaces. The specific time, the group says, marks the end of 85 percent of the working year. ""The remaining 38.2 working days represent the difference in salary between men and women,"" wrote the group, Les Glorieuses, in a statement published on its website. ""We're not launching a movement, and we're not a trade union or a political organization,"" said Rebecca Amsellem, 28, the founder of Les Glorieuses and a PhD candidate in economics at Paris-Sorbonne University. ""I just wanted to highlight that at this moment, women essentially stop being paid."" Gender inequality is hardly unique to France. But there is a perception that it remains particularly difficult to address under rigid workplace rules in France and the country's value on traditional routes for higher-level posts in politics and business. Les Glorieuses, a feminist newsletter, made its calculation from data in a 2010 study from Eurostat, the European Union's official statistics office, which concluded that salaries for women were roughly 15 percent lower than for their male counterparts. ""We tend to blame the woman for this inequality, as if they chose a job being paid less,"" she said, referring to many women who take part-time jobs to juggle child care and other domestic responsibilities they still feel obligated to take on. Amsellem said she was inspired by a similar protest in Iceland, where thousands of women -- by some estimates, as many as 90 percent of the country's female population -- left work at 2:38 p.m. on Oct. 24. They gathered in a large square in central Reykjavik and chanted ""Out!"" -- out of the office, but also out with discrimination. ""I really wanted to take their example and follow their lead and to make a French movement that raised the general awareness of the equal pay gap in France,"" she said. ""We tend to say that women's rights in France are great, that France has the best parental leave, and that France is a great working place for women. But the fact is still that we have a long way to go reach full equality."" In France, the issue is not purely economic. The accusations of improper sexual advances by Republican nominee Donald Trump have resonated in France. Many French women see sexual harassment as an unfortunate fixture of political life. In 2011, there was ""L'Affaire DSK,"" the international scandal of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then the International Monetary Fund chief and French presidential hopeful. Strauss-Kahn was arrested in New York after Nafissatou Diallo, a 32-year-old hotel maid, alleged that he had sexually assaulted her when she came into his room to clean. Those charges were ultimately dropped, but others followed. In May, Denis Baupin, then vice president of France's National Assembly, resigned from office when multiple women went public with accusations that he had sexually harassed female colleagues for years. Baupin has denied the allegations. In a striking similarity to some of the allegations against Trump, one woman accused Baupin of having pushed her up against a wall while he tried to kiss her. Although it is impossible to know how many of France's 13.8 million working women participated in Monday's protest, thousands across the country were seen on social media leaving the office in the middle of the afternoon. In solidarity with the movement, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo suspended city council. In any case, the idea garnered significant support from high-profile women in the French government, many of whom have welcomed it as a means of calling attention to concerns that go beyond salaries. In October, women across Poland staged a nationwide strike to protest proposals that would sharply limit abortions. As Laurence Rossignol, the French government's women's rights minister, told Le Parisien newspaper: ""When women protest, they make visible what is invisible."""

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Hillary Clinton leads by 6 points in a fresh poll of Wisconsin likely voters from Marquette Law School. Not one survey this year has shown her trailing. Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to carry the Badger State in a presidential election. But Donald Trump, eager to expand a very narrow path to the presidency, campaigned in Eau Claire last night, and aides say he will potentially return to Wisconsin multiple times before Tuesday. -- What's he thinking? The GOP nominee has seen survey data showing that he's performing exceptionally well in the rural parts of Wisconsin, which have been hard hit economically, and his team believes that the FBI announcement about new emails potentially pertaining to its Clinton investigation will bring home recalcitrant Republicans in the Milwaukee suburbs where he has struggled. Republican strategist Mark Graul, who directed George W. Bush's 2004 campaign in Wisconsin, said Trump could win the state if he outperforms Bush by five points in these rural areas and avoids getting blown out in the southeastern part of the state. ""Every time it's about Clinton, Trump starts doing better in Wisconsin,"" he said. ""If this election is about Clinton for the next five days, then Trump has a fighting chance."" Trump's team is also emboldened by evidence that African American turnout has dropped off compared to 2012 and hopeful that college students in the liberal enclave of Madison may not be as enthusiastic as they were in the last presidential campaign, when Barack Obama won the state by seven points. Encouraged by Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman from Kenosha, Trump also believes that he benefits from a tightening U.S. Senate race and a get-out-the-vote infrastructure that has been built out by Scott Walker's political team over the past six years. ""Wisconsin does not have partisan registration, although there are numerous strong indicators in the early vote electorate so far,"" said RNC political director Chris Carr. ""When examining some of [Mitt] Romney's strongest counties from 2012, turnout appears significantly higher compared to this point in 2012."" -- The Badger State is now seeing a sudden flurry of activity. Both campaigns have gone up on the air with TV ads. Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine stopped in Appleton and Madison yesterday afternoon. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who defeated Clinton in Wisconsin's April primary, is flying to Milwaukee tonight for a rally at Turner Hall. Chelsea stumps for her mom today in Eau Claire and Oshkosh and hits Milwaukee tomorrow. ""We got one week till the most important election in my lifetime, and Wisconsin is absolutely key,"" Kaine said during his speech in Appleton. ""You are not a state at the edge or a state in the afterthought zone. You are absolutely key. ... We got to have you, Wisconsinites. ... If we win Wisconsin, it is very, very difficult for the other side to win this race."" -- I checked in with nearly 20 operatives and veterans of Wisconsin politics to get a sense of what's going on: -- Everyone agrees that Trump is doing especially well in rural parts of the state. The biggest bright spot for him is the Green Bay media market. It has historically been quite competitive. Obama won the area in 2008 and lost it 51 percent to 49 percent in 2012. But Trump has consistently led by double digits. Aside from the declining manufacturing base, Clinton's unfavorability has been notably higher in polling all year long. Former Democratic congressman David Obey, who represented northwestern Wisconsin in the House for 42 years before retiring in 2010, acknowledged that Trump will do better than previous Republicans in other sparsely populated swaths of the state. He explained that the realty TV star appeals to ""a lot of rural folks who ordinarily would be very, very, very skeptical of someone from a Manhattan penthouse posing as the savior of the middle class."" ""But, but, but, there's enough of these frustrated workers to make it somewhat competitive,"" he continued. ""Trump is getting support from people who have been in the lower middle class economically and have not been taken very good care of by government over the past two decades or more. A number of them will, I don't know how best to put it, let their frustrations get the best of them."" Obey said the decline of organized labor helped create this opening for The Donald. ""You don't have the transmission belt that can bring information down to the grass roots for a lot of these blue-collar workers,"" he said. ""The labor movement used to be the information transmission belts for those people. They're a much smaller percentage of the workforce than they were 20 years ago. That hurts.""    A woman in Eau Claire got in line at 4 a.m. to see Trump speak at 7 p.m. ""I've never been so excited about a presidential candidate in my 40-plus years of voting,"" she said, adding that she is so confident Trump will win that she has already purchased her plane ticket for the inauguration. (Video by Whitney Leaming) -- Reality check: Trump still has a big league problem in the vote-rich Milwaukee suburbs. Traditionally the Milwaukee suburbs are actually the reddest part of the state and have the highest turnout for Republicans. Trump continues to dramatically underperform Romney in what locals call the WOW counties: Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha. Like suburbs in other states where Trump has struggled, this area is more highly educated and white-collar than the rural parts of the state. Charlie Sykes, an influential talk radio host in the Milwaukee area, has been one of the conservative movement's most eloquent Never Trumpers nationally. He's writing in Evan McMullin and has urged listeners to do the same. ""At this point, I think most Wisconsin voters would rather have a root canal, colonoscopy or almost even see the Vikings in the Super Bowl than hear one more word about Trump or Clinton,"" Republican consultant Wendy Riemann, who served in the Walker administration for nearly five years, said from her native Sheboygan. ""Wisconsinites don't like Clinton, but Trump does not represent Midwestern values, and it will cost him greatly in some Milwaukee suburbs."" Trump lost the Wisconsin GOP primary to Ted Cruz by 13 points in April. He lost Waukesha County by 39 points. Our Bob Costa interviewed white, upper-middle-class Republicans at a Starbucks in Waukesha yesterday. Trump continues to have a serious problem there, he relays, though there were also indicators that some holdouts are coming around. The two key quotes from Bob's dispatch: ""You're in a town that's about going to college and raising a family. People are polished and hard-working. He's not one of us,"" said Andy Schwichtenberg, a 28-year-old stockbroker. ""I did try,"" he added with a sigh. ""I went to a rally."" But he was not swayed and he was turned off by the crowd, which he noted was packed with guys ""who came there on Harleys."" Robin Moore, president of the Republican Women of Waukesha County, argued that the Clinton email news helped. ""Republicans here have moved from lesser of two evils to one evil. That's progress,"" the 53-year-old said. ""It's been hard for some women, and those tensions [with Ryan] didn't help. At the end of the day, we have to save the Supreme Court, and we have to stop her."" -- A senior adviser tells me that Trump is likely to go back to this area to shore up his support in the coming days.  -- Obey, the former Democratic congressman, stressed that Trump's weakness among GOP elites goes beyond the WOW counties. He pointed out that retiring Republican Rep. Reid Ribble, whose district includes Green Bay, has refused to support Trump, too. ""I think Wisconsin is competitive but I still believe there is a range of competitiveness,"" Obey said. ""While it's reasonably competitive, in the end sanity will prevail and Trump will get the rejection he deserves.""    Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Elkhorn, Wis. (Anthony Wahl/The Janesville Gazette via AP, File)   -- In the final stretch, elected Republicans are trying to use the email story to motivate these reluctant and recalcitrant Republicans: Ron Johnson, the GOP senator in a tough reelection fight with Russ Feingold (D), said in an interview yesterday that Clinton's use of a private email server is ""an impeachable offense,"" should she win. ""She purposefully circumvented [the law],"" he told the Beloit Daily News. ""This was willful concealment and destruction."" Johnson cited 18 U.S. Code 793 (f) and 18 U.S. Code 2071, which have to do with the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to national defense. Johnson homed in on the latter of the two, which reads in part that anyone found to have concealed or removed records ""shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."" ""I'm not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,"" Johnson said. ""I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws."" Speaker Paul Ryan, who confirmed that he cast an early ballot for Trump, cites the emails as a reason for registered Republicans to go to the polls even if they don't like their party's standard bearer. ""This is what life with the Clintons look like,"" Ryan said yesterday on Fox News. ""There's always a scandal, one after another. ... She can come in with a Democratic Congress -- [the] worst of all possible things -- if Republicans do not turn out and do not vote."" The congressman, who represents Janesville, is campaigning around the country for down-ballot candidates and did not attend Trump's Eau Claire rally. But he'll participate in a bus tour this weekend with Johnson.  If you like the past 8 years, vote @HillaryClinton. pic.twitter.com/cQEtIgPsEz-- Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) November 1, 2016   Scott Walker yesterday posted a picture on his social media accounts of Obama and Clinton embracing at the Philadelphia convention. This led to a snarkfest on Twitter, with senior members of the Clinton operation thanking their foe for helping with get-out-the-vote efforts. But Walker, the first Republican to drop out of the presidential race last year, knew what he was doing. The incoming chairman of the Republican Governors Association, who appeared with Trump at his rally last night, is trying to gin up the high-propensity Republicans in the WOW counties who remain reluctant to board the Trump Train, people close to him say. -- The Clinton campaign is ramping up its Wisconsin efforts but still expresses a high degree of confidence about the durability of its lead. Her advisers say their early vote modeling looks strong. The campaign is also spending six figures to air three ads across three media markets (Milwaukee, Madison and Green Bay), but allies note that a massive cash advantage ($62 million to $16 million in the final FEC reports) allows them to easily match Trump's spending. -- In a related note, Clinton's campaign is also going on television this week in Michigan and New Mexico for the first time, and it is returning to the airwaves in Virginia and Colorado. Brooklyn says all of those states will get a six-figure investment, per Abby Phillip. -- Where's Hillary? You can read a lot into how the campaign sees the race by looking at where she spends her time. While surrogates are fanning across the state, the candidate herself has not come since the start of the general election. Aides say this is a reflection of their confidence. ""Hillary Clinton and our coordinated campaign have been running hard in Wisconsin for months,"" said Jake Hajdu, her state director. Obama, in contrast, came several times in 2012. Clinton and the president were scheduled to come to Green Bay together in June, but the event was canceled after the Orlando shooting. Interestingly, Clinton has gone multiple times to Michigan -- another state Trump is trying to put in play. She will go back to Detroit on Friday.    Tim Kaine is introduced by Russ Feingold yesterday during a Clinton campaign event at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis. (Dan Powers/The Post-Crescent via AP)   Kaine, though, noted last night when he got to Madison that this was his third trip to the university town since Clinton put him on the ticket. He marveled that one of the campaign's staffers made an ""H"" out of cheese using an ice cream scooper. ""Just for this event,"" he said. ""I mean, don't we have an amazing staff? I mean, talk about attention to detail!"" Former Democratic governor Jim Doyle, Walker's predecessor, said he totally understands why Hillary has not come. ""I never want to jinx anything, but I feel pretty good about it,"" he said, calling on his drive home from Kaine's event. ""I don't want to say anything should be taken for granted. And the Clinton campaign is paying attention now, which is good."" The mood on the ground in 2016 just does not compare to previous election -- when both sides fought tooth and nail, Doyle said: ""[John] Kerry had Bruce Springsteen with 100,000 people. [Bill] Clinton and [Al] Gore had 80,000 for an event. I just don't think we're one of the real battleground states this fall. ... I live in Madison, which would be the heart of Bernie country, and I don't see any big anti-Hillary feeling or anything like that. The Bernie people have come home."" -- Another thing working in Trump's favor: There is a strong GOP organization in the Badger State. The 2012 recall fight helped build an impressive voter file and turnout infrastructure. The state GOP has 30 offices open around the state. Not only is the state party full of grizzled veterans from the recall fight, but because Priebus was the former state party chairman, the local operatives have always been able to get whatever resources they want. Ryan, a prolific fundraiser, has also worked to keep the party's coffers flush. But, as I wrote yesterday, GOTV programs are like special teams units.

Fresh numbers from the New York Times' Jeremy Peters, Richard Fausset and Michael Wines:  In NORTH CAROLINA, black turnout is down 16 percent and white turnout is up 15 percent. In OHIO, voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo has been down. In FLORIDA, the share of African Americans that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased from 25 percent in 2012 to 15 percent today.  -- Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.), who is African American, complained to Politico about the Clinton campaign's efforts: ""They're not doing enough in the black community. I have been screaming for months about this and nothing changed and now look what's happening.""    Katie McGinty and Pat Toomey at a debate in Philadelphia last week. (Matt Rourke/AP)   -- New conventional wisdom: The Clinton email controversy may save the Senate for Republicans. From Karen Tumulty and Paul Kane: ""As recently as a week ago, the Republicans' chances of holding on to the Senate appeared to be slipping away. But now, Republicans see a chance to change the subject and remind voters of the drama and perceived moral ambiguity that has surrounded the Clintons for more than a quarter-century. However the latest FBI investigation of Abedin's emails turns out, the fact that they are even at issue goes back to Clinton's initial misjudgment ... [which] can be traced to the secretive impulses that have so often driven the candidate and her inner circle. Though it is an implicit acknowledgment of the fact that the Democrat remains more likely than not to win the White House, Republicans are seizing upon an argument that they must retain control of Congress to be a check on Clinton -- not only on her agenda but on the behavior of her administration."" -- Some congressional Democrats are having eerie flashbacks to the final weeks of 1996: Bill Clinton was cruising to reelection when a controversy exploded over the fact that Democrats had been taking large donations from foreign entities that are forbidden from donating to U.S. campaigns. A number of those illegal donors had access to the Clinton White House. ""That's a good parallel"" to the effect that the resurgent email controversy could have today, a senior House Democrat told Karen. In 1996, Bill's big lead held up, BUT House Democrats -- who hoped to win the majority after losing it in 1994 -- picked up fewer than five seats. -- Pennsylvania offers the clearest illustration: ""Hillary Clinton's latest chapter in her ongoing email scandal, saga, is just a reminder of how much corruption there is in Washington and how disturbing this is,"" embattled Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) told voters this week at a diner in the town of Media. He noted that the administration of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) is resisting a court order to release more than 50,000 emails that Toomey's Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, sent while she was the governor's chief of staff. ""Her devotion to Hillary Clinton is so complete that now she's decided that she has to have her own email scandal,"" Toomey quipped. For down-ballot Democrats, Sharon Jankauskas is their nightmare: The 60-year-old nurse practitioner who lives outside Philadelphia said she sees the presidential race as the ""lesser of two evils."" She plans to vote for Clinton and Toomey. ""We can always impeach her and get her out,"" she told Paul when he asked about Hillary. Quote du jour: ""We used to say in prosecution, it's primacy and recency. The closing argument reintroduces all of the most pertinent issues,"" said Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.). ""This is almost the personification of the trust issue."" The Republican Party of Pennsylvania updated its scripts for volunteer phone callers and canvassers to identify, and ultimately turn out, voters who support Toomey and Clinton, It's an indicator that local GOP leaders believe the Keystone State is out of reach for Trump, but that the senator can still survive, Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns write in the Times.    Voters walk into a polling site to cast ballots in Atlanta yesterday. (David Goldman/AP)   -- Warnings of a rigged vote have stoked deep paranoia about the integrity of the electoral process. A great read from the New York Times' Alan Rappeport: ""There was the myth of Trump supporters sending wild dogs to scare off black voters in Ohio. In Texas, some of the voting booths supposedly became possessed, switching ballots cast for [Trump] to [Clinton]. And then there was the amateur genealogist said to be committing voter fraud by jotting down names found on gravestones. 'I saw a couple of Seeing Eye dogs, one miniature horse wearing a campaign sign and another rather large but friendly dog on a leash,' [said the chair of Hamilton County's election board]. In Butler County, Ohio, Leah Edwards notified the authorities about voter fraud when she saw a man taking notes and photographing gravestones at a cemetery. 'I can't think of any other reason a person would be doing this,' she said. But the man detained was photographing markers for a ""find the grave"" memorial project, and later assailed Edwards for her irresponsibility. 'Sorry to dispel your conspiracy theory,' he said. 'If you would have stopped and talked to me, I could have let you know that I am a registered Republican!'""    Hillary during a rally in Cleveland on Monday (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   THE DAILY HILLARY: -- Libertarian vice presidential candidate Bill Weld ""vouched for"" Clinton in the wake of Comey's email announcement, stopping short of a full endorsement as he acknowledged an ideological split with his running mate. ""Gary and I have not agreed on a number of substantive issues in this campaign,"" Weld told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, when asked about a campaign press release criticizing the Democratic nominee. ""I do not agree with that release."" He added, ""I'm here vouching for Mrs. Clinton, and I think it's high time somebody did."" -- The FBI released more than 120 pages of documents pertaining to Bill Clinton's pardon of fugitive Democratic financer Marc Rich, making public a 17-year-old trove of documents just days after James Comey's bombshell announcement. From Rosalind S. Helderman, Tom Hamburger and Sari Horwitz: ""The seemingly random reminder of one of the darkest chapters of the Clinton presidency drew immediate rebuke from Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon, who asked whether the agency planned to publish unflattering records about Trump as well. For the second time in five days, the FBI had moved exactly to the place the nation's chief law enforcement agency usually strives to avoid: smack in the middle of partisan fighting over a national election, just days before the vote. The Rich documents provided little new information -- and FBI agents called the timing of their release 'coincidental' -- but they serve as a reminder of the once-aggressive criminal probe into the matter."" -- This looks bad: The Justice Department official who told Congress Monday that the agency will ""dedicate all necessary resources"" to the reopened email probe has a close relationship with Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, hacked emails show. From the Washington Examiner: ""Peter Kadzik, assistant attorney general, sent his son to seek a job on the Clinton campaign given his personal relationship with Podesta. He was invited to a small birthday gathering for Podesta's lobbyist brother last year. Kadzik also dined with Podesta at his home in January, when the first FBI probe was well underway. In 2008, Podesta raved about Kadzik to Cassandra Butts, a member of President Obama's transition team, and noted Kadzik was 'willing to help' with vetting for Obama's Cabinet."" -- Attorney General Loretta Lynch and James Comey met on Monday to discuss reviewing, ""as swiftly as possible,"" the newly discovered emails that could be related to Clinton's email probe. From NBC: ""The Justice Department originally was opposed to the FBI's plan to notify Congress about the discovery of the new emails.... However, Comey concluded that it was better to inform Congress sooner rather than wait until after the election. ""In the end, we decided it was better to keep Congress informed,"" an FBI official said. -- ""The FBI never asked [Clinton's] top aides to turn over all the computers and smartphones they used while Clinton was secretary of state, an omission that is now triggering questions from Republican lawmakers,"" Politico's Josh Gerstein reports: ""While the FBI made a concerted effort to obtain all the computers that were used as Clinton's private server and ultimately asked two of Clinton's lawyers for laptops used to review her email messages, investigators never requested or demanded all equipment her top staffers used for work purposes during her four years at State.... The decision left the FBI at least partially dependent on the aides' attorneys' decisions about which messages were work-related and therefore might have contained classified information the agents were looking for. GOP lawmakers say the decision not to demand the aides' electronics, or even to ask for them, raises doubts about how the FBI and prosecutors handled the probe."" -- Republicans are starting to talk about the new email development in paid media. The pro-Trump super PAC Future 45 is launching a $10 million campaign around Comey's announcement. The spot, which goes on the air today, opens with footage of Richard Nixon saying people have ""got to know whether or not their president's a crook."" It concludes with the question, ""How can we elect someone who is under FBI investigation?"" (Julie Bykowicz/AP) -- Clinton campaign manager John Podesta signed a $7,000-a-month contract with the foundation of a major Clinton donor in 2015 who ""made a fortune"" selling types of mortgages that critics say contributed to the housing collapse. From Politico's Ken Vogel and Danny Vinik: ""In February of last year, as Podesta was working to lay the groundwork for Clinton's soon-to-launch campaign ... he signed the contract with the Sandler Foundation, which was started by Herb Sandler and his late wife Marion Sandler. The contract ... is still active, according to Herb Sandler, who said that it calls for Podesta to provide advice on grant-making and other foundation functions. It's unusual for the full-time chairman of a general-election presidential campaign to maintain an active side deal with a major donor to that campaign -- let alone to raise money from that donor for the campaign. But the hacked emails show that Podesta did both, while also maintaining a close personal relationship with Sandler.""    -- Clinton made her most direct appeal yet for women to reject Trump's candidacy, recounting at length his history of degrading statements about women and allegations of unwanted sexual advances during an event in Florida. From John Wagner:  Clinton, who called Trump ""someone who wants to bully us,"" was introduced at the rally by former Miss Universe Alicia Machado,  whom Trump berated as ""Miss Piggy"" after she gained weight and became the subject of a massive online attack the aftermath of the first presidential debate. ""It's really clear that he does not respect women,"" Machado said. ""He just judges us on our looks. He thinks he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.""    The Donald read from a teleprompter yesterday at the DoubleTree by Hilton in King of Prussia, Pa. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   THE DAILY DONALD: -- Most unhelpful endorsement of the year? The official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan formally came out for Trump, devoting an entire front-page spread to defending his message. ""America was founded as a White Christian Republic,"" the article reads, ""and as a White Christian Republic it became great."" (Peter Holley) -- The Post's David Fahrenthold tracked town a $20,000 Trump portrait that the real estate developer bought in 2007 using money from his charity: ""On Tuesday, artist Michael Israel -- the 'speed painter' who painted the portrait of Trump -- released the first public photos of the portrait. Israel painted the piece in just five or six frenetic minutes, during a charity gala at Trump's own Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. Afterward, Israel auctioned the portrait off. Trump's wife Melania won the auction, with a bid of $10,000. Then the auctioneer convinced her to double it. Half of the proceeds went to Israel, the painter, and half went to the charity that hosted the event, then called the Children's Place at Home Safe, [which] helps children and families harmed by domestic violence."" Tax experts say that if Trump hung the painting at one of his homes or businesses -- as he appears to have done in other instances -- he may have violated laws against ""self-dealing."" -- Sean Hannity issued an apology after falsely claiming on his radio show that President Obama deleted tweets endorsing Clinton. The false information could be disproven with a simple Twitter search. From CNN's Brian Stelter: ""The progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners. In this case, the fake news originated on a dubious site called 'Your News Wire,' which publishes a mix of true, slanted and made-up news. Then, like a game of telephone, by the time the story got to Hannity, even the fake facts were wrong."" -- A largely on-script Trump appeared in Pennsylvania yesterday, showing flashes of a cohesive closing argument. From Jenna Johnson, John Wagner, and Sean Sullivan: Stumping alongside Mike Pence and a spate of other Republican lawmakers, Trump called for the eradication of the Affordable Care Act and renegotiation of a sweeping trade pact. He also attempted to strike a more ""uplifting"" tone, offering streamlined policy initiatives and more traditional campaign accoutrements seemingly geared towards moderate voters. ""If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach,"" he said, reading a script someone handed him. -- Trump urged people who already voted for Clinton to go back and change their votes. He noted that state laws in places like Wisconsin allow early voters to change their ballots if they go back in person. ""A lot of things have happened over the last three days,"" Trump said in Wisconsin, per Jenna Johnson. ""This is a message for any Democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and who are having a bad case of buyer's remorse -- in other words, you want to change your vote -- Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake. A lot of stuff has come out since you voted."" Trump's campaign also began circulating this information on Twitter earlier in the day, with his director of social media tweeting out phone numbers that voters in each state can call to change their vote. It seems certain this ploy won't have any sort of tangible effect; the email thing helps Trump with Republicans, not the kinds of people who already went to vote for Clinton. The country is too polarized for that. -- Trump's campaign sought to play down the news that pollster Tony Fabrizio is being stiffed of $767,000. Communications director Jason Miller said Fabrizio is still ""very much"" a part of the team and said the campaign is simply questioning the payment amount. ""We are making sure that Mr. Trump is paying the correct amount,"" a campaign official said. (Matea Gold) -- Trump really has no idea how government actually works, cont.: He vowed yesterday to call a special session of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare as soon as he's elected. Outside Philadelphia, he said: ""I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace,"" he said. ""We will do it and we will do it very, very quickly."" The Los Angeles Times notes the Constitution gives the president the authority ""on extraordinary occasions, to convene both houses or either of them."" But the last one was nearly 70 years ago. Not to mention, if Trump won, Congress would come into session anyway! Asked about his plan by a pool reporter, Trump said he has not reached out to Congress yet, adding: ""We will very soon."" -- Our Amy Goldstein, who covers the health beat, looked at what both candidates say they would do with the health-care system. To put their views in perspective, in part through analyses from experts across the ideological spectrum, she annotated each candidate's official position using the Genius app. Check it out here. -- The places in the U.S. most unsettled by rapid demographic change are the very areas most drawn to Trump, according to an analysis on the front page of today's Wall Street Journal: ""Small towns in the Midwest have diversified more quickly than almost any part of the U.S. since the start of an immigration wave at the beginning of this century. [Census data] shows a distinct cluster of Midwestern states -- Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota -- saw among the fastest influxes of nonwhite residents of anywhere in the U.S. between 2000 and 2015. In 88% of [these] rapidly diversifying counties, Latino population growth was the main driver. Mr. Trump won about 71% of sizable counties nationwide during the Republican presidential primaries. He took 73% of those where diversity at least doubled since 2000, and 80% of those where the diversity index rose at least 150%.... That shift helps explain the emergence of [Trump] as a political force, and signals that tensions over immigration will likely outlive his candidacy."" -- In that vein, Trump is outperforming traditional Republicans in the North Country of both Maine and New Hampshire, where gun rights are sacrosanct and good jobs vanished along with the paper mills that traditionally propped up the economy. From the AP's Patrick Whittle: ""Maine awards two electoral votes for the statewide winner, and one for each of the state's two congressional districts. The proving ground is the 2nd District, which covers the state's vast northern and eastern reaches. Rural Maine has lost thousands of well-paying jobs to paper and textile mill closures, including the Madison mill this year, and it's a place where many people hunt for sport and food. The district also is the home base of Republican Gov. Paul LePage, a Trump supporter popular with -- and twice elected by -- rural Maine conservatives."" -- Newly uncovered video footage shows Trump with reputed mob figure Robert LiButti, contradicting his recent claims that he ""never knew"" the high-stakes gambler. From Yahoo's Michael Isikoff: LiButti can be seen standing alongside Trump in the front row of a 1988 ""WrestleMania"" match in Atlantic City. According to LiButti's daughter, who also attended the event, they were Trump's guests at the event. Video footage shows him sitting in a front-row seat alongside Trump and then-wife Ivana during the event. ""The ""WrestleMania"" event is just one of many times that Trump was close to Bob,"" says author David Cay, who extensively interviewed LiButti before his death in the early 90's. Trump has consistently downplayed his relationship with the gambler, saying in 1991 ""If he was standing here in front of me, I wouldn't know what he looked like."" Earlier this year, Trump said in an email: ""During the years, I very successfully ran the casino business, I knew many high rollers. I assume Mr. LiButti was one of them, but I don't recognize the name."" -- Donald has spent his life trying to overcompensate for something... --> ""Trump's Math Takes His Towers to Greater Heights,"" by the New York Times's Vivian Yee: ""Of the many rivals [Trump] has accumulated over four decades in business and, now, presidential politics, one of the earliest was a New York City skyscraper with the boldness to stand taller than his own. In 1979, as Mr. Trump inspected a model of the black-and-gold Fifth Avenue high-rise that would come to serve as his home, office, fortress and personal monument, he could find only one flaw to spoil the moment: the GM building, which, in real life, was 41 feet higher and a few blocks away....'My building looks a little small,' he said, according to a model maker. Assured the scale was accurate, Mr. Trump had an inspiration on his next visit. 'Can you make my building taller?' Mr. Trump asked. No, he was told. 'Well, can you make the G.M. building shorter?' [They] sawed off the top third [of the GM building], leaving Trump Tower -- in the one-thirty-second-scale model, at least -- the tallest in the neighborhood. As a review of his Manhattan building portfolio shows, Mr. Trump repeated his Trump Tower innovation at least seven more times.""    Richard Burr debates Deborah Ross last month. (Gerry Broome/AP)   THE SENATE: -- More headaches for North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr. The day after he took heat for blocking his state's second biggest newspaper from covering his events and apologized for a joke about putting a bulls eye on a picture of Hillary... McClatchy reports that the Intelligence Committee chairman played a central role 11 years ago in relaxing U.S. controls over the export of bomb-grade uranium: ""In 2005, the Republican lawmaker won passage of controversial legislation to ease restrictions on U.S. shipments abroad of highly enriched uranium - material that terrorists could employ to build a Hiroshima-type nuclear bomb. ... In 2012, Congress reversed course and passed new restrictions. ... Parties that support relaxed export controls have showered Burr with upward of $100,000 in campaign contributions since he first pressed his amendment in 2003."" CNN posted audio of the senator promising to block any Clinton SCOTUS nominee, no matter who, which gives lie to his bromides about bipartisanship. It also contradicts his insistence earlier in the year that the next president should get to pick Antonin Scalia's replacement. ""If Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court,"" he tells volunteers now. -- Nevada Republican Senate candidate Joe Heck said he still does not know who he is voting for. ""Well, I can tell you I'm not voting for Hillary Clinton,"" Heck told the Las Vegas NBC affiliate. ""We still have six days before I walk into the booth. On November 8th, I'll have a decision.""    Chris Van Hollen campaigns in Silver Spring. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)   -- The Juice --> ""Van Hollen campaigns hard for Senate seat that is within reach,"" by Jenna Portnoy: ""It's a good time to be Rep. Chris Van Hollen. His party is favored in the race for the White House, he's overwhelmingly expected to win the seat of retiring Sen. Barbara Mikulski, and -- no matter which way the balance of power in the upper chamber falls -- he stands to benefit. If Democrats win control of the Senate ... a possible President [Clinton] would need allies there who have relationships in the House of Representatives ... and who can negotiate good-faith deals with leadership. That means Van Hollen, a polite and well-liked policy wonk who was a top lieutenant to [Nancy Pelosi], should find multiple ways to flex his budget, foreign affairs and political muscles. While his [Senate] opponent touts the surprise 2014 victory of Gov. Larry Hogan as proof she can win in deep-blue Maryland, experts say the Democrats' 2-to-1 voter registration advantage is a much steeper hurdle when the White House is also in play.""

He had come out of Queens, a pushy New York kid with family money but no social tools to climb the society ladder. The story of how [Trump] and [Clinton] rose and reinvented themselves and embraced and brawled is the story of New York itself.
