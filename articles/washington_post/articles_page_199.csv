Media outlets report Denn sent a letter this week clarifying how officials can use the state's statutes for such incidents. The letter follows a report from the FBI which documented a significant increase in hate crimes during the 2015 calendar year. According to the report, many of the acts targeted transgender people or Muslims. Denn says the letter was also a response to reported upticks in bias-related activity since the presidential election. According to the letter, any Delawareans who believe they are victims of threats based on personal characteristics can contact the Department of Justice Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust at (302) 577-5400.

Falwell tells local media that he and Trump met Thursday at Trump Tower to discuss the U.S. Department of Education and Falwell's potential role. He wouldn't confirm or deny whether he was being vetted as secretary of education, but says he will ""definitely play a role"" in the administration. Falwell announced his support for Trump prior to the Iowa caucuses and has defended him during the campaign. He is a member of Trump's Evangelical Executive Advisory Board. On Nov. 9, Falwell told the News & Advance of Lynchburg that he did not see himself leaving Liberty University. On Thursday, he didn't say if that sentiment had changed.

"   Earlier this week, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly expressed frustration about the revelations in Megyn Kelly's new book, ""Settle for More,"" regarding the sexual harassment she allegedly sustained under now-former Fox News chief Roger Ailes. ""I'm not interested in basically litigating something that is finished that makes my network look bad, okay, I'm not interested in making my network look bad at all,"" said O'Reilly to ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Norah O'Donnell. ""That doesn't interest me one bit. I'm not going to even bother with it. I've got a country that's in a political transition. I've got a kids book that I want millions of kids to look at. That's what I'm interested in, not making my network look bad."" Untrue, all that: Fox News continues fighting a sexual harassment suit by banished co-host Andrea Tantaros. So it's not finished, even though Fox News's parent company, 21st Century Fox, settled a sexual harassment suit by former host Gretchen Carlson, apologized to her and learned of other instances of Ailes's alleged actions through a probe that it commissioned from the New York law firm Paul, Weiss. Nor is the suffering finished, as a story by ABC News's Elizabeth Vargas shows. ""I think that I went through such hell for so many years, I finally felt safe when I saw that other women were speaking up,"" said former Fox News booker Laurie Luhn in an interview with Vargas. If that name sounds familiar, it surfaced earlier this year in a New York Magazine piece documenting a two-decade-long spell of harassment and psychological torment that Ailes allegedly heaped upon Luhn. ""It's not like I was able to consult or cry on the shoulder of some friend. I was completely isolated,"" Luhn told Vargas of Ailes's treatment. Luhn met Ailes back in 1988 on the presidential campaign of George H.W. Bush. The encounter led to many years of manipulation and sexual exploitation by Ailes, according to an extensive account in New York Magazine. Among other things, he allegedly ordered Luhn to wear a black garter and stockings and dance for him, while he videotaped the proceedings. From the New York Magazine story: When she had finished dancing, Ailes told her to get down on her knees in front of him, she said, and put his hands on her temples. As she recalled, he began speaking to her slowly and authoritatively, as if he were some kind of Svengali: ""Tell me you will do what I tell you to do, when I tell you to do it. At any time, at any place when I call. No matter where I call you, no matter where you are. Do you understand? You will follow orders. If I tell you to put on your uniform, what are you gonna do, Laurie? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, LAURIE?"" Then, she recalled, his voice dropped to a whisper: ""What are you, Laurie? Are you Roger's whore? Are you Roger's spy? Come over here."" Ailes asked her to perform oral sex, she said. Ailes issued this statement to ABC News: ""Ms. Luhn is someone I once regarded as a friend and a person who I helped for many years. The stories she is telling now are fabrications built on half-truths and outright lies, and I can only assume are opportunistically intended to thrust her back into the limelight at my expense."" Also in a ""CBS This Morning"" interview, Kelly averred that it's actually Ailes who has made the network ""look bad."" With statements like the one above, he continues to do so."

Throughout the presidential campaign against Donald Trump, Clinton has made some very specific pledges about what she would and wouldn't do. Those could come back at Clinton if she's elected, because she could be governing in a politically polarized environment. Republicans and liberal Democrats would keep watch to see whether she keeps her word.  ""I think Republicans are going to be dogging her any time she flirts with something that sounds like a campaign pledge that's been broken,"" said Republican strategist Katie Packer, who isn't backing Trump. Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, said liberals would look at how Clinton tackles issues, saying ""the key is seeing if she actually fights, rather than insisting that she has to achieve that goal."" Complicating Clinton's path is the reality that the best-laid plans can change. President George H.W. Bush, for example, pledged ""no new taxes,"" but eventually agreed to a budget compromise with Democrats that did include some tax increases. He lost his re-election bid to Democrat Bill Clinton. A look at some pledges Hillary Clinton made in the final presidential debate and what they could mean for her as president: ___ TAXES  ""I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. I also will not add a penny to the debt."" Clinton has focused her campaign on working- and middle-class families, and promised to tax the wealthy to pay for more social programs, but repeatedly said those making $250,000 or less will be exempt. That's the cutoff her campaign has identified to protect the middle class. Clinton says that by taxing the wealthy, she won't create any new debt, though she has not said she would cut the current debt. This tax pledge means any new fees or costs for lower-earning families will be scrutinized. When it comes to the national debt, Packer notes ""there's a lot of different ways you can do the math that make that a very hard promise to keep."" ___ TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP  ""I'm against it now. I'll be against it after the election. I'll be against it when I'm president."" This is a big one for Clinton. She came out against the trade deal last year amid mounting pressure from liberals. She previously praised the deal as secretary of State, calling it the ""gold standard"" of trade agreements. In the past, she has supported some trade deals and opposed others. So progressives will watch Clinton if she wins, not just after Jan. 20, but during the transition as well, to see if she mounts opposition to a vote in the lame-duck Congress.  ""It's going to be critically important that she steps up, she stand up and says it's not going to be passed in the lame duck,"" said Chamberlain, adding that if Clinton does not take such a stand ""in many people's eyes that would be breaking a promise."" ___ MILITARY  ""I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force."" Clinton has made it clear that she does not want more American soldiers to serve on the ground in the Middle East. There are several thousand U.S. troops in Iraq now serving as trainers and advisers to the Iraqi military. She has made similar statements about Syria, where dozens of U.S. special operators are helping. Still, Chamberlain said that on this pledge, liberals see ""a lot of wiggle room there. The progressive movement wants to see less military action period."" Republican strategist Rick Tyler, who advised Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential bid, said that this is the type of promise that could be hard, depending on world events. ""You could claim you were never going to drop a nuclear bomb. I hope not, but what is it there for,"" Tyler said. ___ COLLEGE COSTS  ""I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted."" Clinton enhanced her college affordability plan with the Vermont senator, her rival in the presidential primaries, in an effort to win over his supporters. Bringing down college costs was a rallying cry for his younger supporters. It's also an issue increasingly discussed on the left. Packer said this might be an area that both sides want to work on. ""That strikes me as a thing that transcends ideology."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Lee High School in Staunton, Va., on Monday dressed as Donald Trump, a get-up that included a Trump campaign button pinned to his lapel and a ""Make America Great Again"" hat. The school secretary also got in the spirit that day, donning a short blond wig, a chain belt and an orange jumpsuit -- not unlike one worn by prisoners -- with a ""Hillary R. Clinton"" name tag. Their Halloween costumes have spurred criticism from some parents and school leaders. Some have accused the pair of pushing a political agenda on impressionable teenagers and bringing the ugliness generated by the presidential campaign into the school building. Neither Rowicki nor the secretary, Stephanie Corbett, could be reached to comment Wednesday. Pictures of the pair in their costumes had appeared in a photo gallery on the school's home page but were later taken down at the superintendent's direction. The News Leader newspaper in Staunton first reported the story. It is the latest example of the deeply polarizing presidential campaign cycle pushing its way into schools. Some teachers have avoided talking about the election altogether because it rouses too much anxiety and conflict among their students. Across the country, some students have repurposed campaign rhetoric to bully their classmates, targeting minority and immigrant students in particular.  ['The Trump Effect': Report says 2016 campaign is causing an 'alarming level of fear and anxiety' for children of color]  Superintendent Linda G. Reviea said the school system is handling ""the situation as a personnel matter."" ""It is a long-standing tradition of Staunton City Schools -- and of many school divisions across the United States -- to allow students and staff to engage in festive activities and dress in costume for Halloween,"" Reviea said in a statement. ""That said, the particular costumes worn by two employees at R.E. Lee High School were in poor judgment, especially so given the current political climate and the extraordinarily strong sentiments for the 2016 presidential candidates."" Many parents were angry with the pair for injecting politics into the school building, worried that the principal's Trump costume could make some students deeply uncomfortable. ""What about the students whose parents aren't voting for Trump? What about Hispanic, Middle Eastern, LGBT and, you know, FEMALE students? What message are you sending to any of them when their high school principal dresses up like a man who wants to deport them, says things like 'she's a nasty woman,' "" wrote one Facebook user whose children attend nearby schools. Makeba Robinson, whose son attends A.R. Ware Elementary School in Staunton, is part of a group campaigning to change the name of the high school, one of several named for Confederate generals in the state. She learned the principal had dressed as Trump from a Snapchat photo and was furious. Robinson, who is African American, said the principal's decision to dress as Trump, a candidate whose rhetoric has been criticized as racist and Islamophobic, might contribute to the impression that certain groups of students are unwelcome at the high school. ""This is a school where everyone should feel welcome,"" Robinson said. ""Anything that promotes or encourages divisiveness is not what we need."" According to the school division's policy, school employees are barred from supporting or opposing a candidate or political party while on the job. If they do engage in political activities, they are required to make clear that they are not representing the school system. The rules ""are intended to minimize distractions from instruction, to assure that no public funds are used to support any candidate for public office, and to assure that the public is not given the false impression that the school division supports or opposes any political candidate or party."" School board member Laura Kleiner said she learned about the incident when a local newspaper reporter called her for comment. After viewing the photograph on Lee's website, she said she called the school system and asked for the photo to be taken down. ""I appreciate all of the traditions that we have at our high school. Students and staff dress up for Halloween, and I love that they can be lighthearted and enjoy holidays. But I think that better judgment could have been used,"" Kleiner said. ""It was supposed to be taken as a joke . . . but it also could offend others,"" Kleiner said. ""I think it's just important to remember in this political climate to stay more neutral and make decisions that wouldn't be taken in a way that would offend someone."" Shyanne Shifflett, 18, a senior at the high school, said she laughed off the costumes as a joke. Her principal is known for being a bit self-deprecating, a quality that endears him to students, and she did not take offense at his costume. Shifflett, who is voting for Clinton, said she even laughed at the secretary's costume -- an apparent nod to calls to jail the Democratic presidential nominee -- though she acknowledged it went ""a little too far."" ""There are people who are saying that they are using the school to push their political agendas, but I just think it was supposed to be funny,"" Shifflett said. She said many of her classmates share her view that the costumes were just a joke. ""I just don't think it was really harmful to anyone at all."" "
