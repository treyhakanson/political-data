Abe, who became the first world leader to meet with Trump since his election, was seeking reassurances over the future of U.S.-Japan security and trade relations. He described the meeting as ""really, really cordial"" but offered few details of their discussion.  ""I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as an outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader with whom I can have great confidence in,"" Abe said at a press conference following the meeting, where he took only two questions. Abe said the meeting renewed his conviction that he would be able to establish a relationship of confidence with Trump. Abe met with Trump in New York, where the incoming president is working on setting up an administration after his surprise election victory last week that has injected new uncertainty into old U.S. alliances. The Trump transition team provided no readout of the meeting. Trump's campaign rhetoric caused consternation in many world capitals, including Tokyo. He has said he would demand that allies such as Japan and South Korea contribute more to the cost of basing U.S. troops in their countries. Such comments have worried Japan at a time when the threat from North Korea is rising, and China is challenging the U.S.-led security status quo in the Pacific. The State Department has said it had yet to hear from Trump's transition team, raising the prospect of the Republican holding the meeting with Abe without any input from career diplomats with deep experience dealing with Japan.  ""I conveyed my basic views on various issues to Mr. Trump but with regard to more of the specifics or details, because of the fact that Mr. Trump has not assumed the office as the president of the United States or today's discussion was an unofficial discussion, I'd like to refrain from touching on details,"" Abe said, adding that they agreed to meet again for a deeper discussion on a wider range of issues. Both Japan and South Korea already pay considerable sums to support the U.S. bases, and note that it's also in America's strategic interest to deploy troops in the region. Trump has suggested that Japan and South Korea could obtain their own nuclear weapons, rather than rely on U.S. deterrence, which risks triggering an atomic arms race in Northeast Asia. South Korea currently pays more than $800 million a year -- about 50 percent of non-personnel costs of the U.S. military deployment on its soil -- and is paying $9.7 billion more for relocating U.S. military bases, according to the Congressional Research Service. Japan pays about $2 billion a year, about half of the cost of the stationing U.S. forces. The Japanese leader may also try to sway Trump on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade agreement that the president-elect opposes. The pact was championed by President Barack Obama, and Trump's victory has all but erased hopes of its early ratification by the U.S. Congress. The pact is expected to be discussed in a side meeting at the annual summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Community in Peru, where Abe heads after New York. Obama will also be at APEC. Abe is Japan's most powerful leader in a decade, and he has invested political capital in overcoming strong domestic opposition to the TPP. He has also sought to increase the international role played by Japan's military, which is constrained by a pacifist constitution. That could jibe with Trump's desire to see U.S. partners shoulder more of the burden for their defense. ___ Associated Press writer Mathew Pennington contributed to this report from Washington.

Del. Maggie L. McIntosh (Baltimore City), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said she could be a candidate for governor or comptroller, while Del. Joseline A. Pena-Melnyk (Prince George's) said she was looking at those offices as well and would also consider running for lieutenant governor on a Democratic ticket. ""Nothing is off the table,"" said Pena-Melnyk, who lost a primary bid this year in the 4th Congressional District and spent the fall working for Clinton in Iowa.  Pena-Melnyk said it is ""sad"" that Maryland will have an all-male congressional delegation starting in January, with the departures of Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D) and Rep. Donna F. Edwards (D), and that women are not represented in the offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general or comptroller. The only woman who will remain in statewide office is Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp (D), whose term ends in 2019. Mikulski is retiring after 30 years in the Senate. Edwards ran for Mikulski's seat and lost in the primary to Rep. Chris Van Hollen.   Del. Maggie L. McIntosh (D-Baltimore City) (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has expressed interest in running for a second term and has record approval ratings that will pose a high bar for any challenger. Comptroller Peter Franchot, now in his third term, has been criticized by fellow Democrats for his close ties to Hogan. He has said he intends to run again. Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George's) has also been mentioned as a possible Franchot challenger. He didn't return a call for comment Thursday. McIntosh, a lawmaker for 24 years, hinted that she was interested in Franchot's job in a Facebook comment Wednesday after Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) blasted Franchot for misallocating local income-tax revenue. An audit report that day revealed that the problem, which Franchot blamed on errant software, was more widespread than first thought. Some jurisdictions were shortchanged, while others received more than they were due. In her comment, McIntosh posted a picture of a campaign sticker. Over it, she wrote, ""What do you think Bill?"" ""I have spent a good part of this fall thinking about what are my next steps,"" McIntosh said in an interview Thursday. ""I do think last week's election made me dig deep and ask myself whether I should listen to several people who have encouraged me to think about statewide office."" McIntosh, who has also been mentioned as a possible replacement for House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel), would have to give up her House seat to run for statewide office in 2018. She said she loves her role in the House and is weighing whether ""it is something I am willing to forfeit.""   Correction:    Earlier versions of this story incorrectly said that Del. Joseline A. Pena-Melnyk (D-Prince George's) might consider a run for Maryland attorney general.  "

Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), left, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in April. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)  One observer wrote on President-elect Donald Trump's naming of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist: If ethnic and religious minorities are worried, it's in part because Donald Trump and his intimates have spent the last several months winking at one of the ugliest political movements in America's recent history. Furthermore, as some on the left have been more attuned to than their conservative counterparts, the problem is not whether Bannon himself subscribes to a noxious strain of political nuttery; it's that his de facto endorsement of it enables it to spread and to claim legitimacy, and that what is now a vicious fringe could, over time, become mainstream. More succinctly, a U.S. senator declared, ""Steve Bannon's appointment to a senior White House post signals that many of his dangerous and bigoted ideas will have a seat at the table in the White House."" The first is from Ian Tuttle of National Review and the latter from the soon-to-be minority leader, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). People of goodwill on both sides of aisle, as we have said, are revolted by the ascension not merely of Donald Trump but of his shock troops and their vile creed. Republicans have become so accustomed to Democrats trivializing bigotry (with ""micro-aggressions,"" trigger warnings and the like) and Democrats so convinced that all Republicans think like Trump that they have forgotten their common sense of decency and abhorrence of bigotry. Now is no time to compete for moral superiority; the task is bipartisan unity in defense of our democratic values and institutions. When Trump names someone to an important post like Bannon, there should be a phalanx of lawmakers from both parties who speak with one voice. There are largely symbolic measures that can be undertaken on a bipartisan basis -- op-eds, sense-of-the-Congress resolutions, etc. When it comes to confirmation hearings, Democrats should not reflexively block nominees over policy differences, but when it comes to ethics, conflicts of interest, bigotry and other basic measures of decency, surely some Republicans, such as Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), Shelley Moore Capito (W. Va.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), can stand on principle. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), a #NeverTrump voter, writes that ""even as we hope for [Trump's] personal effectiveness and success, we should all still argue for principles we believe in."" He reminds us, ""In the American system, the vast majority of policy is to be made by the people's legislative representatives -- not by the executive branch or by unelected judges. And thus the Congress needs to hear from the people on the issue."" Moreover, policy is not simply a series of laws. It's the collective output of the Congress -- its pronouncements, hearings, reports, investigations, fact-finding missions and rejection of presidential initiatives and nominees. ""Reflexive tribalism and reflexive partisanship are signs of a sick republic, not a healthy one,"" Sasse writes. ""And so we should argue about Mr. Trump's coming proposals."" Inherent in that is a commitment to find common ground both in opposition to Trump's actions that sully our institutions, abandon our values and bring dishonor on the White House and the country. Lawmakers should not, of course, stand up to the White House merely on issues of race and the fitness of appointments. They must band together to force the president to disclose his finances. They must prevent and investigate abuses of power and gross incompetency, of which there will be both. We've gotten so accustomed to seeing congressional-executive relations obscured by pure partisanship that we forget that lawmakers' best protection against a loose cannon in the White House will be one another. This is a president-elect like no other, so there must be a Congress like no other. Its members must take on an extra burden of checking and stymieing Trump's worst ideas, defending Congress's institutional prerogatives and looking at times for the allies across the aisle against a reckless executive. The Republicans with political futures will not be those who went along with Trump's assaults on our democracy and decency, but who found allies wherever they could be found to defend our country."

The Chattanooga Times Free Press reports (http://bit.ly/2fOuAdt) David George Haskell, a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his 2012 book ""The Forest Unseen,"" says he challenged Corker on his support for Trump. He says Corker responded by saying, ""If you don't like it, leave."" Haskell, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Britain, says Corker challenged him to explain what he has ""ever done to contribute to the state."" Corker spokeswoman Micah Johnson says Haskell ""aggressively approached"" the senator and shouted at him about the election outcome.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/15/paul-ryans-plan-to-phase-out-medicare-is-just-what-democrats-need/	Paul Ryan’s plan to phase out Medicare is just what Democrats need	"   AP Photo/Alex Brandon  Democrats have been feeling many emotions over the last week -- anguish, fear, rage, and despair, for starters. Now that their heads are clearing enough to begin asking themselves how they can mount an effective opposition to Donald Trump and the Republican Congress over the next four years. One of the first tasks is to find a battle to fight. It isn't enough to just pick up the paper or check the internet in the morning and be horrified at whatever new appointments Trump is contemplating; for Democrats to regain their focus, they need a specific controversy around which they can organize and potentially notch a win. And it looks like they may have found it. I'm speaking of Paul Ryan's wish to privatize Medicare, or phase it out, depending on how you want to look at it. In an interview last week with Fox News, Ryan made clear that as part of the legislative bacchanal Republicans have planned for Trump's first months in office, he plans to begin the Medicare phaseout he has long advocated. He seems to want to package it together with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act: ""Well, you have to remember, when Obamacare became Obamacare, Obamacare rewrote Medicare, rewrote Medicaid. If you are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well,"" he said. ""What people don't realize is because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke."" As part of his strategy, Ryan must convince people that Medicare is all but dead already, so we don't actually lose much by putting it out of its misery. That's why he says things like, ""Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke."" This is not just a lie but the precise opposite of the truth, and Ryan knows full well it is; in fact, the ACA extended the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by over a decade. And be warned: Any time you hear Republicans say the phrase ""entitlement reform,"" understand that phasing out Medicare is what they're talking about.      During a news conference on Monday, Nov. 14 President Obama said repealing the Affordable Care Act has been the ""holy grail"" for Republicans in congress. (The Washington Post)   When Democrats say Ryan wants to ""privatize"" or ""phase out"" Medicare, Republicans protest that he and they only want to reform it, strengthen it, save it. This is baloney. (I'd use a slightly different word were this not a family paper.) If Ryan gets his way, Medicare as a universal insurance program will cease to exist. It will be replaced by ""premium support,"" or vouchers which seniors will use to buy private insurance. If you can't afford any of the available plans with what the voucher is worth, tough luck. The whole point is to transfer the expense from Medicare to the seniors themselves. Half a century after Medicare brought health security to America's seniors, Republicans would snuff it out, leaving some unknown number without any coverage at all and breaking the fundamental promise the government made. Understanding just how much senior citizens love this big-government program of single-payer health insurance, Ryan and other Republicans have always tried to sell privatization by telling seniors that they shouldn't worry because the changes they're proposing won't take effect for a while. You'll still have the Medicare program you love, they say. It's those who come after you who will be without it. For whatever combination of reasons this argument has never been persuasive; perhaps seniors just don't trust it, or perhaps they want to make sure their children and grandchildren enjoy the same health security they do. But whenever Republicans have considered making a privatization push, they've quickly changed their minds as they contemplated the almost inevitable backlash. But now they may have the boldness to give it another shot. For Ryan and other Republicans, phasing out Medicare is a high-risk, high-reward game. Getting rid of it is a beautiful dream, because Medicare is a living rebuke to everything Republicans argue about government programs: It's a gigantic entitlement that has solved a significant societal problem, works efficiently, and is spectacularly popular. If they could privatize it and then begin to shrink it down little by little, they could then do the same to Medicaid, to CHIP, to anything. As Ryan says on his website, ""Medicare is the cornerstone on which all other government health care programs rest."" Ryan knows the political dangers he faces in trying to phase out Medicare, but he also knows that a chance like the one he has now doesn't come along very often. So he seems determined to move forward, and that gives Democrats a tremendous opportunity. An effort to phase out Medicare will unite liberals and give them one specific thing to direct their energies toward. It'll make the consequences of unified Republican rule vivid and concrete. It will also enable them to apply pressure to every member of Congress in a way that the parade of Trump administration horrors may not. A Republican congressman from Alabama doesn't care if a few of his constituents are appalled that President Trump will have a white nationalist as his senior adviser. But a threat to their Medicare? Hoo boy. Now that's trouble. So as much as the 2016 presidential campaign showed the danger of making predictions in politics, I feel comfortable making this one: Ryan's effort will fail. If he actually tries to move ahead with a privatization plan, there will be a revolt. Even Republican members of Congress who agree with Ryan's anti-government goals and who would like to see Medicare die will be terrified of their angry constituents and will quickly abandon him. At some point, President Trump -- who has no genuine beliefs about any of this and therefore no ideological commitment to privatizing Medicare -- will pull the plug. And Democrats, having beaten back this effort one more time, might begin to see a glimmer of hope. They're going to lose a lot in the next four years, perhaps more than they can truly understand at this stage. But they won't lose everything."

Bannon reacts to a caller while hosting Brietbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot in Cleveland on July 21. (Ben Jackson/Getty Images for SiriusXM)  Remember the justifications elected Republicans gave during the campaign for supporting now President-elect Donald Trump?  He really wasn't a racist. He ""just"" said racist things, again and again. Even if he was a racist, mishandling emails containing classified national security material was just as bad. Even if those emails were not as bad, at least Trump shares the ""Better Way"" GOP agenda. Well, even if he has no idea what the ""Better Way"" agenda is, he'll need an agenda so he will be compliant. Besides, even if he doesn't get with the GOP program, Reince Priebus and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) will steer him in the right direction. Even if he doesn't defer to people like that he sure isn't going to let Stephen K. Bannon run things. Well, if he tried that, Republicans would stand up to him!  Once you start excusing the inexcusable and bargaining with an amoral narcissist -- someone who cares only about aggrandizement -- there is no end to it. He will never learn, develop self-discipline, understand the character traits we expect in a president or concede error. That puts his enablers on a slope to moral oblivion and political chaos. And so it is with Trump's selection of Stephen K. Bannon as his chief strategist. Republicans won't comment or will defer to his judgment or chide us for calling out a man whose Breitbart website is home to racists and anti-Semites. Elected Republicans are once more hiding under the covers, refusing to lead and to rebuke behavior that would have them frothing at the mouth if the Democrats were in the White House. The chorus of Republican yes-men who backed Trump and now look the other way ignore the magnitude of the president's influence well beyond politics. The New York Times reports: The F.B.I. reported Monday that attacks against American Muslims rose last year, driving an increase of about 7 percent in hate crimes against all victims. The data, the most comprehensive look at threat crimes nationwide, expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside monitors, who have noted an alarming rise in some types of hate crimes tied to the intense vitriol of the presidential campaign and the aftermath of terror attacks at home and abroad since 2015. A wave of racially charged assaults, graffiti attacks and other episodes has swept the country since Election Day, prompting Mr. Trump to call for a halt to it during a ""60 Minutes"" interview broadcast on Sunday night. In its report Monday, the F.B.I. cataloged a total of 5,818 hate crimes in 2015 -- a rise of nearly 340 over the year before -- including assaults, bombings, threats and property destruction against minorities, women, gays and others. It would be unfair to attribute that upsurge in hate to Trump alone, but can we imagine his utterances, slogans and nonstop presence on TV do not help shape our national mood and standards of conduct? He normalizes bias, spreads lies and models bigotry. Of course that impacts the country. The irony and horror is that Trump will ride into office on the shoulders of the evangelical Christian right, the ""values voters"" who bemoan the coarsening of American culture, widespread ignorance about our democratic virtues, secularism and baby boomers' quintessential self-absorption. Society has done them wrong (or globalism has) and now they're out to get back what was ""taken."" Their wounded pride and lack of social status make them into victims in their minds whose needs take precedence over obligations to others and responsibilities of good citizenship. The one ray of sunshine in this is that there is a generational element to all this. Pew Research found: ""Young adults preferred Clinton over Trump by a wide 55%-37% margin; by comparison . . . . Older voters (ages 65 and older) preferred Trump over Clinton 53%-45%."" Perhaps the careless indifference to (if not embrace of) racism, the bitter misogyny, the rejection of globalism and science -- we can only hope -- will die out with the Trumpkin generation. That's a long-term solution, perhaps. In the short term we are faced with Trump's triumph and the Republicans' ongoing moral abdication. More than ever we need an alliance of center-left and center-right to block the worst of Trump's agenda and revive a sane, decent political culture.  "

Moscow said the two men discussed combining efforts in the fight against terrorism, talked about ""a settlement for the crisis in Syria"" and agreed that their aides would begin working on a face-to-face meeting between them. Trump's office later said that Putin had called to ""offer his congratulations"" and that they had discussed shared threats and challenges, ""strategic economic issues"" and the long-term relationship between the two nations. On Tuesday, a Kremlin spokesman said that Putin and Trump had not discussed the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 or the rebellion by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. ""The overall tone of the conversation corresponded with the tone of statements already made during [Trump's] election campaign concerning Russian-American relations,"" the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists.     During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   During the campaign, Trump said that he ""would look at"" recognizing Crimea as a part of Russia. The United States and the European Union issued sanctions on Russia over Crimea, and broadened them as a result of Moscow's involvement in eastern Ukraine.  The president-elect spoke admiringly of Putin during the campaign, praising him as a stronger leader than President Obama and saying the two countries should join together to fight terrorists, particularly the Islamic State in Syria. Those views put Trump at odds with many GOP defense hawks, who have praised his promise to increase military spending but are uniformly suspicious of Moscow and have denounced Russian actions in Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Syria. The offer of cooperation could also immerse Trump in a deep controversy with the Pentagon, where military and civilian leaders have strongly opposed collaboration with Russia, particularly in Syria. U.S. intelligence officials have also expressed concern, noting that the Kremlin is believed to have been involved with hacking the email accounts of prominent Democrats, in hopes of injecting chaos into the U.S. electoral process and perhaps swaying the outcome of the vote. Trump's conversations with Putin and other world leaders came as protests continued for a sixth straight day in major cities and on college campuses over last week's election results, in which Trump won the electoral college but lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.   [Trump called these foreign leaders the day after the election]   He also faced escalating criticism over his appointment of former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist at the White House. Bannon has been denounced by a chorus of advocacy groups, commentators and congressional Democrats as a proponent of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic views.  ""Bringing Steve Bannon into the White House is an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign,"" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said in a statement. ""There must be no sugarcoating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump Administration."" Trump allies have dismissed the accusation. Obama, in his first news conference since the election, declined to comment on Bannon and sought to reassure the country and the international community that Trump is committed to governing in a more realistic and pragmatic fashion than he displayed on the campaign trail. Obama said Trump pledged in their conversation last week to maintain U.S. strategic relationships, including the NATO alliance. At the same time, Obama urged the president-elect to reach out to groups representing minorities and women, many of whom have felt slighted by his candidacy. ""One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the president, obviously, is the leader of the executive branch, the commander in chief, the spokesperson for the nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the president. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships,"" Obama said. "". . . And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue."" Trump has signaled in numerous ways that he will not hew to many of the norms of past presidents, from declining to release his tax returns to relying on his family as key advisers. Previously, he has said he would avoid conflicts of interest as president by turning his business over to his children.   [Trump's win may just be the beginning of a global populist wave]   Since his victory last week, Trump has received congratulatory calls from a number of foreign leaders, including some he sharply criticized during the presidential race, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Sunday night, after he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump's office said that he ""believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward."" Trump's relationship with Russia may be one of his trickiest to navigate. Although the statement released by his office contained few details and did not mention Syria or other specific issues, it said Trump told Putin ""that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the People of Russia."" In addition to praising Putin, Trump has indicated that closer relations with Russia would keep the Kremlin from establishing tighter ties with China. He has appeared to absolve Russia from responsibility for intervention in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, and during the campaign repeatedly questioned the relevance of NATO, which has charged Moscow with engaging in provocative air and sea actions on the alliance's eastern flank. Giving Putin a free pass on those issues would run directly counter to the Russia policy of the Obama administration, which has, among other things, called for an international war-crimes investigation of Russia's actions in Syria. It could also undermine current European negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine, as well as support for U.S. and European Union sanctions. Russia is interested not only in getting the sanctions removed but also in obtaining equal status as a player in the Middle East and elsewhere. Moscow is the primary supporter, along with Iran, of President Bashar al-Assad. In September 2015, one year after the United States began bombing Islamic State targets in Syria, Putin ordered Russian jets into operation against ""terrorist"" targets there. Most Russian airstrikes, however, have targeted U.S.-backed opposition forces fighting against Assad and, according to the United Nations, have killed hundreds of civilians. The United States and its European allies have called for an international investigation of Russia for war crimes. Obama administration offers to coordinate U.S. counterterrorism strikes against the Islamic State in Syria with Russia, if the Russians would stop bombing opposition and civilian targets, have repeatedly failed to stop the carnage. Any cooperation with Russia would also put the United States on the side of Iran, whose activities in the region Trump has vowed to stop. Also controversial was Trump's decision Sunday to name Bannon as chief strategist, a move condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Capitol Hill Democrats and some Republican Trump critics. Trump's staff brushed off the criticism Monday, saying Bannon is a former naval officer and Goldman Sachs executive who has been a measured voice behind the scenes at the campaign. ""That's not the Steve Bannon that I know, and I've spent a lot of time with him,"" Trump's new chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on MSNBC, responding to allegations of racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism. "". . . He was a force for good on the campaign at every level that I saw, all the time."" Kellyanne Conway, who worked closely with Bannon as Trump's campaign manager, also defended him. ""He's been the general of this campaign,"" she told reporters as she arrived Monday at Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet with the president-elect. Asked whether Bannon needed to explain his connections to the alt-right movement, which includes many white nationalists and white supremacists, Conway said: ""I'm personally offended that you think I would manage a campaign where that would be one of the going philosophies. It was not -- 56 million-plus Americans or so saw something else. . . . You should really focus on the will of the people, which was to elect Donald Trump the president."" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) sought to calm the fears many Americans still hold about Trump's election. ""There is a lot of hysteria and hyperbole,"" Ryan said during an interview Monday with his hometown radio station, 1380 Big AM in Janesville, Wis. ""I would tell people to just relax -- things are going to be fine.  Jerry Markon, Juliet Eilperin, Greg Jaffe, Andrew Roth and David Filipov contributed to this report.  "

Sipila said that U.S. relations for Finland, which shares a 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) border with Russia, are of ""paramount"" importance and that Trump's victory wouldn't mean a change in the non-aligned county's defense policy, its close ties to NATO or Finnish-Russian relations.

On Wednesday, she stressed the enduring trans-Atlantic ""special relationship, based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise."" ___ 4:25 a.m. Egypt's president has congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidential election, saying Cairo wants to see more ""cooperation and coordination"" between the two nations to bolster stability and peace in the Middle East. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi telephoned Trump to offer his congratulations and invited him to visit Egypt. Cairo receives more than $1 billion dollars annually in U.S. military and economic aid. ___ 4:15 a.m. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says he's looking forward to working with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and that U.S. leadership is vital to the world's biggest military alliance. Stoltenberg said Wednesday that ""it is important that the Trans-Atlantic bond remains strong"" and that ""U.S. leadership is as important as ever."" Trump has criticized many allies for not paying their fair share of the NATO budget. Stoltenberg said he looks forward to welcoming Trump at next Spring's NATO summit in Brussels. ___ 4 a.m. Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election is being viewed with shock and revulsion in Ireland. The country is close to the Clintons and fearful of Trump's campaign pledge to confront U.S. companies using Ireland as a tax shelter. The Irish Times branded the New York businessman a ""misogynistic racist liar"" who would fan instability overseas and intolerance at home. Irish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole wrote Wednesday: ""The republic of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt is now the United Hates of America.""  ""President Trump is the creation of the same demographic that gave Europe its far-right authoritarian movements with such disastrous consequences for the world,"" he wrote. ___ 3:50 a.m. Turkey's prime minister has called on Donald Trump to extradite a U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen -- blamed by Ankara for the failed coup in July -- as soon as he is sworn in. Binali Yildirim also said Wednesday that he hoped that the new leadership in the United States would take into consideration Turkey's ""sensitivities concerning the fight against terrorism,"" give priority to policies that would bring peace and stability to the region. Ties between the two allies have been strained over perceptions in Turkey that the United States is reluctant to arrest and extradite Gulen. ___ 3:40 a.m. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Donald Trump in a message posted on Twitter. Modi tweeted that ""we appreciate the friendship you have articulated toward India."" Trump had reached out to Indian-American voters at a rally in New Jersey in mid-October, praising Modi and vowing to defeat terrorism. In the Indian capital, some right-wing Hindu nationalists from the group Hindu Sena celebrated Trump's victory. ___ 3:20 a.m. Hungary's prime minister says Donald Trump's victory is ""great news"" and shows ""democracy is still alive."" Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been often criticized by the United States, including by Hillary Clinton, for weakening the democratic system of checks and balances. Orban last year built fences on Hungary's southern borders to stop the flow of migrants heading toward Western Europe. ___ 3:15 a.m. The European Union's foreign policy chief says that the trans-Atlantic ties with the United States go beyond the election of Donald Trump. Federica Mogherini said Wednesday in a Twitter message that ""EU-US ties are deeper than any change in politics. We'll continue to work together, rediscovering the strength of Europe."" ___ 3 a.m. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says he ""congratulates the elected American president, Donald Trump, and hopes that peace will be achieved during his term."" An Abbas aide, Saeb Erekat, said Wednesday he doesn't expect U.S. positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to change under Trump. Erekat said the Republican and Democratic parties are both committed to a two-state solution of the conflict. The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967. ___ 2:35 a.m. Russia's lower house of parliament is applauding the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. ___ 2:15 a.m. Dutch anti-Islam populist lawmaker Geert Wilders has tweeted his congratulations to Donald Trump. Wilders, whose Freedom Party is riding high in opinion polls ahead of Dutch elections due in March, calls Trump's win in the presidential election ""A historic victory! A revolution."" Looking ahead to the Dutch vote, Wilders finished his tweet: ""We also will give our country back to the people of the Netherlands."" Wilders is known for his strident anti-Islam rhetoric and opposition to the Netherlands' European Union membership. ___ 1:10 a.m. The first French presidential candidate to comment on the U.S. election was populist, anti-immigrant politician Marine Le Pen, congratulating Trump even before the final results were known. Le Pen, hoping to ride anti-establishment sentiment to victory in April-May French presidential elections, tweeted her support to the ""American people, free!"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said France would continue to work with the new president whoever wins but warned ""We don't want a world where egoism triumphs."" France's Socialist government had openly endorsed Clinton. _ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

(Andrew Kelly/Reuters)  Lesson 1: Early political science forecasts were, on average, correct. In January 2014, I wrote a piece called ""The Democrats' uphill battle to 270 electoral votes."" That piece was predicated on conditions in the country at the time: economic growth, the president's approval rating and the greater tendency of the White House to change parties after two terms than one term, also knows as ""time for a change."" In March 2016, Michael Tesler, Lynn Vavreck and I drafted an article -- subsequently published in August 2016 -- in which we suggested that there were mixed signals in the American electorate. People's views of the economy had recovered, although a variety of political assessments remained more pessimistic. Taken together, economic growth and presidential approval gave the Democrats only a modest chance of winning. If you factored in ""time for a change,"" the Republicans were favored. Other early forecasts by political scientists and economist Ray Fair showed the same thing. Vox took several such forecasts, asked two political scientists to average them, and came up with a narrow Republican victory in the national popular vote. Yesterday, the full roundup of these forecasts by Pollyvote said that Clinton would win the popular vote by 0.4 points. Currently, she has a 0.2 percent lead. She will probably exceed that, but the point stands: Those models said it was supposed to be close. Then, like most observers -- including, apparently, the Trump campaign -- I believed the forecasting consensus that Hillary Clinton would win and wrote as much yesterday. There were forecasts that gave Trump at least a reasonable shot, including the 24 percent chance given by the forecasters at our partner, Good Judgment. But I went with that consensus and, like others, thought Trump would underperform the average of the political science forecasts. So I was wrong too. Much will be written about why the polls in particular underestimated Trump's vote share. It is all the more puzzling because serious attempts to measure the ""hidden"" Trump vote struggled to find much evidence of them. But for now, a striking fact is that the election ended up looking a lot like an average of the fundamentals-based models from several months ago. Lesson 2: Party loyalty is still very potent. Another striking fact is also consistent with political science: Despite a sense that Trump might not consolidate the support of rank-and-file Republicans -- especially with some Republican leaders breaking with Trump or endorsing him lukewarmly -- Republican voters coalesced around him much as Democrats did around Clinton. In the exit poll, 9o percent of Republicans supported Trump, nearly identical to the percentage who supported Romney in 2012. Perhaps part of that loyalty simply stems from strong hostility toward the opposite party. Back in June, Alan Abramowitz and I noted that partisans were more likely to dislike the opposing candidate than they were to like their own candidate. That may have kept Republicans -- nearly a quarter of whom did not think Trump was qualified, according to the exit poll -- in the fold. Lesson 3: Candidates and campaign activity seemed to matter less than we thought. Or at least I thought. Trump was the less popular of the two candidates, raised less money, aired fewer ads and had fewer field offices. Normally, political science would say that candidates and campaigns don't have a large effect on the outcomes of presidential elections. But part of the reason is that the candidates and campaigns are roughly equivalent in talent, resources and so on. This creates a ""tug of war"" dynamic, as Lynn Vavreck and I described in our book on the 2012 election, with no chronic net advantage for either candidate. The campaigns are actually mattering, but mainly canceling out each other's effects. This election seemed to suggest a durable advantage for Clinton -- one that some observers thought would lead her to outperform, not underperform, the polls. It was certainly an election where I thought that candidates and campaigns might matter. Clearly that was not true, or at least not in the most obvious way. This surprised me. Lesson 4: Identity politics can help either party. During the primary, Michael Tesler and I noted two key features of Trump support: people's financial anxiety and racial attitudes. This appears entirely consistent with the types of people and places who swung toward Trump on Tuesday, especially working-class whites. For many of these whites in rural places, their feelings about politics may also reflect an anti-elite consciousness described by Kathy Cramer in her book, ""The Politics of Resentment."" In our August article, Tesler, Vavreck and I noted that many observers thought the country's growing ethnic diversity would help the Democrats, especially as nonwhite groups had moved toward the Democratic Party. But we added this caveat: The question, however, is whether increased Democratic support from nonwhite voters may be offset by greater Republican support and higher turnout from whites. We cited an April post from Larry Bartels titled ""Can the Republican Party thrive on white identity?"" Bartels described evidence that the demographic change drove whites toward the Republican Party. He concluded: ""In an increasingly diverse America, identity politics will continue to cut both ways."" That certainly seems true today. Lesson 5: Politics is cyclical. Here's a nice tweet from FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten earlier today:     I made this same point after 2008 and 2012. Interpretations of elections as auguring fundamental realignments are often wrong. There is far more contingency in politics than ""demography is destiny"" would assume. The question now is whether there will be a cyclical shift back to the Democrats or whether the movement in 2016 -- particularly of the white working-class toward the GOP -- proves stickier. Political scientists like Lee Drutman have been ""betting the over,"" as it were, on fundamental and permanent shifts in the party coalitions. I've always been a bit more cautious. But caution did not get me too far in this election."
