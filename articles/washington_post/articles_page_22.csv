The Caribbean nation's roughly 6 million registered voters don't lack for choice: 27 presidential candidates are on the ballot. The top two finishers will meet in a Jan. 29 runoff unless one candidate in the crowded field somehow manages to win a majority of the votes. No results are scheduled to be released for eight days, but electoral council director Uder Antoine has said it might take longer. The balloting will also complete Parliament as voters pick a third of the Senate and the 25 remaining members of the Chamber of Deputies. Results of last year's presidential election were disputed and then annulled after a special commission reported finding what appeared to be significant fraud and professional misconduct. Most Haitians typically stay away from the polls, in part because they are repelled by the chronic ineffectiveness and broken promises of their elected officials. But there are Haitians who say they are determined to vote, hopeful new leaders might be able to relieve Haiti's chronic poverty and political turbulence.  ""Nothing will stop me from voting. We all have to step up and help solve Haiti's problems,"" said Mickenson Berger, who has been cutting hair on a Port-au-Prince street corner since his barber shop was destroyed in the devastating 2010 earthquake. Haiti has had a caretaker government for nearly a year, and the new president will face a slew of immediate and long-term challenges.  With the depreciation of the currency, the gourde, the cost of living has risen sharply. Haiti is deeply in debt and public coffers are largely depleted. The southwest is in shambles from last month's Hurricane Matthew and parts of the north have been battered by recent floods. Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere and one of the most unequal in the world.  ""Public institutions remain weak, and life-crushing poverty remains the daily reality of most of its citizens. Environmental degradation has left the population and the country's productive infrastructure highly vulnerable to shocks,"" said Robert Maguire, a Haiti expert who is an international affairs professor at George Washington University. A revamped Provisional Electoral Council, known as the CEP, has gotten high marks for organizing Sunday's vote with some $25 million from the government. It replaced a council that was marred by internal discord and widespread allegations of fraud.  ""So far, this CEP has done a good job. Their credibility is very high,"" said Rosny Desroches of the Haitian group Citizen Observatory for Institutionalizing Democracy, which will have 1,500 observers monitoring the national vote. Delegations from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community are here to watch the election. The European Union withdrew its monitors in frustration earlier this year after officials annulled results from the 2015 vote. As always with Haitian elections, security is a big concern. The Haitian National Police, which has been strengthened with international assistance, is playing a far greater role in maintaining security than it did in previous electoral cycles. A total of 2,026 U.N. police officers and 1,468 peacekeeper troops will assist nearly 9,500 members of Haiti's police force maintain security. There will also be some 5,400 security agents conscripted by the Provisional Electoral Council to help keep order at voting centers. ___ David McFadden on Twitter: www.twitter.com/dmcfadd Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The two former national security advisers came from vastly different worlds to join in constructing the foreign policy tradition Trump seems ready to demolish. Brzezinski, now 88, is a Polish refugee who served Democratic President Jimmy Carter. Scowcroft, 91, is a Mormon ex-military officer from Utah who worked for Republican Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush.  Both were Cold War hawks who were honored recently by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter with the Distinguished Public Service Award, the Pentagon's highest award for civilians. But both were also outspoken critics of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- not the belated and muffled opposition expressed by Trump, but the kind that cost them friendships and access.  What these two shared was a vision of an outward-leaning United States that led a global network of security alliances and trading partnerships. This system, anchored by NATO and alliances with Japan and South Korea, was often described as the ""liberal international order.""  With Trump's election, this global architecture seems to be cracking. Trump is so inexperienced that it's hard to predict just where his foreign policy views will settle out. But many of his supporters (and kindred spirits abroad) are in open revolt against what they see as the menace of globalization.      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   Trump should think carefully about what he would cast aside. This is the structure of enduring American power. It has been built on military strength, yes, but also on the generosity and openness of the American system. Our ""soft power"" was expressed in the biblical injunction carved on the gates of the American University of Beirut, founded in 1866: ""That they may have life and have it more abundantly."" Whatever egregious mistakes the United States may have made over the past 150 years, people still thought our country represented that aspiration.  The ""globalization"" that Trump supporters oppose is nearly impossible to undo on an economic level: Today's corporations and financial markets are instantly connected and integrated. But on a political level, the global system is already unraveling, and that should worry Trump, not cheer him. As this American-led system weakens, the beneficiaries will be a rising China and a pugnacious Russia. Globalization may need a ""course correction,"" as President Obama said Wednesday, but that requires continued American leadership.  Here's where I wish Trump would listen to Brzezinski and Scowcroft and the traditional foreign policy consensus they represent. Eight years ago, I moderated a conversation with the two of them that was published as ""America and the World."" I spoke with them this week about Trump. Scowcroft spoke at a luncheon in his honor hosted by the Aspen Strategy Group, a bipartisan foreign policy organization that epitomizes the elite that Trump wants to overthrow. Scowcroft, frail and struggling for words to convey the lessons of a lifetime of public service, implored the group to cast aside their misgivings and put the country first. ""If you're asked to serve, please do,"" said Scowcroft. ""This man needs help badly."" Brzezinski was honored a week ago at the Pentagon. Carter described him as ""one of the finest strategic thinkers and policymakers of our time."" He said Brzezinski had understood that America must ""live in an insecure world with 'dignity, with idealism, with steadfastness.' ""  I asked Brzezinski what advice he would give Trump. ""Mr. President,"" he said, composing the memo in his head, ""don't assume that strong verbiage conveys strength. It has to be convincing. Be honest and frank, but don't kiss ass. You could do the world a service if you said to President Putin: 'Don't be an adventurer, especially when you're carrying a loaded weapon.' ""  In Trump's eagerness to show he really means to bring change, he has been signaling disdain for all the traditional centers of power, from environmental scientists to economists, from diplomats to generals. Some Americans who resented these traditional sources of power must enjoy watching the Faculty Club burn to the ground.  But Trump needs to be careful. Unless he's very foolish, he will want to be a good and successful president. He inherited a nation that is still the world's only superpower. New reports Thursday night said Trump planned to name Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a combative and very political retired Army officer, to the national security adviser post held by Scowcroft and Brzezinski. Is he a person who can sustain the structure of alliances and power built over 70 years? Or is he someone who would undermine that structure? That's the right question for Flynn and Trump.

Only for a privileged few	" NEW YORK -- The American dream of a blissful retirement, free of financial worries, is dying. Most U.S. households are heading for a worse lifestyle in retirement than they had while they were working, because they simply aren't saving enough, experts say. Thirty-five percent of households in their prime earning years or later have nothing saved in a retirement account and no access to a traditional pension, according to an AP analysis of savings data from the Federal Reserve. Among households that do have some savings, the typical amount is just $73,200. That's about 15 months of the median household's income. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE -- This is part of Divided America, AP's ongoing exploration of the economic, social and political divisions in American society. ___ One group doesn't have to worry as much: the richest 10 percent of households. They typically have more than $413,000 in a retirement account, according to the analysis of the Fed's latest savings data, which is from 2013. The rest of us look a lot more like Nancy Harvey, a 54-year-old child-care center owner in Oakland, California, who has less than $2,000 saved despite her decades of work. Her plan for retirement, as of now, is to continue with real-estate classes in hopes that it can provide a second job.  ""I have to work and pray and hope my health continues to remain good so that I can continue to work,"" she says. ""I still have a mortgage and all the insurance that goes along with that, and I have to pay payroll for my employees, which is really important to me. I can honestly say I'm frightened about the future."" Harvey isn't alone, as the gap widens between the few households who don't have to worry about a comfortable retirement and everyone else. The anxiety stretches not only across the country but also across political affiliations. Nearly equivalent percentages of Democrats and Republicans say they're not managing very well in retirement planning, a recent survey from Lincoln Financial found. The looming crisis is the result of a system that's increasingly put workers in charge of saving for and managing their own retirement. Because the U.S. households at the top have reaped most of the income gains over the last decade -- and because they have disproportionately more access to retirement plans to begin with -- experts say the gap in retirement savings is only growing wider. They're expecting to see more elderly Americans working longer, moving in with their kids and tapping assistance programs.  ""Only the privileged have access to a secure retirement,"" says Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School for Social Research. THE INCOME DIVIDE It's much easier to save for retirement when you're making more money, and the vast majority of the income gains have gone only to the top in recent years. The top 10 percent of U.S. households made more than $162,180 last year. That's up 6 percent from a decade earlier, after adjusting for inflation. For middle-income Americans, meanwhile, incomes have only barely stayed ahead of inflation. The typical U.S. household saw just a 0.5 percent increase from 2005 through 2015, to $56,516. Lower-income households are making less than a decade ago. The benefit of making more money goes beyond having more to save. Higher-income households also get a bigger after-tax benefit from putting money into a 401(k) or another tax-advantaged account, because their contributions would have been taxed at a higher rate than lower-income households'. And with traditional pensions increasingly becoming extinct, it's grown even more important for Americans to save. Decades ago, workers could depend on getting a set, monthly check into their golden years. In 1979, 38 percent of private-sector workers were participating in a traditional pension plan. In ensuing years, employers have shifted instead to the 401(k) and similar plans, where workers make their own contributions and handle the investments themselves. Such plans mean lower costs for employers. By 2013, only 13 percent of private-sector workers were participating in a traditional pension, and most of those workers were participating in both a pension and a 401(k) or similar program. Nearly all employer-sponsored retirement plans -- 94 percent -- are 401(k)-style programs instead of traditional pensions. Meanwhile, Social Security -- the last line of defense for many retirement plans -- is under pressure. With Baby Boomers increasingly tapping the system, Social Security's trust funds are projected to run dry by 2034. After that, the system will be pulling in enough revenue to pay out only 79 percent of scheduled benefits, unless Washington makes some changes. It's a similar challenge for government pension systems around the world. Many countries have moved their retirement ages up to 67 from 65, and some are looking to move closer to 70, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. DEALING WITH UNEXPECTED SHOCKS Financial shocks, such as a layoff, broken-down car or a divorce, happen to most of us. Six in 10 households experienced one over a 12-month period, according to a recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts. But when such shocks happen, lower-income households are less able to weather them without dipping into retirement savings or halting their contributions. Not only does that drain nest eggs, it also means people miss out on future gains their savings would have earned if they'd remained invested in the stock market.  ""When you're out, you can't buy low"" says Anthony Webb, research director of the Retirement Equity Lab at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis. Harvey, the 54-year-old child-care center owner in Oakland, California, knows. At one point, she had built up a nest egg of between $10,000 and $25,000 in 401(k) accounts through prior jobs she had in accounting and sales. About 15 years ago, she started her own business, which she runs from her home.  ""Then, I unfortunately went through a divorce, and life happens,"" she says. She pulled cash from her retirement savings to help pay college tuition bills for her kids and for a car. All the while, even as her business grew, her take-home income remained low enough that she periodically lined up for a free turkey during holiday seasons.  ""There's not a whole lot left,"" Harvey, a member of the Service Employees International Union, says of her retirement savings. ""It's basically down to nothing."" Janene Evans, a 53-year-old in Belgrade, Montana, has also missed out on a lot of the stock market's gains in recent years. She did have a retirement account at one point, saving about $15,000 while working in the payroll department of an Arizona university. But Evans emptied it after she moved to another state in 1998 and couldn't find a job that surpassed her $20,000 annual salary or offered retirement benefits. That means she missed out on the S&P 500's 157 percent return over the last 15 years. She's now barely getting by on the $1,085 she gets monthly after going on disability two years ago. She doesn't know what she will do about retirement.  ""I can't save on $1,000 a month,"" she says. ACCESS TO PLANS The death of the traditional pension means the burden is on us to save, and that's why access to 401(k) and other retirement plans is so important. David Harraway, 61, and his wife have built up a nest egg that will include nearly $1.4 million in IRAs, $400,000 in cash and almost no liabilities once they finish the sale of a nearly paid-off vacation home. They did that by consistently putting away at least 10 percent of their income in a retirement plan. Harraway says they also didn't eat out much, didn't vacation lavishly and lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead of a high-cost area. Occasionally they might splurge to see The Who when they toured. The couple didn't make much money early in their careers, but they recently were making enough to be in the top 10 percent. Most lower-income households will also save when they have access to a retirement plan. The problem is that most don't get the opportunity. Eighty percent of high-income working households have access to a 401(k) or similar defined-contribution plan, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. For low-income working households, it's just 35 percent. And it's not just lower-income workers who have less access to 401(k), 403(b) or similar programs. Small businesses are less likely to offer them than big companies. And small businesses accounted for 60 percent of all net new jobs created in the four years following the Great Recession, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.  ""Think about how people save,"" says Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ""People only save when it's taken out automatically from their paycheck."" So, higher-income households not only make more money to save, they also have more opportunities to save. RAMIFICATIONS The low retirement balances mean the majority of households -- 52 percent -- are at risk of having to cut their spending by more than 10 percent after entering retirement, according to the Center for Retirement Research. That's even if everyone works to age 65 and turns all of their assets into retirement income, such as by reverse-mortgaging their homes and annuitizing their savings.  ""For an upper-middle class person, not being able to maintain their standard of living means fewer trips,"" says Munnell. ""But for lower-income people, it can really mean depriving themselves."" In 1992, the percentage of U.S. households at risk was much lower: 37 percent. Christian Weller, a professor of public policy at the University of Massachusetts Boston and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, paints a bleak picture of retirement for more than a third of the country. Because of their low savings and lack of a traditional pension, this group of Americans will rely mostly on Social Security for their retirement. He says many will require Meals On Wheels or heating assistance, and they will work into their 60s or 70s even if they have mental or physical ailments. This group of workers has always existed, and they include many lower-educated and single Americans. But their ranks are growing, as a result of the widening retirement gap. ""People who 20 or 30 years ago would have been in the middle, nowadays, they are much more likely to be in the bottom,"" Weller says. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS To help close the gap in worker access to 401(k) and similar plans, states are trying their own measures. California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation two months ago requiring employers to automatically enroll their workers in a state-run program and deduct money from each paycheck, for example. Workers can opt out of the program. Experts say they would prefer a broader fix from the federal government but call the state programs an encouraging step. It's natural for state and local governments to take the lead, because they're under more pressure.  ""When the retirement crisis really hits, local and state government will be on the front lines,"" says Weller. ""They provide some of the money, but they also provide the services."" In the meantime, many workers are simply working longer. David Tucker, for example, is 74 and still waking at 1:15 each morning to get to his job as a skycap at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C. He's worked there 54 years, and he makes $3.77 per hour, plus tips. He and his wife have saved between $50,000 and $100,000. He also gets $235 monthly from a pension, a benefit earned from one of his first jobs. His wife wants him to retire, but he's worried about having enough to pay the bills, and he doesn't want to take help from his seven children. He says he's going to keep working, at least until February. Then, he'll consider cutting down to a few days per week or retiring. And what would he look forward to in retirement? Trips? The beach?  ""I would like to feel what it's like to wake up and not go to work,"" he says. ""For a while, that's all I would like to do. I wouldn't worry about anything else."" ___ AP Data Journalist Angeliki Kastanis and AP Business Writers Joseph Pisani and Sarah Skidmore Sell contributed to this report.

The next morning, Trump had a 15-minute phone call with Piers Morgan, the British journalist who once hosted major television programs, and was visited by Jeanine Pirro, a prosecutor turned minor celebrity who has a Saturday night Fox News show called ""Justice With Judge Jeanine."" Welcome to the variety show that has become Trump's informal kitchen cabinet -- now webcast daily by C-SPAN. The president-elect -- who has long been entranced by celebrities and cleared his schedule to meet them -- campaigned on the promise to do things differently than presidents before him. That pledge is clear in his log of visitors and callers. They include potential Cabinet nominees, longtime supporters, prominent Republicans, more than two dozen foreign leaders and Alex Jones of Infowars, the conspiracy website that claims that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job. The presence of so many nontraditional visitors and advisers raises a question: Is this really the best use of the president-elect's time, especially when his transition team has just undergone a leadership purge and is only now reaching out to many major federal agencies?   Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, arrives at Trump Tower on Nov. 16. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)   [Trump Tower: Home to a reality show, a campaign and now a transition]  ""It's not particularly purposeful, is it?"" said Paul Light, a professor at New York University who has studied presidential transitions. Light and other transition experts said Thursday that they have learned to accept that Trump's approach to everything is likely to be dramatically different from his predecessors' -- and that's a major reason many voters selected him. And there are things that Trump could learn from a football team owner, a boxer, a skateboarder and television commentators that could help prepare him for the presidency. But such contacts are not helpful unless Trump has an express purpose, Light said. Trump's team did not respond to a request Thursday to detail what Trump discussed with each of the guests. ""If it's a bunch of people coming by to give him flowers and take a photo, that's just going to make him feel invincible,"" Light said. ""What he needs is a dose of reality right now."" For example: Light suggested that Trump could meet with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and ask how he runs a two-minute drill in the final minutes of a tied game, taking advantage of every second left on the clock. That's the sort of strategic concentration Trump will need to push tax restructuring and other priorities through Congress early in his term to avoid letting down his voters and losing congressional seats in 2018.  [Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet]  Max Stier, the president of the Partnership for Public Service -- which helps guide candidates and agencies through transitions -- deemed Trump's guest list ""more eclectic than you would see in years past"" and offered additional types of people the president-elect might want to consult. At the top of his list: those who can explain ""how the government actually works"" and those who have tried to change it in the past. To gain a full understanding of the government he wants to change, Trump should reach out to a former White House chief of staff, someone such as Joshua B. Bolten, who worked for President George W. Bush, Stier said. To learn to transition from private businessman to elected leader beholden to the people, Stier suggested that Trump talk to former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. And, Stier said, Trump should talk with a former world leader who tried to impose major change, such as ex-British prime minister Tony Blair. Stier said Trump's list of formal and informal advisers should display a clear objective -- a sense of the direction he wants to take the government. ""I don't think they're really sure yet,"" he said. Martha Joynt Kumar, a retired Towson University political science professor who has studied presidential transitions, said there are no rules for whom a president-elect can or cannot meet or talk with. She also said it's fine for the president-elect to have fun during the transition, as long as he's moving ahead on selecting White House staffers, settling on rules for picking appointees, starting the transfer of information at the agencies and setting on a clear narrative for his presidency.  [How conspiracy theorist Alex Jones got Donald Trump's ear]  One rule of order that Trump broke in his first week as incoming president was to carefully choreograph his communications with other nations. Instead, Trump appeared to take calls as they came in without placing importance on the order. While this stunned many lifelong foreign policy experts, Kumar wondered whether the formality really mattered. ""After all, what was he saying his whole campaign was about?"" she said. ""Shaking things up and changing the way government does things."" Late Wednesday, Rohan -- the pro skateboarder -- came down the elevators at Trump Tower and yelled at reporters: ""Trump loves Muslims, too! As-salaam alaikum! Peace be upon you!"" He then explained how world peace could be achieved by building more skate parks. He told reporters that he was impressed with Trump. ""It was the opposite of what I expected,"" Rohan said. ""You know how you hear about Freemasons and then you meet one and it is the opposite of what you expected? It was like that.""  "

The Democrats are in disarray, it's said. Unless they're enormously skillful or lucky, they risk becoming a minority party indefinitely. Be skeptical. The reality is that these dire forecasts have a habit of not coming true. Remember Barry Goldwater's crushing defeat in 1964. After Watergate, Republicans seemed doomed. Ronald Reagan's two successful terms, followed by the election of George H.W. Bush in 1988, seemed to entrench Republicans.  In each case, something (Vietnam, double-digit inflation, recession) altered the calculus and confirmed a long-standing axiom of U.S. politics: When Americans are unhappy, they throw out the party in the White House. So we need to be wary now. The grim diagnoses for Democrats are surely overdone. It's true that Trump's victory was astonishing -- but only because most political experts had predicted his defeat and, more important, because he survived his own behavior, which violated so many established norms of public conduct. Once you dispense with this astonishing fact, Trump's triumph appears less out-of-the ordinary. I have spent some time studying election statistics. Herein, some conclusions:      President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   1) Despite all the vitriol -- or perhaps because of it -- the public was not nearly as engaged with the campaign as the round-the-clock cable and Internet news media made it seem. One standard measure of political interest is whether people voted; fewer did, proportionally, than in 2012. Between that election and this, the voting-eligible population grew 9 million to 232 million, according to the nonpartisan U.S. Election Project. But actual voting increased only by 4 million. Voter turnout was 58.1 percent, down from 58.6 percent, reports the Election Project. 2) Donald Trump did not win the election so much as Hillary Clinton lost it. In 2012, President Obama won with almost 66 million votes; Clinton's total was just over 62 million. Although that may increase slightly with some late reporting, it will not approach Obama's count. If Clinton had simply matched Obama, she almost certainly would have captured the electoral college and become president-elect.  3) Trump's performance was less spectacular than it seemed -- at least as measured by votes -- and, in some crucial ways, was no better than Mitt Romney's. Romney was criticized as a poor campaigner, but his popular-vote total and Trump's were roughly equal (60.9 million), even though there were more eligible voters in 2016. Remember also that Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton by roughly 1 million or more. 4) Voting patterns are remarkably stable. Consider the share of white voters who supported the Republican candidate in the past four presidential elections (2004-2016): 58 percent, 55, 59, 58, report exit polls compiled by the American Enterprise Institute. Similarly, here's the share of African American voters who backed the Democratic candidate: 88, 95, 93, 88. Campaigning concentrates on a small sliver of voters whose minds aren't made up or who are open to change. Some lessons are plain. One is that the Democrats' vaunted ""ground game"" -- the get-out-the-vote operation -- was vastly overrated. Another is that elections rarely produce genuine ""mandates,"" though leaders of both parties routinely claim that they do. (Not surprisingly, Trump is asserting a mandate to shake up Washington.) The people may have ""spoken,"" but their message is usually limited to voting for one candidate over another. Broader themes have to be inferred or invented.  With some exceptions (Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, Lyndon Johnson in 1964 are examples), elections do not signal upheavals in American life. The commentariat -- scholars, pundits, columnists, bloggers -- have an interest in saying otherwise. They build impressive theories of social, political and economic change based on elections where the candidates are separated by only a small percent of the vote.  When you hear these pronouncements, you ought to temper them with history. It teaches that public opinion is fickle.       Read more from Robert Samuelson's archive.                    "

The driver, Mohammed al-Khal, stopped, took a wounded ice cream vendor into his car and rushed him to the nearest hospital. But the warplanes were still hunting. Moments after al-Khal pulled up at the hospital in the town of Abs, hell was unleashed. A missile struck just outside the hospital entrance, ""like a ball of fire,"" one witness said. Al-Khal, a father of eight, was incinerated in his car. The blast ripped through patients and family waiting in an outdoor reception area. Nineteen people were killed, along with two civilians killed on the highway. The attack in August typified what has been a pattern in the nearly 2-year-old air campaign by Saudi Arabia and its allies against Yemen's Shiite rebels, known as Houthis. Rights groups and U.N. officials say the U.S.-backed coalition has often either deliberately or recklessly depended on faulty intelligence, failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets and disregarded the likelihood of civilian casualties. Experts say some of the strikes amount to war crimes.  ""The Saudis have been committing war crimes in Yemen,"" said Gabor Rona, a professor teaching the laws of war at Columbia University. He pointed to ""indiscriminate targeting, that is, attacks in which the attacker makes no effort to distinguish between combatants and civilians."" And he warned that American personnel helping the coalition ""may also be guilty of war crimes."" Nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed since early 2015 and an estimated 60 percent of them died in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition, the U.N. says. Around one in three strikes hit civilian targets, according to the Yemen Data Project, an independent group of researchers that has put together a database of more than 8,000 strikes. In the Aug. 15 strikes in Abs, the original target was a small checkpoint manned by two rebel fighters on a highway far from any frontline. Of 21 people killed, none appears to have been a combatant. The two fighters escaped the initial missile, witnesses told The Associated Press, yet warplanes fired two more, spraying bystanders with shrapnel. It appears they then followed al-Khal's Camry, believing it was carrying a fighter, and hit it with a fourth missile at the hospital entrance Moreover, the hospital, which was run by the international humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, was on the coalition's own computerized list of sites that should not be targeted.  ""Any way you look at it, it is a war crime,"" Rona said. Each strike that day was carried out with a Paveway guided missile system, built by an American company and sold to Saudi Arabia -- a sign of how the United States has become mired in Yemen's war. Washington and its allies have sold billions of dollars in weapons to Saudi Arabia for the campaign, and the U.S. military has been providing it with intelligence, satellite imagery and logistical help. Washington underlines that it does not make decisions on strikes, and it calls on the coalition to investigate any claims of violations. ""U.S. security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank check,"" National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in October. The coalition denies neglect, saying it does its utmost to avoid civilian casualties and noting the rebels often operate among civilians. Rights groups and the U.N. human rights office have also reported possible war crimes by the Houthi rebels, citing their shelling of civilian areas and basing their fighters in schools and other civilian locations.  ""This is the fog of war,"" the coalition's spokesman, Saudi Gen. Ahmed al-Asiri, told The Associated Press when asked if there is a pattern of civilian deaths.  ""In war, one plus one doesn't equal two. In war, there are many changes taking place around the clock. In war, there are decisions that should be taken fast,"" he said from the Saudi capital, Riyadh. But critics say the American and international backing and lack of independent investigation have given Saudi Arabia and its allies a free rein.  ""We believe that the coalition understood that ... it has a green light to commit more massacres in Yemen,"" said Abdel-Rashed al-Faqeh, the head of Muwatana, one of Yemen's most prominent rights groups. ___ Saudi Arabia launched the coalition campaign in a bid to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, after the Houthis overran the capital Sanaa and Yemen's north. The Houthis are allied with troops loyal to Hadi's predecessor Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted after a 2011 pro-democracy uprising. Saudi Arabia, which calls the rebels a proxy of its regional rival, Iran, has backed an array of military units and fighters against the Houthis. The war has devastated the country of 26 million. Around 3 million have been driven from their homes. The bombardment, fighting and a coalition blockade have fueled widespread hunger. Warplanes have hit medical centers, schools, factories, infrastructure and roads, as well as markets, weddings and residential compounds. The Yemen Data Project documented nearly 60 strikes on medical facilities, though it says it does not track casualty figures because of how difficult it is to verify events on the ground. The coalition, which says it investigates claims of civilian casualties, has made nine investigations public. In most cases it said the strikes were against a justified military target. If any attack typified the rush to hit without regard for civilian casualties, it was the Oct. 8 attack on a funeral in Sanaa. Warplanes fired two missiles at the funeral hall. More than 140 people were killed, more than 600 wounded, in one of the deadliest strikes of the campaign. The funeral, which was for the father of a Houthi government minister, brought together numerous prominent figures from the rebel movement and Saleh's circles. Several top military and security figures were killed, but the majority of dead were civilians. After an international outcry, the coalition held an investigation and admitted a mistake, one of only two times it has done so. But the coalition blamed its Yemeni allies, saying an air operation center in Yemen received information that the hall was filled with Houthi leaders and was a legitimate military target. The center ordered the strike without the coalition headquarters' knowledge, the spokesman of the coalition's investigation team, Mansour al-Mansour, told the AP. But several Yemeni political and military officials told the AP that the centers do not have the power to order coalition warplanes to strike. Two Yemeni officials said the coalition headquarters ordered the strike after getting information -- incorrect it later turned out -- that Saleh would be present. The officials, one a senior pro-coalition figure in Hadi's government and the other senior military officer, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the workings of the air campaign.  ""This is very tempting for a country like Saudi Arabia as they really want to break the resistance,"" said Michael Knights, a Boston-based Yemen analyst with the Washington Institute. ""If they had the chance to do it with one bomb, I am sure they would do it."" The strike raised multiple concerns in terms of its legality, experts said.  ""If you have to kill 140 to get one militiaman, then that is pretty clearly disproportionate and that would be a war crime,"" said Rona, who has worked as a legal expert with the international Red Cross and Human Rights First. The U.N. Panel of Experts, which reports to the world body on the conflict, denounced the use of a ""double-tap"" attack against the funeral. The second missile strike, timed moments after the first, ""almost certainly resulted in more casualties to the already wounded and the first responders,"" it said, a practice prohibited under international humanitarian law. ___ When the campaign began in early 2015, the coalition focused on Houthi military targets largely based on information from Hadi's government. But as time went on, targeting relied more on tips coming from hundreds of informants paid by the coalition. A senior Yemeni army official close to Hadi's Riyadh-based government said the informants often provide inaccurate information, rely on rumors or call in strikes to get revenge on personal enemies. He and another top official said decisions on strikes are taken hastily without enough verification or assessment of likely civilian casualties. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the workings of the coalition. In one instance, a bus carrying men, women and children was struck north of the city of Aden on June 6, 2015, killing 15 people, after a tip that it was carrying Houthi fighters. A similar incident came 11 days later, again from a tip. Strikes killed all 16 passengers on a bus in an area called Tor al-Baha northwest of Aden. It turned out the passengers were families heading out for the Muslim Eid holiday. In both cases, the official said the Yemenis informed the coalition that the dead were civilians. ""They said we will look into it. But of course nothing happened."" ___ Since the air campaign began, the U.S. has authorized some $7.8 billion in military sales to Saudi Arabia. In 2015 alone, Saudi Arabia purchased $25 billion in arms from the U.S., Britain, France and other countries, according to Control Arms, a New York-based group that tracks the arms trade. The U.S. also been providing intelligence on targets through American military advisers posted at the Joint Combined Planning Cell, or JCPS, in Riyadh. But the U.S. military never provided ""direct or implicit approval of target selection or prosecution,"" Central Command said in a statement. U.S. officials say the JCPS sought to limit civilian casualties. It provided coordinates for some 2,300 sites on a ""no-target"" list, including hospitals, schools and mosques, which would appear on the coalition's computer screens as red marks. It also advised the coalition on compliance with the Law of Armed Conflict and use of precision weapons to avoid civilians, said Lt. Ian M. McConnaughey, U.S. Navy spokesman in Bahrain. But the U.S. and its allies have also protected Saudi Arabia from criticism. In September, a number of EU countries tried to pass a resolution for the U.N. Human Rights Commission to order an international probe into civilian deaths, but the provision failed to get U.S., British and French support. In June, the U.N. blacklisted the coalition because of child deaths in Yemen, but that move was revoked after Saudi Arabia's allies threatened to cut funding for U.N. programs. Last summer, Washington appeared to try to distance itself. The U.S. pulled out dozens of personnel from the joint planning cell in June. Pentagon spokesman Christopher Sherwood said fewer than five personnel were needed. After the funeral strike, the U.S. said it would review its assistance further. Nabeel Khoury, a former U.S. diplomat in Yemen and now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, attributed the reduction to the criticism over civilian deaths.  ""Yes, the official line was we are providing intelligence, but this is targeting. The only intelligence Saudis want is for targeting,"" he told the AP. ""In the end, the decision to fire is Saudi, but because of the American support to this war, it is hard to deny U.S. responsibility."" ___ Al-Haj reported from Sanaa, Associated Press writers Maad al-Zikry and Hani Mohammed in Yemen contributed to this report.

Despite sporadic reunion tours over the past decade, the Golden Age hip-hop legends were destined for permanent dissolution, with Q-Tip and Phife Dawg living on opposite coasts and harboring seemingly irreconcilable grievances. Those were captured in all their tense combativeness in the 2011 documentary, ""Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest."" But in the aftermath of last November's ""Tonight Show"" performance commemorating the 25th anniversary of their debut, the group covertly re-formed and embarked on a path that ultimately produced their best album since 1993's ""Midnight Marauders."" The brilliance of the new ""We Got It From Here: Thank You 4 Your Service"" stems partially from its ability to serve multiple purposes. Foremost, it functions as a requiem for the greatest sidekick this side of Scottie Pippen, Phife, who died this spring at 45 due to complications from diabetes. But it's also a caustic political screed against the xenophobic and bigoted forces that helped elect Trump, and somehow still a celebration of the chemistry, musical adventurousness and irrepressible joy that made Tribe the platonic ideal of a rap group. What the foursome (also including Jarobi White and Ali Shaheed Muhammad) has achieved is almost unthinkable: shedding two decades of rust to create something that neither traffics in nostalgia nor mimics the past, while retaining the Day-Glo fluorescence, mystic chords, and jazz-fortified aesthetic that made them stars in the first place. If Phife didn't update his references to Muggsy Bogues for ones in favor of John Wall, you could almost be convinced that this was originally recorded in 1992 or 1998 or 2006. Of course, Tribe always rapped about more than just point guards. Whereas onetime peers Public Enemy and Ice Cube unleashed radical politics with battering ram intensity, Tribe always articulated similar themes with smoother equilibrium. A song like ""Steve Biko (Stir It Up)"" balanced Mad Cobra references and Sunday-barbecue cool with a title paying tribute to the murdered South African anti-apartheid leader and founder of the black consciousness movement.  That subversive streak has returned in these strychnine times. On ""We the People,"" Q-Tip sardonically inverts the Constitution's preamble and croons hooks like, ""All you black folks you must go/ all you Mexicans you must go/ all you poor folks you must go."" On the album finale, ""The Donald,"" they redeem Trump's nickname and assign it to Phife, belatedly adding it to his already indelible litany of aliases (""the five-foot assassin,"" ""the five-foot freak,"" ""the funky diabetic,"" ""the Trini-Gladiator"" and ""Dynomutt""). The mission becomes immediately clear on ""The Space Program,"" the first track of the hour-long odyssey. In his trademark Muppet-huffing-helium timbre, Q-Tip spits, ""This time we're going left and not right,"" a sinistral declaration of artistic and political principle -- a refusal to play it safe. They dedicate it to brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and the dead. A snippet of Blaxploitation classic ""Willie Dynamite"" sneers that ""they need to come together"" and ""come down hard"" -- a testament to both resistance against reactionary forces and a more personal mantra.  Q-Tip insisted that everyone -- including album guests such as Kanye West, Jack White and Kendrick Lamar -- come to his studio in New Jersey to record their contributions. It's an anachronistic approach in an era of emailed Pro Tools files, but one that reignited an alchemical formula that had ostensibly expired decades ago. Q-Tip claimed that he hadn't seen Phife that happy since they were kids, which is what you'd expect him to say while promoting their first group album since Joey Bada$$ was 3, but it's the sort of thing that can't be faked in the vocal booth.  Most truly great music involves some inalienable voodoo, chemistry or soul that can't be achieved through will or repetition. On those first three albums, Q-Tip and Phife had it like Keith and Mick, McCartney and Lennon, Russell Westbrook and lens-free glasses. They completed each other's sentences like twins on a sitcom, until Phife moved to Atlanta and complained about being portrayed as the Tito Jackson of the group.  That same off-the-dial psychic frequency is all over ""We Got It From Here."" And not only do Phife and Tip defy middle-aged complacency, but their longtime conspirators Consequence and Jarobi deliver the best performances of their careers. Even Busta Rhymes raps like he grew his dreads back and just stepped off the set for the ""Woo Hah (Got You All in Check)"" video.  The other guests largely reflect those contemporary greats whom Tribe inspired who later inspired Q-Tip. Kanye bellows a sepulchral hook on ""The Killing Season,"" but you can spot his production influence on a song like ""The Space Program,"" where the rappers commune back-and-forth with a vocal sample. Or there's ""Kids,"" where Andre 3000 and Tip make vulgar jokes, pour liquor on the graves of cops, and offer a belated ""well, actually"" retort to ""Parents Just Don't Understand."" The keyboards recall Kraftwerk and the hook resembles OutKast's ""Art of Storytellin' 2.""  Jack White periodically pops up, pale and ghostly, wielding a guitar that he plucked off Q-Tip's wall and delivering a riff that sounds like ""Hello Operator"" for the iPhone 7 age. Near the end, Lamar materializes to invoke Bible books and rattle off a machine-gun flow. Q-Tip cited Lamar's track ""Money Trees"" as another one of the album's touchstones, and you can detect Lamar's double-time in his cadences. But Q-Tip has synthesized these inspirations into the Tribe principles sweeping up almost everything worth emulating from the past quarter century of left-field cerebral hip-hop.  If political turbulence offers its intellectual compass, Phife's death lends the record its spiritual pulse. Both ""Black Spasmodic"" and ""Lost Somebody"" could easily be maudlin tributes to their recently departed partner, but they instead stand as memorials that can exist somewhere between 2Pac's ""How Long Will They Mourn Me"" and Pink Floyd's ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond."" On ""Black Spasmodic,"" Phife floats with his West Indian patois, effortless and cocky, his mouthing tangling slang and reinforcing his legacy one final time. ""Lost Somebody"" finds Tip divining his friend's spirit in the recorded fragments left behind, trying to stitch the album together, mourn, and make his best friend's memory proud.  There are few, if any, hip-hop analogues for this achievement. Dr. Dre's ""Compton"" followed a decade-and-a-half hiatus, but ultimately felt like an impressive coda celebrating a long-extinct golden era. De La Soul's recent effort this year proved exactly how halfway attempts to modernize your sound can lead to it seeming monochrome. If anything, ""We Got It"" is the nexus between D'Angelo's ""Black Messiah"" and David Bowie's ""Blackstar."" It is at times political, at times spiritual, at all times focused on leaving behind a profound artifact. To paraphrase Auden, this shows an affirming flame at a time beleaguered by negation and despair.  When the world needed it most, A Tribe Called Quest delivered on that most difficult task: They made a Tribe Called Quest album.  "

(Scott Soderberg/University of Michigan)  Students at colleges across the country are walking out of class, holding rallies and marching on campus to protest the election of Donald Trump as president. But at the University of Michigan, a different kind of protest has taken shape: Hundreds of students and others have signed a petition decrying anti-Trump rhetoric from the school's leadership. After a wrenching campaign that left the country deeply divided, tensions have been particularly raw at the University of Michigan in the days following the election, with attacks on students that may have been motivated by their religion. Some students saw another kind of animosity on campus, as well.   [University of Michigan student wearing a hijab threatened with being lit on fire]   Amanda Delekta, a sophomore, started the #notmycampus petition out of frustration last week, after what she described as university leaders offering safe spaces and encouraging students to attend a vigil, rather than encouraging debate about the results. ""For the University of Michigan, that prides itself on critical thinking and open dialogue, I was shocked to see that,"" she said. It spread quickly. Some wrote anonymously, such as a freshman who said she withheld her name because she is scared to even take out her laptop because it has a GOP elephant sticker on it. Another student wrote, ""I have experienced more verbal attacks and insults in the past week than I have in my entire life."" Many signed their names, saying they were disgusted by rigid viewpoints, stereotyping and self-righteousness -- especially at a state flagship that is one of the most prestigious public universities in the country. A spokesman for the university, Rick Fitzgerald, said there have been no anti-Trump protests on campus. He said the gathering Wednesday was intended to bring students together after the election. And he said an event at the law school, promoted online as ""postelection self-care with food and play,"" was not related to the election but was one of a series of routine events hosted throughout the year by Counseling and Psychological Services. In a message to campus Wednesday, Mark Schlissel, the university's president, announced a series of events, including the student vigil, several programs offering support for students, and analytical discussions. He also wrote, ""Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty."" Reebehl El-Hage, a senior studying engineering, said by phone Tuesday that he didn't vote for Trump but objected to what he called Schlissel's condemnation of people who did. He had expected the president to understand there were two highly emotional sides -- not to choose one of those sides. The University of Michigan seeks diversity, El-Hage said. Just last month, Schlissel announced the school will invest $85 million over the next five years to boost diversity on campus. ""They seek diversity in race, ethnicity, religion. But when it comes to diversity in opinion, they're clearly biased on one side."" As a Lebanese American student, he wrote on the petition, that he had never felt marginalized because of the color of his skin. As a conservative, however, ""it is a whole other story."" And he wrote that Trump won not because of racism and bigotry, but ""because, as a nation, we have continuously ignored the plight of a large portion of the country who, for the past 8, 12, even 16 years, has been clamoring over its struggles to no avail,"" citing issues such as rising insurance premiums and the loss of factory jobs. One student wrote that the school had become ""an echo chamber for those with liberal views,"" which shuns and shames people who disagree: Contrary to popular belief, there are minorities who supported Trump and the Republican Party. I, myself, am a member of the LGBT community . . . I will not be labeled as a racist, sexist, xenophobic, and laughably homophobic person simply because I voted for a certain candidate. That overgeneralization is exactly what causes violence, division, and unnecessary tension. Michigan, like many universities across the country, has witnessed ugly and frightening incidents on campus since the election. The school's symbolic rock was painted with ""Kill them all"" over Republican and Democratic symbols, and university police are investigating three other incidents: A student who returned from class to find a swastika on his door; a student pushed down a hill and yelled at for being in America, with a reference to her religion; and a woman who was forced to remove her hijab.   [Tensions over Trump literally ignite when firecrackers are tossed into a college protest]   The university has also, like many across the country, had protests against those kinds of biased incidents that included talk condemning Trump's rhetoric, according to reporting from the scenes by the Michigan Daily.   [Mobs of tearful, angry students protesting Trump victory swarm college campuses]   Anti-Trump protests continued elsewhere in the country this week. Towson University students walked out of class Monday. Students at George Washington University planned to march to the White House Tuesday afternoon. A University of Maryland student suggested a ""Not My President"" silent protest at the Capitol on Inauguration Day, and 19,000 people said online they would attend.    Students paint encouraging messages on the Rock at the University of Michigan on Nov. 9. The Ann Arbor landmark had been painted with crude messages. (Matt Weigand/Ann Arbor News-MLive.com via AP)  On Sunday night, Schlissel and other university leaders sent an email to the campus community, which read, in part:    University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel.(Scott Soderberg/University of Michigan)  In the days since last Tuesday's election, people in our community have experienced hateful attacks, both on an individual level and as members of groups. . . . We saw a threatening message painted on the rock near our campus; a student walking near campus was threatened with being lighted on fire because she wore a hijab; another student left his apartment to go to class and found a swastika with a message telling him to go home. Some students have also been shouted at and accused of being racist because of their political views. Emotions are high all across the political spectrum. We hope all members of our community can agree that we must not stand silent while facing expressions of bigotry, discrimination or hate that have become part of our national political discourse. Only by speaking out against personal attacks, hate and threats can we move on to have the discussions that will be necessary for our campus and our nation to reach its full potential. We do not seek to suppress political speech or ongoing debate of key issues. Rather, we are asking everyone to reject hate and bigotry and to provide personal support for one another. People of widely varying ideologies have expressed this idea, and we are confident that it represents the ideals of the vast majority of our community. Delekta said more than 100 students and professors met Monday night, and they had awkward and uncomfortable and emotional conversations that she felt were productive, part of a genuine effort to understand one another's points of view and confront some of the fears and frustrations. On Friday, she said, she and some other students have been invited to talk with Schlissel. ""I'm really looking forward to that,"" she said, and ongoing conversations on campus. ""Students of all identities need to talk with students who are different from them."""

Matata Ponyo said Monday that he has stepped down in accordance with the Oct. 18 agreement to form a united interim government. Congo's presidential elections have been delayed from November to April 2018. Congo's largest opposition party boycotted the talks that led to this agreement, and rejected the deal, which paves the way for opposition members who agreed to the delay to be given government positions. President Joseph Kabila's term was supposed to end in December. Critics accuse him of delaying the vote to stay in power. The electoral commission says it cannot organize an election before 2018. Dozens died in the capital in September protesting the delays. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
