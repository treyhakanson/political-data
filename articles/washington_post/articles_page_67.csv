Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the new rate is part of the government's efforts to boost competitiveness. The current rates are 10 percent on annual corporate profits below 500 million forints ($1.7 million) and 19 percent above. Economic Affairs Minister Mihaly Varga said Thursday the new rate would reduce tax revenues next year by 145 billion forints ($499 million). No new taxes were announced to make up the shortfall. The opposition party Politics Can be Different said the change will make Hungary a ""tax haven."" According to advisory firm KPMG, the average corporate tax rate in the 28-country EU this year was slightly above 22 percent. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (Theo Wargo/Getty Images)  Bernie Sanders, who famously declared that the American people were sick and tired of hearing about Hillary Clinton's ""damn emails,"" on Thursday warned President-elect Donald Trump not to try to prosecute his former rival over the issue. ""It would be almost beyond comprehension to think that a new president would be involved in the prosecution of his opponent who ended up getting some 2 million more votes than he did,"" the senator from Vermont told reporters at a breakfast in Washington hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, referring to Clinton's lead in the popular vote. Trump said in a debate that if he were president, the Democratic nominee would be ""in jail"" for alleged wrongdoing associated with her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. FBI Director James B. Comey recommended in July that neither Clinton nor her aides be charged in the episode and restated that conclusion just days before the election after his agency examined a newly discovered batch of email.   [Donald Trump could actually take steps to try to jail Hillary Clinton]   Once Trump takes office, the Republican could order his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue a case against Clinton. ""We read about these things, and we see these things in nondemocratic counties all over the world,"" Sanders, the runner-up in the Democratic primaries, said Thursday. ""That would completely divide this country. It would be an outrage. I would hope very, very, very much that Mr. Trump understands that is not something he should do."" Trump, asked about his intentions on ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, ticked off a number of other priorities for his new administration, including jobs, health care and immigration. And he suggested he didn't want to hurt Clinton. But he didn't rule out pursuing a legal case against her. ""I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do '60 Minutes' together,"" Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl.   [Hillary Clinton, in first formal talk since conceding: 'There is common ground to build upon']   During a wide-ranging discussion with reporters at the breakfast, Sanders also said that he believes there is a role for Clinton to play in the Democratic Party going forward. ""It goes without saying she has a very important role to play in the future of the Democratic Party,"" Sanders said. ""Her voice is an important voice, and it needs to be heard."" Sanders's now-famous line about Clinton's ""damn emails"" came during a primary-season debate in October 2015. ""Enough of the emails -- let's talk about the real issues facing America,"" he said at the time."

The new prime minister, Samy Badibanga, was appointed Thursday by presidential order and comes from the same party as longtime opposition figure Etienne Tshisekedi. Badibanga took part in talks with President Joseph Kabila's government in October even though his opposition party had boycotted them. Kabila's second term in office expires next month, but Congo's courts have ruled that the election can be delayed and Kabila can stay in power until a new leader is chosen. A deal reached last month calls for the vote to be held in April 2018, though the largest opposition party rejected it. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Davaapurev, a monk at the Gandan monastery in the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, said the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader's four-day visit starting Friday is for purely religious purposes. He is to receive an honorary degree, take part in religious observances and hold meetings with academics and representatives of the nation's youth, said Davaapurev, who is organizing the visit. No word was given on any meetings with political figures. The visit is ""separate from politics and for religious purposes only,"" Davaapurev said. China, landlocked Mongolia's giant southern neighbor, accuses the head of Tibetan Buddhism of seeking independence for Tibet and routinely objects to his overseas travels. Beijing has in past used the Mongolian economy's heavy dependence on trade with China as leverage, cutting off rail links and disrupting air travel during a visit by the Dalai Lama in 2006. Mongolian Buddhism is closely tied to Tibet's strain and traditionally reveres the Dalai Lama as a leading spiritual figure. However, the abbot of the rival Ikh Khuree monastery, Sanjdorj Zandan, criticized the visit as interference in Mongolia's internal affairs and said it appeared the Dalai Lama planned to name the new head of Mongolian Buddhism. Davaapurev denied any such appointment would be made. Tibetan Buddhist leaders are recognized as the reincarnations of their predecessors and their appointments can be major sources of controversy. The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet during an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, made the first of his eight visits to Mongolia in 1979, when the country was still under Communist rule.

Should I rent my house to his supporters for the inauguration?	"   Supporters hold signs and a Bible during a rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in Manchester, N.H. (Charles Krupa/Associated Press)  Over the past couple of years, I've come to depend on my home as a source of income. I'm a freelance journalist, and renting out my basement (and, sometimes, my entire house) on sites such as Airbnb alleviates a lot of pressure. For people like me, Inauguration Week can be lucrative. During busy tourist seasons, most hosts charge two to four times more per night than usual. I could make thousands of dollars -- a windfall. But I'm no longer planning to rent my home out then. Because I don't want to bring a certain kind of Donald Trump supporter into my neighborhood. Of course, I believe those coming to D.C. to celebrate Trump's victory have every right to do so. They had every right to vote for him, and every right to free speech. This isn't about being a sore loser. It's about fear.   [22 times Michelle Obama endured rude, racist, sexist or plain ridiculous attacks]   I am concerned about renting to the wrong kind of Trump celebrant, the kind of Trump supporter for whom hate trumps decency. The type who would rip off a Muslim woman's headscarf, spray a swastika with the message, ""Make America white again,"" or write, ""#go back to Africa"" and ""Whites only"" on a high school bathroom door. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 400 reports of hateful intimidation and harassment have been made since the election. In Oregon, a group of teenagers began screaming at a Muslim woman on public transportation, ""yelling at her that she was a terrorist, that our new president was going to deport her, that she can't wear her hijab anymore."" A Latina woman in Texas said a white couple yelled, ""white power"" at her as she walked her baby in a park. I have a mezuzah on my front door, and guests will quickly figure out that I am Jewish (not evident from my name). Many of my neighbors are African American, members of the LBGTQ community, Muslim, Latino. That worries me. It worries my friends, too. Salim Bhabhrawala lives a couple of doors down from me. He's engaged on our block; he created an email list to alert neighbors about crime, lost dogs and those in need of help. Once a month, he walks down the street and cleans up garbage to help make our block nicer. Last week, he sent an email to everyone on the street.      Members of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team as well as Democratic officials on Nov. 13 responded to protesters marching in several cities against Trump's election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   ""In the last 48 hours my family has experienced incidences of racial discrimination from Trump supporters,"" Bhabhrawala wrote, asking neighbors with short-term rentals not to rent to Trump supporters. ""A family friend had her hijab torn off her head in Boston just yesterday night and was told to, 'go back to your own country because Trump is in charge now!' I think it's important that we as a community draw a line in the sand and let them know that their values and racist ideals are not welcome in our community and our city.""   [Trump keeps ditching the press. But he can't succeed without transparency.]   So I will politically discriminate during inauguration week. I will host only friends, or friends of friends -- people I ""know."" And, I will not ""charge"" these guests to make a profit. I will make a donation to an organization such as Planned Parenthood or Black Lives Matter. My reasons aren't vindictive. They are protective. They are out of concern for my family, my neighbors, my city. I have never discriminated against a guest because of race, sexual orientation or religion. But I need to do something to take a stand against the hateful rhetoric that has been unleashed and, it seems, encouraged by our president-elect. As the sharing economy evolves, draws inevitable regulation and the need to resolve conflicts, we also must admit that it is very hard to answer the question I have posed to myself and my neighbors who find themselves in a similar predicament about political discrimination, safety and hosting for the Trump inauguration."

Unhappy with the election of Donald Trump, several hundred joined the rally near Yale University. ( Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post)   NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Among America's demoralized Democrats, none were more stunned at Donald Trump's electoral victory than those at the nation's left-leaning college campuses who had expected to rejoice at the rise of the first female president. Here at Yale University, a deep-blue bastion in a solid blue state, Hillary Clinton's defeat led some mournful partisans to gather outdoors on election night for a primal scream. A funereal funk then settled over the Ivy League campus as many students expressed fear at what the coming Trump administration will mean for Muslims, Mexican immigrants and other groups subject to the Republican's slashing campaign rhetoric.  ""I don't think I had really prepared myself for the abject, utter loss,"" said Theo Torres, 23, a law student from Denton, Tex. Timothy Pepler, 29, a divinity student from Windsor Locks, about an hour's drive north of campus, called it ""a level of despair I have never felt in my entire life."" Torres and Pepler joined several hundred students and others in a march through New Haven on Thursday night to show solidarity with immigrants and others who might feel threatened under Trump policies.  [Yale professor: My students aren't snowflakes, and they don't melt]  Their gloom was echoed at other colleges across the country where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where even some conservatives have voiced reservations about the president-elect and the direction he is taking the GOP. Spontaneous election-night protests on some campuses morphed into days of rallies and gatherings that included flag-burning, anti-Trump chants and tense confrontations between epithet-hurling students on both sides.  [Mobs of tearful students protesting Trump victory swarm college campuses]  Republican students here who openly backed Trump were few in number and discreet in their revelry. Emily Reinwald, 21, of Stafford, Va., co-president of Yale College Republicans, said she and another Trump supporter shook a bottle of champagne and popped the cork early Wednesday outside their campus residence. But they were careful not to gloat in front of housemates, most of whom had voted for Clinton. Reinwald acknowledged slightly mixed feelings. Her heart this year was with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a conservative Republican whom Trump defeated in the GOP primaries. ""I celebrated Hillary Clinton not winning,"" she said. ""Maybe more than I celebrated Trump winning.""    Emily Reinwald, 21, of Stafford, Va., is a Yale University student and co-president of Yale College Republicans. (Nick Anderson/The Washington Post)  The Yale College Republicans offer a telling view on the tensions Trump's candidacy generated among conservatives, especially in the climate of a largely liberal campus that has been through a year of discussion and debate about tolerance and inclusion. Although the group officially endorsed Trump this year -- unlike its counterparts at Harvard -- that decision divided its members. Some opposed to the Republican nominee fled to start what they call the Yale New Republicans.  [U-Va. College Republicans rescind support for Trump]  ""Trump hijacked our party,"" said Benjamin Rasmussen, 20, a junior from Novato, Calif., who pushed for the breakaway group. ""I personally don't think Trump is fit to lead."" Rasmussen declined to say for whom he cast his ballot, but he said it was not for the Republican. Josh Altman, 21, a senior from Armonk, N.Y., described himself as fiscally conservative and socially liberal. He is president of the Buckley Program at Yale, an organization named for the late conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. that promotes intellectual diversity on campus through forums and other events. Altman said he doesn't know which party speaks for him, but he said he voted for Clinton. ""I'd much rather be critiquing Hillary Clinton for four years than having to defend Donald Trump,"" he said.    In this file photo from Nov. 9, 2015, Yale University students and supporters participate in a march across campus to demonstrate against what they see as racial insensitivity at the Ivy League school. (Ryan Flynn/AP)  Yale, a 315-year-old school with 12,400 students and a world-class faculty, has deep connections to national politics. Despite its liberal leanings, Yale's history also reflects a strong current of conservatism that produced generations of New England Republicans. Presidents William Howard Taft, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush graduated from its college, and President Gerald Ford from its law school. Democratic President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, also are famous Yale law grads. The latest presidential campaign occurred during an exhausting year for Yale. In fall 2015, racial tensions rose on campus after students claimed that a fraternity barred black women from a party and a university instructor issued an email critique of warnings against Halloween costumes deemed culturally insensitive. In February, the university expelled a former captain of the men's basketball team, Jack Montague, after investigating an allegation against him of sexual misconduct. Montague denied wrongdoing and later sued the university, claiming a breach of contract.  In April, Yale President Peter Salovey announced that the university would not change the name of Calhoun College, a residential unit named for a 19th century U.S. vice president, John C. Calhoun, who was a staunch advocate of slavery. That decision provoked another uproar. In August, Salovey formed a committee to examine ""principles on renaming"" and indicated that he could be open to reconsidering the Calhoun name decision.  [A year after protests at Yale, here's what has changed]  Now the presidential election outcome has left many students distraught.  On election night, some emailed an economics professor, Steven Berry, to ask if he could postpone a midterm exam scheduled the next morning. He agreed to make the exam optional -- with additional stakes put onto the final exam for anyone who wanted to skip the midterm. Most ended up taking the test Wednesday.  University officials said academic work must go on. They said they would not issue exemptions, known as ""dean's excuses,"" granting students a temporary reprieve from testing requirements because of postelection trauma. ""Dean's excuses are not designed to respond to reactions, howsoever deeply felt or unsettling, to an event such as a national election,"" the dean of academic affairs, Mark Schenker, told the Yale Daily News. Instead, Schenker said, students who need help could turn to the university's mental health and counseling services. Some found solace in other ways.  On Wednesday, they grabbed colored chalk and scrawled messages on a plaza in front of Sterling Memorial Library. One read: ""#stillwithher and her and her and her and all the capable, powerful women OUT HERE."" Others papered bulletin boards anew with fliers declaring ""Love Will Trump Hate,"" and other slogans, as if in hope that the campaign could resume.  ""A lot of my friends have been crying,"" said Rita Wang, 19, a sophomore from Edison, N.J. But she has not shed any tears even though she went to the Democratic National Convention and spent hours phone-banking for Clinton. Describing her politics as ""super left,"" Wang said sometimes losing goes with the territory.     Protesters near City Hall on Church Street in New Haven, Conn. on Nov. 10.

""I'm really excited to build student power with my classmates to oppose his legislative decisions,"" she said. If Trump and the Republican Congress repeal President Obama's signature health-care law, the Affordable Care Act, Wang said, ""then I'm probably going to cry."" Maxwell Ulin, 21, a senior from Santa Monica, Calif., who is president of the Yale College Democrats, said Trump critics are talking about how to mobilize. ""People are committed to doing something,"" he said. ""They aren't just mourning, grieving, being sad."" Some Clinton supporters here said the election exposed a blind spot at Yale. As an elite institution, they said, it is not sufficiently attuned to the concerns of the massive bloc of white, working-class voters in small towns and rural areas who powered Trump's election. ""A lot of people here are out of touch with what's going on in communities that don't look like their communities,"" said Isis Davis-Marks, 19, a sophomore from New York City. ""This election made me realize how much of a liberal bubble Yale students live in,"" said Zachary Cohen, 20, a junior from New York City who edits a political journal here. That isolation left the campus largely unaware of anger and resentment elsewhere, he said.

Speaking Sunday on Fox News, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy says Republicans on Capitol Hill will focus on job creation, reforming and repealing President Barack Obama's health care law, and rebuilding's America's roads and bridges. McCarthy says he will leave any inquiries of Clinton to law enforcement. The GOP won control of both the House and Senate. Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state shadowed her presidential candidacy.

(Ben Terris/The Washington Post)  For the past year or so, the former ""Downton Abbey"" congressman has been slowly trying to rehab his image, dropping hints he'd like a chance to revive his imploded political future -- or, at the very least, to be remembered as a good guy who made ""an honest mistake."" But Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) just got news that may force even him to acknowledge his political future is almost certainly dead -- and any efforts to move on may be on hold for the moment. After a nearly 20-month federal investigation by not one but two grand juries, Schock got indicted Thursday on 24 criminal charges, ranging from theft of government funds to making false statements and filing false tax returns. The ambitious 35-year-old accused of running his congressional office like a personal-money-making machine. Schock said in a statement he'll fight the charges, just as he's spent the past year fighting being the laughingstock of Washington. Really, Schock can't help but fight. Before Schock even came to Congress, before Schock even graduated from high school -- hell, before Schock had even gotten to high school -- his ambition was so bare it was unsettling, as my colleague Terrence McCoy so eloquently chronicled this past year. Traces of that ambition have stuck around even after the rising GOP star's political career imploded. When Schock resigned from Congress last year after furor over his snazzy renovation of his Capitol Hill office, he compared himself to Abraham Lincoln.      Former congressman Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) gave his farewell speech to the House of Representatives on March 26, saying that as he goes through this ""valley in life"" he looks to former president Abraham Lincoln for inspiration. (AP)   When Schock broke his self-imposed social media ban in January, he did it to defend himself from critics who had, it's safe to assume, long forgotten about him. (Washington has a short memory when it wants to.)   More press not doing hmwrk:office painted before election,LaHood hired 2 Schock staff.Sorry facts don't=story #truth https://t.co/Cf9OaR9L3n -- Aaron Schock (@aaronschock) January 4, 2016   (A quick break for some background: The Washington Post's Ben Terris first wrote in February 2015 about Schock's elaborately designed office. Schock's team's unusually defensive response led to a host of investigations by political reporters into his exotic vacations on the taxpayer dime and questionable real estate deals. Schock -- known in Washington as ""the abs congressman"" for posing shirtless in men's magazines -- was out of office a month later, at age 33.)    Rep. Aaron Schock poses for Men's Health, May, 2011. (Men's Health)  When Schock came under federal investigation for his use of social-media-documented travel and real estate deals, he brushed any wrongdoing off as ""honest mistakes."" It was the judicial system doing the wrongdoing, he said in a statement, according to the Chicago Tribune and Associated Press. ""Like many Americans, I wanted to have faith in the integrity of our Justice Department,"" he said. ""But after this experience, I am forced to join millions of other Americans who have sadly concluded that our federal justice system is broken, corrupt, and too often driven by politics instead of facts."" Read between the lines, and you see that Schock is a man who considers himself down but not out. Perhaps it comes with the territory of thinking so highly of yourself. Except this time, even he may have to admit he's out. As I wrote earlier this year before the indictment, it's not impossible Schock could make a comeback. But it would require a careful, exacting rehab of his image. For someone like Schock, who has weathered a public disgrace, rehabbing his image is a slow -- and often excruciating -- process. He appears to be dipping his toe into that water now. In the future, though, I'd recommend Schock stop trying to re-litigate what drove him out of Congress and instead spend his time trying to figure out whether (and how) he can salvage his once-promising political career. An indictment takes things in the opposite direction, undoing whatever image rehab Schock may have spent the past year attempting. Schock is making clear that he intends to fight these charges. Fighting is what Schock does. We have to wait and see what happens in the court of law to know Schock's legal future. But we probably don't have to wait very long to know Schock's political career is definitely over. It's something even he will have a hard time denying now.      Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) resigned from Congress amid allegations he misused funds. The Washington Post's Ben Terris explains a few things lawmakers might want to avoid if they want to keep their seats.

Trump has vowed on the campaign trail to build a wall along the United States' southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. He has also described migrants crossing the border illegally as criminals and rapists. Trump met with Pena Nieto in late August in a surprise visit to Mexico City.
