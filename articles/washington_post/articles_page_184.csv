(MENAHEM KAHANA/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  Okay, you could live through the next four years. But if you have money and imagination, and are not afraid of robots, why not try one of these theme parks, cleverly designed for people not satisfied with the results of the election? We will deposit you there by helicopter and see to your every need. It is fine to live in a bubble if you pay for the privilege of living in that bubble and the security of that bubble is guaranteed by a sinister corporation.  Pastworld: This magical world transports you to the American Past, where women and minorities DEFINITELY lack the rights that only might be jeopardized under a Donald Trump presidency. But, hey, you get to see passenger pigeons, and the uncertainty is gone. Trumpworld: This is our cheapest bubble package. You will still have to live through a Trump presidency, but none of the news stories you read about it will be correct. Clintonworld: Based on the director's cut of the 2016 election, in which everything went the same but the outcome of the electoral vote was different, which apparently didn't screen well with audiences. Sit back and watch the next four years of Attempted Impeachment For No Clear Reason, rude gendered language aimed at the president, people grabbing muskets and marching indignantly on the square, and the knowledge that in the course of the campaign the level of national discourse was lowered, possibly for good. Perfectly acceptable outcome that lacks the raw edge-of-your-seat white-knuckle drama promised by the Trump years, and the little robot girls who surround you still have hope in their eyes. Obamaworld: Shut your eyes and climb into our hibernation chamber and you will awaken in 2009. President Obama is being inaugurated. And he will soon win a Nobel peace prize! The arc of history is long and it is bending toward justice! You are also seven years younger. Enjoy the next years as the country recovers, everyone acquires a smartphone, and robot hosts perform ""Hamilton"" on every screen and stage everywhere. Every so often you will hear an ominous rumbling from outside the bubble, all the power will go out, and you will see a glimpse of the Gadsden Flag as you huddle in the darkness waiting for the lights to come back. What world will exist when the power comes back up? Please, let them get the power back up quickly so that you do not have to remember that this is only a simulation. Canada: Canada is where all the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. Everyone there is polite and wears flannel. All liberal policies have been tried there and they have all succeeded. You, American, can move there any time you want. That is why this place was built. Canadians were sent there only to prepare the way for your coming. It is a paradise on earth where everyone is kind, says ""aboot,"" and greets you by covering you in maple syrup. It is Europe, for Americans. The president is a sexy maple leaf wrapped in a rainbow flag. The health care flows freely. There are no wait times. There is no prejudice. It is fall all year 'round and the rain may never fall until after sundown. Every celebrity lives there now, as promised. (This is not the Canada that exists in the real world, as you can learn if you talk to an actual Canadian. The only true Canada is in the human heart.) Jurassic World: Help, you're being chased by a real-life Tyrannosaurus rex! He's getting closer! Oh no, that was your leg. However, Donald Trump's decisions have no impact on your day-to-day life."

Small-company stocks bucked the downward trend and continued to climb, and bond yields rose to their highest level in a year. Drugmakers like Merck and biotech company Amgen took some of the biggest losses Friday. Weak results from Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch hurt retailers as investors kept a close eye on the upcoming holiday season. Small companies including regional banks continued to make large gains. Those stocks have risen sharply since the presidential election last week and are now at record highs.  ""Some of the proposals that (President-elect Donald) Trump has promoted, specifically deregulation and also some of his trade proposals, are better for small companies than potentially they are for large ones,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,867.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.90. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high early on, but turned lower and gave up 12.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,321.51. That's not a big loss, but the major indexes hadn't fallen that much since before the presidential election. Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished substantially higher this week after their big gains the week before. But indexes of smaller companies, like the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600, did better. They are on 11-day winning streaks and have hit all-time highs. Among small-company stocks, mortgage lending service company LendingTree added $6.80, or 7.3 percent, to $100 and coal miner Cloud Peak Energy rose 79 cents, or 15.8 percent, to $5.79. Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $8.20, or 4.1 percent, to $191.78 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.13, or 1.4 percent, to $145.23. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed 96 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.62. Drug company stocks are coming off their biggest weekly gain in two years. The stocks had been falling in the months leading up to the election because investors worried that under a Hillary Clinton presidency, the federal government would take steps to rein in drug prices. Those kinds of steps are less likely under a Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress. The dollar continued to climb. It's near one-year highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.63 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0599 from $1.0626. The dollar hasn't been this strong since early 2003. Nixon of Northern Trust said that's affecting big multinational companies because it can hurt their sales outside the U.S., but it's less of a problem for smaller, domestically-oriented companies. Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.30 percent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch plunged $2.33, or 13.8 percent, to $14.60 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap's said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $5.10, or 16.6 percent, to $25.61. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $4.90, or 10.8 percent, to $40.40. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.47, or 3.8 percent, to $68 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up $1.07, or 1.3 percent, to $82 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 72 cents to $83.27. Those companies have fallen since the election as investors buy companies that could benefit more from faster economic growth. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to close at $45.69 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 37 cents to $46.86 a barrel in London. Energy companies traded higher. Chevron rose $1.08, or 1 percent, to $109.20 and ConocoPhillips jumped $1.15, or 2.6 percent, to $44.76. Gold fell $8.20 to $1,208.70 an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to $16.62 an ounce. Copper dipped 2 cents to $2.47 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 14 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $2.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. France's CAC 40 fell 0.5 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.3 percent. The German DAX lost 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 percent as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.3 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Mayor Bill de Blasio (dih BLAH'-zee-oh) says at a news conference on Friday that the beefed-up security for President-elect Donald Trump will continue for at least another two months until he's inaugurated. The mayor says what happens after that depends on how Trump splits time between his high-rise apartment and the White House. The security effort has slowed motor and foot traffic outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and raised concerns among retailers that it could hurt business during the holiday shopping season. It's also prompted questions about cost. City officials say they want the federal government to chip in. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Suddenly faced with the possibility that the U.S. could withdraw from the emissions pact adopted in Paris last year, delegates at U.N. climate talks rallied in support of the landmark deal and said they would forge ahead no matter what. Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, the host of the two-week talks in Marrakech, said the conference's ""message to the new American president is simply to say, 'We count on your pragmatism and your spirit of commitment.'"" Trump said during his campaign that he would ""cancel"" an international agreement aimed at fighting climate change and withdraw American tax dollars from U.N. global warming programs. More than 190 countries, including the United States, pledged in the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for rising temperatures and sea levels, worsening droughts and heat waves. In Marrakech, delegates from China to Brazil expressed hope that Trump didn't mean what he said during his campaign. Some appealed to him directly to change his mind about the issue.  ""I renew my offer to President-elect Trump to come to Fiji and see the effects of climate change,"" said the island nation's prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, drawing applause from the conference. Small island nations are among the strongest advocates for sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions because they fear their survival depends on it. Many are already experiencing the effects of climate change, with rising seas eroding their coastlines and intruding into their freshwater supply. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said the Marrakech conference ""has demonstrated that the spirit of Paris is alive and stronger than ever."" With mostly procedural issues under negotiation, countries announced various partnerships and initiatives to show their commitment to a clean-energy transition. In a symbolic move, more than 40 vulnerable countries including small island nations and drought-hit African countries, declared they would pursue 100 percent renewable energy ""as rapidly as possible."" Many of them would require support from richer countries to switch to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Some, including the Philippines and Bangladesh, plan to expand coal power, a key source of global warming emissions, to meet their growing energy needs. Still, the declaration signaled support from even poor countries that previously had said it was up to the West, which historically has polluted the most, to reduce emissions.  ""This is a group of countries that are the most vulnerable to climate change, but they are not sitting back and complaining about being vulnerable,"" Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace said. ""They are acting and they are setting the pace for the type of change that we need to see in our world."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The plan was to stay up all night, have a bonfire and march to the U.S. Capitol to demand more funding for veterans and research for post-traumatic stress disorder. But after Tuesday's election, it morphed into something else -- a giant, 48-hour psychedelic dance party, in full view of the White House -- to deal with the ""trauma"" of electing Donald Trump as president. ""This is D.C.'s Burning Man,"" said Tim Clark, an art designer from San Diego who shipped his school bus-turned-100-foot-long-dragon from California to the District for the event. ""This is really helpful right now, I think people need this to shake off this whacky election."" While thousands have marched nightly in major cities since Tuesday, and some of those protests have turned violent, the spectacle unfolding Saturday in Washington was decidedly more mellow, but drawing a bigger audience. Dubbed ""Catharsis on the Mall,"" the event attracted a kaleidoscope of young professionals, aging hippies and those in between. It was organized by many of the same activists who led a successful ballot measure campaign two years ago to legalize marijuana in the District.   A 30-foot-tall structure dubbed the Temple of Rebirth was to be set ablaze Saturday night near the Washington Monument, in a Burning Man-inspired protest to support veterans. But federal authorities rejected a permit request for the fire. (Aaron Davis/The Washington Post)  Saturday morning there was yoga. By noontime it had shifted into a dance party for hundreds, with techno music echoing off the nearby World War II Memorial.  ""I'm just trying to let go of the anxiety from this week,"" said Anastasia Greene, 29, who works for the Wilderness Society. Dancing in a blue yoga jacket, Greene lifted her arms north toward Constitution Avenue: ""We've been talking about sending good vibes toward the White House,"" she said. Mary Burch Harmon, who works for the University of Maryland had stumbled onto the event with a group of visiting students from Argentina, the Congo, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. All stayed and began to dance. ""I'm afraid,"" Harmon said of the election results. ""I really feel scared of what's to come."" Late Saturday, the party was scheduled to culminate with a ""ritual burning"" of a wooden structure that organizers had dubbed the ""Temple of Rebirth.""  The blaze was supposed to be an homage to a similar finale at the Burning Man festival, held each year in the Nevada desert. But it won't be as big as organizers had hoped.  The National Park Service denied a request to ignite the massive, 30-foot-tall wooden structure. A federal judge sided with the government Friday, citing concerns that embers from the fire could travel across the city, igniting other structures.   A school bus turned into a 100-foot-long dragon by artists in California provided a stage for musicians and DJs Saturday during Catharsis on the Mall. (Aaron Davis/The Washington Post)  Robert ""Roman"" Haferd, an attorney for the gathering, said organizers would still light three smaller fires -- a moon, a sun and an egg, each about five feet tall by five feet wide -- to stay within park service regulations. ""The moon and the sun represent the passage of time, and the egg, renewal,"" Haferd said. ""That still carries the message."" Adam Eidinger, a pro-marijuana activist said the theme for this year's event emerged after the suicide of a District artist last year and the influence of veterans groups, which have supported marijuana legalization as a way to treat PTSD symptoms suffered by some soldiers. But Eidinger said last week's election results had reshaped the event. As organizers began erecting the ""temple"" Tuesday, they encouraged passersby to scrawl messages on the wood in marker. On Saturday, some were about personal loss and death. But many were about Trump and the election. ""I'm not white + female. Scared of Trump,"" one read. ""This is a bad hombre,"" read another. Some offered words of hope: ""Don't get mad, get active,"" ""Decency will prevail. There is still room in this world for love."" ""The theme this year was trauma, and it seems especially appropriate after the trauma we've all experienced from this election,"" Eidinger said. ""We have a diverse group, all coming together around the therapy of psychedelics."" "

Rhonda Crawford had been expected to win Tuesday's election over a write-in opponent, as she was the only name listed on the ballot. The 45-year-old can't be sworn in to the $180,000-a-year job unless she's cleared of wrongdoing. The former nurse was fired from her courthouse job and criminally charged for donning a black robe and presiding over traffic cases that should've been heard by a real judge. The Illinois Supreme Court temporarily suspended her law license. Crawford has said she'd been shadowing judges, observing how they work, when Judge Valarie Turner ""encouraged"" her to put on the robe and preside. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Elena Kountoura, Greece's alternate minister for tourism, said Monday that 2016 has been ""another great year for Greek tourism,"" with international arrivals up 7 percent in the nine months through September compared with the year before. The four summer months from July were the best ever for the sector, she said.  ""By the end of the year, international arrivals are expected to exceed 27 million, including cruise arrivals, which is a new high record for Greece,"" she said at the World Travel Market in London, the industry's biggest global gathering. That's a much-needed boost for a country that has spent the past few years mired in a debt crisis that's required successive governments to enact tough budget austerity measures in return for three massive international bailouts. Greece's tourism industry has benefited from a period of political calm this year and attracted travelers who decided not to holiday in places like Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey -- three countries that have seen extremist attacks and political volatility over the past couple of years. Tourism, which according to many measures accounts for around 25 percent of Greece's annual GDP when direct and indirect influences are incorporated, will play a key role in any economic recovery in the country. Since 2008, Greece's economy has contracted by around a quarter and seen unemployment spike to around 25 percent. It badly needs tourism revenue if it is to recover and sustainably create jobs. Vasilis Kontos, CEO of Corfu Holidays Travel, says the sector has seen a rise in interest from those who may have originally opted to holiday elsewhere in the Mediterranean. The boost in tourism numbers has helped the sector make up for hefty sales tax increases that were required by European creditors in return for last year's three-year bailout of around 80 billion euros ($89 billion). Firms opted against passing on that rise in costs in order to maintain tourist interest.  ""It's something we have had to absorb,"" he said at the World Travel Market.

The Constitutional Court ruling, announced late Sunday, blocks the return of Mohammed Dahlan to the West Bank for a possible succession battle. Dahlan was convicted in absentia of defamation after Abbas lifted his immunity in 2012. A Palestinian court threw out separate corruption charges after ruling Abbas' immunity decree was not legal. In the past, only parliament could lift a member's immunity. Parliament has been defunct since the territorial split of 2007 that left Abbas with West Bank enclaves and the rival Hamas in control of Gaza. Analyst Jihad Harb said Monday that the court enabled Abbas to go after ""anyone else who dares to challenge the power of the president."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
