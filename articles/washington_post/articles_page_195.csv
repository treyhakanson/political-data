Barbara Comstock celebrates her victory on election night (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)  Sen. Tim Kaine is all in. For reelection to the Senate in 2018, that is. And with Kaine's announcemen that he wants to stay in the Senate for quite some time, Virginia Republicans have their work cut out for them to thwart his ambition. The work begins with choosing a candidate. This column has already looked at a few contenders on the Republican side, including recently reelected Reps. Barbara Comstock and David Brat. Brat would still appear to have a slight advantage in a head-to-head match with Comstock, and Brat has already signaled his interest in running. Comstock, though, showed substantial strength in her victory over LuAnn Bennett on Nov. 8. Comstock won by almost 6 percentage points even though Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton carried the district by almost 10 percentage points. Comstock's strategy to keep her distance from Trump paid off, and she may be on her way to making the 10th as safe a House seat for her as it was for her predecessor, former Rep. Frank Wolf. Which brings us to Brat. The giant-slayer of 2014 handily won reelection on Nov. 8. Brat's numbers were down slightly from the 2014 general election, but that follows the pattern his predecessor, Eric Cantor, set in presidential-election years. Brat remains a favorite of Virginia's new Republican grassroots -- the people who distrusted Cantor for his association with Washington's status quo and demanded a change. Brat didn't hide from Trump. Brat outperformed the Republican nominee by 7 percentage points in the district, the boundaries of which had been redrawn by court order earlier in the year. On paper, Brat looks like a solid contender for the GOP nomination should he decide to seek it. But there is another possibility: former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina. In the fall, she campaigned for Virginia congressional candidates, including Comstock. Fiorina will be a featured speaker at the Republican Party of Virginia's annual meeting in Richmond next month. American Majority founder and CEO Ned Ryun told me Fiorina and Comstock are both interested in the nomination. ""Barbara Comstock [and] Carly Fiorina are two of the strongest in my mind,"" Ryun said. ""I know Carly's very interested in running. Suspect Comstock will be too,"" Ryun said. Fiorina has some knocks against her. She's already lost one Senate race, against California's Barbara Boxer in 2010. Her bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination folded before the South Carolina primary. A Fiorina bid for the Senate, then, carries both the baggage of failure, and a whiff of carpetbagging. Not exactly the stuff of which successful statewide campaigns are made. Looming over all this, however, is Trump. By 2018, Trump will be well into his presidential term. There is no way of knowing what the political ground will look like then. But if Trump is flaming out, Kaine would look like a shoo-in for reelection, regardless of whom Republicans nominate. But if Trump manages to exceed the admittedly low expectations for his presidency, then Kaine - who has never lost an election in Virginia - might just feel the heat of a competitive race. Given Northern Virginia's leading role in Democratic statewide victories, then, Republicans need a candidate who can break the blue wall. Fiorina may have some star power. Brat may have an affinity for the base. But Comstock may yet emerge as the candidate to beat for the GOP nomination. She's a proven winner in vote rich Northern Virginia and is hedged against a possible Trump debacle. Brat, Comstock and Fiorina have plenty of time to weight their options. But the clock on the 2018 Senate race is already ticking."

(Joseph Victor Stefanchik/for The Washington Post)  There's a long list of people who are expected to benefit from a Trump presidency: alt-righters and Rudolph W. Giuliani, to name a few. Add to that list: some bar and restaurant owners in Georgetown. Of course parts of Georgetown are getting psyched for a Trump presidency. In a city where 93 percent of voters picked Hillary Clinton, Georgetown and Upper Northwest are where most of our Republicans live. It's where the young-staffer social scene was concentrated during the Bush administration. And it's where some restaurateurs are hoping and praying they'll return under Trump. ""I've seen Georgetown on a steady decline for the past eight years,"" said restaurateur Bo Blair. ""I do think that this change in administration will invigorate Georgetown and hopefully re-energize it."" Blair would know. His Georgetown bar Smith Point became the epicenter of young Republican Washington during George W. Bush's presidency because it was a frequent hangout for first daughters Jenna and Barbara. Ivanka and Eric Trump, both of whom attended Georgetown, went to his club, too, he says. It was also the base of a short-lived conservative social scene called Late Night Shots, which became notorious for its racist and misogynistic online message boards, where members posted about boat shoes, luxury cars and, in the words of one user, ""Figuring out if girls are sluts."" But Smith Point has struggled during the Obama years, and Blair said he had been trying to sell it. He changed his mind after the election and is now planning renovations to attract newcomers. ""I think a preppy, conservative place in Georgetown is hopefully what some of them will be looking for,"" said Blair, who considers himself an independent. Cafe Milano, a longtime favorite haunt of politicians on both sides of the aisle, is also gearing up for a busy season. ""Everybody says Republicans have a tendency to spend more,"" said Franco Nuschese, the restaurant's owner. He's already booked most of the restaurant's private rooms for inauguration weekend.    Jose Andres is moving his America Eats Tavern, now in Tysons Corner, to Georgetown. (Scott Suchman/for The Washington Post)  The neighborhood has ebbed and flowed. It got its start as a working-class black neighborhood, before being gentrified in the 1940s. In the '60s, it was synonymous with Kennedy-era dinner parties. Elegant restaurants followed, and so did the rowdy, drunken 20-somethings of the early Aughts. But with the closing of several major restaurants, including Citronelle, as well as the attention paid to 14th Street and Shaw, Georgetown hasn't gotten as much attention in recent years. Even before the election, big-name restaurateurs made plans to branch into the neighborhood. Jose Andres recently announced he would move America Eats Tavern from Tysons Corner to Georgetown. His former Minibar chef, Johnny Spero, is opening Reverie there next year. A longtime liquor license moratorium for the neighborhood expired this year, opening the door to more restaurants and bars. Lauren Boston, communications director for the Georgetown Business Improvement District, resisted the idea that the neighborhood's fortunes might be tied to Trump. ""We have a diverse political spectrum here and welcome everyone to dine and shop in Georgetown,"" she said.     The dining room at BLT Prime, overlooking the lobby of the Trump International Hotel. (Dixie Vereen/for The Washington Post)  The Obama Effect Trump himself may never even set foot in the neighborhood. His effect on the local restaurant scene certainly won't echo that of the Obamas, who are credited with breathing new life into boring old Washington.  But many changes attributed to the Obama Effect are the result of market forces -- an improving economy, a nationwide trend of young people moving into urban centers, and the fruition of developments, such as CityCenter, that had been planned during the Bush years. ""We all love the involvement that the president had in the city, but I would not say that the boom happened because of that alone,"" Andres said. ""Washington, its destiny was to have the boom. I was opening restaurants before Obama came here."" Still, the Obamas' presence at a restaurant was a boon for business. ""They were young, they dined out, they wanted to be part of the city,"" said Ashok Bajaj, owner of the Oval Room, Rasika and other restaurants the Obamas visited. ""They visited those places and gave their endorsement. It's very good for me."" If there's a Trump Effect, it's likely to mostly benefit BLT Prime in the Trump International Hotel, which has the potential to become the center of the Republican social scene. Jane Freundel Levey, a historian for the Historical Society of Washington, D.C., imagines ""little bursts of Trumpian socializing and excess"" there. Nuschese, on the other hand, says that because the hotel has gotten so much attention, it will be too public for politicians to dine there often. ""The people who eat every single day and entertain, I don't think they will want to be around that,"" he said. Besides, the hotel has become a center of protest, too. And as with Trump's other businesses, it has raised the hackles of ethics watchdogs, since the Trump family stands to benefit from its elevated stature. ESquared Hospitality, parent company of BLT Prime, declined to comment.    Security staff guard the 21 Club in New York while President-elect Donald Trump dines inside. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)  Will his children set trends? Given what we know about Trump's habits, it's unlikely he will follow Obama's lead as a man-about-town. He has a well-known distaste for Washington. In the second presidential debate, he called it a ""violent"" place. He has repeatedly referred to the federal government here as a ""swamp"" to drain. And the Trumps have hinted they will be only part-time residents of our city, anyway. The New York Times reported that he wants to split his time between the District and New York, with some stints at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. He's also a notorious germaphobe and an unadventurous eater, preferring fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, and steakhouses, such as New York's 21 Club, that will cook him a well-done slab of meat. For obvious reasons, it's also hard to envision Trump eating immigrant food, as George H.W. Bush did with his penchant for Peking Gourmet Inn, or the Obamas with their love of Rasika. He'll probably just go to his own hotel. His children are another story. ""Maybe they will set the trends, and people will follow them,"" Bajaj said. ""Hopefully they will go out as much as President Obama."" Bajaj and other restaurateurs from immigrant backgrounds are prepared to welcome Trump and his children. That includes Andres, who is mired in litigation with the president-elect after Andres canceled his plans to put a restaurant in Trump's hotel after Trump called Mexican immigrants ""rapists."" ""I'm a guy that believes in second and third opportunities,"" Andres said.    Washington's 14th Street NW, now home to a slew of popular restaurants, including Le Diplomate, was quite a different scene during the last Republican administration. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  The staffers who move to Washington to work for the administration will probably participate in local culture more than Trump will. Georgetown was the obvious choice for them in 2000 because neighborhoods like the more-diverse 14th Street and Shaw didn't have as many amenities. Now that there are excellent bars and restaurants throughout the city, it's likely that Trump staffers will go to those, too. ""Tons of people that are coming to town have never been to 14th Street or Barracks Row or tried Rose's Luxury,"" Blair said. ""It's exciting to have a whole new group of people try all these places that have come alive."" How well those staffers integrate with the city's Democratic population remains to be seen. Still, even though the city probably won't change too drastically, ""I think there's going to be even more hunkering down than ever,"" Levey said. In previous administrations, there was more bipartisan socializing, particularly at dinner parties. ""That style is gone, and that's a shame, because we need that more than ever, if we're going to be able to talk to each other again,"" she said.   More from Food:   Have questions about cooking?

The girl died last month, and her wishes were carried out. Here are questions and answers about the unusual case and the technology involved: WHY WAS THE CASE IN COURT? The matter had to be resolved in the Family Division of the court because the girl was a minor of 14 whose divorced parents did not agree on what should be done with her body. Her lawyer, Zoe Fleetwood, told The Associated Press that there would have been no legal issue if the girl had been 18 or older. The disagreement between the parents made resolution much more difficult and the judge in the case, Peter Jackson, was charged with deciding what course of action was in the girl's best interest. He was persuaded in part by a heartbreaking letter she wrote in which she said she did not want to die and clearly expressed the wish to try cryopreservation. DOES THAT MEAN THE JUDGE BELIEVES SHE CAN BE REVIVED IN THE FUTURE? Absolutely not. The judge said his ruling was based on what was best for the girl, not a judicial finding on the validity of cryopreservation as a way to extend life. He did not attempt to decide whether there is a realistic hope of being brought back to life. The judge was clearly impressed with the girl and said there was no doubt that she was mentally capable of filing a lawsuit even though she was too weak to appear in court. He said it may be the first case of its kind in the world. But even if it is, it is unlikely to have many legal ramifications since it dealt only with the specific issues facing this family, not the broader ethical, medical and financial issues raised by the cryogenic preservation technique. HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO KEEP HER REMAINS PRESERVED? She chose a basic option at a cost of about 37,000 pounds ($46,000). Her remains have been flown to the United States, where a number of companies offer cryopreservation. The details of where her remains have been placed, and who is paying for the preservation, are being kept private by the family, as are the details of the cancer that killed her. The Arizona-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation is one of the best known facilities in the United States offering the service. Its website says preservation is ""surprisingly affordable."" The preservation technique is also offered in Russia. DOES IT WORK? Not yet. It may never be possible, but devotees believe it may be viable in the future as medical research continues to advance at a startling pace. It is true there have been tremendous advances in using ultra-low temperatures to preserve living cells. This has helped with the preservation of blood cells, sperm and embryos. Researchers have cleared a number of hurdles to come this far -- but they concede that cryopreservation cannot at the moment be used to preserve large structures like human organs. There is a long, long way to go and as yet no evidence that a whole human body can be preserved and revived. ARE FAMILY DISPUTES COMMON IN CASES INVOLVING CRYOPRESERVATION? Very few have received publicity, but there were disagreements over using the preservation technique among Ted Williams' children after the Baseball Hall of Famer died in 2002. The issues that led to a court battle were different and didn't involve a minor -- he was 83 when he died of cardiac arrest. His remains have been cryopreserved at a facility in Arizona.

(Andrew Kelly/Reuters)  NPR Justice Correspondent Carrie Johnson this morning posted a note on Twitter to promote her story -- along with Camila Domonoske -- on Donald Trump's choice of Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general in his administration.   Sen. Jeff Sessions, an early Trump backer, is now the pick for Attorney General. https://t.co/t3lK0F79U1 -- Carrie Johnson (@johnson_carrie) November 18, 2016   An individual on Twitter responded, surprise, with some attitude:   @johnson_carrie @nprgreene A pre-election story on Trump's likely picks would've been nice. Maybe there's another email story you could do? -- Brohamand (@brohamand) November 18, 2016   A reporter's job is to inform, which Johnson proceeded to do:   Actually I did a story months ago on what a Trump doj might look like. Perhaps you missed it. https://t.co/vFFyxkCQKh -- Carrie Johnson (@johnson_carrie) November 18, 2016   On Aug. 2, Johnson published a story titled, ""What Would Donald Trump's Department Of Justice Look Like?"" The story's lede alone sounds as if it would have pleased Johnson's Twitter critic: ""The Department of Justice has broad-ranging powers to decide who gets prosecuted with the full weight of the federal government,"" writes the correspondent. ""And some of the rhetoric used on the campaign trail this year, especially by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, worries some department veterans about the possibility of major political interference in law enforcement by the next administration."" Spirited Twitter exchanges happen thousands of times per day, of course. What makes this one worth highlighting is the feeling among Hillary Clinton advocates that the media gave Trump some kind of pass. Campaign chairman John Podesta, according to CNN, cited a ""hostile press corps"" in a conference call last week. And so did Trump: Stories casting doubt on every aspect of Trump's biography -- treatment of women, exploration of business in Cuba, ties to mob figures, affection for Vladimir Putin's Russia, history of racial discrimination at Trump properties, bogus charity claims, failure to read, tax issues, failure to pay contractors, extreme litigiousness, application to build a sea wall at one of his golf courses over concerns about climate change -- crowded the media before and after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination. It's all there in the archives, just like Johnson's story on worries about Trump abuses in the Justice Department."

"   Sen.-elect Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) thanks supporters after winning his race at an election night rally in Indianapolis on Tuesday. (Michael Conroy/AP)  The Senate will remain in Republican control, after Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) beat out his Democratic challenger, Jason Kander, dashing the Democrats' hopes of a return to power in Congress next year. The House will also remain in Republican control next year, after Democrats made only modest pickups there. While a couple of races were still outstanding as of 5:30 a.m. Wednesday, Republican wins in competitive states left no viable pathway for Senate Democrats to seize control from the GOP, despite earlier polling that suggested they were likely to do so. Under a Donald Trump presidency, a Republican Congress and White House will be able to attempt sweeping rollbacks of President Obama's landmark policies, including the health-care law known as Obamacare and last year's nuclear deal struck with Iran. The Senate Democrats' threat of a filibuster would, in many instances, be the only viable way to block such legislative efforts. Democrats had to pick up at least four seats if Hillary Clinton became president, and five under Trump, to seize the Senate majority. They never came close.   [Trump's White House win promises to reshape U.S. political landscape]   Democrats picked up only one seat, in Illinois, where current Rep. Tammy Duckworth unseated incumbent Republican Sen. Mark Kirk. Of the competitive races, it was the seat most likely to flip to Democratic control. Democrats also won a competitive Senate race in Nevada, where former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto beat Republican Rep. Joseph J. Heck. But the seat, which is being vacated by retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid, already belonged to Democrats. Democrats maintained a shot early Wednesday at eking out a victory in New Hampshire, where Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan were running neck-and-neck with almost 90 percent of precincts reporting. But elsewhere, Democrats did not score the victories they had hoped for. In Pennsylvania, Republican incumbent Sen. Patrick J. Toomey flouted almost all polling in the days before the election showing him closely losing to his Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, while in Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson defeated former senator and favored Democratic candidate Russ Feingold to hold onto his seat. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr prevailed after coming under a serious challenge from Democrat Deborah Ross, holding an important seat for the GOP. Burr, the Senate's top Republican on intelligence matters, including cybersecurity, has comfortably kept his seat for two terms. Democrats had hoped to oust him in a wave of swing-state victories to take back the Senate majority. Democrats also suffered losses in other Senate races they had sought to contest more closely during the campaign season. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain cruised to an easy victory Tuesday night over his Democratic challenger, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, despite months of polls showing the two were neck-and-neck. McCain had broken ahead of Kirkpatrick in the most recent polls, but the race was still considered to be among the more competitive ones in the country. And in Indiana, Republican Rep. Todd C. Young beat Democrat Evan Bayh, who served two terms in the Senate and hails from one of Indiana's most powerful political families. He was recruited as one of the Democrats' stronger candidates but ultimately fell short against Young, a three-term congressman from the southern part of the state.      The Fix's Chris Cillizza breaks down why Republican Todd Young's win in Indiana's Senate race is important. Young defeated Democrat Evan Bayh, a former Indiana governor who held the Senate seat for 12 years. (The Washington Post)   In Florida, Republican Marco Rubio, who ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign earlier this year, was also reelected to his Senate seat Tuesday night, keeping it in the GOP's column as he overcame a challenge from Democrat Rep. Patrick Murphy. House races in Florida yielded mixed results. Florida Democrat Stephanie Murphy staged an upset against one of the GOP's veteran members, Republican John L. Mica, who has held his seat since 1993. Mica's race in part was fueled by redistricting that led to a defeat for the normally safe incumbent, who ultimately lost by nearly three points.      Republican Marco Rubio celebrates winning his Senate re-election bid in Florida, beating Democrat Patrick Murphy. (Reuters)   Democrats also picked up a House seat in Florida from Republican Rep. David Jolly, who lost his reelection battle to former Florida governor Charlie Crist. Crist, who was a Republican and an independent while governor, joined the Democratic Party in 2012. But Democrats lost the House seat being vacated by Patrick Murphy -- who lost to Rubio in the Senate race -- when Florida Republican Brian Mast defeated Democrat Randy Perkins. In Virginia, Republicans also overcame a Democratic effort to oust Rep. Barbara Comstock, who easily rode to a nine-point victory over Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett. In general, House Democrats were frustrated and disappointed at less-than-expected gains.

Many Democrats had charged that Comey's decision was politically motivated, and Pelosi said Tuesday that it had a ""definite impact"" on Democrats' efforts to seize more congressional seats. In the House, it was possible that Democrats could knock out one of the GOP's chief attack dogs against the Obama administration in California's Darrell Issa, who as the former chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was banging the GOP's Benghazi drum before there was a Benghazi committee. If Issa loses to Democrat Doug Applegate, a former Marine colonel whose camp has ridiculed Issa's recent attempts to recast himself as a friend of the Obama administration, it could be the Democrats' biggest House upset of the night. Some Democratic gains came in urban areas where Trump's candidacy created negative headwinds: In Illinois's 10th, Rep. Bob Dold (R) lost to Democratic challenger, former congressman Brad Schneider, while in New Jersey's 5th District, Rep. Scott Garrett (R) lost to Democratic challenger Joshua Gottheimer. But in Iowa's 1st District -- another bellwether -- Republican Rep. Rod Blum held out against Democratic challenger Monica Vernon. Other competitive House races were all over the country, from New Hampshire to Nevada. The race in New Hampshire's 1st District was called after 4 a.m. Wednesday, with former Democratic congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter defeating incumbent Republican Frank Guinta. In Nevada's 3rd District, Democrat Jacky Rosen defeated Republican Danny Tarkanian, while in the 4th District, Democrat Ruben Kihuen beat incumbent Republican Rep. Cresent Hardy. In general, Democrats performed better in Nevada, which boasts a large Latino voting population, than they did nationwide. Early Wednesday morning returns were inconclusive in Minnesota's 2nd District, where Democrats backing Angie Craig tried to link Republican talk radio host Jason Lewis to Trump over his comments about ""not-thinking"" women and ""cultural suicide"" by the ""white population."" One of them will replace outgoing Rep. John Kline (R). In the Senate, meanwhile, the parties held onto their seats in other high-profile races. Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who just a few months ago was on the shortlist of incumbents most in danger of losing their seats, was reelected to a second term in one of the earliest races to be called Tuesday night. And in Iowa, Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley won a seventh term over Democrat Patty Judge, despite earlier fears that his tenure was in jeopardy.   [Map: Senate results]   In Maryland, Democrat Chris Van Hollen was elected to his first term as a U.S. senator in the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D), while in California, Democrat Kamala Harris was elected to her first term in the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer (D). Democratic Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), who is expected to replace Reid as the Senate's top Democrat next year, won a fourth term, while Washington Democrat Patty Murray, also a member of the leadership team, won her fifth term. The Senate's No. 3 Republican, John Thune (S.D.), was reelected to his third. In Georgia, Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson was reelected to a third term in a race against Democratic challenger Jim Barksdale. While Isakson was not in grave danger of losing his seat, it was not clear that he would pass an important 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff until the last days of the election. Elsewhere in the Senate, Vermont's Democratic Sen. Patrick J. Leahy was reelected to his eighth term, while Alabama Republican Sen. Richard C. Shelby won his sixth, and Idaho Republican Mike Crapo won his fourth. Republicans Tim Scott of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii were reelected to their first full terms in the Senate, while Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republicans Rand Paul (Ky.), Mike Lee (Utah), Jerry Moran (Kan.), John Boozman (Ark.), and John Hoeven (N.D.) each won a second Senate term. Colorado Democrat Michael F. Bennet was also reelected to his second full Senate term, while Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden was reelected to his fourth full term. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was reelected to her third full term, while the Senate race to replace outgoing Sen. David Vitter (R) in Louisiana will head to a December runoff between Republican John Kennedy and Democrat Foster Campbell. The outcome of that runoff, in which the Republican is favored, will not affect which party holds the majority in the Senate. Mike DeBonis contributed to this report."

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        ""I just want to make sure,"" my editor asked me as he closed the door to his office. ""He definitely grabbed her?"" It had to be the 50th time I'd heard this question, and each time it filled me with unspeakable anxiety. Yes, he grabbed her. It happened three days earlier, in the chandelier-lit ballroom of Donald Trump's golf club in Jupiter, Fla. Trump had just won the state's primary, and he was celebrating in a ballroom full of Trump-branded products: steaks, water, even a magazine. After the speech, Michelle Fields, a reporter for Breitbart, approached Trump with a question about affirmative action, when Corey Lewandowski, then Trump's campaign manager, took her by the arm and yanked her from the candidate. It happened right in front of me. And yet, even though I saw it, the Trump team's response -- to claim it never happened at all -- would become a small preview of a strategy the campaign would return to again and again on a much larger scale this year: Bully, don't back down, do whatever you can to muddy up the facts. It was a type of lie that has lived at the center of the Trump campaign. This was not simply a misreading of history, an embellishment of biography, or a dishonest interpretation of a piece of legislation. It was a flat-out denial of something that undeniably happened.      The Jupiter, Fla. police department released a video that appears to show Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, grabbing Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Lewandowski was charged with battery by police on March 29. (Jupiter Police Department)   Later in the year, Trump would employ these same tactics to deal with a flurry of crises, most recently to combat numerous accusations of sexual misconduct. By most accounts, Trump lies at a rate much higher than Hillary Clinton, but he does it with such confidence that he's still seen as more trustworthy than his opponent. From an outside vantage point, it can be difficult to tell fact from fiction. From the inside, it's even more disorienting. After I left the primary night event in Jupiter, the story about Lewandowski leaked out on Twitter before I wrote it. Once it was out there, the campaign set about on a coordinated effort to discredit Fields and me. Lewandowski called Fields ""delusional"" and said he ""never even met [her]."" Surrogates pointed to Zapruder-like footage that they said exonerated the campaign manager, and aides issued a statement that claimed ""not a single reporter"" saw the incident. In the moment, I was sure it happened. I asked Fields if she was okay. (She was bruised and a bit rattled.) I told her it was Lewandowski who had grabbed her. There was no question. But by the time my editor asked me about it three days later, doubt had started to creep in. Trump had suggested Fields was probably making it up, and nobody else had corroborated my account. If it had really happened, Trump and his surrogates maintained, why wasn't there any footage? * * * Of course the 2016 election, this psychological battlefield of a campaign, would introduce ""gaslighting"" into the political lexicon. Until recently, the term has been reserved mostly for a form of domestic abuse wherein one partner, through lies and charm, persuades another that the things she's seen and heard simply did not happen. Reporters and political junkies experienced this in a collective way during the vice-presidential debate in October, when Gov. Mike Pence (R-Ind.), Trump's running mate, shook his head ""no"" to the charge that Trump had praised Vladimir Putin. He denied that Trump had suggested more nations get nuclear weapons, that Trump had proposed a ""deportation force"" to go after undocumented immigrants, and that Trump wanted to punish women for having abortions. Never mind that the political press, along with many others, had watched the Republican nominee say all these things in the preceding weeks and months, and it was all on tape. Trump's running mate used ""polish and confidence,"" wrote Jamelle Bouie in Slate, ""to deny Trump's rhetoric and behavior and gaslight the country that has borne witness to them."" Gaslighting can be frighteningly effective, especially on a person who has a realistic sense of humility about perception and memory. Reporters are trained to apply skepticism to sources who rely on their memories; when you're the source, this skepticism can turn inward. I know, because on a very small scale, it happened to me. In the days after the grabbing incident, I started reading articles about the science behind false witness accounts. (Did you know that in 2012 researchers found that there were more than 2,000 false convictions over the past 23 years? Can you guess the number one reason?) After I wrote up my version of what happened, Joel Pollak, one of Fields's colleagues at Breitbart, published a ""Loose Change""-style analysis of several videos and still photographs purporting to prove the events""could not possibly have happened as Ben Terris reported."" As the story plowed through multiple news cycles, people kept asking me if I was 100 percent sure I saw it happen. I had my memory, and I had a record of my conversation with Fields after the incident. Still, absolute certainty is an uncomfortable feeling for a journalist. It should be hard to say something definitely happened, just as it should be hard to say something ""could not possibly have happened."" I turned down dozens of television interviews on the subject. I worried I might say something like: ""No, I'm not 100 percent certain of my account because I've never been 100 percent certain about anything."" And then I'd find a Breitbart headline like: ""WaPo reporter no longer sure he saw what he said he saw."" A few days later, video from Trump's own security cameras finally surfaced that clearly showed Lewandowski grabbing Fields by the arm and yanking her away from Trump.      The Jupiter, Fla. police department released a video that appears to show Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, grabbing Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Lewandowski was charged with battery by police on March 29. (Jupiter Police Department)   I thought that would put the issue to rest, but I was wrong. The video demonstrated that Lewandoski and his allies had lied about what happened, but Trump supporters used the same video to ""prove"" that Lewandowski was vindicated. ""He barely touched her"" became a common refrain.   [Donald Trump loves conspiracy theories. So do his supporters.]   In a sense, the Trump campaign played it brilliantly, intentionally or not. First they asked why, if Fields had really been grabbed, she didn't go to the police. When she called that bluff and filed a report, they then painted her as having overreacted to a relatively minor altercation. (Fittingly enough, it turned out nothing in that Florida ballroom was what it seemed: The glossies weren't really Trump Magazine, but a glorified pamphlet handed out to visitors at various Trump properties. The Trump water was bottled by another company. The Trump steaks were replicas of a product Trump once sold and doesn't anymore; the campaign hadn't even bothered to remove the wrapping from the real company, Bush Brothers, that had provided them.) Meanwhile, Trump's aides just kept trying out different excuses. At one point, they said Lewandowski was simply protecting his boss from Fields, who they claimed was coming at him with an unknown object, perhaps ""a little bomb."" It was a pen. * * * All this happened back in March. It was still primary season, and the real estate mogul was in the process of transforming from spoiler to standard-bearer. His campaign was aggressive, but mainly in its rhetorical posturing. Most journalists had not yet started to focus on the women Trump himself might have grabbed, nor by what part of the anatomy. But today, Trump's form of crisis management feels particularly familiar. When numerous women accused Trump of sexual harassment this fall, he said that he had never even met them (no matter that one of them profiled him for People magazine and another had been on ""The Apprentice"" with him). Trump encouraged voters to ""check out"" the sex tape of Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who accused him of calling her ""Miss Piggy,"" even though no such tape appeared to exist. And one of Trump's spokeswomen said it was impossible for him to have groped another woman on an airplane because armrests didn't move up and down at the time (which proved to be not only ridiculous, but also untrue).   [We already know what Trump does when he loses: He acts like it never happened.]   The Trump campaign has told many lies since Lewandowski lied about grabbing Fields in that Florida ballroom. Trump lied in front of millions by claiming that Hillary Clinton's campaign started rumors that President Obama was foreign-born (it didn't). He lied when he said he started his business with a ""very small loan"" from his father (which is only true if you consider $14 million a small loan). Professional fact-checkers have checked hundreds of Trump's statements and judged him to be less truthful than any presidential candidate they have seen. And yet, he's got an ability to come across as a truth-teller, at least to his supporters: 87 percent of Republicans see him as more honest and trustworthy than Clinton. When I spoke with Fields last week, she told me that at the time even she began questioning her own account, despite having the bruises to prove it. ""The Trump campaign did everything they could to get me to question my own reality,"" she said. ""You don't think that will ever happen to you, but it did."" It's been a hard few months for Fields. She lost her job at Breitbart, and though she now works for the Huffington Post, she admits she's begun questioning the power of the press. She had her phone number and apartment address posted online and received death threats. And watching Trump battle with his recent female accusers has only made things worse. ""It broke my heart,"" Fields said when I met up with her recently. ""He was attacking these women, and I remember thinking that I knew what they felt like: completely powerless. You know the truth, and you are watching this person lie to millions of people, and what can you do?"" What worries Fields is that if Trump can get people to second-guess their own experiences, imagine how effective he can be convincing people who weren't even there. It's the kind of power that can get someone elected president. ""Trump gaslighted me,"" Fields said. ""I worry now that he's gaslighting the country.""

(Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP Images)  In the race for the White House, the climate change debate has been more or less missing in action. In the race for a central Texas House seat, the Democrat hoping to topple 30-year incumbent Republican Lamar Smith has made global warming his top campaign issue. Democrat Tom Wakely is campaigning as a champion of climate science in a year when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- and most other candidates for Congress, for that matter -- have barely touched on the issue, in what is shaping up to be the hottest year on record. Wakely has seized on a theme that has defined Smith's run in Washington as chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: He's a climate change skeptic. Smith, 68, an attorney from San Antonio who's represented the area northwest of the city since 1987, rejects the scientific consensus that man-made pollution is behind global warming. He's used his perch as committee chairman to subpoena federal climate scientists to discredit their research, issuing a record number of legal summonses this Congress and turning a panel that was once a sleepy backwater into an aggressive attack dog. [Meet the House science chairman who's trying to put global warming on ice] This has made Smith a polarizing figure in Washington, beloved by oil and gas interests who give generously to his campaigns and vilified by those fighting to reduce global warming pollution. Now his attacks on scientists are percolating back home in a district buffeted in recent years by drought and water shortages and alternate floods. And while Smith does not often highlight his views on climate change on the campaign trail, Wakely, a little-known Democratic activist, saw an opening this year.    Democrat Tom Wakely campaigns in the 21st House District in Texas, which has been held by Republican Lamar Smith since 1987. (Tom Wakely campaign)  ""Lamar Smith is the major impediment to anything being done on climate change in Congress and absolutely nobody is talking about it,"" said the 63-year-old Air Force veteran and former union organizer who supported Bernie Sanders. ""People in this district are slowly getting the message that climate change is not a far left wing conspiracy."" Wakely has little shot at unseating Smith, who is running for a 16th term in a safely red district. But his campaign isn't the only sign that Smith's stance on global warming is raising some eyebrows back home. Smith has long won the support of local newspapers. But this year, his hometown paper, the San Antonio Express-News, refused to endorse him for reelection, citing his ""bullying tactics"" on climate change. ""We've argued that Smith's undeniably conservative credentials have been a good fit for the 21st congressional District,"" the editorial board wrote on Oct. 17. ""However, Smith's actions have developed more transparently this term into an issue that goes beyond the boundaries of his district. A particular issue is his abuse of his position as chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. Specifically, it is his bullying on the issue of climate change that should concern all Americans."" The Express-News is one of Texas's largest newspapers. The editorial cited Smith's threat to Kathryn Sullivan, chief of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of criminal charges if she did not release her scientists' internal communications about a landmark study they released last year refuting the long-held view of a  global warming pause. The Express-News did not endorse Wakely, though, saying he is not a good fit for the conservative district. Texas's 21st, which stretches from parts of San Antonio to parts of Austin through rural Hill Country, has been safely red for years, thanks to redistricting that has given Republicans a generous electoral advantage. Smith was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Donald Trump and has stood by the nominee, who is favored to win central Texas. Like Trump, he says the U.S. has not done enough to secure the border with Mexico and is co-sponsoring legislation to keep out Syrian refugees. This Congress, Smith has shown a willingness to go beyond the boundaries of the science committee's traditional jurisdiction, subpoenaing attorneys general and environmental groups investigating whether oil giant ExxonMobil covered up what it knew of the dangers of climate change and launching an investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state. He has also demanded records from the Environmental Protection Agency to undermine President Obama's regulations to reduce emissions from power plants. [NOAA chief tells lawmaker: 'No one will coerce the scientists who work for me'] ""As Chairman, I have an obligation to conduct vigorous oversight of agencies and programs within my jurisdiction,"" Smith said in a statement to the Post. ""Under that umbrella, I work to ensure that federal agencies base their regulations and policy decisions on the best available science and not on partisan politics.""

He served early in his career on a school board in southern Wisconsin. He says he was motivated to make climate change a core issue because his granddaughter has asthma and he worries about pollution. He argues that global warming is keenly felt by voters in the district, who have been faced in recent years with long droughts and severe water shortages. ""We're talking about water,"" Wakely said. ""That resonates with everybody. It's part of the changing climate.""   This morning @PedernalesCoop members shared with me how EPA regulations will affect the power supply and costs to Hill Country customers pic.twitter.com/cz0jmqrQFs -- Lamar Smith (@LamarSmithTX21) October 24, 2016   In a district with a large military presence, Wakely also says he will fight for faster benefits and better health care for veterans. Smith did not face a Democratic opponent two years ago. He has always won reelection with at least 60 percent of the vote. While the district is now 28 percent Latino, a demographic trend that could favor a Democrat, a smaller percentage of these residents are registered to vote. While the economy of the Lone Star state is heavily reliant on the fossil fuel industry, energy companies are not a huge presence in the 21st district. Still, Smith calls climate science an economic threat to his constituents. ""The Obama administration along with climate alarmists have long pursued climate policies that would cost Americans billions of dollars and put hard working people in my district out of a job,"" he said. Smith has raised $1.4 million this election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org, while Wakely has brought in $64,400, much of it in small contributions. ClimateHawksVote, a political action committee that endorses candidates who fight global warming, has identified Wakely as its top ""message"" candidate this year. [Congressman now threatens to subpoena commerce secretary over global warming report] A 2014 estimate by the nonprofit Yale Program on Climate Change Communication of attitudes toward the issue found that 65 percent of people in Texas's 21st district believe global warming is happening, similar to 63 percent nationwide. The estimate, based on a statistical model using national surveys, also said 49 percent believe that global warming is caused mostly by human activities, while 33 percent think it is caused by natural environmental changes. Those numbers roughly mirror national data. Mark Jones, a political scientist at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, said he doubts climate change is a top voter concern in the district. ""I think it's driven from within for Smith, more by his personal beliefs,"" Jones said. Texas is one of ten states that allow straight ticket voting, where general election voters can choose every candidate in a political party who is on the ballot. With Trump favored to win the 21st district, this makes Wakely's challenge tougher."
