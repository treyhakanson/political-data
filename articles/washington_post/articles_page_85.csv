Rockville Police spokesman Maj. Michael England says the 15-year-old Richard Montgomery High School student wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" cap was participating in the walk-out Wednesday with about 300 to 500 students from the school. Students marched to the county courthouse carrying signs and chanting ""Love Trumps Hate!"" England says the teen's argument with one person turned violent and four others jumped in. He says the student was ""woozy"" and couldn't remember what happened, but England believes the teen's injuries are minor. No charges were filed, but the incident is under investigation. England says the crowd was otherwise peaceful. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

But huddled over the trunk of a Toyota Camry as he put the final touches on a posterboard sign, he vowed that he and his fellow Californians would fight. ""California is not gonna take this,"" he said as he held the sign, which read ""F--- Trump."" Then Guerrero, a 30-year-old artist, walked toward the sidewalk in front of a gas station parking lot, where he and a few dozen others protested, chanted, and waved Mexican flags amid a haze of exhaust and marijuana smoke. They crossed a six-lane highway as passersby honked their horns and pumped their fists out open windows.  California has long been in the vanguard of American politics, routinely enacting liberal legislation and policies long before the rest of the nation and a hotbed of support for Democrats such as Hillary Clinton. But in the aftermath of an election in which the country as a whole shifted to the right, the Golden State is now out of step with the rest of the nation by moving even farther to the left.

The electoral map illustrates the United States' geographical and political divides in bright red and blue relief. But nowhere on Tuesday was the gulf between liberals and the conservative tack that won the electoral college more stark than here in California and other parts of the far West. Nevada chose Clinton over Trump, an outcome driven in large part by the state's growing Latino population. It was one of the few states to send a new Democrat to the Senate, Catherine Cortez Masto, who will become the country's first Latina senator. Nevada also legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and voted to require background checks for most gun purchases and transfers. Oregon elected the nation's first openly LGBT governor. Washington raised its minimum wage to $13.25 an hour by 2020.  Here in California, voters legalized marijuana, enacted the nation's first background checks for ammunition purchases, banned large-capacity gun magazines, increased the tax on cigarettes and vaping devices, reinstated bilingual education, boosted income taxes on the wealthy, and banned the sale of single-use plastic bags.  [What the future of marijuana legalization could look like under President Trump]   The state also elected Kamala Harris, a Democrat, to the Senate. Harris will become the first Indian American and the second black female senator. The state overwhelmingly voted for Clinton in the presidential contest, with 61.5 percent of the electorate -- one of the highest in the country -- casting ballots for the former secretary of state, compared with 33.3 percent for Trump.   California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) joked before Election Day that the state might have to build a wall around itself if Donald Trump was elected. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)  Months ago, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) joked about building a wall around California to ""protect it from the rest of the country"" if Trump is elected, a quip that is now recirculating. Some are even calling on California to secede from the rest of the country. A group that had previously dedicated itself to that cause rallied on the statehouse steps in Sacramento on Wednesday, stating a goal of getting a secession referendum on the 2018 ballot. Its leader tweeted on Thursday that he has received 18,000 emails in recent days.  Online, people are using the term ""Calexit,"" a take on Britain's ""Brexit"" vote to sever ties with the European Union.  Shervin Pishevar, the co-founder and co-chief executive of San Francisco venture capital firm Sherpa Ventures, tweeted Tuesday that he would begin and fund a ""legitimate campaign"" to help the world's sixth-largest economy become its own nation, ""New California."" ""It's the most patriotic thing I can do,"" he told CNBC. ""The country is at a serious crossroads.""  [Nebraska and California voters decide to keep the death penalty]  De Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said Wednesday in a statement issued in English and Spanish that they felt like ""strangers in a strange land"" after the election. The men ordered attorneys to look at how a Trump presidency would affect federal funding of state programs, investments that rely on foreign trade and federal enforcement of various laws, including those relating to immigration. They vowed to ""lead the resistance"" to any efforts to ""shred our social fabric"" or Constitution.  ""California is America before America is itself,"" de Leon said in an interview. ""That means the good, the bad and the ugly, not just the good things that happen in California.""  In 1994, California voters passed an initiative designed to set up a state-run immigration system and deny most benefits, including education, to undocumented immigrants. Backlash to the proposition, which was strongly backed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, is widely considered a watershed moment that eventually led to the decimation of the Republican Party in the state. Today, California allows undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and access in-state tuition at public universities. The state is also one of the most diverse in the nation. According to the census, 38.8 percent of Californians identify as Latino, 14.7 percent as Asian and 6.5 percent as black.   ['Not my president.' Thousands protest Trump in rallies across the U.S.]  Those demographic changes are spurring political ones here in Orange County, once a mostly white bastion of Republicanism that has become increasingly Latino and Asian. While blue-collar Democrats who switched parties to vote for Trump in the Rust Belt helped propel him to the presidency, voters in Orange County chose a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since the 1930s.  ""I've always referred to Orange County as the 'Orange Curtain' because it's so conservative,"" said Adriana Garcia, a 40-year-old Democrat who lives in Newport Beach. She cried as she talked about a Trump presidency, concerned that it might subject her, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, to racist and sexist hatred she has never experienced. ""I thought it was wild"" that Orange County tilted for Clinton, she said. ""I'm sad more places didn't."" Neighboring Riverside County also flipped to Democrat from Republican in 2012, as did Nevada County in the state's north.  Protests flared across the state Wednesday after Trump's victory, with dozens arrested. A group of high schoolers in Berkeley walked out of class. In Oakland, more than 7,000 people took to the streets. In Los Angeles, hundreds of people blocked freeways. In front of City Hall, some protesters burned a giant papier-mache Trump. Fewer protesters camd out in L.A. on Thursday night, but those who did marched through the streets, halted traffic, threw bottles and set off fireworks. At least 185 people were arrested, a number that will likely rise, said Norma Eisenman, a Los Angeles Police spokeswoman.   Here in Santa Ana on Wednesday night, protesters spent more than an hour continually crossing the four-way intersection, walking in a square from the gas station to an auto-parts store to a food stand where some picked up Mexican corn, to a 7-11 and back to the gas station. They held signs reading, ""Not our president"" and ""Dump Trump,"" and yelled profanities about the president-elect. A 2-year-old held a sign reading, ""Stop white supremacy."" Some wore bandannas around their faces, prepared for the police to deploy tear gas.  The group marched along the main street and the protest ballooned in size, with 650 people ultimately standing in an intersection until 2 a.m. Participants got into a standoff with police, who fired beanbags and used other nonlethal crowd-control methods; police said the crowd members threw bricks, bottles and other objects. Ten people were arrested, including three juveniles, on charges including disorderly conduct and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, said Cpl. Anthony Bertagna of the Santa Ana Police Department. He said that a brick was thrown at a police car and that three others were seriously damaged. Two businesses also were damaged and 167 police officers from the county responded.  Many here expressed anger at white Americans, saying they helped propel Trump to the presidency and endorsed racism and xenophobia.  ""Can I give you a hug on behalf of white people?"" Jennifer Hellman, 36, asked Guerrero as the two stood in the parking lot of a strip mall of mostly Latino stores. ""We're not all like this.""  The two embraced as a woman on a bicycle rode by, screaming an expletive about Trump.  Oliver Lopez, 33, and his wife, Lucy Dominguez, 37, stood in front of a neon gas station sign, arms around each other and each holding a sign that read, ""Peace.""  Dominguez said she chose the sign because the nation needs peace in this moment. She was born in Mexico, became a citizen and voted for Clinton. She was angry about and hurt by Trump's assertion in his campaign kickoff speech that some Mexicans are drug dealers and rapists.  ""I'm not a rapist. My family are not rapists,"" she said.  Lopez said he is glad he lives in California.  ""It gives me a sense of safety,"" he said. ""We're leaning more to the left.""  "

(Jeff J. Mitchell/Getty Images)  LONDON -- If Tuesday's election had played out anywhere outside the United States, Donald Trump would most likely have lost. His approval ratings were bad or catastrophic in most parts of the globe. Being president, however, is deemed the world's most influential political job. Hence, governments have reacted far more cautiously to a Trump presidency than some of their citizens. Here is a roundup of what a selection of countries' governments think of the president-elect, or what they hope he will achieve. Optimism     Russia is likely to be among the most enthusiastic countries. Members of parliament applauded when they heard the news of Trump's victory on Wednesday morning. The result appeared to come as a surprise to Russian journalists and politicians. For weeks, they had covered allegations of election rigging.    Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images)  Some of Trump's statements were not in favor of Russia, such as his stance on Ukraine. But for the most part, Trump is viewed favorably by the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.   [Russia's establishment basks in Trump's victory]   Trump has called Putin a ""strong leader,"" causing furious reactions among the United States' European allies who feel threatened by Russia's recent military movements. In addition, Trump has raised doubts about the U.S. role in NATO, saying American military support would only go to nations paying their fair share. The Israeli government did not pick sides in this election. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likely deemed it too risky to support any of the two candidates during such a volatile election campaign. Following the result's announcement, however, Netanyahu was quick to congratulate Trump. For many Israelis, America's choice has been embraced far less enthusiastically. ""While many Jewish Israelis felt comfortable with Trump's populist rhetoric, especially his tough talk against 'Islamic terrorism,' they were simultaneously appalled by the anti-Semitism of some of his supporters,"" my colleague William Booth summarized.   [Top Trump adviser says Israeli settlements are not an obstacle to peace]   Right-wing politicians now hope that Trump will deliver on some of his main promises, which include a reconsideration of the nuclear treaty with Iran and moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The latter decision could spark international outrage, as the United Nations does not recognize Israel's declaration of Jerusalem as its capital. Such a move would be seen as a refutation to Palestinian claims to the city and a change in U.S. foreign policy, which has advocated a two-state solution. Current Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett went one step further Wednesday, announcing: ""The era of the Palestinian state is over."" Hungary is currently being regarded as the European Union's ""problem child."" To the dismay of some E.U. politicians, Prime Minister Viktor Orban built a wall last year to stop the influx of migrants escaping wars in the Middle East and North Africa. A left-wing opposition newspaper was recently shut down, as well. Speaking on Wednesday, Orban positioned himself as one of Europe's biggest Trump supporters, declaring that Hillary Clinton's defeat was ""great news."" Orban has faced several political setbacks in recent weeks -- Trump could possibly turn the tide in his favor. Slovenia might become a European safe zone for Trump, mostly because his wife, Melania, was born there. In April, the mayor of her home town Sevnica said he would turn the local castle into a U.S. Embassy, and erect a sculpture of Melania Trump. It was an April Fools' Day joke back then. Now, it suddenly doesn't sound like a joke that much, anymore. Melania Trump has put Slovenia into the international spotlight, welcomed by many in the country. But some fear it could easily turn against them, too. Dusan Trusnovec, 58, a social activist, said in July: ""I've read that one writer from the U.S. said that it must have been pretty bad in Slovenia if she found it better being with Trump. Statements like that may make people from the U.S. think Slovenia is a very bad country."" Other countries have been more straightforward. South Sudan officially embraced Trump early on. Michael Makuei, the country's information minister, said that Trump would certainly be better than President Obama. ""I really doubt President Obama had any clear policy to South Sudan other than to destroy it,"" Makuei was quoted as saying. Uncertainty     French President Francois Hollande was a particularly vocal supporter of Clinton. Unfortunately, as with most things, the French president with a current approval rating of 4 percent was unlucky. Things may get even worse next year. Following Brexit and the U.S. elections, the French elite now also fear a revolt at the voting booths in their own country during the general elections. Right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen could easily make it to the second round of the process, facing either a Socialist or a conservative contender. Some in the country already feel reminded of a familiar situation: a populist right-wing candidate facing a moderate establishment candidate.      Many far-right parties in Europe are celebrating the presidential victory of Donald J. Trump. (Jason Aldag,Ishaan Tharoor/The Washington Post)     [The election is being celebrated by Europe's far-right]   Le Pen, meanwhile, was among the first to congratulate Trump on Wednesday. They would get along perfectly as presidents, she already appears to suggest. Of all countries, it is Britain that could prevent a European split between Trump allies and Trump opponents. The E.U. referendum in June clearly showed that a majority of Britons oppose the establishment and globalization, and how much people there feel left behind, amid immigration woes and economic uncertainty. Trump capitalized on similar sentiments in the United States.   [Trump promised Brexit 'times five.' He delivered.]   But following the Brexit referendum itself, Britain faced an immediate backlash. Leading Brexit supporters backtracked on the main promises, and the economy has only started to suffer, economists predict.    Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French far-right party Front National. (Thierry Chesnot/Getty Images)  Those developments have mainly hurt populist politicians arguing their countries should also leave the E.U., such as Le Pen in France. Although in the past, the French have been more Eurosceptic than the British, a majority favored staying in the E.U. in a poll conducted as the first reactions to ""Brexit"" started to emerge. At the same time, Brexit might make Britain also more dependent on the United States. Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated Trump, reminding him of the two countries' ""special relationship."" As Britain has a declining number of friends in Europe, Britain needs U.S. trade and as a political ally. But will the British prime minister get her way? Britain's Telegraph newspaper already appeared upset on Thursday, pointing out that Trump had spoken to nine other world leaders before May. Iraq has reasons to be both hopeful and doubtful. Trump has often contradicted his own foreign policy stances concerning the Middle East. While he has clearly called for the defeat of the Islamic State, he is also expected to be more of an isolationist than recent presidents. In 2015, however, Trump argued that U.S. ground troops would be one option to defeat the Islamic State and to ""take back the oil."" Such statements will hardly calm fears in Baghdad. Syria's Assad regime might benefit from the Trump presidency. Trump's broader Middle East plans remain vague, but he has suggested withdrawing U.S. support for rebel groups. This, as well as Trump's friendlier relations to Putin, the regime's key ally, could prove advantageous to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia is one of the United States' most important (and most criticized) allies in the Middle East. Will it change? Trump has suggested that the Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia, should pay more for U.S. support. According to Saudi Arabian news agency SPA, King Salman made ""peace and stability"" the main focus of a phone call with Trump on Wednesday. Canada has frequently -- and jokingly -- been considered the new country of residence for Americans disappointed with the outcome of the election. After the Trump victory became apparent, Canada's immigration website crashed because of the unexpectedly high number of visitors.   [Americans, it's actually quite hard to move to Canada]   Whereas the initial flight plans of Americans are likely to fade away at some point, bigger political question loom on the horizon. Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail expressed particular concerns over Trump's suggestions he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. China is also likely to be concerned about Trump's protectionist plans, to revitalize parts of the economy that saw job losses to China and other nations. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly referred to China, blaming the country for unfair competition, among other things. From a defense point of view, however, Trump's unwillingness to support political allies in the region at all cost could reverberate across Asia. Japan could feel the repercussions first. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump are scheduled to meet in New York later this month. Friendly words were exchanged Wednesday: In a phone call following Trump's election, Abe said he was convinced ""America will be made even greater"" because of Trump. The president-elect is said to have congratulated Abe for his country's economic performance. But Japan fears the United States may be about to reconsider its security arrangements for the country. Trump has previously called Japan an economic rival and criticized the security treaty between the United States and Japan as unfair. A U.S. troop withdrawal from Japan and South Korea would significantly change Asia's balance of military power, benefiting China and North Korea. The Philippines, a country branded a ""terrorist nation"" by Trump, likely reacted to his victory with mixed feelings. ""We're dealing with animals,"" Trump had said at a rally in August, referring to people entering the United States from the Philippines. That didn't go over too well in what is considered a key U.S. ally in Asia. A resolution was filed in the country's parliament in August to ""refuse Donald J. Trump entry into the Philippines."" Despite that, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte congratulated Trump on his victory, saying he looked forward to work on ""enhanced Philippines-U.S. relations."" ""We both curse for the slightest reason. We are alike,"" Duterte was quoted as saying by wire agencies. Whether Trump would agree to that, however, remains unclear. He previously said Duterte had shown a lack of respect for the United States. Skepticism     Ukraine is likely among the nations most concerned about the Trump victory. The president-elect's suggestion that the United States recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea will worry politicians in Kiev.    People cross a Ukrainian army checkpoint outside Kurakhove on March 3, 2015. It is just a few miles away from the area controlled by Russia-backed rebels. (Vadim Ghirda/AP)  ""Tell me I'm sleeping and this is a terrible nightmare!"" Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-corruption Action Center, commented, according to Radio Free Europe. Ukraine has so far considered the United States to be its biggest single-state ally. Throughout his campaign, Trump, however, has dismissed calls for giving more support to the Ukrainian government. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's congratulatory remarks were filled with multiple caveats -- a deviation in the normal diplomatic courtesy -- as he stressed the need for U.S. sanctions against Russia and emphasized ""our fight against Russian aggression, in our fight for freedom and democracy, and sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Germany, as well as most European nations, reacted cautiously to the Trump victory, as well. Over the past days, countless comparisons had been made on social media between Trump and Adolf Hitler. German officials refrained from using such rhetoric. Chancellor Angela Merkel's remarks nevertheless were among the world's least enthusiastic, despite her being a rather pragmatic leader who knows she will have to work with Trump. ""Germany and America are bound by common values -- democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views,"" Merkel explained. ""It is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation, both with me personally and between our countries' governments,"" she said. Merkel's rhetoric is almost always cautious. In that context, her remarks implied a great deal of skepticism about whether Trump could deliver on upholding those shared values. Similar concerns were shared by current or former leaders of Sweden, Italy, Spain and Greece, among others. As my colleague Anthony Faiola pointed out, Merkel's deputy chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, was far less diplomatic. Referring to Trump and his allies, he said: ""They want a rollback to the bad old times in which women belonged by the stove or in bed, gays in jail and unions at best at the side table."" In the Middle East, Iran warned Trump to not reverse the nuclear deal struck between the regime and the Obama administration. Obama had lifted some sanctions on Iran in return. Palestinians were similarly discouraged by Trump's victory and his previous announcement to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Such a decision, accompanied by U.S. acceptance of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, would diminish hopes for more Palestinian autonomy or a two-state solution. Mexico was one of Trump's first targets in the Republican primaries. His plans to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border, and claims that Mexico will pay for it, created a backlash south of the border. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto compared Trump to Hitler and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Mexico also is concerned about Trump possibly revoking NAFTA. Despite Pena Nieto meeting Trump before the elections and them agreeing to meet again soon, chances of friendly Trump-Mexico relations are rather low, at the moment.

He lived among them growing up, and then studied them with a fanatical intensity during his political rise. But now, with any notion of a dynasty dead and gone, one explanation for the stunning political demise of the Clintons might be the extent to which they moved away from a middle-American sensibility into the realm of the coastal elite, from McDonald's to veganism to put it in symbolic terms, making it harder for Hillary to bridge the nation's yawning social divide. This rendered her vulnerable even to the most unlikely opponent, a wealthy Manhattan real estate developer who had nothing in common with many of his voters except his uncanny ability to speak their language of discontent.  Bill Clinton grew up in rural southwest Arkansas. His mother called him Bubba and thought of him as her Elvis. Their neighbors were mostly white, had little money or clout, and felt alienated from the social and economic changes rumbling through the outside world and headed their way.  These same citizens later dealt the brash young Bill Clinton an unsettling early defeat, tossing him and his wife, Hillary, out of the Arkansas governor's mansion in 1980 after a single two-year term. They thought he was too much of an elitist, that his wife was not one of them, but an independent feminist who wouldn't even take his last name, and that his policies ignored their daily struggles. What incited their rage was a state tax on license plates based on the weight instead of price of a vehicle -- making a farmer with a heavy, old pickup truck pay more than a rich city slicker driving a Porsche. His opponent, Frank White, had been dismissed as a lightweight know-nothing who would drag Arkansas back into the 19th century, but White found a way to turn that argument on its end, saying he would return the state to its gloried past. His message connected with the frustrations of many white voters -- an early variation of what Donald Trump would do to Hillary a full 36 years later with his evocation of a long lost great American past that only he could restore. Clinton became the youngest ex-governor in American history, and the Clinton era was thought to be over not soon after it had begun.      2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted View Graphic     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted  Bill and Hillary drew on the lessons of that defeat in constructing their comeback in Arkansas and their rise to national prominence, building an unprecedented political partnership that carried them through a decades-long cycle of loss and recovery and mostly success until it all came crashing down at long last in the early hours of Wednesday morning. They focused relentlessly on the economy and found ways to communicate directly with the electorate, creating a permanent campaign. A shared pragmatism that had been evident since they first met at Yale Law School in 1971 went into overdrive. Losing power so early shaped everything they would do from then on, their ambition at times overtaking their ideals in the fight to survive. They believed that in the name of doing good, the ends could at times justify the means. In the four terms Bill served as governor after returning to power in 1982, he and his wife constantly tried to figure out how to keep going even as the country turned more conservative in the Reagan era. That became the essence of his successful 1992 presidential campaign, when he relied on pollster Stan Greenberg's seminal study of Reagan Democrats in Michigan's Macomb County, the blue-collar suburban region north of Detroit populated largely by white men who felt adrift from the cultural changes in America and struggling from the decline of manufacturing jobs. There and in similar areas, Clinton knew how to take his old Bubba personality and combine it with a relentless focus on ""the economy, stupid"" to make his winning case. He used that ability again later in the White House to keep his connection with the white working class, among other ways by opposing same-sex marriage and supporting reform of a welfare system that many wrongly believed was aimed primarily at helping poor minorities. Two decades later, when Hillary tried to reclaim the Clinton legend, everything had changed. The country and the candidate. She was no Bubba, but maybe he wasn't anymore, either. By the time she won the Democratic nomination, she had more experience than any candidate in modern times, but also as much baggage. She had been investigated by a special prosecutor, called to appear alone before a federal grand jury, grilled for 11 hours straight by a hostile congressional committee and probed by the FBI. She was such an established persona in American culture that a first name sufficed. Hillary. Singular first names usually evoke singular identities, but not in her case. Despite all that she has done and been, or perhaps because of it, her identity remains not singular but kaleidoscopic, with ever-changing shards of opaqueness and clarity.  Many of her problems could be traced to her husband in ways large and small. She suffered both in comparison with him and because of him. As a campaigner, he was magnetic and extemporaneous, she was studied and practiced. It had been that way from the beginning. In one of their first tag-team efforts, as partners in a mock Prize Trial run by the Barristers Union at Yale, Bill was soft and engaging and emotive, working to charm the judge, making the jurors feel as though he was addressing them individually, pouting when a ruling did not go his way, while Hillary was calm and cerebral, deliberate and tough. One classmate noted that while Bill ""would massage their toes,"" Hillary was less concerned about stepping on them. A campaign is not a courtroom, the sharp contrast between his performance style and hers did not help her any when it came time to be the candidate. Her style also played into gender stereotypes that persist in American life, the sexist denigration of an aggressively competitive female. And Bill's personal vulnerabilities when it came to sex and women, while sometimes making Hillary a more sympathetic figure to the public, had a long-term problematic effect on her. She developed an encrusted defensiveness over the years as the lawyer in her tried to protect him and their shared goals. What became a reflexive tendency toward secrecy and lack of transparency merged with her deeply held Methodist belief that her mission was to do the best she could in as many ways as she could and that she and her husband were persisting in the face of fierce and wrongheaded right-wing opposition.     The 2016 presidential election, in graphics View Graphic     The 2016 presidential election, in graphics  Almost every controversy she has been enmeshed in over the years can be seen through that prism -- her advice in 1993 essentially to stonewall the press as the inscrutable non-scandalous Whitewater story was unfolding; her decision to go on the Today show one January morning in 1998 as the Lewinsky affair was breaking to decry what she called ""this vast right-wing conspiracy"" against her husband; and her more recent travails with the use of a private server during her tenure as secretary of state. Carrying the accumulated weight of those stories on her back through this 2016 campaign proved to be a load too heavy. There is also the complicated interplay between Hillary's pioneering status as the first woman to be the presidential nominee for a major party and her position in what was considered a political dynasty, which though not unprecedented rubbed against a myth of American democracy. Most modern presidents, from Richard M. Nixon to Barack Obama, with Bill Clinton as a prime example, came out of nowhere, pushed along by their own will, with no family wealth or prestige or political legacy to assist them. Hillary's early rise was not all that different, from the middle-class heart of unpretentious Midwestern America in suburban Chicago, with her own generational story of despair and salvation involving her mother, who had been abandoned by her parents and grandparents and essentially made her own way since age 14, imparting that determination and will on her only daughter. But Hillary's lift into elective office came only after another Clinton had paved the way, just as George W. Bush followed in the path of his father, George H.W. Bush. Among other things that Trump did in his improbable campaign, by disposing of first Jeb Bush and then Hillary Clinton, he took down not one but two dynasties. The question of what role sexism played in Hillary's defeat will be the source of endless debate, lasting at least until a woman finally breaks the glass ceiling in the White House, which has persisted for 227 years, headed toward at least 231. Back in 1969, when Hillary was delivering a commencement address at Wellesley, another accomplished woman who would later become her friend and ally, Paula Stern, wrote an article for the Atlantic about the nascent women's movement titled ""The Womanly Image: Character Assassination Through the Ages."" Stern wrote about how an employer's most pressing question to her was whether she was in love, about how the legend of Eve, as man's subordinate helper and temptress, overtook the legend of Lilith, man's equal; about how the writings of Aristotle and Shakespeare and Samuel Johnson and Rousseau and Freud had all diminished the value of women in various ways; and about how being competitively aggressive was considered unladylike behavior. All of that came back to Stern this week as she watched Hillary in the final days of what she hoped would be a history-making campaign, but instead became a moment of bitter disappointment. Speaking of the most popular mob-like incantation at Trump rallies, Stern said, ""I see the cries of 'Lock her up' as the 21st-century expression of character assassination through the ages."" Hillary, she said, was not just trying to break through a glass ceiling, but ""through centuries of misogyny."" Bill Clinton had his own problems, but never that one, and neither did Trump, who openly disparaged women throughout his campaign and still prevailed. The result was at once unfathomably difficult for the Clintons and yet not entirely surprising to Bill. He saw the signs all along the way of this campaign. He knew the people who were voting for Trump, and also the people who during the primaries were voting not for his wife but for Bernie Sanders. He saw the anger and the feelings of disconnection, but he did not know how he, or his wife's campaign, could connect to it effectively without resorting to demagoguery or false populism, something Hillary was not good at even if she was disposed to try.  Once, in New Hampshire back during the primary season, Bill Clinton described the mood of the moment, all the various forms of anger roiling to the surface, by using a line from one of his favorite poets, W.B. Yeats -- ""Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart."" Now, to borrow from another Yeats poem, there will be no second coming of the Clintons, and it will be Donald Trump slouching toward Washington.

Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, an executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were convicted of scheming with former Christie ally David Wildstein to punish a Democratic mayor for not endorsing Republican Christie when he ran for re-election in 2013.

Testimony contradicted Christie's statements about when he knew about the four days of gridlock at the base of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee in September 2013. Wildstein testified that Baroni told Christie about the traffic jam at a Sept. 11 memorial event in New York while the gridlock was in progress. He said Christie laughed and made a sarcastic joke when he learned of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's distress over not getting his calls returned. It was unclear from Wildstein's testimony whether Christie knew then that the mess was manufactured for political reasons. However, Kelly testified she told Christie about Sokolich's concerns about political retaliation during the week of the traffic jams at the bridge, which connects New York and Fort Lee. She said Christie told her that it was a ""Port Authority project, let Wildstein handle it."" Christie said Monday that no one testified they told him it was an act of political retribution.  ""If they would have told me that they were creating traffic at the George Washington Bridge in order to punish the mayor for not endorsing you, I would have remembered that. And they never said that,"" Christie said. Other testimony described some of Christie's top advisers and confidants knowing about the plan ahead of time or soon afterward and being aware of the political motivation well before Christie told reporters in December 2013 that none of his staff was involved. ___ ON THE 'ABSOLUTELY STUPID' PLOT Christie said that he could never figure out why aides would have retaliated against the mayor considering Christie had a large lead.  ""I'm pretty good at this political game, I'm up by 25 points in a re-election in a blue state and they decide they're going to create a traffic jam in a town that's a Democrat town that I wound up winning two months later in the election?"" Christie said. ""Absolutely stupid."" Christie's big edge in the polls notwithstanding, the Office of Inter-Governmental Affairs, headed by Kelly, had spent more than two years before the bridge scandal courting Democratic mayors, even keeping a spreadsheet ranking them on their likelihood to endorse Christie and listing what favors they had received, according to testimony. Several weeks before the lane closures, Christie's office apparently felt betrayed by Democratic Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, who they viewed as a potential endorser. According to Kelly's testimony, the order came from Christie to cancel scheduled meetings with Fulop. ___ ON WHAT THE VERDICT SAYS ABOUT HIS MANAGEMENT Christie said Kelly was ""one out of 25"" people to serve on his senior staff who ""didn't get it.""  ""So I don't think it says anything about me,"" he said. ""I think it says everything about that person."" One of Christie's closest political allies, David Samson, pleaded guilty this year to using his position as chairman of the Port Authority to get an airline to start a flight so he could have an easier trip to his vacation home. Christie appointed him to the position. Also, Christie cut ties with his former campaign manager because of his alleged role in the bridge plot. Bill Stepien is now involved in Donald Trump's presidential campaign. So is Christie. ___ ON WHETHER BRIDGEGATE COST HIM POLITICALLY At the time the scandal unfolded, Christie was considered a top presidential contender. Chis campaign failed and Christie said recently the scandal probably influenced Trump's decision not to pick him as a running mate. Christie is chairman of Trump's transition team, in charge of hiring thousands of employees if he wins the presidency. Christie said in the interview that he was runner-up to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to be Trump's running mate, but that you'd have to ask Trump what role Bridgegate played in him not getting the nod. Christie's scheduled campaign stops for Trump on Saturday were canceled after the verdict. ____ Associated Press Writer David Porter, in Newark, contributed to this report.

But he'll be following in the footsteps of other moguls who have jumped into the political fray elsewhere in the world. The track record for these businessmen-turned-political leaders is decidedly mixed. Some have translated their private sector acumen into success in government. Others had tenures marked by scandal, and even a military coup. Americans have elected presidents with business experience before -- among them, George W. Bush, who ran an oil company, and Herbert Hoover, a mining executive. But all moved into politics before running for the nation's highest office. Trump would be the first American president to never have held elective office, or other high-level government or military post. The real estate magnate has long promoted his business background as a selling point for voters frustrated with career politicians.  ""We need people in Washington that know how to make a deal,"" Trump says. A look at some of the billionaires who blazed a trail from business to politics: ___ SILVIO BERLUSCONI, ITALY Trump has drawn more comparisons to the brash Berlusconi, a three-term Italian prime minister, than perhaps any other foreign leader. Both are irreverent and controversial, and they like to flaunt their lavish lifestyles. Each started his career in real estate, but made his name in the media world: Berlusconi built a fortune buying up television stations and Trump became a fixture in the New York tabloids and reality TV. For Trump, that's probably about where he'd like the comparisons to end. Berlusconi was a fixture in Italian politics for two decades, but his time in office was frequently marred by scandal. He was convicted of multiple crimes, including tax fraud and paying for sex with an underage prostitute, though the latter charge was overturned by an appeals court. ___ PETRO POROSHENKO, UKRAINE Known as Ukraine's ""Chocolate King,"" Poroshenko made his fortune in the confectionary industry. Now he's a key Western partner in trying to resolve the heated dispute between Ukraine and Russia. Poroshenko was elected president in 2014 following the public uprising that led to the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russian leader. The billionaire businessman positioned himself as a friend of Europe and the United States, and indeed speaks and meets regularly with both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. But Poroshenko's tenure has coincided with more Russian meddling in Ukraine, particularly along the country's shared border. The U.S. has sent Ukraine tens of millions of dollars in nonlethal aid; President Barack Obama has resisted calls to send lethal assistance. It's unclear what type of support Poroshenko would have from the U.S. under a potential Trump administration. Trump has spoken favorably about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump has said he would be ""looking at"" whether to recognize Crimea -- a Ukrainian area annexed by Moscow -- as Russian territory. Poroshenko's transition from businessman to political leader also holds warning signs for Trump's financial future. The Ukrainian leader saw his net worth decline significantly after taking office. ___ THAKSIN SHINAWATRA, THAILAND A telecommunications billionaire, Thaksin was Thailand's prime minister until he was ousted in a military coup in 2006. During his tenure, Thaksin drew support from poorer voters who backed his reduction in hospital feeds and other populist programs. But Thaksin's wealth would contribute to his political downfall. He faced corruption allegations after his family sold a company for $1.9 billion in a way that enabled them to avoid paying taxes on the sale, sparking a year of political tumult in Thailand that ended in the coup. Though he's been in exile for several years, Thaksin remains involved in Thai politics from affair. Earlier this year, he weighed in on American elections, saying there was ""some similarity"" between himself and Trump.  ""The cultures are very similar, the culture of being a businessman,"" Thaksin told the Financial Times. ""And then when successful businessmen come to politics, they give fresh air to political campaigns."" ___ SEBASTIAN PINERA, CHILE Pinera's financial empire touched numerous parts of Chilean society. He held stakes in the country's largest airline, a television station and the popular soccer team Colo-Colo. Turning to politics, Pinera campaigned on his private sector experience and became the first conservative to lead Chile since military rule ended in 1990. But his presidency launched to an inauspicious start -- a major earthquake disrupted his 2010 inauguration. Chile experienced solid economic growth during Pinera's four-year term, but the president himself was deeply unpopular. Chile's constitution prohibits presidents from serving two consecutive terms. Pinera is eligible to run again in 2018. Pinera hasn't been shy about weighing in on the U.S. election, levying sharp criticism of Trump. During an appearance in New York last fall, Pinera said the Republican would be a divisive leader and said his election would be a ""tragedy."" ___ Follow Julie Pace on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
