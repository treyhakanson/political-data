On YouTube, you know?"" Biden's cohort in his mission, actor Adam Devine, has equally bad luck blending among college students.But in the video at least, their message about stepping in to prevent campus rape comes through.""It's on all of us to change the culture to prevent sexual assault,"" Biden says.Biden last week appeared on an episode of ""Law and Order: SVU"" to highlight the backlog of untested rape kits."

If last term is any guide, they will get their work done, ruling narrowly at times to achieve consensus, while the political branches feud over which president will choose the next justice.10 things you didn't know about the 'Notorious RBG'Not only does the seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia remain open, but the fact that three of the justices are in their late 70s or early 80s means talk on the campaign trail about how the next president can shape the court's future isn't just hyperbole. Last term, progressives scored victories in the areas of abortion rights and affirmative action. If another justice were to join the liberal wing, the court could swing left on other cases concerning voting rights, campaign finance, immigration, access to the courts, and gun control. If a Donald Trump nominee were to be confirmed, the conservative majority on those issues might solidify. ""If the next president is able to make multiple appointments we could see a real paradigm shift,"" said Jeffrey B. Wall, of Sullivan & Cromwell, who frequently argues before the court. He notes that since the late 1990's there have been a fairly cohesive bloc of four liberals on the court and a less cohesive block of five more conservative justices.  ""No matter what happens in the election, the center of the court is likely to shift,"" he said and added that if President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, were to be confirmed, for instance, he could replace Justice Anthony Kennedy as the new center of the court. But Paul Smith of Jenner & Block cautions that change on the court does not necessarily happen overnight. ""The court doesn't like to overrule prior decisions,"" he said. If the majority were to swing left, the change would likely be reflected in a narrowing or undermining of previous opinions. The justices like to remind the public that they are often unanimous in their rulings, but it is the closely divided cases that grab people's attention.While 4-4 splits are still a possibility, the justices demonstrated last term that they could find more narrow ways to rule on certain cases in order to seek consensus. They also managed to deal with one controversial case concerning the so-called contraceptive mandate, by simply sending it back to the lower court and urging the parties to find consensus.Notably, after Scalia's death in February, justices took up fewer cases to be heard this term, perhaps in an effort to stall until the court is at full strength. For now, public interest groups on both side of the political spectrum are also moving cautiously, fearful of pushing a particular issue and risking bad precedent until they are sure which way the court might swing on hot button issues. The casesThe cases that are currently on the docket may not present the constitutional blockbusters of recent years, but they explore significant issues ranging from voting rights, to the death penalty, religious liberty, and racial bias in juries. There are also patent disputes covering everything from the bezel of the iPhone to the chevron found on a cheerleader's uniform.  The court could also add cases over the term. Lurking on that list is a case concerning a Virginia transgender male teenager who seeks to use the boys' bathroom. A lower court cleared the way for Gavin Grimm to use the bathroom that corresponds to his gender identity, but last summer the Supreme Court froze that opinion while it decides whether to take up the appeal. Voting rights and gerrymandered districtsThe voting rights cases concern claims of racial gerrymander -- or how states draw district lines. Civil rights groups and Democrats are challenging redistricting plans in North Carolina and Virginia that they say packed African-Americans in districts that already had a high percentage of African-Americans, thus diluting their presence in other districts. But attorneys for North Carolina and Virginia argue that the states find themselves in a bind. The Voting Rights Act requires that the legislature take race into consideration when drawing lines. At the same time, the equal protection clause prevents race from being the dominant factor in those decisions.Death PenaltyJustices this week will hear a case concerning Duane Buck, an African-American, who was sentenced to death after his own lawyer introduced an expert who testified that Buck was more likely to be dangerous in the future because he is black. Texas law requires a finding of ""future dangerousness"" before a death sentence is imposed.Lawyers for Buck argue that, ""no constitutional rule is more important than the dictate that race must play no role in a criminal sentence, much less a capital sentence."" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton responds in court papers that an ineffectiveness of counsel claim is procedurally barred in the case and that the assessment of the death penalty was not made solely on the testimony of one witness.Religious libertyReligious liberty is another issue the court will examine in a case out of Missouri concerning a day care facility run by the Trinity Lutheran Church. The church sought a state grant given to facilities that use recycled tires as a surface for playgrounds to improve safety. Missouri awarded the grants to other non-profits, but said that the day care facility was ineligible because the Missouri Constitution bars state funding to churches.Lawyers for the church say the state's action is an unconstitutional violation of both the free exercise and equal protection clauses. In court papers they argue, ""A categorical ban on religion here is merely an overbroad and unconstitutional restriction on the faithful's ability to participate on equal terms in public life."" One interesting twist in the case is that although it was granted in January, just before the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, it has yet to be put on the calendar. Court watchers speculate that Chief Justice John Roberts might be expecting a 4-4 split in the case so he is trying to delay arguments until there are once again nine justices on the court. Jury biasThe justices will also hear the case concerning jury bias that pits the secrecy of jury deliberations against the 6th Amendment's guarantee of an impartial jury. A jury in Colorado found Miguel Angel Pena Rodriguez guilty of unlawful sexual contact and harassment. But after the verdict was released, two jurors explained that during deliberations another juror -- ""H.C."" -- had expressed racial bias toward Pena Rodriguez. According to the jurors, ""H.C."" said that the defendant ""did it because he's Mexican and Mexican men take whatever they want."" Pena Rodriguez seeks a retrial. Insider trading and copyrightsThe justices will hear major disputes that are less likely to divide them down familiar lines. There's an insider trading case concerning the personal benefit that must be established when an insider gives information to a ""tippee."" In Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands, the justices will decide whether the stripes and chevrons of a cheerleading outfit can be subject to copyright protection. In Samsung v. Apple the Court will discuss the $399 million award Apple won in the court below in a patent dispute with Samsung. Presidential politicsIf Hillary Clinton were to win in November, there is a possibility that Obama's pick, Garland, could go before Congress during the lame duck session. But so far, Senate Republicans are ruling out that possibility. That means it would be Clinton's choice whether to push forward with Garland or to choose her own nominee after her inauguration.  She would come under some pressure to choose someone younger with a more liberal record.""If I have the opportunity to make any Supreme Court appointments, I am going to look broadly and widely for people who represent the diversity of our country, who bring some common-sense, and real-world experience,"" she said last month on the Tom Joyner radio show. It would be the first time since May of 1969 that the court has had five members appointed by Democratic presidents. ""We had not even walked on the moon the last time a majority of the Justices had been appointed by a Democratic President,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. Vladeck pointed out that if Donald Trump were to win he could ""cement a new Republican majority -- both by replacing Justice Scalia and, perhaps down the road, Justices Ginsburg or Breyer as well."" Trump has put forward his own list of potential nominees for the court.  His list is made up mostly of current federal and state judges, but he also suggested he would consider Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a stalwart conservative and close friend of Trump's former presidential rival, Sen. Ted Cruz."	Supreme Court starts new term with more questions than answers

""It is really in fact not continent with a claim that 'I care about all of us. I care about paying my fair share.' That's the disconsonance,"" he added. Hoffman's comments come on the heels of a New York Times report that revealed Trump declared a $916 million loss in 1995, which could have allowed him to legally forgo paying federal income taxes for nearly two decades. The Trump campaign has not disputed that report. Hoffman also scoffed at the candidate's $916 million loss, suggesting it weakened his claim of being a successful businessman. ""My first reaction was 'so a $916 million loss?'"" Hoffman said. ""'That equals very, very successful businessman? That doesn't quite go together.'""Last month Hoffman, who is vocal Hillary Clinton supporter, pledged to donate up to $5 million to nonprofit organizations that assist veterans if Trump releases his tax returns in time for the final presidential debate on October 19.So far the Democratic nominee, Clinton, has released decades of tax filings while Trump has released none. ""All it requires now is for Trump to do the right thing and essentially say, 'let me reveal my taxes, let me be open and transparent,'"" added Hoffman. "	LinkedIn co-founder slams Trump over taxes

Would you point to him as a role model?"" ""I think that certainly there are many role models that we have, and I believe he can serve as president and so, absolutely. I would do that,"" she said at the New England College hosted debate in Henniker, New Hampshire.In a statement afterward, Ayotte said: ""I misspoke tonight. While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn't hold either of them as role models for my kids.""Ayotte is currently locked in a hotly contested Senate reelection race against Democratic rival, Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte has said she is voting for Trump, but not endorsed him for president.Ayotte has said that she will she will ""stand up"" to Trump if he becomes president -- but she will vote for him in November. ""I will take on my own party,"" Ayotte told CNN in Nashua in August. ""I really believe that this is a big issue in this race -- that I am the one candidate that will stand up to whomever is in the White House to do good things when we can work together -- also when it's wrong to stand up to them.""During Monday's debate, someone off-screen asked Ayotte: ""If you think he can serve as president, why won't you endorse him?"" ""Because I've had some disagreements with him,"" she said. ""And I've been quite clear about those disagreements. And this is an area where Gov. Hassan has been lockstep with Secretary Clinton. I haven't heard major disagreements that she's had with Secretary Clinton so who's going to step up for the people of New Hampshire?"" Since Trump launched his campaign last summer, he called some Mexicans ""rapists"" during his announcement speech, said Sen. John McCain isn't a ""war hero"" because he was captured, proposed a temporary Muslim ban, mocked a disabled reporter during a campaign rally, repeatedly made harsh comments about women, and attacked the Khans, a Gold Star family, for their comments at the Democratic National Convention.And at a rally in Pennsylvania this weekend, Trump hit Clinton on her ""stamina,"" said that Clinton is not ""loyal"" to her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and called her an ""incompetent"" and ""sarcastic woman."" In the past, Ayotte has been heavily critical on Trump's controversies, including his attacks against the Khan family. When Trump was asked about Ayotte in an August Washington Post interview, he criticized her lack of support and implied she was weak.""You have a Kelly Ayotte, who doesn't want to talk about Trump, but I'm beating her in the polls by a lot. You tell me. Are these people that should be representing us?"" he said. ""We need loyal people in this country. We need fighters in this country. We don't need weak people.

The largest of these is called CHAI -- the Clinton Healthcare Access Initiative -- and files its own financial statement with New York.Foundation officials say ""while we are not yet certain if this information is required to be filed,"" the foundation will do so ""out an abundance of caution.""These officials also said they had not received any inquiries from New York state regulators.This potential lack of full compliance could be the result of the complex nature of the Clinton Foundation and the affiliates which operate within it. What appears to be missing are foundation records on donors and contributors for these affiliates. Overall, as of last year the Clinton Foundation had $315 million in reserves.  A foundation spokesman said the foundation employs hundreds of people worldwide and is hundreds of times larger than Trump's Foundation, which in its last filing held just $1.3 million dollars in its accounts.Late Tuesday, a spokesman for the New York attorney general's office. acknowledged some of those financial statements had been missing. The confusion arose, the spokesman said, because of a merger between the foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, an annual conference which had its final session in New York City last month""The Clinton Foundation was required to file these statements for CGI in 2012, prior to CGI's merger with the Clinton Foundation in 2013,"" a spokesman told CNN.

Overall, their favorability numbers are identical among registered voters: 38% view each favorably, 30% unfavorably and almost 3-in-10 have no opinion of each of them.Looking ahead to the next time the top-of-the-ticket candidates will meet on stage, in a debate set for Sunday, October 9, more say Clinton will do a better job in that event's town hall format than think Trump will thrive. Among registered voters, 54% say Clinton is likely to do the better job with that one, 38% that Trump is more likely to succeed.The survey also measured voters' views on whether several topics related to each candidate's personal life are appropriate or inappropriate for the debate stage. Most voters agree that it is appropriate for candidates to bring up charitable work or donations (70% appropriate), health and medical records (65% appropriate) or personal finances (60% appropriate). But most say it is inappropriate to talk appearance (73% inappropriate) or marital history (79% inappropriate) on the debate stage.QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump?How voters feel about the appropriateness of those topics seems connected to their choice of candidate: Only about half of Trump voters say personal finances are an appropriate topic (49%), well below the nearly three-quarters of Clinton backers who say the same (72%). Clinton voters (61%) are less likely than Trump backers (72%) to say health is an appropriate topic, while Trump voters are less likely to say it's appropriate to discuss charitable work and donations (59% among Trump backers, 80% among Clinton supporters). Voters behind both camps are largely in agreement that appearance and marital history aren't appropriate topics for the debate stage, though Trump's supporters are slightly more likely to consider marital history appropriate than Clinton backers (23% to 19%).The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 28 through October 2 among a random national sample of 1,501 adults. Results among the 1,213 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. It is 2.5 percentage points among the 1,335 registered voters interviewed.

The trend continued with the latest poll from Monmouth University showing Clinton with a 10-point lead over Trump, with 50% of likely Pennsylvania voters supporting her in a four-way race with third party candidates. In each poll, Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson garnered the support of 5% of the state's voters. Pennsylvania has been a reliably blue state for years; a Republican presidential nominee hasn't won there since George H.W. Bush in 1988. But there were signs that Trump could put the state's 20 electoral votes in play. A CNN/ORC poll late last month found Clinton leading Trump by only a single percentage point among likely Pennsylvania voters. But that survey was conducted before the first presidential debate, which was widely seen as won by Clinton. Trump has also faced turbulence since the debate, engaging in an unseemly public spat with a former Miss Universe winner and facing heightened scrutiny over his tax record.The Franklin & Marshall poll was conducted September 28-October 2 using phone interviews with 496 likely Pennsylvania voters. It has a margin of error of 6.1 percentage points.The Monmouth poll was conducted September 30-October 3 using phone interviews with 402 likely voters in the state.

But even if most Americans CNN spoke to in Farmville agreed this debate may not be as entertaining, many felt that putting the spotlight on the vice presidential nominees could be more important than their running mates. ""Pence and Tim Kaine, actually I'm more confident in them. I would rather have one of them as the presidential candidate than the two choices we have,"" Ethan Seaver, a 22-year-old waiter at Charley's Waterfront Cafe told CNN. ""I guess I would say I'm more of a Republican, but this year I have no idea what I would I be.""""I don't trust either side of things, we got the Clinton machine and then we got this guy Donald Trump, which when he started everyone thought it was a joke,"" Seaver said in between serving lunch to patrons. ""At the vice presidential debate I'd like to see an actual debate and not the show we had last time with the insults and everything.""According to the latest CNN/ORC poll of registered voters Seaver isn't alone. Among younger voters, a traditionally Democratic group Clinton has struggled to win over, a full 42% say neither candidate is a person they admire, more than name Clinton (37%) or Trump (21%).And 29% of all those surveyed say neither Trump nor Clinton is a person they admire, about on par with the 30% who see Trump as the more admirable of the pair, behind the 40% who name Clinton as more admired. Sam Hellier, a 22-year-old sales associate at The Outdoor Adventure store across the street agreed with the sentiment, pointing to the negative press surrounding Trump and Clinton. Hellier is a graduate student at Longwood University, the sight of the debate, and told CNN that the event will be a ""big deciding point.""Some Virginia residents CNN spoke with were more familiar with Kaine, their hometown senator, than Pence, the governor of Indiana. And several cited both men's political backgrounds in Congress and as governors as a positive. Farmville resident Den Cralle had a different way to describe it: ""I think they're both going to be the more blander two candidates.""But Cralle, a 26-year-old who works at his father's boutique furniture store, told CNN he was still excited to land a ticket to the debate. It will assist him in making a decision in a election that has him questioning his party affiliation as a Republican. ""We're going to be able to tell a lot about Clinton and Trump's judgment by the people they chose to be their second command,"" Cralle told CNN. One couple, visiting from West Virginia for a college reunion and some shopping, said they didn't know much about Kaine and Pence because they'd purposely blocked out news coverage of the election. ""I've never missed a vote in my life and I'm very tempted not to vote this time,"" 67-year-old retired teacher Sue Ann Palmer told CNN, adding that she'd reluctantly vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""I don't have much respect for her, but Trump, I think the man's insane,"" Palmer told CNN. Her husband, Mark, said that he'd likely vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump but is hoping he won't be as much of a ""lose cannon"" in upcoming debates. Palmer said she might not watch much of the debate. ""I'll probably do what I did with the Presidential debates. I watched about 30 minutes and I said I'm going to bed this is ridiculous,"" she said.Christine Bailey, a 52-year-old business manager at Vellie's Boutique, felt that Pence would make Trump ""a little bit more presidential"" and seemed to be ""a good Christian man,"" while hoping that Pence would also ""mop the ground with Tim Kaine"" in the debate. Even with all the negativity surrounding the candidates, Ethan Seaver is optimistic that the election will turn out alright. ""I know we can do it, we're America. This is nothing to us, we've been through a lot worse. But I'm definitely nervous,"" Seaver said. "	In Farmville, VP wishful thinking: 'Actually, I'm more confident in them'
9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/04/politics/donald-trump-republicans-reaction/index.html	"As the Republican nominee tries to recover from one of his toughest stretches, few prominent GOP leaders -- other than those who advise him or are on his payroll -- seem willing to launch a full-throated rescue effort.So Trump sought to do the heavy lifting himself Monday, delivering a feisty speech here that attempted to reframe the campaign and extract him from the quagmire of the past week, which included a disappointing debate performance, a roiling controversy over whether he paid taxes, and ill-advised attacks on a Latina beauty queen -- a feud he couldn't seem to let go.Trump running out of time as controversies pile upWith a new CNN/ORC poll showing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a five-point lead over Trump after the debate, Trump for the first time seemed to relish the role of underdog in the presidential race. He mounted an unapologetic defense of his business record, previewing lines he might deploy during his rematch with Clinton on Sunday. Responding to a stunning New York Times report over the weekend that he may have paid no taxes for the last 18 years, Trump acknowledged here that he had been a ""big beneficiary"" of ""the unfairness of the tax laws."" He acknowledged that he ""brilliantly"" used U.S. tax laws to pay as little in federal income taxes as possible. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump?'I'm working for you now'But, he added to an appreciative crowd, ""I'm working for you now, I'm not working for Trump."" Indeed, the day was all about Trump as few prominent Republicans rushed to his defense. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a policy wonk who once chaired the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, was the most senior lawmaker to address Trump's troubles Monday in comments that were relatively tepid.""I don't think it's that harmful,"" he told local reporters in Michigan, according to the Detroit Free Press. ""I think people who don't like him are going to continue disliking him.""Back in Colorado, Trump took on the stance of a fighter as he detailed his financial troubles in the 1990s -- which he described as a ""bad time"" and an ""ugly time"" -- boasting that he never considered giving up, and compared his own losses to those of working class voters across America. ""When the odds are stacked against me and you -- because many of you people are the same way -- when people say it can't be done, that's when we just get started,"" Trump said. ""We are looking for a comeback."" ""The thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is absolutely impossible,"" Trump said. ""For me, impossible is just a starting point.""6 questions about Trump's taxes and the political falloutAcross the country at Clinton's event in Ohio -- a state that may be beyond her reach despite its bellwether status in past elections -- the former secretary of state sharply pointed out that it was difficult for Trump to claim stellar business skills after declaring $916 million in losses in his 1995 tax records, according to the weekend report in the New York Times. ""Here is my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?"" Clinton asked. Verge of unravelingBefore attempting to reframe his life story as one of resilience and overcoming obstacles, Trump's campaign seemed at the verge of unraveling this week, once again sending GOP lawmakers slinking away from their flailing nominee, as they try to contain the collateral damage to vulnerable House and Senate candidates.Somewhat laughably, Trump blamed the fact that he failed to prosecute his case against Clinton in the first debate on a faulty microphone. He then attempted a Twitter takedown of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, a Clinton supporter who he had once criticized as overweight. Before long he was mired in the controversy over The New York Times story that found his reported losses may have resulted in him not paying federal income taxes for 18 years.CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by The Times.How Trump could lose a billion bucks but still live a billionaire lifeTrump's apparent self-sabotage -- or perhaps merely tone-deafness -- continued Monday morning at a forum in Virginia with the Retired American Warriors PAC where he seemed to suggest that U.S. soldiers and veterans commit suicide because ""they can't handle"" post-traumatic stress or weren't strong enough. At the same forum, he also pointedly questioned the U.S. approach to defeating ISIS, wondering aloud whether airstrikes by the U.S. and its allies are actually taking out members of ISIS.""We don't have victory,"" Trump said at the veterans' forum in Virginia. ""We're dropping things all over the place. Who knows what they are hitting? Who knows how many people are being killed? Who knows if they're the right people?"" As Trump's comments about PTSD blazed across social media, news reports emerged that New York's (Democratic) Attorney General issued a cease-and-desist letter to Trump's charitable foundation, ordering it to stop raising money in the state after a series of reports about the foundation's questionable spending. Gleeful DemocratsWhile most Republicans were silent Monday, Democrats were gleeful -- doing their part to stir up the uproar over Trump's comments about PTSD, with even the White House weighing in. ""The commander in chief made a firm declaration that it is not a sign of weakness to get help,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, alluding to President Barack Obama's comments during a town hall with service members last week moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper. ""In fact, it's a sign of character, and a sign of strength to ensure that you are taking care of yourself. And the president has acknowledged the cultural barriers in the military to changing attitudes about this,"" Earnest said. For much of the past month, Republican leaders believed that Trump was finally on message and making an effective case against Clinton. His poll numbers rose, giving a boost to GOP senators down-ticket while improving Republican prospects of keeping the House.But his feud with Machado, renewed questions over his taxes and his rocky performance at the first debate have once again renewed long-standing concerns within GOP ranks that their standard bearer remains an unpredictable wild card when it comes to their party down-ticket.Why Donald Trump doesn't have a case against The New York Times""Every prediction I've made has been wrong about Mr. Trump and his impact,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, who told CNN earlier this year that Trump could be an ""albatross"" for his party. Asked about the next debate, Cornyn said: ""We'd like to see him do better. Obviously, he doesn't have as much experience as Secretary Clinton — and it showed"" at the Hofstra debate.Asked about Trump's attacks on Machado, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 4 Senate Republican, said Trump ""is at his best"" when he focuses on economic issues and national security -- not personal matters.""I would focus on Hillary's record on politics of 30 years,"" Barrasso said when asked about Trump bringing up Bill Clinton's sex scandals. ""This is a change election -- change versus more of the same and this country cannot afford to have the next four years to be like the last eight years with Obama.""Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana also said Trump needs to re-engage on the issues that drove up his poll numbers in late August and early September.""You know I can't comment on that, it's not what I would do,"" Cassidy said when asked about Trump relitigating the Clinton scandals from the 1990s. ""I think people know that. Folks now — they're hurting and they want to know somebody understands.""Indeed, GOP leaders publicly and privately have long shown a level of discomfort with Trump's unorthodox campaign — especially in the aftermath of last week's events. At a press conference to wrap up the pre-election congressional session, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not talk about Trump's impact on the battle for the Senate majority.""Look to avoid wasting our time here,"" McConnell told reporters, ""this is not something I'm going to discuss today -- the implications of the presidential race on the Senate.""Asked why he wouldn't answer Trump questions, McConnell said flatly: ""Because I choose not to."	GOP distances itself from Trump -- again
