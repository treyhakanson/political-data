Clinton later sought to clean up the comments, but the resulting storm is renewing a debate that has flared throughout Hillary Clinton's political career: Is the 42nd President his wife's best asset or biggest distraction? Or both?Republicans, including Donald Trump, seized on the Obamacare remarks to claim that Clinton is his wife's worst surrogate, seeking to drive a wedge between Obama supporters and the current Democratic nominee who badly needs their votes.""Bill Clinton is right: Obamacare is 'crazy', 'doesn't work' and 'doesn't make sense'. Thanks Bill for telling the truth,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday.At a rally Wednesday evening in Reno, Nevada, Trump accused Hillary Clinton of wanting to ""double down"" on Obamacare.""This woman doesn't know what the hell she's doing,"" he said.Clinton's misstepsTo those who believe that the former President, who recently turned 70, has lost a political step, the Obamacare spat was another exhibit for the prosecution. After all, it was not the first time he veered off message during the 2016 campaign.His decision this summer to stride across the runway at the Phoenix airport to greet Attorney General Loretta Lynch sparked accusations he was trying to compromise the Justice Department's probe into his wife's private email server. Days of unflattering headlines and memories of Clinton's past scandals followed.Clinton also got into a fiery back-and-forth about criminal justice with a protestor at a rally in Philadelphia in another counter-productive moment.Allegations of ethical wrongdoing, and ghosts of his past infidelities, as well as more recent questions about the management of the Clinton Foundation, have given ammunition to Republicans keen to sideline the former president.Ohio poll: Clinton and Trump locked in tight raceAll of this doesn't just add fuel to questions about Clinton's campaign role. It sparks intrigue about how a President Hillary Clinton would manage an active, sometimes outspoken and independent former president living in the White House.The latest Bill Clinton episode erupted in Flint, Michigan, on Monday.""So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world,"" Clinton said.Although he tried to walk back his remarks on Tuesday and Wednesday, Republicans took the words ""crazy"" and ""craziest"" from his larger argument to proclaim Clinton just ripped into Obama's proudest achievement.On Wednesday in Ohio, Bill Clinton moderated his language on Obamacare but did not dilute his point.""I strongly supported that bill, and it's given more than 20 million people more insurance,"" Clinton said. ""But there are problems with it. There are problems with it, and everybody knows it."" Statement of factIt might have been a political gaffe. But Clinton's comment was a simple statement of a fact that everybody in politics understands.If Obamacare is to work and survive, like many laws after they are enacted, it must be adjusted for prevailing economic and social conditions. But with Republicans -- who voted more than 50 times to repeal the law -- in control of Congress, there is no chance of a simple overhaul. That means the law's fate depends on who wins in November.CNN's road to 270In that sense, Clinton's remarks, though they might have infuriated the White House, likely infuriated congressional Democrats running for re-election and embarrassed his wife's campaign, could represent an effort to create political distance for his wife at a time of rising premiums and deductibles that are coming due just as voters go to the polls.""He can be colorful but I think that really hit the point he was making, which is we've got to keep what's good and we've got to fix the problems,"" Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta said on ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" this week.Indeed, the ""good"" Bill Clinton that can be a political gift to the campaign comes as a package with the undisciplined version. Patrick Maney, a Boston College historian who recently published a book about the Clinton presidency, which he dubbed ""A New Gilded Age,"" disputed the idea that the Obamacare comments were a gaffe.""He will do things and you think he has lost a step and you think, 'Boy that was not a smart thing to do.' But then you think about it, you realize there is a really astute political mind at work there,"" Maney said.Positive roleThe latest Obamacare spat aside, it is easy to overlook the fact that Clinton actually has played a more positive role in the 2016 campaign than in his wife's bitter 2008 race against Obama. The former president's role in a racially charged, losing primary race with Obama left deep political wounds on all sides.But in politics, if not in life, Clinton learns from his mistakes.Next debate prep: Clinton's light schedule, Trump stays on trailThere has been no repeat of the competing power centers loyal to Clinton and his wife that were ruinous to her primary effort in 2008. And despite a few controversies, he's mostly been an effective behind-the-scenes player.""From everything I can tell, President Clinton has always been a good soldier to the best of his ability,"" said Joe Conason, author of the new book ""Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton."" ""It is not that he never makes a mistake but he does mostly what he is asked to do to the best of his ability.""Following his controversial comments in the 2008 primary that were seen as a racially charged dismissal of Obama, Clinton spent years repairing his ties with South Carolina Democrats and other African American leaders. That helped build Hillary Clinton's unassailable Democratic bastion among black voters in 2016, which helped her build a wall against Bernie Sanders in the South during the primaries.After a few frosty years, Bill Clinton accepted the olive branch offered by Obama and made the case for the nation's first African-American President's re-election during the 2012 Democratic National Convention in a way that Obama was unable to do for himself.The snapshot of current relations between the two presidents came last week when Clinton dawdled at the foot of the stairs to Air Force One at the Tel Aviv airport after the funeral of former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.""Bill, let's go!"" Obama cried from the top of the steps, his face a picture of combined exasperation, affection and amusement.Role reversalThe Clinton-Obama rapprochement has had real results in 2016. In fact, it sparked a role reversal, with Obama and his wife, Michelle, returning the favor to become the most prominent surrogates for Hillary Clinton's election. Obama's growing popularity -- a CNN/ORC poll released Thursday found his approval rating at 55%, the highest mark of his second term -- lends Hillary Clinton significant credibility in key Democratic blocs.While Bill Clinton may have been less prominent in the 2016 campaign, he has been as busy as ever, heading to places like Youngstown, Ohio, where Trump's populism threatens to eat into Democratic vote counts.Each event is a chance to enthuse and register Democrats and spreads the campaign to places the candidate herself cannot always reach.His gaffes might make headlines but his influence is not always in the news.Conason says that on the same day as the showdown with the protestor in Philadelphia made waves, Bill Clinton enjoyed a rapturous welcome in the city from influential African Methodist Episcopal bishops from across the nation.""His speech to them was full of scripture and exhortation and stories about his wife and really nothing about him. He had them on their feet. They all went home, they did what they needed to do for him,"" Conason said.Clinton is just as tireless on the campaign trial as he was when he first ran for the office almost a quarter century ago. His white mane may be thinning and the skin hangs more loosely around his neck, but he was in top form in Ohio Wednesday, characteristically waving his thin index finger and holding small crowds in thrall.His speeches are packed with folksy anecdotes about people he meets on the trail, along with issues like energy, college financing, economic policy and retraining. He connects each of these points to a plan his wife is proposing to enact should they call the White House home again.On Wednesday, Clinton complained that such nuts and bolts policy never gets an airing in the debates, in a barbed comment about a campaign in which his 1990s style conversational politics has sometimes seemed a throwback.""It doesn't do well on Twitter! No one is foaming at the mouth!"" Clinton said. ""I am joking. But I am not."""	Bill Clinton: Asset or distraction?

Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson tallied 10% support and Green Party nominee Jill Stein received 3%. The poll also found a sizable block of undecided voters, with 12% yet to make up their mind.The breakdown of support marks a shift since the last Detroit Free Press/WXYZ poll published on September 16, which found the Democratic presidential nominee up by a slim margin of three percentage points.In the wake of the first presidential debate, Trump's unfavorable ratings ticked up from 63% to 66%, while Clinton's inched down from 56% to 52%. The poll also showed Clinton leads Trump in several key voting blocks, with 86%-2% support among African-Americans, 41%-32% among whites and 48%-28% among women. Clinton is also more than 20 points ahead with young voters (44%-22%).A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll also released Thursday showed Clinton thumping Trump 63-27% in Maryland.The 36-point differential in the historically blue state is 10 points more than the 26-point advantage President Barack Obama enjoyed over his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, in the lead-up to the 2012 election. The EPIC-MRA Michigan poll surveyed 600 likely Michigan voters between October 1-3 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll surveyed 906 Maryland likely voters from September 27 to 30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

""Well, no, of course not. We're so much better than all that,"" Johnson said with sarcasm, according to the report. ""We're so much better when in Afghanistan, we bomb the hospital and 60 people are killed in the hospital.""Johnson was referring to a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders that the United States admitted it bombed in 2015. The Pentagon said after a military investigation that the action was not a war crime, although it did not allow an independent, international investigation into the killings.Libertarian VP candidate: Focusing attacks on Trump is 'way to win'Johnson has made skepticism of foreign interventions a mainstay of his campaign, ensuring to highlight it in almost every interview he does. But he has had several embarrassing incidents that demonstrated his shortcomings in that area. At the beginning of September, Johnson failed to recognize Aleppo, a city at the heart of the Syrian civil war. The embarrassing moment underscored Johnson's lack of foreign policy chops, and he compounded the mistake in a late September interview when he struggled to name a foreign leader he respected, conceding he was having another ""Aleppo moment.""Johnson also specifically slammed Democrat Hillary Clinton, calling her a foreign policy hawk who contributed to bloodshed overseas.""Because Hillary Clinton can dot the i's and cross the t's on geographic leaders, of the names of foreign leaders the underlying fact that hundreds of thousands of people have died in Syria goes by the wayside,"" Johnson said.The Libertarian nominee's criticism of Clinton appears at odds with his running mate, Bill Weld, who told CNN Wednesday he would focus his criticism on Republican Donald Trump.""I guess my role will be Hillary, and his role will be Donald Trump,"" Johnson said."

I don't care what this a------ thinks @realDonaldTrump #centralpark5,"" Raymond Santana Jr. tweeted.The 1989 crime -- in which a 28-year-old banker who had been jogging at night in Central Park was raped, bludgeoned with a rock and was found hours later, tied up, stripped and suffering from hypothermia and brain damage -- shook the city and exacerbated racial tensions.Trump involved himself in the controversy soon after it took place when he took out full-page ads in major newspapers calling, among other things, for the death penalty to be reinstated in New York.There were no witnesses to the attack. The victim had no memory of it, and DNA evidence was in its infancy and was not presented at the trial. The five youths were convicted almost exclusively on their confessions, which they testified were coerced by detectives.In 2002, another man, a convicted rapist and murderer, confessed to the assault, and his DNA did match semen that was found on the victim. No DNA evidence has been found to tie any of the Central Park 5 to the crime.The Central Park 5 were exonerated, and in 2014, New York paid them a $41 million settlement. Trump, however, still is not buying their innocence.  ""They admitted they were guilty,"" Trump said this week in a statement to CNN's Miguel Marquez. ""The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same.""Trump obviously still believes that the Central Park 5 are guilty, so it cannot be said he is lying or even misleading. But he is undoubtedly holding steadfast to an opinion in the face of DNA evidence to the contrary and the fact that the Central Park 5 have been exonerated by the legal system.Ken Burns, who co-directed a 2012 documentary on the case, tweeted Friday: ""Apparently Mr. Trump is unfamiliar with the concept of wrongful conviction.""'Bring Back Our Police!'A group of five teenage boys who were in the park at the time and who may have been involved in committing other crimes were arrested for the assault. After extended questioning over two days -- during which the suspects claim they were deprived of sleep and food -- police say they confessed to the crime. None acknowledged actually raping the victim, instead pointing fingers at the others. The viciousness of the crime, which came in the midst of New York's crack epidemic and a spiraling crime rate, coupled with the fact that the victim was white and four of the suspects were black and one was Latino, added to the city's racial tensions.Two weeks after the attack, Trump took out full-page ads in four of the city's newspapers with the blaring headline, ""Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!"" Trump did not specifically call for the youths charged in the jogger attack to be executed. But he was clear that people like them should face severe punishment for such crimes. ""I want to hate these muggers and murderers,"" he wrote. ""They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence."""	Member of 'Central Park 5' blasts Trump

Trump's luxurious 20-acre Mar-a-Lago estate -- which is also his primary residence in Florida -- has previously weathered hurricanes, but the Category 4 hurricane could be a test for the property.A Trump aide told CNN on Thursday, ""Mr. Trump spoke to his employees yesterday to ensure they were being safe and following instructions from local officials. The club is not open for the season yet.""A Category 2 storm in 2004, Hurricane Frances, already wrecked the waterfront property's landscaping and caused some flooding, Trump told the Palm Beach Post after the storm hit.""We lost a lot of the vegetation that gave Mar-a-Lago its character,"" Trump told the newspaper. ""I wasn't there for the storm, but I've been told by my people there that it re-landscaped the place. There was a little flooding in some of the basements, too.""

But the hurricane is also threatening Clinton and Trump efforts to mobilize voters. And the potential of displaced residents could challenge pollsters and scramble turnout.Hurricane politics, on The Daily David ChalianThe Clinton campaign had asked Florida officials to extend the state's October 11 voter registration deadline to account for the storm. But Florida Gov.

The storm is essentially freezing the 2016 campaign in place as candidates on both sides avoid Florida for the next few days.""We're very mindful of the fact that a visit at the wrong time, when people are really focused on keeping themselves safe, would be a real distraction,"" Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said Thursday on CNN's ""New Day."" The storm is forcing the campaigns to scramble across Florida -- even outside the state's evacuation zone. Orlando, and the sprawling surrounding area, is home to many of the state's Puerto Rican voters who are top targets of the Clinton campaign. Field offices were closed and campaign workers were evacuating, aides said Thursday.Republican National Committee political director Chris Carr said the party suspended its voter contacts in Florida Wednesday at noon ""so that our staff can make plans in preparation for the storm."" Political risksBoth campaigns face risks in shuttering significant portions of their voter turnout operations temporarily: Clinton's operation has vast organizational muscle -- and therefore more to lose. Trump has been playing catch-up in swing states, and could find himself running even shorter on time.""You do worry about it, you fret about it,"" said Brett Doster, a Tallahasee-based GOP strategist who aided George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign in Florida.""And if you're a good state executive director,"" Doster said, ""what you're probably telling your employees and volunteers to do right now is to stay safe -- and then after the storm's over, put on a Trump or Clinton T-shirt and go help people out, start handing out water. That's about all you can do."" Obama approval hits new highDoster said hurricanes cause a delay of about a week to 10 days, when ""recovery becomes way more important than a partisan label."" ""That will sort of set a time-out in the game, so to speak,"" he said. ""But it doesn't prevent people from doing things to get ready for the partisan games again once that period passes, and my guess is that both campaigns right now are going to be thinking about what go time looks like, and they will pick up immediately afterward.""Already, Clinton's campaign ran into criticism for a move that gave the appearance she was capitalizing on a deadly storm. Earlier in the week, the campaign spent $63,000 on advertisements to air on The Weather Channel -- which would have aired during coverage of the hurricane, while the station's viewership swelled. On Thursday, Clinton's campaign -- facing backlash from Republicans including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell -- delayed that buy until after the hurricane. Test for governorsMatthew isn't just a test for presidential candidates. Governors like Scott and South Carolina's Nikki Haley will be judged for their response. In North Carolina, incumbent Republican Gov. Pat McCrory is struggling against Democratic challenger Rory Cooper in another race that could hinge on McCrory's handling of disaster efforts. Trump, meanwhile, has personal properties at stake in Florida. His prized Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and his golf club in Jupiter could face the storm's fury. A Trump aide said the Republican nominee ""spoke to his employees yesterday to ensure they were being safe and following instructions from local officials. The club is not open for the season yet.""Trump's Florida properties brace for Matthew impactTrump on Thursday offered his thoughts and prayers to ""everyone in the path of Hurricane Matthew"" and warned residents to heed authorities' calls for evacuations.""Nothing is more important than the safety of your family,"" Trump said in a statement. Trump later told a town hall audience in New Hampshire that he had spoken with Scott.On CNN's ""New Day,"" Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, said he would ""just encourage people not only to keep the people in Florida, and up the Eastern seaboard in their prayers, but also to be supportive of organizations like the Red Cross that are going to be tested in the days ahead as they come alongside families.""Natural disasters have intervened repeatedly in recent presidential contests -- starting in 1992, when Hurricane Andrew slammed into Florida as President George H.W. Bush squared off in a general election battle with then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. After three days of waiting for federal relief, Kate Hale, who was Dade County's emergency manager, famously stood in front of TV cameras and asked: ""Where's the cavalry?"" ""There was a sense that George H.W. Bush wasn't watching his backyard -- he was too busy with international affairs,"" said Tevi Troy, a former George W. Bush White House aide and historian who wrote the book ""Shall We Wake the President? Two Centuries of Disaster Management from the Oval Office."" Past political stormsEight years later, his son -- then a Texas governor who'd learned from his father's failures in handling disasters like fires in 1998 -- forced Al Gore into a major error. Gore, who was then vice president, claimed in a debate that he'd accompanied Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt on a tour of the fire-damaged lands in Texas. Gore had not, and Bush's team successfully labeled him a serial exaggerator for it. But Bush's second term was ultimately undone by Hurricane Katrina, with federal help again slow to arrive and the President's helicopter tour of the flooded New Orleans making him appear detached. A natural disaster again intervened in election season in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast of the United States. The storm stunted Mitt Romney's ability to score political points against Obama in the final weeks of the race. It sidelined New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a prominent Romney surrogate who was suddenly touring storm damage alongside Obama. And it thrust Obama into a leading role, demonstrating the advantage of incumbency. Trump himself weighed in on Sandy in 2012, calling it a boon to Obama's re-election chances because of his ability to dole out federal aid. ""Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars,"" he tweeted on October 30, just days before the election. Trump's own reaction to a natural disaster has already helped him once in the 2016 race: He toured Louisiana in the wake of floods there this summer, revealing a compassionate side of the bombastic billionaire. Though 24-hour cable news has changed the importance of presidential candidates' actions, natural disasters have challenged presidents and candidates through the United States' history, Troy said. In the country's early days -- before the advent of mass communication -- presidents did little to address disasters in part because they had no way to learn about them in real time. It took James Madison six weeks, for example, to learn that a massive earthquake had struck Missouri. Then, there were questions about the president's role. In 1889, when more than 2,200 people were killed when a dam broke in Pennsylvania, President Benjamin Harrison sent a personal check to the victims. "	US election: How hurricanes can upend politics

Just in the past year, Obama has granted clemency to 590 prisoners -- the most commutations in any single year of US history.At the same time, the number of inmates who have applied for pardons or commutations has increased sharply in the final year of Obama's tenure, creating a backlog of requests for Obama's team to process before he leaves office in January.""I've told my office that anything that gets to us will get processed,"" Neil Eggleston, the White House counsel, said in an interview Thursday. ""We're not going to have a failure of resources here. I'm pretty confident that we'll get to all of those.""Eggleston said Obama would continue to personally review clemency requests up until the final days of his administration.""It's not uncommon for him to call me in and have various ones that he wants to talk through. He focuses individually on each one of these, knows a fair amount of information on each of them,"" Eggleston said. ""He's essentially looking at the various pieces, and he's testing the likelihood of success on the outside. The way he really thinks about this is giving people second chances.""She went from a life sentence to clemency from ObamaThe White House wants to bring existing sentences -- many handed down when strict ""mandatory minimum"" punishments were in place -- closer in line with current guidelines. Even as Congress has reduced mandatory sentences for certain drug crimes, thousands of Americans are still serving long sentences that current law no longer requires.Obama has argued the severe sentencing practices of the 1980s and 90s — a facet of the larger ""war of drugs"" — have destroyed communities and led to an exploded US prison population that far exceeds those in other countries. Legislative action on criminal justice reform, which seemed to gain momentum earlier this year, has been put on hold amid a contentious political election where crime has played a prominent role.Of the 102 clemency grants Obama issued on Thursday, 34 shortened life sentences. New release dates vary, from the earliest in February of next year to several years down the road. Thirteen involved the use of a firearm.Among the inmates whose clemency requests were approved by the President on Thursday: David Fitzgerald Lightner, serving a life sentence since 1994 for drug-related charges in North Carolina. His sentence is now set to expire in one year.California's Alvin Green was handed a life sentence in 2004, also for drug changes. His prison term is now set to end in four months.The longest-serving inmate granted clemency Thursday was Lancell Maurice Harris of Arkansas, who was handed a 421-month sentence in 1993 for drug and firearm charges. He's now due to be released in February.Previous recipients of Obama's clemency grants describe an almost surreal feeling upon realizing their lengthy sentences have been shortened.""It was a very exciting moment,"" said Norman Brown, who served 22 years of a life sentence for drug-related charges before his punishment was reduced by Obama last year. ""To look at my life a little over a year ago, I was in prison. To now have a second chance at life.""The Justice Department has seen an influx of clemency applications as more inmates learn of Obama's drive to reduce harsh sentences. The agency has worked to reduce a massive backlog, though the mountain of requests has only grown as the President nears the end of his term.Opinion: How to inspire criminal justice reformOne year ago, 9,115 commutation requests were pending at the Justice Department. Despite a record-setting pace of approvals in the last several months, the number of pending applications rose over the past year to more than 12,000.Requests have increased sharply, jumping from 3,000 applications in fiscal year 2015 to almost 9,000 requests in the first 11 months of fiscal year 2016 -- an increase of almost 200%. It's not likely that even a majority of the applicants would be eligible; in the past year, the Obama administration has quietly denied more than six times the number of clemency applications than it has granted. Lawyers who advocate on behalf of prisoners estimate roughly 1,500 people could qualify for reduced sentences under the administration's guidelines.Even with additional resources dedicated to reviewing clemency and pardon requests at the Justice Department, the massive pile of pending applications will provide a daunting task for officials in the four months remaining in Obama's tenure.The two candidates vying to replace Obama have expressed deep differences in their plans for allowing drug offenders to petition for reduced prison terms. Democrat Hillary Clinton has tread carefully on the issue since her husband enacted some of the sentencing laws that Obama is addressing. Her website says she supports ""allowing current nonviolent prisoners to seek fairer sentences.""Republican Donald Trump, meanwhile, has blasted Obama's commutation program, warning against releasing those convicted of drug crimes back into communities.""Some of these people are bad dudes,"" Trump said at an August campaign rally in Florida.
