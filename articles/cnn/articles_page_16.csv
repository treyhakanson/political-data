After Christie's endorsement, Trump would praise Christie for his takedown of Rubio during the Republican debate right before the New Hampshire primary. Christie mercilessly mocked Rubio when he repeated a talking point again and again to criticize President Barack Obama.During the Republican primary, Christie and Trump -- who have known each other through New York-area politics -- were not as harsh toward each other as were other pairs of rivals. Christie, though, did criticize Trump by calling on voters to get serious and not treat the election as a game, and Trump at one point alleged that Christie knew about his now-convicted aides' plans to close down the George Washington Bridge.Christie has since become one of Trump's most stalwart defenders, and he is currently under consideration for a number of high-profile cabinet posts. But on Friday, Christie was layered over as chair of Trump's transition team, with Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, now in charge of assembling the Trump administration.The relationship between two outsized personalities will continue to unfold in the months ahead.Own a piece of history: Pre-order ""Unprecedented"" at http://CNN.com/book"	CNN's 'Unprecedented': Trump told Christie he didn't think he'd last past October 2015

The two leaders discussed issues including shared threats, strategic economic issues and the historical US-Russia relationship.  The two men also spoke about working to normalize relations between the two countries and emphasized the importance of creating a foundation of bilateral ties through trade, the Kremlin said.They also discussed the need for ""joint efforts in the fight against common enemy No. 1"" -- international terrorism and extremism.Russia factorPutin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on his win, after a campaign dogged by alleged Russian hacking and Trump's cozy relationship with the Kremlin. Trump praised Putin as a strong leader even as US officials accused Moscow of meddling in the election by leaking hacked Democratic campaign emails to undermine Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Multiple critics of Putin have been outspoken in their shock at Trump's win. ""Russia was a democracy, if briefly,"" wrote Gary Kasparov on Twitter. ""Then Trump's idol won our last real election.""Masha Gessen, author of ""The Man With No Face,"" a biography of Putin, drew parallels between the Russian leader and Trump in a piece for the New York Review of Books on ""rules for surviving in an autocracy."" Changing tiesDuring the campaign, Trump was criticized for saying that Putin ""is not going into Ukraine,"" two years after the invasion of Crimea. He later claimed that he meant as President he would not allow further incursions. The President-elect also made a habit of questioning NATO's relevance, a departure from over 60 years of bipartisan foreign policy. Putin has been a long time critic of the alliance's expansion into eastern Europe. However, on Monday, in his first news conference after Trump's election, President Barack Obama said that Trump had told him he was committed to NATO.Last week, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN that he hoped Trump would help improve relations between Washington and Moscow. ""Because what we have currently is a very lousy relationship,"" he said."	Trump, Putin speak about future of US-Russia ties

""Since the presidential election, there has been a sense of uncertainty among many immigrant communities in Chicago and across the nation,"" Emanuel said. ""I want to assure all of our families that Chicago is and will remain a sanctuary city."" The sanctuary city designation broadly means that local police will not coordinate with federal law enforcement in efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would block federal funding for sanctuary cities. ""Block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds,"" Trump said in August, in his much-touted immigration speech. ""We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.""He has not said since then if he would follow through on the promise, and whether it would need congressional approval or could be done through executive order. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment Monday.But there are signs indicating he is likely to stick to a hard-line immigration stance.Trump tapped Steve Bannon, a Breitbart news publisher who has embraced the white nationalist and alt-right movements, to be his chief strategist, placing him on an equal footing with incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus. Immigration and sanctuary cities in particular have been a hot-button issue for conservatives, stoked in part by coverage from the Bannon-led Breitbart.com.That has left city officials across the country planning for the worst if they lose all their federal aid. Officials in San Francisco said they receive up to $1 billion in federal aid. ""It's certainly something the mayor's office, the city's lobbyist and our office has started looking at,"" City Controller Ben Rosenfield, told The San Francisco Chronicle last week. And Crain's New York Business determined that Trump's home city, New York, could take a $6 billion hit if he follows through with the plans. ""These are our fellow New Yorkers, we're going to respect them, protect them, they're part of our communities,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, told the paper."

3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/obama-news-conference-donald-trump-transition/index.html	"But in his first news conference since last week's stunning election results, Obama warned that some of Trump's expectations will soon be shaken up by the gravity of the job. Obama said he was certain after meeting Trump last week that his successor and longtime political foe was ""sincere"" about being president for all Americans but also called on the President-elect to reach out to people who felt anxious after the explosive rhetoric of the campaign, including women and minorities.""I don't think he is ideological, I think ultimately he is pragmatic in that way and that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a good sense of direction,"" Obama said.Obama appeared before reporters before leaving the United States on the last scheduled foreign trip of his presidency, to Greece, Germany and Peru. It takes place with many of Obama's subordinates and liberals across the nation still barely able to believe he will be succeeded by Trump, whose volatile character and taboo-busting rhetoric could hardly strike a more overt contrast to the current president. Obama said he told Trump that his election achievement in tapping into the enthusiasm of his voters was impressive.""I think he is coming to this office with fewer set hard and fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other presidents might be arriving with. Do I have concerns? Absolutely, of course I've got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues,"" Obama added.Obama dodged an opportunity to comment on the appointment of firebrand polemicist Stephen Bannon as Trump's senior White House policy adviser, who has been vigorously criticized as a leading member of the alt-right nationalist movement.Obama said it would not be appropriate for him to weigh in on all of Trump's appointments because it would be incompatible to his desire to provide a smooth transition of power to his successor.""I think it is important for us to let him make his decisions. The American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see,"" Obama said. He added: ""This office has a way of waking you up. Those aspects of his positions or his predispositions that don't match up with reality, he will find shaken up pretty quick because reality has a way of asserting itself.""Obama was repeatedly pressed about Trump's temperament, which he had criticized extensively during the campaign.""There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them,"" Obama said, pointing out the impact that a comment from a US president that is not accurate can have around the world.    ""I think he recognizes that this is different,"" he said.Affirms US commitment to NATOObama also said Monday that the United States would remain the world's ""indispensable"" power and that Trump had told him he was committed to NATO.""In my conversations with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,"" Obama said, adding that he had a message from Trump to pass on to world leaders he will meet this week. ""One of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance.""The President said that there were many diplomatic, military and humanitarian levers of US power that made America the indispensable nation in the world and that status would continue.""There is no weakening of resolve when it comes to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship,"" Obama said.TransitionObama had hoped to be handing the reins to a fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, yet is now preparing the way for Trump, a man for whom he has harbored personal and political animosity, and who has pledged to tear up his legacy as quickly as possible.Obama, who met Trump in the White House for 90 minutes Thursday, stressed to reporters the importance of a smooth transition process, similar to the one he was offered by former President George W. Bush.He said the most important point he made to Trump was the importance of setting up a proficient staffing structure, including the chief of staff, national security adviser and White House counsel.""I hope it was useful,"" Obama said. ""I hope that he appreciated that advice.""He said he told Trump that ""gestures matter"" and how he reaches out to groups that did not support him were important.""I think it is important to give him the room and the space to do that, it takes time,"" Obama said.Trump may be in more need of assistance than other recent presidential election winners, considering he has no experience whatsoever of governing yet is about to take on what may be the world's toughest job.Some White House staffers were surprised by the businessman's rudimentary grasp of White House operations but say they will work to get the new administration up to speed before January 20.Â Officials described Trump's visit as a wake-up call of sorts, revealing the work to be done with the new White House staff before Trump is sworn in.Obama argued Monday that despite there being some ""deeply disaffected"" people, the country he will turn over to Trump is in better shape than it was in when he took office in 2009, amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. He said that economic indicators including unemployment were as healthy as they had been in years, and despite challenges in the Middle East, the US was in a strong position against ISIS."

Soon after, other celebrities such as Amy Schumer and Amber Tamblyn followed suit.Donations to Planned Parenthood have begun to swell, with many on social media donating and voicing their approval.Even if it meant digging deep for funds.Planned Parenthood even took note, thanking supporters for their donations in Pence's name.In a news release sent out on Tuesday, Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said that the office has seen more than $25,000 from nearly 1,400 donations come through since Election Day.According to Ali Slocum, PPINK's Communications Director, it's looking like ""almost 90 percent"" of the donations have been made under Pence's name. She said that Pence will receive notifications of the donations made to PPINK in his honor at his office in the Indiana Statehouse.CNN calls to Pence's office were not immediately returned."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/white-nationalists-on-bannon/index.html	"The leaders of the white nationalist and so-called ""alt-right"" movement â€” all of whom vehemently oppose multiculturalism and share the belief in the supremacy of the white race and Western civilization â€” publicly backed Trump during his campaign for his hardline positions on Mexican immigration, Muslims, and refugee resettlement. Trump has at times disavowed their support. Bannon's hiring, they say, is a signal that Trump will follow through on some of his more controversial policy positions. ""I think that's excellent,"" former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke told CNN's KFile. ""I think that anyone that helps complete the program and the policies that President-elect Trump has developed during the campaign is a very good thing, obviously. So it's good to see that he's sticking to the issues and the ideas that he proposed as a candidate. Now he's president-elect and he's sticking to it and he's reaffirming those issues.""Duke, who last week lost his longshot bid for the US Senate seat from Louisiana, said he plans on expanding his radio show and is hoping to launch a 24 hour online news show with a similar  approach to Comedy Central's Daily Show. He argued Bannon's position was among the most important in the White House. ""You have an individual, Mr. Bannon, who's basically creating the ideological aspects of where we're going,"" added Duke. ""And ideology ultimately is the most important aspect of any government.""Bannon, who was a Navy officer and Goldman Sachs investment banker years before taking over Breitbart, has called the site ""the platform for the alt-right."" Under Bannon, Breitbart has taken an increasingly hardline tone on issues such as terrorism and immigration, running a headline after the Paris attacks of November 2015 saying, ""Paris Streets Turned Into Warzone By Violent Migrants."" It also ran a headline in May 2016 calling anti-Trump, neoconservative commentator Bill Kristol a ""Renegade Jew."" Bannon himself was accused of anti-Semitism by his ex-wife, who alleged in a 2007 court declaration that he did not want their daughter to attend a Los Angeles school because of the numbers of Jews who went to school there. (Bannon, through a spokesperson, denied his wife's accusations.) Peter Brimelow, who runs the white nationalist site VDARE, praised Bannon's hiring, saying it gives Trump a connection to the alt-right movement online.""I think it's amazing,"" Brimelow said of Trump's decision to tap Bannon. ""Can you imagine Mitt Romney doing this? It's almost like Trump cares about ideas! Especially amazing because I would bet Trump doesn't read online. Few plutocrats do, they have efficient secretaries.""Brimelow added his site would continue to focus solely on their hardline position on immigration, saying he expects American whites to vote their interests similar to other minority groups.  ""To the extent that the 'alt-right' articulates that interest, it will continue to grow,"" Brimelow said. Brad Griffin, a blogger who runs the white nationalist website Occidental Dissent using the pseudonym ""Hunter Wallace,"" said he thought Bannon's hiring showed Trump would be held to his campaign promises.""It makes sense to me,"" he said. ""Reince [Priebus] can certainly get more done on Capitol Hill. He will be an instrument of Trump's will, not the other way around. Bannon is better suited as chief strategist and looking at the big picture. I think he will hold Trump to the promises he has already made during the campaign. We endorse many of those promises like building the wall, deportations, ending refugee resettlement, preserving the Second Amendment, etc. There's a lot of stuff in there on which almost everyone on the right agrees.""Griffin added,  ""We're most excited though about the foreign policy implications of Bannon in the White House. We want to see our counterparts in Europe â€” starting in Austria and France â€” win their upcoming elections. We're hearing reports that Breitbart is expanding its operations in continental Europe and that is where our focus will be in 2017.""Jared Taylor, who runs the site American Renaissance, echoed those comments, saying Bannon would help hold Trump to his campaign rhetoric.""There has been some waffling on some of candidate Trump's signature positions: build the wall, deport illegals, end birth-right citizenship, take a hard look at Muslim immigrants, etc,"" he said. ""I suspect one of Steve Bannon's important functions will be as an anti-waffler, who will encourage President Trump to keep his campaign promises.""Chairman of the American Nazi Party, Rocky J. Suhayda, who wrote a post after Trump's election night victory celebrating it as a call to action, said he was surprised at the pick of Bannon, but said it showed him Trump could follow through on his campaign promises. ""I must admit that I was a wee bit surprised that Mr. Trump finally chose Mr. Bannon, I thought that his stable of Washington insiders would have objected too vociferously,"" Suhayda wrote in an email. ""Perhaps The Donald IS for 'REAL' and is not going to be another controlled puppet directed by the usual 'Wire Pullers,' and does indeed intend to ROCK the BOAT? Time will tell.""Richard B. Spencer, the president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute, wrote a series of tweets on Sunday evening saying Bannon had the best position as chief strategist, allowing him to not get lost in the weeds and could help Trump focus on the big picture of setting up his agenda. ""Steve Bannon might even push Trump in the right direction. So that would be a wonderful thing,"" he told CNN on Sunday before the announcement, adding that he hopes to push Trump in an increasingly radical direction.""Matt Parrott, a spokesman for the Traditionalist Worker Party, said Bannon was a ""civic nationalist"" â€” someone who sees an American identity not based on race. ""Steve Bannon has never been a white nationalist and it's kind of tiresome how the important distinction, everyone needs to learn them now that they're relevant. There's an important distinction between a civic nationalist and a white nationalist,"" Parrott to CNN. ""Steve Bannon's entire career, and if you look at Breitbart, like, he's accusing the other side of racism. That's something that wouldn't happen out of an actual white nationalist of course because we don't see being for your race as a negative thing. Yeah, Steve Bannon's a civic nationalist and that's much better than what was in Washington before. We're hopeful about the whole thing."" Parrot added, ""We in the alt-right are going to be just as vicious in trolling and attacking the Republican Congress as they try to obstruct Trump's reforms as we were against the left."""

Leadership elections are scheduled for Thursday.""Congressman Ryan is flattered that a growing number of members of the Democratic caucus have called on him to run for leader,"" Ryan spokesman Michael Zetts said. ""He understands that many members are deeply concerned about the future of the Democratic party and caucus. He watched many traditional Democrats leave our party and he is concerned that if changes aren't made we will be in the political wilderness for many years to come."" The statement went on to say Ryan ""has the highest respect for Leader Pelosi,"" and that ""he considers her a friend and mentor.Ryan could also face some questions about his level of support for House Democrats, with one senior Democratic aide noting that the Ohio Democrat only paid half of the $200,000 in dues he owes the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee this cycle. In a letter, more than 20 House Democrats -- led by Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton -- are urging House Democratic leaders to delay this week's leadership elections, as the party struggles to find a new way forward after its stunning rebuke at the polls last week.Senior Democratic officials say they expect the leadership elections to take place Thursday as planned.But the letter indicates some level of concern within party ranks about whether the Democrats' current crop of leaders are the right people to bring the party back into power. Some of the signatories include members elected within the last few election cycles, underscoring a generational divide within the House Democratic Caucus.Ryan signed onto the letter urging for a delay in the leadership elections. But his spokesman said he pulled his name so as not to create an apparent conflict.In the letter, Moulton's group told Pelosi that Democrats find themselves in a ""difficult situation"" and that more time is needed for an ""extensive conversation"" between the rank-and-file and party leadership. He asked for leadership elections to be delayed until after Thanksgiving.""It is vital that our Caucus take the time to listen to the American people and learn the lessons of this difficult election in order to put our Caucus in the best position to fight the potentially dangerous agenda of President-elect Donald Trump and to have a realistic chance of taking back the House in 2018,"" Moulton said. Moulton added: ""We feel very strongly that our Members deserve the opportunity to thoroughly discuss the results of the election and analyze how our party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's strategy fell so short of our goals.""A Moulton spokesperson said that more than 20 Democrats have signed onto the letter.Asked for comment, a Pelosi spokesman referred questions to a letter the Democratic leader sent last week saying leadership elections would take place this week.Pelosi still has significant support from House Democrats, given her fundraising prowess and that her progressive politics are in line with much of her caucus. On Friday, 40 House Democratic women wrote a letter urging Pelosi to stay as Democratic leader next Congress. So there's little chance of anyone unseating Pelosi atop the Democratic leadership.But Pelosi's long tenure running the House Democratic Caucus has prompted some grumbling among younger members."
