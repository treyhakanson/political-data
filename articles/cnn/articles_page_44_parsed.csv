""Again, this is — if you look at Washington it's a mess and so what I've said is, as governor of Michigan, I have the highest value by making sure Michigan stays on the best track we can so I've stayed out of the presidential race. And, I think it's been a disappointment to many, many people in terms of how negative that's become, and so I'm staying focused in on the House races. There's important Supreme Court races, we've got a couple great justices up for re-election, and other down ballot races are important to how our state operates.""Earlier in the interview, Synder said, ""Again, I keep that to myself in terms of how I vote, but I'll be out there voting with my wife and looking forward to it."" Synder publicly endorsed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney before the Michigan primary. In the final days of the 2016 campaign, Trump is making a play for Michigan — which hasn't been carried by a Republican since 1988 —  in hopes of appealing to blue collar voters who traditionally vote Democratic. He held a rally in the state Sunday evening with rocker Ted Nugent and will appear in Grand Rapids for a rally Monday. "	Michigan Gov.

Comey told congressional leaders Sunday that his bureau had reviewed the newest batch of Clinton emails -- discovered on the laptop of embattled former Rep. Anthony Weiner, estranged husband to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin -- and determined there was nothing to merit reopening their investigation. But instead of crowing about the apparent victory, Clinton and her top staff have been largely quiet since the announcement, instead pushing the attack on Trump.Comey's letter may be too little too late""Clearly, he made a statement 11 days ago that this could be relevant, he created all this expectation that there had to be something significant in this large collection of emails and they went through and obviously sorted through them and found the ones that had to do with Hillary Clinton, and anyway, went through them and there was nothing,"" Hickenlooper said on ""New Day.""He continued, ""I don't think he was out there trying to take down Hillary Clinton; I think he made a terrible mistake. I really do, but I don't want to go dwell on it. I'd rather talk about the crucial stuff, and again, no one in the campaign gave me instructions, I haven't talked to anyone in the campaign in the last 24 hours, no one in the campaign said, 'Here's where our line is.'"""

Four voted for Clinton, two backed Trump while one person supported Libertarian Gary Johnson and one person wrote in 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.Clinton and Trump both go into Election Day with paths to the White House. But Clinton has many more options to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.Perhaps reflecting optimism, Clinton stressed national unity in her closing appearances Monday, while Trump returned to his claims that the political system and the media were rigged against him.7 things to watch for on election nightThe former secretary of state capped her campaign with a remarkable passing-of-the-baton rally with President Obama before a crowd of about 20,000 against the symbolic backdrop of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.""I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became,"" Clinton said, prompting one woman in the crowd to shout out, ""Not your fault!""But Clinton went on to slam the ""many troubling things"" Trump had said about women, Muslims, Latinos and African-Americans. She said Trump's ""most horrifying"" comment was his warning that he may not accept the election result.""Let's show tomorrow there will be no question about the outcome of this election!"" Clinton said.Obama introduced Clinton in a speech that was both a firm endorsement and a poignant farewell to politics.""We now have the chance to elect a 45th president who will build on our progress who will finish the job ... who is smart, who is steady and who is tested,"" Obama said. ""She will work, she will deliver. She won't just tweet.""Barack Obama's frantic final campaignThe President said he was counting on Americans not to elect Trump.""America, I am betting on you one more time,"" Obama said, predicting the nation would ""reject fear"" and choose hope.Michelle Obama, who has used her popularity to become perhaps Clinton's most powerful surrogate, called on Democrats to turn out in huge numbers to prevent Trump becoming president.""This election is on us. It is in our hands,"" she said. ""If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win.""'Face of failure'Trump, meanwhile, presented himself as the face of change for Americans, whom he said had been let down by a corrupt political system.""Hillary is the face of failure. She's the face of failure,"" Trump said, blasting Clinton's political record and service as secretary of state.The Republican nominee claimed -- in defiance of polls showing a mid-single digit Clinton lead -- that he was tied with his rival in Pennsylvania, a state that forms a crucial part of Clinton's Democratic firewall.""They say we're tied in Pennsylvania. I don't think so. I think we're going to blow them out tomorrow. Blow them out,"" Trump said at a rally in Scranton, one of the most hotly contested parts of the state.The latest CNN Poll of Polls gives Clinton a four-point lead over Trump, 46% to 42%. In most of the swing states that will decide, the race is tight. But if Clinton can hang on to most states that have voted Democratic in recent elections and add at most a couple of swing states, she will likely win the election.But Democrats are worried about Trump's strength in the Midwest -- particularly in Michigan, which has not voted Republican since 1988. Trump has been making a strong push there amid narrowing polls.Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway predicted that Trump will win Michigan, telling ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that the campaign feels ""really good"" about the latest polling in upper Midwest states.In final push, Trump's aggressive campaign swing creeps past midnightBut Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said late visits to Michigan by both Clinton and Obama on Monday were more a function of the calendar and the lack of early voting there than a sign of genuine anxiety.""Our strategy these last few days is to focus on the states where voting overwhelmingly happens on Election Day,"" Mook said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""Previously, as you've seen, we've been focused on states like Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, where the majority of the voting happens early.""He continued: ""So, this is really a reflection of the voting calendar. Donald Trump has been kind of running to each and every state it seems. So they have their strategy. But we have ours.""Trump scraps for every electoral voteTrump has little margin for error.He will need to win Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, where he is locked in close races with Clinton, just to give him a chance to make the near-perfect run through the remaining swing states that he needs to capture the presidency.Democrats are particularly encouraged by indications of a surge of Hispanic voters in early voting in Florida and Nevada. But there also are warning signs for Clinton, with African-Americans not as large a proportion of the early-voting electorate as they were for Obama in 2008 and 2012.CNN's most recent electoral map shows Clinton is projected to win 268 electoral votes from states that are solidly blue or leaning in her direction. Trump has 204 votes from states that are solidly in his column or leaning that way. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the White House.GOP strategist: Clinton will win -- but Congress won't work with herIn the latest CNN Poll of Polls data in the swing states, Clinton leads 45% to 43% in North Carolina, the rivals are tied at 45% in Florida and Clinton leads by five points in Pennsylvania, a state Trump hopes to turn red.In New Hampshire, where the race moved toward Trump in the last week, Clinton is still up up 44% to 41%. New Hampshire only has four electoral votes, but Trump's path to 270 is so difficult that votes from smaller states could still be crucial for him.The presidential election is not the only close race that will wrap up on Tuesday. Democrats are battling to grab back the Senate from Republicans. The GOP, meanwhile, is expected to hold onto the House of Representatives, but likely with a reduced majority.Speaker Paul Ryan said Monday that he would run again for the top job, despite reports in recent days that he may opt out or that more radical members of his restive caucus could try to oust him, after deeming him insufficiently supportive of Trump.""I am going to stay -- you know why? Because I moved our majority to put out a very specific and coherent agenda. We have it, we're running on it,"" Ryan said on the Charlie Sykes radio show.Asked who would win the presidential race, Ryan said he genuinely did not know, because ""it is such a weird election, such a volatile election."""

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/james-comey-fbi-hillary-clinton/index.html	"Comey's initial letter to Congress on October 28 was the very definition of the October surprise, rocking Clinton's campaign and giving Donald Trump's team a surge of momentum at a time when Clinton seemed to be coasting toward victory.Eleven days before the election, Comey announced the FBI had discovered new emails that could be pertinent to the investigation into the former secretary of state's private email server, an inquiry that he had said was concluded this summer.On Sunday, two days before the election, Comey essentially lifted that cloud of suspicion from her campaign -- signaling that his agency's new discovery of emails would not lead to criminal charges against Clinton.""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July,"" Comey said in his letter to top congressional Republicans.Millions of votes already castWhile the news was welcomed by Democrats who worried that the initial announcement had inflicted serious damage to her campaign, it came after a week in which millions of early votes were cast around the United States. Moreover, many voters made up their minds in the last week, leaving Democrats furious about the last-minute announcement.Though the race between Clinton and Trump was always expected to tighten in the final days, Comey's initial announcement was expected, at the very least, to depress turnout on Clinton's behalf. Her allies and advisers worry it has cost her votes among independents and Republican women who -- repelled by Trump -- had considered supporting her campaign.A senior Democrat close to the Clinton campaign told CNN's Jeff Zeleny Sunday that it was ""impossible to fully undo the damage of the last nine days,"" but acknowledged there was a sense of relief within the campaign that the matter was resolved.California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the top Democrat on the Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday that Comey's initial letter ""unfairly hurt the campaign of one candidate and changed the tenor of this election.""""Today's letter makes Director Comey's actions nine days ago even more troubling. There's no doubt that it created a false impression about the nature of the agency's inquiry,"" Feinstein said in a statement. ""I believe the Justice Department needs to take a look at its procedures to prevent similar actions that could influence future elections.""Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said he believed the damage to Clinton's campaign had been overstated. ""Much of what you saw was natural tightening, returning to the norm of what the race is, which is a three- to four-point race,"" he said.""What this gives (the Clinton campaign) is a sense of momentum going forward,"" he said, noting that it also deprives Trump of a key talking point.'Good news for Clinton'""There's no question it's good news for Clinton,"" Pfeiffer said. ""I don't think the original letter was going to cost her the campaign and I don't think this is going to win it for her. But you want to feel like the wind is at your back going into the election, and this certainly helps."" Republicans, including Trump, had roundly praised Comey for his surprising disclosure of the new email review more than a week ago. But the FBI director was quickly relegated to a GOP punching bag Sunday -- as Trump continued to argue on the campaign trail that ""the system"" was rigged to protect the powerful.""Hillary Clinton is guilty,"" Trump said in Sterling Heights, Michigan. ""She knows it. The FBI knows it. The people know it, and now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.""""Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he can't possibly know,"" Trump supporter Newt Gingrich tweeted, referring to the rapid review of the newly found emails that the FBI conducted over the past week.""The destruction of James Comey by political pressure is painful to watch,"" the former House Speaker added. ""He is being twisted into an indefensible pretzel of contradictions.""Another Trump adviser, former General Michael Flynn, was incredulous, sharing a view voiced by several Trump advisers that it was ""impossible"" that the FBI had conducted a thorough review.""There R 691,200 seconds in 8 days,"" Flynn tweeted. ""DIR Comey has thoroughly reviewed 650.000 emails in 8 days? An email / Second? Impossible.""Presumably to avoid giving the issue another infusion of oxygen, Clinton did not address the new letter at her rally in Ohio Sunday afternoon.Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN's Sara Murray that she did not believe the second letter would change the contours of the race in the final days. Even before the original Comey letter, she said more Republicans were gravitating toward their nominee, and more women and independents had begun leaning in Trump's direction.""Our polls started to tighten prior to last Friday,"" Conway said. She noted that the second letter did not change Comey's harsh criticism of Clinton earlier this year.""He still says she's reckless and careless,"" Conway said. ""She always has something to hide. There's always a separate set of rules for her.""Trump made that argument at his midday rally in Minneapolis, shortly after the news broke. ""You have to understand it's a rigged system and she's protected,"" he said. "	Comey's letter may be too little too late	['Feinstein', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Murray']	[]

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/fbi-james-comey-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/index.html	"The FBI director cleared Hillary Clinton for a second time Sunday in the probe over her private email server. But the damage to her campaign -- and his own reputation -- is unlikely to quickly heal.With his highly public handling of the email probe and his resulting entanglement in the political tumult, Comey accomplished the unusual feat of antagonizing each side of the partisan divide. In the aftermath, his stature is diminished and his future in a Clinton or Donald Trump administration is highly uncertain.Comey's new status as one of Washington's most polarizing leaders is a stunning twist for someone who long enjoyed the genuine respect of both parties. If he hoped his Sunday letter to lawmakers informing them that a review of new emails potentially tied to Clinton's server would quell the political storm swirling around him, he was mistaken. Democrats pilloried him for influencing the final days of an already vitriolic campaign and Republicans accused him of caving to political pressure and questioned how the bureau could review thousands of emails so quickly.""Right now, (Clinton) is being protected by a rigged system,"" Trump said at a rally in Sterling Heights, Michigan. ""It's a totally rigged system. You can't review 650,000 emails in eight days. You can't do it folks,"" Trump said, mischaracterizing the number of emails the FBI was reviewing. Sources with knowledge of the investigation have told CNN the number is in the tens of thousands.Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said Comey ""unfairly hurt the campaign of one candidate and changed the tenor of this election.""Can Comey continue?Comey is three years into a 10-year appointment at the FBI. But there are now serious questions about whether his position is still tenable going forward — regardless of who becomes president.By late Sunday, neither Clinton nor Trump supporters would definitively say their candidate still had confidence in Comey.""It's not my place to come in and say if Director Comey is doing a good job or not a good job,"" Trump's senior communications adviser Jason Miller told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" ""It is clear that the system is rigged. It is clear that this investigation has not been handled very well from the beginning.""Trump's path to White House lined with false, misleading statementsAsked on ""The Situation Room"" whether he had confidence in Comey, Rep. Sean Duffy, a Trump supporter, said ""I don't have any information from inside the FBI to make that conclusion right now.""Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a Clinton supporter, also refused to say whether he had confidence in the FBI chief.""Director Comey has a good reputation and he's been a law enforcement professional for many years,"" Butterfield said.Still, he expressed concern about the initial letter sent to Congress at the end of last month. ""I am still evaluating why he would send such a letter to Congress,"" Butterfield said. Comey recognizes he's in a tough spot even after the election. But an official said he's given no indication he will resign.FBI's reputation at stakeThe FBI chief's future isn't all that's at stake. The political storm surrounding Clinton's emails and the FBI's handling of them threaten to tarnish the bureau itself.Republicans are suspicious of the extent to which the FBI is being constrained by President Barack Obama's Justice Department. Democrats are worried that leaks and probes into the Clinton Foundation are indications that rank-and-file FBI agents are upset by Comey's decision not to seek indictments of Clinton.Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine made a stunning charge Saturday that elements of the FBI were trying to throw the election to Trump -- a contention that would seemingly make it difficult for Comey to work in a Clinton administration.""Comey knew that the FBI is not only a leaky sieve but there were people within the FBI actively working—actively working—to try to help the Trump campaign,"" Kaine said in an interview with Fusion. ""This just absolutely staggering, and it is a massive blow to the integrity of the FBI.""Emotions run high in final days of the campaignFrom the start, the FBI probe into Clinton and Comey's handling of it has drawn him onto political ground anyone in his position would prefer to avoid. And it's been a reminder that once officials like Comey, who by definition required to be nonpartisan, enter the political crossfire, it's nearly impossible to get out with their character and prestige in place.""The destruction of James Comey by political pressure is painful to watch,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, tweeted on Sunday. ""He is being twisted into an indefensible pretzel of contradictions.""If Clinton loses the election on Tuesday, Democrats are certain to blame Comey, since she saw her comfortable leads in opinion polls over Trump erode following his first letter to Congress just over a week ago.If she wins, but her margin is narrow, or if Democrats fail to win back the Senate, Comey will also be accused of actions that had the effect of suppressing the Democratic vote and influencing the election.""This should never have happened,"" Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings said on ""The Situation Room,"" arguing that Comey should never have sent the initial letter to Congress in the first place.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/pantsuit-nation-trnd/index.html	"It's pantsuit day, and they intend to dress accordingly.Plans to wear the Democratic nominee's signature style on Election Day started in the private Facebook group Pantsuit Nation. It's where Clinton supporters gather to gush over the candidate and share what her historic candidacy means to them, though the group is not affiliated with any campaign or party.In little more than two weeks the phenomenon has spread from the private group to become the latest feminist rallying cry for Clinton. There's a public Facebook page and people are using #PantsuitNation to join the conversation on social media. Even Beyonce caught the fever, opting for a black-and-white polka-dotted number at her Friday night Clinton rally.Just as with Trump supporters who plan to wear red, it's a (sort of) subtle way of showing solidarity amid restrictions on wearing campaign paraphernalia to the polls. But to those in the group, it's more than a fashion statement.What is Pantsuit Nation?Members of Pantsuit Nation come from swing states, red states and blue states, but they share a devotion to the first woman candidate, expressed in heartfelt and often soul-bearing posts. Many posts come from women -- and some men -- who feel isolated among Trump-supporting friends, families and neighbors. They don't feel comfortable talking politics on their Facebook feed so they turn to the group. Others are simply looking for a safe space where they can go gaga for Clinton without having to check their language for fear of inviting unwanted political debate, critiques or worse.The posts -- which we're not attributing to anyone because the group is private -- feature variations on the following themes:""I've been wanting to discuss this for a while, but I'm deep in the heart of Trump country and I'm sure most of my friends could care less...""""This group has made me so happy. Happy to know how many people actually want to change the world. Happy to know that there's so many Hillary supporters like me...""""All these posts flying by my news feed are giving me hope and courage...""Who started it?Maine resident Libby Chamberlain started the group after the final presidential debate. She was inspired by a conversation with a friend who found herself defending Clinton's sartorial choices to young women. To Chamberlain and her friend, woman wearing pantsuits was a way to challenge gender roles through an item of clothing historically seen ""as a man's prerogative,"" she said in email. ""We talked about how beautifully and stoically Hillary embodies women's fight for equality, and how the pantsuit is an emblem of that struggle,"" she said. ""It's a symbol that might be lost on younger women, and so I wanted to do something to re-appropriate that symbol and everything that it means to me as a feminist and Clinton supporter.""What does it do?Members share stories of fights with relatives or being the only person with a Clinton-Kaine yard sign. Stories about mothers who fought for the Equal Rights Amendment or mothers who became citizens this year and voted for the first time. They share voting selfies after casting a ballot -- the group warns not to post pictures in voting booths -- and pictures of all manner of HRC paraphernalia: T-shirts declaring ""I'm with her"" and ""Nasty woman,"" nail art, hairstyles, signs, even food bearing the HRC logo. Many share pictures and stories of a time they met Clinton.The group has ballooned to more than 1.3 million members, evolving from a safe space into an organizing group whose members spent the weekend before the election fund-raising and canvassing -- and looking for pantsuits. It turns out pantsuits can be hard to find in a pinch, especially on the cheap, causing some to offer improvised solutions such as tracksuits and Halloween costumes. Organizers suggest trying Goodwill, your mother's closet or online retailers for last-minute solutions.What should you wear?Chamberlain plans to wear a white pantsuit for its symbolism in women's rights and women in politics. It's the color activists used during women's suffrage to symbolize the purity of their movement. It's also the color worn by Shirley Chisholm when she became the first African American elected to Congress and Geraldine Ferraro when she accepted the vice-presidential nomination of a major party ticket in 1984.At this point, though, Pantsuit Nation is about more than an article of clothing, Chamberlain said.""Our members are relieved to find a place where they can support their candidate without fear of anger and attacks,"" she said. ""For many, this group has become a safe space to share their stories and support one another; we're hoping to continue this safe space post election."""
