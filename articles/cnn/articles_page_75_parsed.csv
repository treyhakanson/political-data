""I really don't care what happens to me,"" Kane, 50, said, CNN affiliate WTAE reported.An attorney representing Kane told CNN affiliate KYW Prosecutors, however, said that her crimes -- which they say have tarnished the attorney general's office and ruined an activist's life in the process -- warranted time behind bars.Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy handed down the sentence after several hours of testimony, CNN affiliate KPVI reported.Kane was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs and taken to Montgomery County jail after her sentencing, KYW reported. She posted a $75,000 cash bail and remains free while she appeals, CNN affiliate WPVI reported.The charges had alleged that Kane acted in anger about a local newspaper article that accused her of dropping an investigation into politicians accepting bribes. To get back at her predecessors, the complaint said Kane leaked sealed, confidential grand jury documents to the media and then lied under oath.A political act of retributionFour years ago, Kane, a former assistant district attorney in Lackawanna County, defeated Republican David Freed as a political rookie.State Democrats quickly pegged Kane as one of the party's rising stars. But halfway through her term, the Philadelphia Inquirer ran a story with the headline: ""Sources: Kathleen Kane shut down probe of Philly Democrats.""That's where the trouble started. The article outlined an investigation launched by Kane's predecessor, former Chief Deputy Attorney General Frank G. Fina, into politicians caught in a sting accepting local bribes. In emails cited in the complaint, an irate Kane vowed to wage ""war"" with Fina, a criminal complaint later said. After the article, Kane leaked sealed, confidential grand jury documents conducted under Fina that looked into whether J. Wyatt Mondesire, the former leader of the NAACP's Philadelphia chapter, misused grant money, the complaint said. Fina's investigation never led to criminal charges against Mondesire, the complaint said.'No one is above the law'In August 2015, then-Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman, a Republican, filed charges against Kane. Ferman accused the then-attorney general of secretly leaking documents ""in the hopes of embarrassing and harming former state prosecutors whom she believed, without evidence, had made her look bad."" Ferman also alleged that Kane after had lied under oath to a grand jury about leaking the grand jury documents to reporters in order to cover her tracks. Kane, though, strongly denied the allegations ahead of the trial -- even as Democrats like Gov. Tom Wolf urged her to resign.""A resignation would be an admission of guilt and I'm not guilty,"" Kane said in a statement in August ahead of her trial.A jury found Kane guilty of felony counts of perjury and obstruction. She resigned that same week.""It seemed that we had somebody who felt that she was above the law, and that's not the case because no one is above the law,"" Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said following the trial. ""We are a very honorable profession here. We have rules that we have to abide by and there are no exceptions to that.""Wolf nominated Bruce Beemer, a former Kane deputy who testified against her, to become attorney general. Prosecutors: Kane should go to jailOn Monday, Judge Demchick-Alloy weighed whether Kane would serve time behind bars, remain under house arrest or simply get probation.In Kane's sentencing memo, her attorney argued to the judge that the former attorney general has been punished enough since she had to step down from elected office and could be disbarred given her status as a now convicted felon. In addition, prosecutors said Kane, who wants to focus on parenting her two teenage sons, was not at risk of re-offending, nor was she a threat to society.But Steele wrote in a sentencing memo that Kane deserved prison since she eroded the public's confidence in the attorney general's office, according to KYW. Beyond that, Steele noted that Mondesire, who was never charged of a crime, had lost his job, saw his health decline, and died nearly two years later.""During her tenure as attorney general, Kane behaved in a paranoid manner and repeatedly misused her official authority to advance her personal vendettas,"" Steele wrote in a sentencing memo, according to the The Legal Intelligencer.The race for the AG's officePennsylvania residents will soon get a chance to decide who permanently replaces Kane when they elect a new attorney general next month.Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who chairs the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, is running against state Sen. John Rafferty, a Republican from Montgomery.The election will occur statewide on November 8."	Former PA Attorney General Kathleen Kane gets prison term	['Wolf']	[]

However, in an June 2012 interview with CNBC's Squawk Box reviewed by CNN's KFile, Trump said he didn't believe in deporting undocumented immigrants who, he said, ""had done a great job.""Asked about his views on immigrant labor, Trump said, ""You know my views on it and I'm not necessarily, I think I'm probably down the middle on that also. Because I also understand how, as an example, you have people in this country for 20 years, they've done a great job, they've done wonderfully, they've gone to school, they've gotten good marks, they're productive â€” now we're supposed to send them out of the country, I don't believe in that, Michelle, and you understand that. I don't believe in a lot things that are being said."" Trump's comments came in the context of a discussion of the Supreme Court's decision a day before on the state of Arizona's tough immigration law. Trump said ""both sides lost"" in the ruling, which struck down key parts of the law but upheld a part of the law allowing law enforcement to check the immigration status of a person when enforcing other laws.A Trump campaign spokesperson did not return a request for comment.Trump kicked off his campaign in June 2015 by calling some of the undocumented immigrants from Mexico ""rapists.""""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" Trump said. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""The tumultuous 2016 campaign is in a sudden limboIn a speech in September laying out his immigration plan, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to building a wall on the US southern border and deporting undocumented immigrants with a criminal background. Trump did not specify in his speech what he would do with those that remain in the country, but did say  undocumented immigrants seeking legal status would have to first leave the country.""For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system,"" Trump said.Full video of Trump's CNBC answer below:"	"Trump in 2012: 'I don't believe"" in deporting many undocumented immigrants"	['Trump']	[]
2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/23/politics/barack-obama-republican-senate-candidates-criticism/index.html	"He ripped Ohio Sen. Rob Portman in Columbus last week as a too-little-too-late political opportunist for disavowing Trump only after the presidential nominee boasted about sexual assault. He lashed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in Miami as a weak-minded hypocrite who once ran against Trump but now worries about alienating his backers.And on Sunday in Las Vegas, he declared GOP Rep. Joe Heck, running to replace retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a closet Trump supporter, even as he's disavowed the candidate.""How does that work?"" Obama said with disdain during a raucous campaign rally here. ""You're for him, but you're not for him. You're kind of for him. What the heck?""""That's not leadership. That's cynical,"" Obama said. ""That means you'll say anything and so anything just to get elected.""During his half-hour stump speech, Obama lambasted Trump for carrying out a ""bromance"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and for suggesting the upcoming vote is rigged in favor of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""That means he's losing,"" Obama said on Trump's claims about the validity of the election. ""It means you don't have what it takes to do this job.""Polls in Nevada show a close race, though Clinton has emerged with a narrow edge in the last several weeks. A Monmouth University survey released just before last week's debate showed the Democratic nominee at 47% support among likely voters, compared to 40% for Trump. That was a reversal from a month ago, when Trump stood at 44% and Clinton at 42%.The state's Senate race, held to replace Reid, appears tighter. Heck stands at 45% in the Monmouth survey of likely voters, while his Democratic rival Catherine Cortez Masto, a former attorney general, is at 42%.In his remarks Sunday, Obama reserved his harshest criticism for the GOP Senate candidate, who initially backed Trump enthusiastically but withdrew his support following tape of Trump making the sexually aggressive remarks. Obama said that kind of political reversal doesn't stand scrutiny.""Now, when suddenly it's not working, and people are saying this guy's kind of out of line, all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were OK with this up to a point, are saying this was too much, suddenly that's a deal-breaker,"" Obama said. ""Well what took you so long?""""What the heck took you so long?"" Obama said again with emphasis -- one of several times he deployed the candidate's surname as an attack.And he went after a new Republican tactic, suggesting GOP lawmakers should be elected to act as a check to Clinton's power should she win. An ad in New Hampshire this week backing incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte utilized the argument, but Obama said the senators' records should stand for themselves.""They've been in charge of Congress now for the last six years basically, and what have they gotten done?"" he said to chants of ""nothing.""Obama has increasingly turned his ire on Republican lawmakers in the waning days of the 2016 campaign, casting those who have criticized Trump's behavior but maintained their endorsements as craven hypocrites. With Clinton leading in most national polls, and up in enough battleground states to signal a likely victory, the President now hopes to turn key legislative chambers, where the agenda items he's pressed for as commander-in-chief could either be cemented or eroded in the years after he leaves office.The strategy is not without risk. In the post-election lame duck session, many of the same Republicans Obama is hammering will prove essential in approving the President's last remaining legislative priority: passage of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact.Even TPP's fate in the Republican Senate is unknown though, and there appears little concern on Obama's part about undermining any remaining ties to congressional Republicans in his final months in office.His stop in Las Vegas on Sunday kicked off a three-day fundraising tour through San Diego and Los Angeles, where the President was planning to use his still-considerable pull among deep-pocked Democrats to pad his party's congressional campaign coffers, along with the Clinton campaign's.Already, Obama has appeared in television spots for Democratic Senate candidates in Florida, California, Illinois, North Carolina and Pennsylvania; he's also recorded radio ads for Senate hopefuls in New Hampshire and Nevada. Those states' Senate battles are among the most fiercely contested this year.Obama has also cut television or radio ads for three governors races and ten House contests, and Democratic officials predict new spots will appear almost daily in other races around the nation.Democratic officials also said Sunday Obama planned to endorse 150 candidates for state legislatures across the country, lending his voice to recorded phone calls, appearing in television ads, and issuing statements of support in places where his considerable popularity holds sway.Like his active support for Clinton, Obama's considerable efforts in down-ballot races amounts to an investment in his own legacy, which has relied heavily on executive action prone to reversal by courts or Republican legislatures. In advocating for Democrats in state houses and the US Capitol, Obama is also hoping to ensure his own achievements are furthered -- or at least aren't scrapped -- when he's no longer in office.A Democratic US Congress could, for example, approve necessary changes to the Affordable Care Act, preventing Obama's signature legislative achievement from collapsing. If Democrats assume a majority in the Senate, the leftward evolution of the federal judiciary begun under Obama could continue, starting with the confirmation of his Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland (provided Clinton renominates him in January, which is far from a certainty). And instead of relying on Obama's set of broad environmental regulations established through executive action, a Democratic body could write actual laws combating climate change.In his rally Sunday, Obama declared a loss in November fatal to his presidential record.""For all the progress we've made, if we don't work as hard as we can in these next 16 days all that progress could be out the window,"" he said."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/24/politics/jay-z-hillary-clinton-concert/index.html	The event -- which aides expect will draw thousands -- is part of an ongoing series of concerts that aim to motivate young people to turn out for Clinton the way they turned out for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.What hip hop lyrics tell us about Hillary Rodham ClintonJay Z's event is targeted specifically at young black voters, an electoral demographic that has been reluctant to rally around Clinton, in part, because of comments she made in the 1990s and her support of President Bill Clinton's crime bill.The concert was first reported by Buzzfeed.Jay Z is not the first member of his household to help Clinton. Iconic artist Beyonce, Jay Z's wife, attended a Clinton fundraiser in New York City in 2015. She has not, however, performed on Clinton's behalf.Jay Z has been slow to back Clinton, especially considering how close he has been with Obama. The rapper even rapped in 2009 that he texts with the president, a fact Obama denies.Clinton's campaign has also enlisted help from Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, John Legend and others to engage young voters.Cyrus knocked on doors at George Mason University over the weekend, hoping to use her stardom to spur students to vote for Clinton.RELATED: Clinton looking past Trump to transition planningPerry was in Las Vegas over the weekend and will headline an event in Philadelphia on November 6, two days before Election Day.Rocker Jon Bon Jovi will also perform in Pittsburgh on Thursday, and The National, an indie rock back from Cincinnati will perform in its hometown on her behalf November 2.Clinton has had a stable of celebrity supporters throughout her 2016 campaign. But not until recently have a number of these famous supporters -- including Jay Z -- pledged to campaign for the former secretary of state.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/23/politics/ip-forecast-gop-trump-rallies-clinton-outreach-republicans/index.html	"It's all part of CNN's ""Inside Politics"" forecast, where you get next week's headlines today. 1) Shhh ..... Clinton quietly reaches out to Republicans            Hillary Clinton insists she takes nothing for granted and will campaign to the end as if she were the underdog.            But there are increasing signs of her confidence, including devoting more time in her speeches to trying to help Democratic candidates for Senate and other offices.            CNN's Jeff Zeleny shares his reporting on her quiet, private outreach to Senate Republicans as Clinton allows herself to look ahead at the prospect of trying to govern.            ""I'm told she's been talking to Republican senators, old allies and new, saying that she is willing to work with them and govern. On the campaign trail she clings very closely to President Obama. She needs him to win the election,"" Zeleny says.  ""But she also is signaling she will be a different kind of president. She will work with (Republicans). She wants to have an open-door policy.""2) Would Clinton keep Obama's Supreme Court pick?            It may be a moot point if the Senate surprises us and acts on President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court during the post-election lame duck session.            But if not, and if Clinton wins the presidency, would she re-nominate Garland or make a new pick?            She hasn't answered that question. But Julie Pace of The Associated Press shared her reporting on the intense pressure Clinton faces from Democratic interest groups who don't view Garland as sufficiently liberal.            ""If Clinton wins she will be constantly watching the left flank of her party and there are a lot of people in that part of the Democratic party who would like to see her move on a more liberal justice, particularly if Democrats have a majority in the Senate,"" Pace says. 3) Trump likes his big rallies -- win or lose            As campaign optics go, it would have been HUGE: Donald Trump's campaign charter landing in the shadow of a NASA launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center.            But those plans have been scrapped for now, and the Trump campaign is making different rally plans in Florida. Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg Politics says his campaign must balance strategy and scheduling in the final two weeks with Trump's preference for big rallies.         ""As this gets bleaker, they are getting more creative,"" Jacobs says. ""They've been doing these big hangar rallies. They were supposed to have him land on the space shuttle runway, which would have really thrilled the 'Make America Great' types. Florida newspapers report that (plan) apparently has been scrubbed. So what that says is maybe that's a new symbol for his campaign.""4) Paul Ryan faces survival questions Four years ago, Paul Ryan spent the final weeks of the presidential campaign extolling the virtues of the Republican nominee for president. This cycle, Ryan tries to not even mention the Republican nominee for president.            Of course four years ago Ryan was Mitt Romney's running mate. This cycle, he is the House Speaker, trying to navigate an environment in which some House Republicans are enthusiastic about Trump while others view him as toxic.            The question for Ryan is one of survival: He has already faced dissent from some of the most conservative members of the House GOP. CNN's Manu Raju shares his reporting on potential new efforts to force a leadership change.           ""Paul Ryan has his hands full after the elections from the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservatives who led that charge against John Boehner several years ago,"" Raju says. ""The caucus is demanding to delay leadership elections scheduled to take place. They want to have them later in the lame-duck session in order to see how Ryan deals with spending bill negotiations.""5) GOP envies Democrats' bullpen -- and wants a closerIn baseball, the best bullpen often makes the difference as we get into late October. Can the same be said for presidential campaigns?            A lot of Republicans worry the answer is yes. The GOP is watching with envy as the Clinton campaign deploys the Obamas, Vice President Biden, Bill Clinton and Senate stars like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to help campaign in battleground states.            So where is the GOP bullpen? Or even just one closer?            Maybe, in at least one race, the call will go out for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.            Remember Kasich ran second to Donald Trump in the New Hampshire presidential primary -- and he has refused to endorse Trump.            GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte is in a tough re-election race, and she now says she can no longer support Trump.            New Hampshire polling shows a good chunk of Kasich primary voters are not supporting Trump, but many also are not supporting Ayotte.             So some New Hampshire Republicans are hoping Kasich will come out of the bullpen -- or at least out of Columbus -- and return to New Hampshire to help Ayotte in the campaign's final days. There are also discussions about whether a Kasich testimonial ad would help."

She has some advantages,"" Kellyanne Conway said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" adding that those advantages include that Clinton ""has a former president, happens to be her husband, campaigning for her; the current president and first lady, vice president -- all much more popular than she can hope to be. And she's seen as the incumbent.""Conway, while touting Trump's Gettysburg speech Saturday that proposed ethical reforms, also distanced herself from Trump's lengthy attack on women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.  ""He delivers his own speeches. This is his candidacy. He's the guy who's running for the White House, and he has the privilege to say what he wants,"" Conway told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""This lifetime ban on lobbying -- if you've worked in the White House, you can't lobby for foreign nations. That's sort of the big, ethical shower we're all going to need to take post-Hillary Clinton State Department,"" she said, touting portions of Trump's speech.Trump also proposed a series of reforms that include term limits of six years for House and Senate members. That would've meant Trump running mate Mike Pence would've been term-limited out of office halfway through his 12-year tenure representing Indiana. ""He was definitely living in the swamp,"" Conway said of Pence, who led fiscal conservative fights like opposing the bank bailout pushed by his own party's President George W. Bush. ""Mike Pence would agree with Donald Trump on that: When you're there for too long, you need that fresh blood and new perspective,"" Conway said. ""I wish there were more members like Mike Pence. If there were, we wouldn't need to have the conversation."" Conway also attacked Clinton over her family foundation's acceptance of foreign contributions -- but Tapper pointed out that those details are public because the Clinton Foundation has published lists of its donors, while Trump hasn't released his tax returns. Tapper said: ""We have no idea what his ties are and where there might be moneyed interests and conflicts of interest because he won't disclose his tax returns.""Trump says he'll sue sexual misconduct accusersConway responded: ""Here's what we do know: We know that -- as he said yesterday in Gettysburg, Jake -- he used to be an insider. He's somebody who breathed rarefied air right up there with the Clintons and others, given his position, his power and his wealth and his great success as a businessman. And yet, that gives him the credibility and legitimacy to go and fight the system from the outside in. He knows how corrosive and corrupt it is.""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/22/politics/donald-trump-jessica-drake/index.html	"Jessica Drake is at least the 11th woman to accuse Trump of unwanted sexual advances since the surfacing of a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump brags about being able to grope and kiss women.Drake, an adult film performer and director, claimed at a news conference in Los Angeles Saturday that Trump asked her for her phone number and invited her to his suite the night they met in 2006. She went and brought along two other women to accompany her because she said she did not feel comfortable attending alone.""He grabbed each of us tightly, in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission,"" said Drake, who is being represented by Gloria Allred, the women's rights attorney who has represented other women -- including two other Trump accusers -- in high-profile sexual assault cases.Feeling uncomfortable, Drake said she left after about 30 to 45 minutes but later received a phone call from one of Trump's representatives, who invited her to his room alone. Drake declined.According to Drake, Trump himself then got on the phone with her, asking her to come back and to go out to dinner or attend a party with him, but she again declined.He then asked, ""What do you want? How much?"" Drake said.After she turned down his invite, she said he eventually offered her $10,000 and use of his private jet if she accepted.At the news conference, Allred showed a photograph of Trump and Drake together.The Trump campaign, which has vehemently denied previous sexual assault allegations against him, pushed back against Drake's account Saturday.""This story is totally false and ridiculous. The picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her. This is just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate who just today is number one in three different polls. Anyone who would pay thugs to incite violence at a rally against American citizens, as was released on video, will stop at nothing. Just another example of the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election,"" the statement said.Trump earlier Saturday also vowed to sue his accusers after the election. He did not mention Drake's allegations during a campaign rally in Cleveland.Asked about Trump's claim earlier in the day that she was behind other accusers, Clinton told reporters aboard her campaign plane Saturday night ""That is just not accurate.""Allred addressed Trump's threat to sue.""If Mr. Trump thought that such bullying tactics would silence his accusers and prevent other women from coming forward, he will be sorely disappointed. Women will not be intimidated into silence by Donald Trump,"" Allred said.Drake, at the end of her statement, acknowledged that she might be called an opportunist and a liar, but after the release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape, she said she felt the need to come forward publicly.""I realize that in this situation I may be but a tiny grain of sand. But clearly, this is an enormous beach,"" Drake said.The accusations made against Trump in the past two weeks range from inappropriate touching to forced kissing. Simultaneously, his poll numbers nationwide and in several key swing states have plummeted."	Latest Trump accuser says he hugged, kissed her without permission	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, Kaine said the two wouldn't reject the possibility of a future Asia-Pacific trade agreement. ""You never close the door if you can get a deal that's going to be good for American workers and our economy,"" the Virginia senator said. ""We aren't against trade.""""We want to find export markets for American businesses because they'll be able to add workers the more they export,"" he said. ""That's very important.

He pointed to his own decision to vote for ""trade promotion authority,"" which gave Obama the power he needed to finalize the agreement and submit it to Congress for an up-or-down vote with no amendments, in 2015 -- even though he ultimately opposed the final deal. ""I had put on the record in 2015 the concerns that I had, especially about the enforcement provisions. Those concerns were not addressed,"" he said.
