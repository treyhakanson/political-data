""And the members said, to a person, people were in support of Donald Trump and they really were perplexed why Paul even had the conference call in the first place because Donald Trump delivered a masterful performance in the second debate.""Bachmann added, ""So I think that this isn't a civil war, as you wrote it. It's really the members in Congress who are saying 'we're not going to fall in line and abandon Donald Trump.'""Bachmann's comments follow days of turmoil within the Republican Party about how to respond to 2005 footage leaked Friday in which Trump can be overheard making lewd and sexually aggressive comments about women. The former representative of Minnesota's 6th congressional district also defended the Trump campaign's decision to invite three women who have accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior to Sunday's second presidential debate, saying it was important to remind young voters of the former president's past indiscretions.""Well, there's a reason why he did and it's because the case was brought up about him,"" Bachmann said, continuing: ""In this circumstance, I think it was very much fair game because this was a planned surprise attack on Donald Trump going at his character.""Bachmann acknowledged she would prefer that the Republican Party focused on policy rather than politics, but said Trump was prepared to fight fire with fire to defeat Hillary Clinton in November.""I think what all of us would like to see is more talk about Obamacare and the disasters that are happening in Syria right now, the tragedies over there, and also with our economy,"" Bachmann said. ""But then it really will be up to Hillary Clinton's team to make sure that there aren't these sort of videos and things that are coming out because Donald Trump will respond in kind. Why shouldn't he?"""	Michele Bachmann on the Republican Party: 'This isn't a civil war'	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Costello']	[]

They were comparing the political fallout from comments Trump made on an audiotape leaked on Friday to The Washington Post to that from Bill Clinton's sexual conduct in the White House in the 1990s when Ingraham said that she thought that voters ""have had just about enough.""King replied that he agreed. ""I hear that, Laura,"" he said. ""And I also think about the establishment wing of the party could simply be amputated out in this effort that's going on right now. They've gone so far out on this limb. And in the end, maybe we can rebuild. And for meâ€”what they're thinking, one thing is, they don't want Trump's immigration plan. They're for the Gang of Eight's amnesty bill. That's worth a lot to them.""Earlier in the interview, King said that he does not think Republicans should consider the presidential election a lost cause. ""It looks grim,"" he said. ""But I would not resign myself that the election is lost. We do not know that we've lost and we must not believe that we have and the best thing we can do is lift Trump up."""

Ann Kirkpatrick. ""He's an old, good friend of mine and a lot of people like him. The fact is I can't, seriously, I cannot vote for either one.""McCain withdrew his support of Donald Trump over the weekend after a recording surfaced in which the Republican presidential nominee can be heard making vulgar comments about women. On Tuesday, Trump hit back at the Arizona senator. ""The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave he won),"" Trump tweeted, ""then dropped me over locker room remarks!""McCain, a former GOP nominee in his own right, has said he also cannot support Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton. ""It's not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of my party, he won the nomination fair and square,"" McCain said at the debate. ""But this, I have daughters, I have friends, I have so many wonderful people on my staff, they can not be degraded and demeaned in that fashion. And so I believe that ... I had to withdraw my support just as I cannot support Hillary Clinton."" So that might leave McCain with Graham, the South Carolina senator who ran a quixotic and short-lived campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.When Graham ended his White House bid at the end of last year, McCain said that he and fellow Republicans lost ""our most qualified, thoughtful, fearless and honest presidential candidate."" Such admiration was hardly surprising. The senators have had a famously close relationship for years, frequently teaming up on policy matters and making joint press appearances. With former Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the trio formed the so-called ""three amigos."" As he seeks his sixth term in the Senate, McCain is strongly favored in his re-election bid against Kirkpatrick -- although many analysts have questioned whether Trump could influence the state of play in Arizona.McCain, for his part, has never been a full-throated Trump supporter. At the debate on Monday night, the senator expressed concern for the future of his party.""I just worry about, frankly, and this probably has nothing to do with this debate, but I worry about the future of the Republican party,"" McCain said.

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate-early-voting/index.html	In 27 states where data have been made available so far, early votes have been cast or absentee ballots returned by at least 455,878 people. In most of those states, the data cover a period through Thursday, the day before news broke of the 2005 video of Trump, others cover a period ending earlier, and no state total can reflect ballots that had been mailed but not yet received or tallied by election officials, meaning the total number of votes cast before Friday's campaign-altering news is likely greater.The available data includes results from nine states where some recent polls have found a tight race between Clinton and Trump that will be critical to the outcome of the presidential election -- Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Colorado, Wisconsin and Virginia. Those states make up a significant share of the votes cast so far, with about 190,000 total returned ballots or early votes coming from those nine.Iowa, which has tilted Trump in most polling so far, leads the way, with more than 77,000 votes cast, Wisconsin, more of a Clinton stronghold based on polling there, follows with 76,559. Both states are among those where election experts expect a significant share of the vote to be completed before Election Day. RELATED: Clinton wins, Trump exceeds expectations, but few moveThe share of ballots cast early or absentee has been growing -- the 35% who voted that way in 2012 is more than double the 16% who cast ballots before Election Day in 2000. In 12 states in 2012, a majority of votes were cast early or absentee, including three states where all voters receive ballots by mail -- Colorado, Oregon and Washington. The number of states where a majority of voters make their choices before November 8 is expected to grow in 2016.Voters reflected in these totals can cast ballots in multiple ways, either requesting and receiving an absentee ballot, which is then mailed back or dropped off in person. Some states require an excuse for casting such votes -- such as plans to be out of town, being away at school, long-term illness or a work schedule that prohibits voting on Election Day -- and states vary in how strictly those rules are enforced. Most states -- 37 for this year's balloting -- now also offer some form of in-person early voting, where any voter can go to a polling place before Election Day and cast a ballot for any reason. The group of states where a majority of ballots are cast early already included the battlegrounds of Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and Colorado, as well as the population centers of Texas and California. More than four in 10 votes were cast early or absentee in Iowa in 2012, along with a third of votes in Ohio and a quarter in Michigan. Battlegrounds closer to the northeast, which tend to have more restrictive policies for voting early or absentee, including Virginia (12%), New Hampshire (10%) and Pennsylvania (5%) are less likely to have large blocks of votes cast before Election Day.RELATED: 7 takeaways from the second presidential debateCNN has partnered with Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates and advocacy groups, academics and think tanks, to receive detailed early vote return information for the 2016 election. Catalist's voter list connects returned ballots with some demographic and registration-related information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at just who has already cast a vote in this year's election. CNN will receive updates to these data from Catalist regularly over the next 30 days.In Iowa, where early voting began September 29, more than twice as many registered Democrats have cast votes so far as Republicans, even though Republicans have a slight edge in party registration overall in the state. But the Democrats edge in returned ballots is not quite as large as it was at this point in the campaign in 2012, when votes cast by registered Democrats outweighed Republicans by a nearly 3-to-1 margin.But the partisan pattern is not the same in every battleground state. In North Carolina, where about 22,000 votes have been cast, those from registered Democrats only narrowly outpace those from registered Republicans, though Democrats have a nearly 10-percentage-point advantage in party registration overall. Still, that's a better rate for Dems than at this point in 2012, when almost twice as many registered Republicans had returned ballots than Democrats. Other battleground states included in this data either have fewer than 10,000 ballots returned so far, or do not ask voters to affiliate with a party when they register. Party registration does not necessarily equate to partisan vote in the presidential race or any other contest, and the actual votes from those returned ballots won't be reported until Election Day polls have closed in each state, but the numbers are the first hints at how effective each party has been in getting their own supporters to lock in their votes early.

Norquist said more than 90% of Republicans in Congress have made that commitment. ""It's branded the Republican party as the party that won't raise your taxes,"" he said.

Chris Christie revealed Tuesday morning that he was not happy with the way Trump responded after tape of his 2005 lewd and sexually aggressive comments broke Friday night.""I was there when he found out about it and there's no question in my mind he's embarrassed by it,"" Christie said during an interview with WFAN Radio in New York. ""But I think that he should have been much more direct and much more focused on saying, just saying 'I'm sorry and only I'm sorry and that's what I would have done.'""  Christie told the radio hosts that he had ""issues to deal with in New Jersey"" Sunday, which prevented him from appearing at the debate. But sources had told CNN that Christie was upset that Trump wouldn't listen as they were in crisis management mode. Ultimately, Trump did not just say he was sorry, but he tried to turn the tables by bringing allegations against Bill Clinton into it. ""On the video itself, let's be really clear it is completely indefensible and I won't defend it and haven't defended it,"" Christie said.RELATED: GOP on the precipice""That kind of talk and conversation, even in private, is just unacceptable and so I made that very clear to Donald on Friday, when this first came out, and urged him to be contrite and apologetic because that's what he needs to be.""Still, the New Jersey governor and Donald Trump transition chief said Tuesday said ""at this point"" he supported the Republican nominee's bid for the presidency.Christie conceded that the video may have turned off undecided voters but said he still stood behind Trump.""What I would say is again, anybody who hears that video was disturbed by it and offended by it and as well they should be,"" Christie said, adding, ""I've known him for a long time and I'm really upset by what I heard but in the end this election is about bigger issues than just that so at this point I still support him.""Christie had been a loyal Trump supporter since he ended his own presidential run earlier this year. The New Jersey governor has known Trump for years, and sources say is one of the few who will be blunt with the billionaire when giving political advice.Christie's decision to cancel his scheduled television appearance Sunday morning on CNN, and not attend the debate, stands in stark contrast to that of another close adviser and surrogate, Rudy Giuliani. The former New York City mayor not only publicly defended Trump, but helped orchestrate the appearance of four Bill Clinton accusers at the debate itself."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/donald-trump-campaign-republican-party/index.html	"Declaring that the ""shackles"" of moderation had been shed, Trump on Tuesday unleashed a barrage of angry tweets denouncing the party that made him its presidential nominee, while taking potshots at its leader, House Speaker Paul Ryan.For nearly 16 months, Trump and Republican officials have maneuvered and played each other, launching and squashing a series of feuds as the party sought to manage Trump and he angled to keep its organization in his corner.But four weeks out from Election Day, in the wake of two disappointing debate performances and the publication of a potentially campaign-killing video tape, with prominent elected officials fleeing his shadow, Trump is on the warpath again -- and this time, the damage could be permanent.Here's a look back at how we got here.August 6, 2015 -- Division at the first debate  In the same city where he'd accept the nomination a year later, Trump at the first GOP primary debate in Cleveland made it clear that his loyalty to the party would only go so far.When Fox News moderator Bret Baier asked the candidates to raise their hands if they could not promise to support the eventual nominee -- or not run an independent campaign if they lost the primary -- Trump, standing center stage, quickly lifted his.After a labored explanation, Trump gave a weirdly qualified assurance -- one that, in retrospect, he actually seems keen to break.""If I am the nominee,"" Trump said, ""I will pledge I will not run as an independent.""  September 3, 2015 -- Unity! Trump signs the pledgeFour weeks later, as Trump's lead in the early polls expanded and party officials grew anxious, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus visited with the candidate in New York. At the end of their private meeting, Trump emerged with a new message.""I have signed the pledge,"" he told reporters at Trump Tower, papers in hand. ""So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and to the conservative principles for which it stands."" In return for his signature, Trump said, the party had offered him reassurance he would be ""treated fairly"" as the primary contest unfolded.December 9, 2015 -- About that pledge ...Define ""fair.""To say that Trump moved the goalposts would be inaccurate. Their initial position, beyond the vague promises of fairness, had never been truly established.During an interview at his offices in New York, Trump again refused to rule out an outside run. ""I think it's highly unlikely unless they break the pledge to me, because it's a two-way street,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon. ""They said they would be honorable. So far, they, I can't tell you if they are, but the establishment is not exactly being very good to me.""The first votes were still nearly two months off, but Trump insisted on being treated ""as the front-runner.""""If the playing field is not level, then certainly all options are open,"" he added. ""We'll go through the primaries. We'll see what happens, and I'll make a determination.""February 26, 2016 -- The establishment moves toward TrumpThe runner-up to Ted Cruz in Iowa, Trump won the next three GOP primary contests. Then, days after his romp in Nevada, a major endorsement arrived on his doorstep.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a one-time favorite who had dropped out weeks earlier after a disappointing finish in New Hampshire, joined Trump in Texas to give his backing ahead of Super Tuesday. ""I will lend my support between now and November in any way for Donald,"" Christie told surprised reporters before a rally in Texas.""Generally speaking, I'm not big on endorsements,"" Trump would say. But this one, he added, ""This was an endorsement that really meant a lot.""With Christie on board, Trump seemed to be making inroads with the mostly elusive party establishment. But as Trump continued to rack up the wins -- he took seven states on Super Tuesday to Cruz's three -- whispers about the potential for a convention challenge grew louder.March 29, 2016 -- Rip up the pledge!Trump, Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich all formally abandoned the pledge during a CNN town hall in late March, as the field narrowed and the attacks turned increasingly personal.""I'm not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and my family,"" Cruz said, making reference to a nasty tweet Trump had sent days earlier. ""I think nominating Donald Trump would be an absolute trainwreck,"" he added, ""I think it would hand the general election to Hillary Clinton.""Trump, meanwhile, was focused on the RNC, protesting again that he had been ""treated very unfairly"" by the party. Asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper if he pledged to support the eventual nominee without reservation, Trump said simply: ""No, I don't anymore.""May 4-5, 2016 -- General election arrives, but endorsements do notAfter overwhelming Cruz and Kasich in the Indiana primary on May 3, Trump emerged as the GOP's presumptive nominee. And with that, the pressure was on high-ranking elected officials, many of whom had previously demurred citing the ongoing competition, to state their allegiances.New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, on May 4, was among the first to employ some rhetorical jujitsu, as her own campaign said she planned to support the nominee, but not formally endorse him. Others, like former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, an early (and harsh) Trump critic, did an about-face and even suggested he would be open to a vice presidential nomination.But it was House Speaker Paul Ryan's response that underlined just how unsure the relationship between Trump and party leaders remained.""I'm just not ready to (support Trump) at this point. I'm not there right now,"" the speaker said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, adding that he hoped to find common ground and ""be a part of this unifying process.""Trump was not impressed.""I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda,"" he shot back in a statement. ""Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!""By the next day, the two sides had scheduled a sit-down for the following week on Capitol Hill.May 12, 2016 -- Detente!The makings of a fragile alliance seemed to be in the works after a meeting that was treated like a summit between the heads of warring states.When it was over, Trump and Ryan even put out a joint statement pointing toward progress and a more decorous future.""While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground,"" they said. ""We will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there's a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal.""Ryan did not endorse the presumptive nominee, but conceded that his primary run had been ""kind of unparalleled."" Trump tweeted his delight all the same, saying, ""Great day in D.C. with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well!""""I don't mind going through a little bit of a slow process,"" he told Sean Hannity on Fox News. ""We're getting there.""Priebus, a close ally of Ryan's who helped broker the meeting, called it ""a good first step toward unifying our party"" during a subsequent interview with CNN's Dana Bash.By June 2, Ryan had come all the way around. In his hometown Janesville Gazette, the Wisconsinite wrote that he finally felt ""confident (Trump) would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people's lives. That's why I'll be voting for him this fall."" With the Cleveland convention nearing, Trump had finally secured the backing of the highest-ranking Republican in the land. â€ŽJuly 18-21, 2016 -- Cold shoulders, a clash in ClevelandTrump had Ryan nominally in his corner, but the quadrennial convention was beset by high-profile no-shows. Four of the party's last five presidential nominees failed to turn up, along with a number of big name officials, including Ayotte, Sen. John McCain and the host state's governor, John Kasich. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman also steered clear of the convention stage, opting not to give a speech.Asked by a reporter if he planned on attending, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, one of Trump's most consistent detractors, said, ""No. I've got to mow my lawn.""One former rival who did show up in Cleveland? Ted Cruz.But the Texas senator had a trick up his sleeve. Cruz refused to endorse Trump during his address, telling stunned and angry delegates to ""vote your conscience."" It was a shocking round of staged defiance. The next morning, Cruz made his purpose clear, telling his state delegation, ""I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.""Trump initially responded with calm, but in a press conference following the convention, revived an old, odd and discredited charge that Cruz's father had in some way been in cahoots with JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.August 1-5, 2016 -- Back-and-forth with Paul RyanHis poll numbers plummeting after a disastrous week spent attacking the parents of a slain war hero, Trump lashed out at Ryan in early August.On the first day of the month, he tweeted praise for the speaker's primary challenger, Paul Nehlen. A day later, Trump in an interview with The Washington Post refused to endorse Ryan, turning his May words against him, saying, ""I'm not quite there yet.""But after another painful news cycle littered with ugly poll numbers, Trump backed down and served up the endorsements he had so pointedly withheld. At a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, he announced his formal backing for Ryan, McCain and Ayotte. Trump would dismiss campaign chairman Paul Manafort soon thereafter, replacing him with Breitbart boss Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, a longtime GOP pollster who had been working for the campaign. While Bannon's entry raised some eyebrows, Conway's elevation signaled to many that Trump might be prepared to rein in his rhetoric. September 23, 2016 -- Cruz makes peace before the first debateA calamitous August gave way to a resurgent September, as Trump closed in on Clinton after a few weeks of measured campaigning. Then, just days out from the first debate, a shocker. Ted Cruz, the primary rival who sought to humiliate him on national television, came out in support of the revived Trump.""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,"" he wrote in a Facebook post.Trump received Cruz's kind words with some of his own, saying of his former opponent, ""We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.""October 7-10, 2016 -- The tape hits, and breaks the coalitionA little after 4 p.m. last Friday, a video, obtained and published by The Washington Post, put a hammer to the Republicans' fragile coalition.In the tape, Trump can be heard musing about sexual assault and engaging in otherwise graphic conversation about a number of women. Within hours of its hitting the airwaves, Trump's GOP backers began to flee.Utah's Jason Chaffetz became the first sitting Republican congressman to publicly withdraw his support. Ayotte and McCain soon did the same. Establishment figures like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on Trump to withdraw from the race. Others said they would simply refuse to support or defend the nominee going forward.But in perhaps the most stinging response, Ryan, who said he was ""sickened"" by the contents of the 2005 tape, told Trump to stay away from a GOP event in Wisconsin where they had been scheduled to share a stage. Vice presidential nominee Mike Pence was initially announced as Trump's stand-in, but that was scuppered, too.By Monday, Ryan went a step further, telling GOP House members he would no longer vouch for Trump or defend him, and instead, per his spokeswoman, ""spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities."" October 11 -- It all falls apartRyan stopped short of revoking his endorsement of Trump, but the message was clear: the long dance had come to a screeching halt.Trump responded with a primal scream. Over the course of about five hours, beginning early Tuesday morning, the Republican presidential nominee launched a volley of angry tweets targeting Ryan, John McCain and ""disloyal R's"" from around the country.""Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty,"" Trump wrote after grumbling that he had not been credited with having won his most recent debate against Clinton by a ""landslide.""""It is so nice,"" he continued in another tweet, ""that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.""As his subsequent posts would confirm, Trump's desired approach meant taking on both Republicans, like McCain, and Democrats -- the latter he described as being more naturally loyal than members of his own party. ""Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary,"" he said. ""They come at you from all sides. They don't know how to win - I will teach them!""With less than a month to go, class is in session."

Humayun Khan, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" Tuesday. ""And for this candidate to put his political expediency ahead of any realization of pain and suffering of the families is shameful.""Trump said during the debate: ""First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero.

So he would have been alive today.""Khan, whose son was killed in the Iraq War, delivered a passionate appeal at the DNC in July to encourage voters to support Hillary Clinton. He said Trump smears ""the character"" of religious minorities like his family. Khan said Tuesday he was shocked that Trump brought up his son's name again considering that his family has never heard from the candidate.""We were not only shocked, we were saddened that for such disingenuous expression of his thinking and of his feeling, and that was nothing but it was ... political expediency,"" he said. Khan said Trump is incapable of understanding the pain of the military families he exploits.""Look how much he has paid in support of the military. Nothing. Think back what his character had been. Is that what we want in our commander in chief,"" he asked. ""Nothing but a selfish person that is exploiting the sympathies, exploiting the loyalty of the military families.""Khan also attacked Tuesday Trump's promise to appoint a special prosecutor that would put Clinton in jail if the businessman is elected. ""Donald Trump has laid the foundation for interference to investigate Hillary Clinton, his political opponent,"" he said. ""This is not a third world country this is the democracy of the United States. What example are we setting? Are we setting this example that will haunt us later?""Khan said Republicans need to recognize that Trump is unfit to be the commander of chief due to his character flaws. ""I have said it two months ago that this candidate does not have the character to be the commander in chief of the armed forces,"" he said. ""Think back to what his character has been.

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken after Trump's tape surfaced found Hillary Clinton surging to an 11-point lead among likely voters in a four-way race for the White House. And without formally revoking his endorsement of Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan cut the nominee loose and said he would no longer defend him, instead devoting his energy to securing the congressional majorities.But Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus stood by the nominee Monday despite the bleak prospects.Pence congratulated Trump on the debate and said he never considered leaving the ticket -- even as dozens of Republicans called on the nominee to step aside over the weekend. ""I'll always keep my conversations with Donald Trump and my family private,"" Pence told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""But it's absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket.""Running with Trump, Pence said, ""is the greatest honor of my life.""Preibus, meanwhile, put to rest talk that the RNC was ready to cut Trump off to devote resources exclusively to congressional races.""Nothing has changed in regard with our relationship,"" Priebus said in a call with RNC committee members, according to sources on the call. ""We are in full coordination with the Trump campaign. We have a great relationship with them. And we are going to continue to work together to make sure he wins in November.""For her part, Clinton and her allies are steadily becoming more bullish. The campaign is eyeing whether to spend money in additional states.""There is always a chance,"" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters Monday. ""It's the kind of thing that we are day-to-day on and we have to see how these states are looking and if that is a smart thing to do.""Grover Norquist: Donald Trump still hasn't signed tax pledgePriorities USA, the leading super PAC supporting Clinton, is preparing to expand beyond the presidential race and potentially run television ads focused on a handful of competitive Senate races, CNN's Dana Bash reported Monday. Until now, Priorities USA has spent the 2016 election cycle entirely focused on getting Clinton elected. The fact that they may use their resources to also promote Democratic candidates in down-ballot races suggests how increasingly confident they are in a Clinton victory.Still, there are signs of caution in Clinton's world. Trump's decision to hold a pre-debate press conference with women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety in the past shocked many of Hillary Clinton's aides. They said the move didn't intimidate Clinton, but there is an acknowledgment inside Clinton's campaign that if the wheels completely come off Trump's operation, the attacks could grow even more personal.""This was supposed to be his big moment,"" Palmieri told reporters. ""His threat, he followed through and it had no effect, so I don't know what he is going to do as an encore."" Frustration among establishment RepublicansThe St. Louis debate underscored the long-running frustration among establishment Republicans that Trump has made no real effort to moderate his tone in a fashion that would reassure and win over independents and swing voters in the blue states that he must flip to win the White House.The bar for Trump was undeniably low Sunday night. But unlike the first debate, he did successfully launch attacks on Hillary Clinton's record.Still, they were attacks designed to rev up the conservative base: criticizing her handling of the Benghazi attack, excoriating her judgment in using a private email server, and attempting to shift the spotlight on to past troubles within her marriage.7 takeaways from the second presidential debateHe thrilled his supporters by asserting that if he were President, he'd appoint a special prosecutor to look into her ""situation,"" and throw her in jail -- immediately drawing Twitter comparisons to a dictator of a banana republic.Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, hailed the debate as a victory and insisted the Trump campaign would welcome back any Republican who had rescinded his or her endorsement.""We hope what they saw on display last night was somebody willing to take the case to Hillary Clinton,"" Conway said on ""CBS This Morning."" ""If those members can live with giving the next three or four Supreme Court justices over to Hillary Clinton, they should think about that.""  Winning back womenSpeculation before the debate had centered on how Trump might try to win back women offended by his assertion on the 2005 tape that his fame gave him license to grope and kiss women he had just met.Trump apologized during the debate, and when pressed by debate moderator and CNN Anchor Anderson Cooper, Trump said he had never made unwanted sexual advances on women.But rather than appealing to women with thoughtful words of contrition or an explanation of how he had changed, Trump again merely dismissed his 2005 comments about women as ""locker room banter,"" before veering incoherently into a tangent about ISIS and beheadings around the world.Donald Trump's mission: Make Clinton's life hell for the next monthThat missed opportunity to reach out to voters disgusted by the tape was only amplified by the spectacle that Trump staged before the debate -- parading out three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in the 1990s, in an attempt to unnerve his opponent. Several Republican strategists and donors said they cringed as they watched the bizarre scene play out as a prelude to the debate.It remains to be seen how voters will greet Trump's strategy of trying to shift the conversation to Bill Clinton's past, and how they will react to his fierce attacks on Clinton, who sometimes fares better among female voters when she is viewed as a victim.With less than a month until Election Day, Trump has significant ground to make up."

Trump then asked the boy if he'd rather stay up onstage with the GOP nominee or go back to his parents.The boy paused and then said, ""Trump."" The arena went wild as Trump handed the boy off to a (smiling) Trump staffer to return him to his parents. Monday's spontaneous show of affection by the Republican nominee marks a dramatic shift from a previous interaction with youngsters at a campaign rally. At an August event in Ashburn, Virginia, Trump, trying to reassure a distressed mother with a crying baby, said that he loves hearing babies cry at his rallies and told her not to worry -- only to change his mind just a moment later.""I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it,"" Trump said as a baby could be heard crying in the audience. ""What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like, don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want.""But less than two minutes later, as the baby continued to wail, Trump took back his words.""Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here,"" he said to laughs. ""I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's OK. People don't understand. That's OK."""	Donald Trump holds toddler to microphone at rally	['Trump']	[]
