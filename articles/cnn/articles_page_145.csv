A decision that, believe me, does not come lightly,"" Kerry told an audience in Brussels, Belgium, while speaking on Transatlantic relations.Kerry stressed that the US would continue to pursue diplomatic initiatives to curb the violence in Syria that has sprung from the civil war there.""I want to be very, very clear to everybody: We are not giving up on the Syrian people. We are not abandoning the pursuit of peace. We are not going to leave the multilateral field. We are going to continue to try to find a way forward in order to end this war.""Kerry also slammed both Russia and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad for their role in perpetuating the conflict.""Together, the Syrian regime and Russia, seem to have rejected diplomacy in furtherance of trying to pursue a military victory over the broken bodies, the bombed-out hospitals, the traumatized children of a long-suffering land,"" he said.The White House on Monday had similarly harsh words for Russia's behavior.""Everybody's patience with Russia has run out,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.Earnest said Russia had lost credibility by ""making a series of commitments without any indication they were committed to following them,"" accusing Russia and its Syrian regime allies of trying ""to bomb civilian populations into submission.""Kerry last week had threatened to call off bilateral talks with Russia unless Moscow took immediate steps to end the assault on Aleppo and restore a ceasefire.Kerry: 'I lost the argument' on SyriaThe statement announcing the suspension said the Russian and the Syrian regime's unwillingness to uphold the cease-fire accord was ""demonstrated by their intensified attacks against civilian areas, targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need.""US military and civilian personnel that were sent to Geneva, Switzerland, to work with the Russians on the Joint Implementation Center will now be withdrawn home, according to the statement and US defense officials.The Joint Implementation Center was a key element of the negotiated accord and was intended to facilitate collaboration between the American and Russian militaries in targeting ISIS and al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, the al Nusra front. The center was never launched because the agreement had required that the cease-fire hold and aid deliveries must be allowed for at least seven days prior to the center's starting work.Officials said the US and Russia will continue to communicate via previously established direct military-to-military channels as part of a safety effort to ""de-conflict"" Syrian airspace and allow for coalition and Russian warplanes to avoid dangerous accidental incidents.State Department spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters Monday that US and Russian officials had met through the weekend to discuss Syria. The suspension ""does not preclude multi-lateral dialogue"" with Russia regarding Syria, Trudeau added.When asked if the US had lived up to its end of the cease-fire deal, Trudeau said, ""We believe we did.""For its part, Moscow announced Monday that it was suspending an arms reduction agreement with the US in which both countries agreed to dispose of 34 tons of plutonium, enough for thousands of nuclear bombs, over what it called Washington's ""unfriendly actions"" toward Russia, state news agency TASS reported. In a statement published on the Russian Foreign Ministry's website, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said: ""The decision we have made is a signal to Washington: attempts at talking to Russia from the position of strength, in a language of sanctions and ultimatums while continuing selective cooperation with our country ... where this cooperation benefits the United States will not succeed.""Asked if the Russian announcement was linked to the recent US decision regarding the suspension of bilateral Syria talks, Trudeau said, ""I would not link those at all.""""We believe it would be a shame if this important agreement was put aside because of an unrelated issue,"" she added.Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed regret over Washington's decision Monday to stop participating in the bilateral channels with Russia.Shortly after Zakharova's response, Konstantin Kosachev, head of Russia's Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the decision by the US.""Russia has striven for continuing dialogue with the US on Syria until the last moment, and only our position was keeping the chance to launch a stable peace process alive,"" he said, according to Russian state-owned Sputnik News.He also accused Washington of making the decision because of campaign politics, saying it was based ""to a great extent on subjective factors linked with the current presidential election cycle.""The UN's special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said he ""deeply regrets"" the fact that the US-Russia talks ""did not reach a positive conclusion,"" according to a statement issued in the wake of the announcement.""The UN will continue to push energetically for a political solution of the Syrian conflict regardless of the very disappointing outcome of intense and long discussions among two crucial international stakeholders,"" the statement said."

But my worries are not the same as black grandmothers, who have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face,"" Clinton said. In her remarks, Clinton quoted 9-year-old Zianna Oliphant, who garnered national attention when she tearfully spoke about the recent police killings of African-Americans at a Charlotte City Council meeting last week. Clinton said she ""wouldn't be able to stand it"" if her own grandchildren ever felt the kind of fear and worry that Oliphant and others have expressed. ""But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state -- let's be honest here: They won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council,"" Clinton said. Clinton lamented that because of the recent killings of black people by police, Oliphant had to weep rather than simply feel the joys of being a child. ""Can you imagine? Nine years old -- she should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things that her future holds for her,"" Clinton said. ""Instead, she is talking about graveyards.""In the middle of Clinton's remarks in North Carolina, Oliphant took the stage and stood next to Clinton, beaming as the Democratic nominee hugged her. It was in striking contrast to the image of Oliphant that the country became familiar with last week. With tears streaming down her face, the distressed girl said at a heated city council meeting: ""It's a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed and we can't see them anymore.""""It's a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears,"" she said. ""We shouldn't have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.""That city council meeting came on the heels of the death of Keith Lamont Scott. A husband and father of seven children, Scott was shot and killed by police last month at an apartment complex. Police said they were looking for someone else with an outstanding warrant when Scott came out of a vehicle with a gun. But Scott's family has disputed that account, saying Scott was carrying a book. Scott's death, along with the killing of Terence Crutcher by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, once again sparked national outrage, heated debates about the use of police force against minorities, as well as a series of protests. Clinton had initially planned to visit Charlotte last Sunday, but scrapped those plans at the request of Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts.Clinton has made addressing systemic racism and police shootings a central part of her campaign, dedicating her first speech as a candidate to investing more in police departments in order to combat bias. During her remarks on Sunday, Clinton pledged to spur economic investment in impoverished areas, toughen gun laws and ""build on the work that president Obama has done.""And while Clinton did not mention Republican nominee Donald Trump during in her remarks at church, she urged congregants to reject people who believe the way to fix implicit bias is more ""law and order."" Trump regularly calls himself the law and order candidate.""Now, there are some out there who see this as a moment to fan the flames of resentment and division, who want to exploit people's fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart,"" Clinton said. ""They say that all of our problems will be solved by simply more law and order, as if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist.""""Being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other,"" she said."

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/donald-trump-taxes-report-hillary-clinton/index.html	"The revelations threatened to put the controversy over Trump's refusal to follow recent precedent and release his tax returns at the center of the presidential campaign less than 40 days before the election, after a week in which the Republican nominee has struggled to bounce back from a debate in which most analysts and scientifically conducted polls scored Clinton as the winner.His campaign vehemently pushed back on the Clinton campaign's effort to turn the report into an ""October surprise"" moment, saying Trump has a ""fiduciary responsibility"" as a businessman to pay no more tax than legally required. It also charged that the report proved that the Times and the ""establishment media"" are merely an arm of the Clinton campaign.The report contains some of the most detail of Trump's financial empire that has been publicly reported. It was immediately picked up by Clinton's campaign, which has sought to make Trump's refusal to release his tax returns a major issue of the campaign.Calling it a ""bombshell report,"" the Clinton campaign said the Times' article ""reveals the colossal nature of Donald Trump's past business failures and just how long he may have avoided paying any federal income taxes whatsoever.""The Times' report shows Trump that year declared a $916 million loss and lists tax benefits he used after a turbulent financial period for him in the early 1990s. The paper, citing tax experts, said Trump could have used his loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income for nearly two decades.The paper says it obtained the three pages of documents when they were mailed to a reporter last month. A postmark indicated the documents were mailed from New York City, and the return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower.The paper did not look at his federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax return as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns.CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity.Trump himself responded via Twitter on Sunday morning, saying: ""I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes.""""I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!"" he added.In its statement issued Saturday night, the Trump campaign said the GOP nominee has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in other taxes, including property and real estate taxes.""The only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that The New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,"" the statement said.The Trump campaign statement was notable because it did not directly deny the allegations in the Times report. It also noted that though Trump had paid some taxes, it did not specifically say he had paid income tax.A central issueTrump has maintained that his tax returns in recent years are under audit and that he has been advised by his lawyers that it would be unwise to release them while that process is going on. However, there is no legal reason why someone under audit cannot make their tax records public while they are running for office. Candidates for president have released their tax returns for decades.But by refusing to release his tax returns, Trump, who has broken every other rule of politics during his stunning outsider campaign, has been, in effect, betting that he can outlast the demands of opponents who want to make his tax history a pivotal issue in the end game of the campaign.The impact of the revelations in the Times story were difficult to gauge in their immediate aftermath. But they seem certain to keep the issue of Trump's tax returns and questions about his business prowess -- which are at the center of his public image and rationale for running for president -- at the center of the campaign over the next week. Trump has just endured a rough week after scientifically conducted polls and most analysts agreed that he lost the crucial first presidential debate to Clinton. Early polling after the debate also appears to indicate Clinton is getting a modest boost from her performance. The Republican nominee has also spent the week in a war of words with Venezuelan-born former beauty queen Alicia Machado, who was mentioned in the debate as a woman who had been the victim of unflattering rhetoric by Trump. The feud plays into Clinton campaign charges that Trump harbors prejudice against women and Hispanics -- two crucial demographics that could help decide November's election.The issue could be next scrutinized at the vice presidential debate on Tuesday, forcing Trump's running mate, Mike Pence -- who has released his tax returns -- on the defensive. Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, have also released their returns.Will voters care?The extent to which Trump's tax controversies will damage him could also take time to play out.But there is evidence that a majority of voters believe it is important that candidates for president release their tax records.In a Monmouth University poll last month for instance, 62% of those asked thought it was very important or somewhat important for candidates to show their tax records.Trump's decision not to release his tax returns is a complicated issue politically, and the controversy shows the complications of someone like Trump, with a vast business empire, running for president.On the one hand, conservatives have long viewed the Internal Revenue Service with disdain and it has long been a plank of the Republican Party's orthodoxy that taxes should be lowered across the board. The GOP also sought to make political capital out of claims that the Obama administration used the IRS to target the tax-exempted status of conservative grassroots and Tea Party groups. So it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Trump's core voters, who harbor deep suspicion of the federal government, would applaud his efforts to avoid some tax liability -- as long as he acted within the law.But Trump's appeal in Rust Belt swing states has been aimed directly at voters who feel they have been left behind by the uneven economic recovery -- and who see Wall Street figures with vast means as able to use legal maneuvers to escape the kind of tax burden that ordinary middle-class voters must bear.So far, Trump has been able to position himself as the scourge of high finance and the New York financial elite -- despite having moved in proximity to such circles for decades. Saturday's Times report is likely to make it more complicated for him to pull off that feat.It may also undermine Trump's self image as a consummate dealmaker and businessman. He repeatedly argues that he has created a ""great company"" worth billions of dollars and implicitly argued that expertise equips him to manage the US economy and renegotiate what he has styled as global trade deals that disadvantage the United States. Anything that contradicts that image could be politically damaging.And the story of those financial losses could be a humbling one for a candidate who has incessantly bragged about his wealth and referred to a $1 million loan he received from his father as ""small.""Trump and his campaign have sought to redraw the battle lines in their fight against the Clinton campaign by defining the race as one between an elitist insider and a change-making outsider.But the possibility that Trump may not have paid any income tax for 18 years will undermine Trump's message that Clinton abides by a different set of rules than most Americans by putting Trump at that very level.'That makes me smart'Saturday's developments come less than a week after Trump appeared to indicate that he had not paid federal income tax over an unspecified period during a debate with Clinton. The Democratic nominee accused the billionaire of refusing to release his returns because he wanted to hide how little tax he had paid.""That makes me smart,"" Trump replied, and also said that any tax money he had paid would have been wasted by the federal government.Later, however, in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Trump said that he hadn't made such a comment.""No, I didn't say that at all,"" Trump said in the spin room after the debate.""If they said I didn't, it doesn't matter. I will say this: I hate the way our government spends our taxes because they are wasting our money. They don't know what they are doing, they are running it so poorly.""Trump is also playing with fire in refusing to release his tax returns.In the last presidential campaign in 2012, for example, Republican Mitt Romney's resistance to releasing his tax returns was exploited by President Barack Obama's re-election campaign.Romney's eventual decision to release tax returns also hurt him when it emerged that because most of his income as a former venture capitalist came from carried income and capital gains, he paid an effective tax rate of only around 14%. Although he was compliant with the law, it was easy for the Obama campaign to portray him as out of touch with the struggles of everyday Americans who have to pay higher tax rates on lower levels of income.It would not be hard for the Clinton campaign -- under pressure from Trump's appeal in Rust Belt swing states left behind by globalization and a transforming economy -- to make a similar argument."

Pressed on whether anyone in Trump's camp should be criticizing others' marriages, Giuliani said: ""It isn't her marriage. It's the way she goes on the attack and tries to hurt victims of sexual predations."" ""I am saying, the problem with Hillary Clinton has nothing to do, as far as I'm concerned, with her marriage,"" Giuliani said.

The New York Times reported Saturday that Trump reported a loss of $916 million on his 1995 tax records -- which, tax experts said, would have allowed Trump to avoid paying income taxes for a period of 18 years.The paper did not look at his federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax return as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns.CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by the Times. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has not released his tax returns as is tradition among presidential candidates, claiming they're under IRS audit. There are no legal restrictions against releasing tax returns that are under audit. ""It shows what a genius he is. It shows he was able to preserve his enterprise and that he was able to build it,"" Giuliani said. He insisted Trump isn't to blame for failing to pay federal income taxes.""No. The law is responsible for it,"" Giuliani said. ""If you have a set of laws, you live by those laws. And the reality is, you are ignoring completely the fiduciary obligation he has to all the people around him to run his business at the lowest possible expense.""Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who has kept up a drumbeat of Trump attacks over his taxes, said Sunday, ""Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won't release his taxes because they'll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father.""""Despite losing a billion dollars, Trump wants to reward himself with more tax breaks on inherited wealth while stiffing middle-class families who earn their paychecks with hard work,"" Reid said.Is Trump a good businessman? Trump has placed his business record at the forefront of his list of qualifications for the presidency. Tapper pressed Giuliani on whether someone who lost $916 billion in one year could reasonably argue he's a good businessman. ""That doesn't sound brilliant,"" Tapper said. ""Well, yes it does, because he came back,"" Giuliani said. ""Because he came back, and he came all the way back. And isn't that the history of America? I mean, people like Steve Jobs were fired by Apple and came all the way back. Churchill was thrown out of office twice and came all the way back."" Another top Trump ally, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also called The New York Times' report positive for Trump because, he said, it shows his resiliency.""This is a guy who, when lots of businesses went out of business in the early 1990s, he fought and clawed back to build another fortune, to create tens of thousands of more jobs, and this is actually a very, very good story for Donald Trump,"" Christie said on ""Fox News Sunday.""Giuliani said Trump's personal financial disclosure form filed last year shows Trump made $680 million -- enough that Trump wouldn't have been able to carry over his 1995 losses through 18 years.""He hasn't released his tax returns. The only reason we know anything about this is because somebody released this to The New York Times,"" Tapper said.Giuliani again pointed to Trump's financial disclosure, ""which describes considerably more about his finances than the tax return.""Tapper said: ""He's the first major party nominee since 1976 to not release his tax returns. If you're proud of that, that's great, but I don't think you should be.""And Giuliani responded that the scrutiny and attention being paid to The New York Times report ""is a very clear indication of why someone might not want to release their tax returns.""""You take something that is perfectly legal, something he had no choice but to utilize ... and you try to make it into -- he did no wrongdoing. ... He did nothing wrong. The headline should have been, 'Donald Trump takes advantage of legal provisions in tax code,'"" Giuliani said. Christie said Trump's 1995 tax returns show ""what an absolute mess the federal tax code is.""""There's no one who's shown more genius in their way to maneuver around the tax code and to rightfully use the laws to do that, and he's already promised in his tax plan to change many of these special interest loopholes and get rid of them,"" Christie told Fox News.'Rather common'Giuliani, who did not dispute the authenticity of Trump's 1995 tax records and did not say how much Trump has paid in income taxes, said that ""this is rather common in large, gigantic American businesses.""""There aren't very many smart businessmen that don't take advantage of the legal tax laws that are there, and if they are, then they're not very good businessmen,"" Giuliani said. And, he said, ""in fact, 44%, 45% of America doesn't pay any income tax.""""Anybody that goes and has an accountant, H&R Block or just goes online, figures out all the deductions that are available to them. I mean, the reality is that most Americans take advantage of every deduction available to them,"" Giuliani said. Tapper said: ""Most Americans pay federal income taxes though, though, sir, and Donald Trump apparently does not."" ""And very large businesses very often take advantage of these kinds of losses,"" Giuliani said. Tapper then asked Giuliani whether he personally pays income taxes. Giuliani said: ""Well, that's between me and my accountant and the IRS. And the reality is, I pay my lawful tax and he pays his lawful tax."" Could Trump be sued?Giuliani argued that Trump could have faced legal trouble for paying more than necessary in taxes. ""If he didn't take advantage of those tax deductions of tax advantages that he had, he could be sued, because his obligation as a businessman is to make money for his enterprise and to save money for his enterprise. It would have been insane for him not to take advantage of it,"" he said. Tapper asked: ""Sued by who? Who would sue him for paying personal income taxes?""""Investors in his business, people who loan money to his business, banks that loan money to his business,"" Giuliani said. ""That's why the simplistic analysis of an extraordinarily complex code is very unfair,"" he said. Tapper responded: ""I think that there are a lot of very, very successful businessmen and women who pay federal income taxes and don't look for every single opportunity there is to avoid paying them."" ""There are not very many smart businessmen who don't take advantage of the legal tax laws that are there. And if they are, then they're not very good businessmen and no one wants to go into business with them -- and they don't have very good lawyers or accountants,"" Giuliani said.

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/02/politics/ip-forecast-trump-troubles/index.html	"It's all a part of CNN's ""Inside Politics"" forecast, where you get next week's headlines today.  Team Clinton takes a fresh look at Ohio         Perhaps Ohio will be a fight to the end after all.         For all the odd twists in Campaign 2016, the idea that Ohio might not be a big battleground state has been among the oddest. Donald Trump has had a small but steady lead there lately, and some members of Team Clinton have talked of focusing more resources elsewhere.         But Abby Phillip of The Washington Post reports the Clinton campaign believes the terrain shifted somewhat after the first debate, and is about to test its prospects in Ohio again. ""She's headed back there this week and Bill Clinton is going to do two days on the ground there [taking a bus] around in eastern Ohio,"" Phillip said.""The key here, especially for Hillary Clinton, will be working-class women in the suburbs. And some of those women are going to be paying close attention to what's been going on with Donald Trump these last few days, especially with some of his meltdowns around Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, and other things."" The campaign may get more personal             Hillary Clinton has consistently declined to get into a back and forth with Donald Trump about his threats to raise Bill Clinton's personal character flaws as a campaign issue.          Instead, she says he can pick what he wants to talk about, and she will focus on her ideas.         But a leading pro-Clinton super PAC is preparing to raise Trump's personal history if he takes the campaign in a more personal direction.         Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast shared her reporting on the conversations among Clinton's super PAC allies:          ""One of [the super PACs] has told me they are ready for anything. They aren't tipping their hands yet, but I would look to them to do her dirty work should Donald Trump decide to go after her when it comes to that issue.""Team Trump tries to find focus         It goes without saying that the week ahead is big one for Trump and his campaign.         The polls have shifted Clinton's way, there are new questions about Trump's taxes, and he went off-prompter again Saturday to disparage Clinton, suggesting among other thing that she might ""actually be crazy.""         At the Trump Tower, there are complaints about media coverage but also a promise to be more prepared for the second debate next Sunday.         Keeping that promise will test the candidate and his operation.         Trump, for example, was described by two campaign insiders as more than a little annoyed after his campaign manager said on national TV that she had reprimanded him for his comments about a former Miss Universe who says the businessman once called her ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping.""         Plus there's been some internal finger-pointing over who shares the most blame for Trump's preparations for the first debate and over who on the inside leaked to the media about Trump's reluctance to engage in traditional prep work.         After a slew of negative press last week, there is a ""crackdown on anyone saying anything negative about his last performance,"" a senior Trump campaign aide told CNN.            There is plenty of time left for momentum swings, but some Trump allies enter this big week with two worries: They describe the candidate as angry and frustrated, and they say his organization is complicated by dysfunctional relationships.  North Carolina's Senate race has GOP nervous         As Republicans fight to keep their Senate majority, there are increasing worries about the GOP incumbent in North Carolina, Sen. Richard Burr.         It is a race Republicans had hoped to move to the safe column by now, but CNN's Manu Raju tells us that GOP strategists are nervous about Burr's performance and the potential that the presidential race could impact the Senate results.          ""North Carolina has become a major presidential battleground and it is now becoming central to the fight for the Senate majority. Senator Richard Burr, the Republican incumbent, now is in a really tough fight against a little-known Democrat named Deborah Ross,"" Raju said. ""Republicans, when you talk to them around town, they are very worried that this seat could slip if a lot more money doesn't start to go into this state. Donald Trump, for one, is not spending nearly as much as Hillary Clinton. That's helping the Democrats at large. And watch for Republicans to really go after Deborah Ross' record as an ACLU attorney.""A bloody sock as campaign logo?         Curt Schilling is forever enshrined in Boston Red Sox lore for his gritty performance in Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, pitching through an ankle injury in what became known as the ""bloody sock"" game.         His political views often get him into controversy, though, and there is talk he wants a bigger platform to air them.         Matt Viser of The Boston Globe reports that Schilling is again considering a run for the US Senate against liberal Massachusetts icon Sen. Elizabeth Warren.        ""There are a lot of reasons to be skeptical about this. Curt Schilling has talked in the past about running and he didn't. He's made some controversial statements that got him fired at ESPN. And (in) recent polls -- he's serious enough he's included in polls -- he's down 19% to Elizabeth Warren,"" Viser said.""Curt Schilling is a very Trump-like candidate in Massachusetts and would help us combine politics and sports, the two loves of the state."""
