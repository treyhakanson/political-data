Even if it's 500 bucks or 15 hours on a bus,"" Emerald said.Protests have spread across the country after Trump was elected, with large crowds rallying in cities like New York City, San Francisco and Seattle the past two nights.Garry Sitarski said outside the White House that he was afraid of a Trump presidency. He was protesting in New York on Wednesday and he came to protest in front of the White House in time for Trump's visit.Some of those present voiced support for Trump, including Zack Parente, 31, and Cletus Pippin, 29.""Hillary's idea was continuing the eight years of Obama."" said Parente.The importance of change was what moved Pippin to vote for Trump, his first ballot cast in a presidential election, though he said he didn't agree with everything the president-elect said and hopes ""he simmers down a little bit."" He doesn't think Trump is serious about building a wall that Mexicans will pay for. ""I think we're going to end up paying for it,"" he said.Pippin's mother, Brenda, was with him and said she was annoyed at the surrounding protesters, who she said must accept the outcome.""You know, take it day by day, accept he is president, and stand behind him,"" she said, adding that she was not offended by Trump's infamous comments surfaced on the ""Access Hollywood"" tape last month.Some protesters, however, cited the tape as to why they were there Thursday.Deborah Klaus, a 48-year-old nurse from Arlington, Virginia, was telling her fellow protesters that she's concerned for her daughter. ""I can't let her think it's OK. It's not healthy,"" said Klaus, referring to the sexual assault claims against Trump.As Trump's motorcade left the White House, guards pushed protesters away, who chanted, ""Love trumps hate,"" a common slogan among Clinton supporters."

That means Ryan could lose 20 votes on the floor and still be elected speaker -- a large number of defections that GOP sources said is highly unlikely.But that's not all that's helping Ryan. The House Freedom Caucus, the outside group of agitators who helped drive out John Boehner from the speakership, seems reluctant to mount a challenge against the speaker, with some members saying they want to focus on helping Trump instead. Plus Ryan -- who angered Trump supporters in his conference when he said last month he couldn't defend his party's nominee -- seems to have calmed down Trump backers by his late embrace of the billionaire in the final days of the campaign. He enthusiastically welcomed the President-elect to his office Thursday and held a photo op with cameras capturing him pointing out Washington landmarks from his majestic balcony outside his Capitol office overlooking the National Mall. The speaker's office also had a camera there and posted video on Ryan's Facebook page highlighting the first meeting of the two leaders since the election.RELATED: Trump, Ryan meet for first time since historic winBut what has calmed down conservatives the most? Winning the election on all levels of government. And Ryan allies say the speaker deserves praise for the GOP success down-ticket given his relentless fundraising and campaigning for House candidates.House Republicans will vote Tuesday in a secret ballot election on whether Ryan will get a second term as speaker.Ryan, in his first interview since Trump's election, said Thursday on Fox News, that he is confident that he won't be challenged -- and heaped praise on the President-elect.He called the businessman's win ""one of the most impressive political feats I have seen in my lifetime. It's an amazing thing. And so Donald Trump deserves all that credit.""In an election season filled with stunning developments, this is another unusual moment. The House speaker, who had been critical over his party's nominee and often went to lengths to avoid discussing him, now is in a more secure spot in his conference because of Trump's election.Ryan only lost 10 votes on the floor of the House when he was first elected speaker last year. One of those votes was Rep. Dave Brat of Virginia, who said whether there will be a challenge to the speaker depends on what happens in the post-election, lame-duck session of Congress. Yet he offered cautious praise for the speaker.RELATED: Team Trump is already filled with Washington insiders""If the lame-duck gets even more lame beyond a $600 billion deficit with something like the Export-Import Bank -- or any more barn cleaning -- then our blood pressure goes up,"" Brat, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN Friday. ""Speaker Ryan made very promising comments that Trump saw and heard things from the American people that we have all missed. So it's incumbent on him to name exactly what that is.""Throughout the campaign season, Ryan struggled with Trump as the nominee. He sharply criticized Trump's plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, and said he would speak out against Trump when he believed conservatism was being ""disfigured.""He initially declined to endorse Trump in the spring. But even after he did formally back Trump, Ryan lashed the GOP nominee for making ""racist"" comments about a Mexican-American judge. And things blew up after Ryan privately told his colleagues he could no longer defend Trump after the release of the now-infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape in October where the billionaire is caught talking lewdly and sexually aggressively about groping women. For weeks, Ryan said little about Trump, declining to say anything publicly about him after the final two presidential debate.That approach changed during the last push in the campaign season. Ryan began preaching GOP unity, appeared on stage with Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, and he even offered to campaign with Trump in Wisconsin -- despite saying privately a month before he wouldn't do so.RELATED: Congressional leaders say TPP is deadBeyond the Freedom Caucus members who have sparred with Ryan in the past, the other group of members who could complicate his future are the group of House Republicans who rallied around Trump. But multiple members in that camp tell CNN that Ryan's post-election news conference and public comments Thursday have made it clear he's on the same page with Trump now. They believe the President-elect will need the Wisconsin Republican's expertise to pass key agenda items.One of these members told CNN that Ryan was ""giddy"" on a post-election conference call with House Republicans, laying out the list of conservative bills he could now pass because a Republican won the White House and the party is keeping control of both chambers of Congress.New York GOP Rep. Chris Collins, the first member of Congress to endorse Trump, said on CNN that Ryan's re-election next week was a ""slam dunk."" He said he spoke to both Trump and Ryan and offered to act as a liaison on Capitol Hill to help get key legislation passed.The culmination of the Ryan-Trump relationship came Thursday, as the two toured the speaker's office and had what both sides had a productive meeting. And aides went to lengths to downplay their past disputes. Even the speaker, sitting next to the President-elect at his conference table, pulled a phrase from Trump's stump speech to tout their new partnership.""We're going to hit the ground running to make sure that we can get this country turned around and make America great again,"" Ryan told reporters."

""I told Donald Trump I wanted to help him, because I thought that this country needed his leadership. That being said, if the President asks you to serve, you step up to fulfill that duty. So if he feels that I can help him and he calls on me, sure I'll accept it, but I'm not expecting anything.""Clarke was a surrogate for Trump during the presidential campaign and is known for his tough on crime positions and unapologetically blunt comments. Clarke, who is African American, also made news during the campaign for his opposition to Black Lives Matter activists, whom he predicted would join forces with ISIS.BuzzFeed and Politico reported that Clarke is under consideration to become the next secretary of Homeland Security.Also in the interview, Clarke criticized activists who are protesting the election results, calling them anarchists who don't support the rule of law, though Clarke himself made news last month when he told supporters it was ""pitchfork and torches time"" in a tweet.""When Barack Obama won in '08 and when Barack Obama won in 2012, I was disappointed, as were a lot of people.

I hope my colleagues who never really anticipated that they would succeed.""""And I know many of them are privately deeply ashamed of what they've been pushed into doing by their leadership, by the Koch brothers and their associates who really went in and said we want you to do something unprecedented in US History: Take a Supreme Court seat under our constitution, assigned to one president, and move it to another,"" he added.  But despite the recent presidential election, things do not have to end for Garland, he said.

In response to Trump's victory, tens of thousands of Americans protested in at least 25 US cities to mourn the election results. Moore joined protesters in New York who were demonstrating outside the Trump Tower. ""Literally thousands of people coming down the street and I just joined them,"" Moore said. ""There's a lot of fear and a lot of panic amongst a lot of people right now.""Lemon reminded Moore of his past remarks predicting Trump's potential success in rust belt states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Moore said he took no pleasure on accurately predicting Hillary Clinton's challenges with states like his home state of Michigan.

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/hillary-clinton-loss/index.html	"They're pointing fingers at FBI Director James Comey, unfair media coverage and voters resistant to electing the first woman president.But many Democrats believe the list should begin with this: Clinton and her campaign.As a new political order falls over Washington, advisers close to Clinton are trying to get ahead of a bitter round of finger-pointing inside a newly-decimated Democratic Party. In a conference call with top donors Friday, campaign chairman John Podesta said a ""hostile press corps"" contributed to Clinton's defeat. Other top advisers said Comey's decision to take another look at Clinton's emails stopped the campaign's momentum and motivated Trump voters. That bombshell contributed to a significant fall-off among college educated voters ""who fizzled at the end,"" an adviser said. Those voters, always wavering about Clinton, were simply turned off at the end. Democrats try to pick up the piecesThe call on Friday, which was described to CNN by several participants, did not specifically address one of the biggest questions many Democrats have: How did Clinton allow Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to fall away from the party?Clinton is expected to hold a conference call of her own later Friday with donors and other supporters, CNN has learned, to offer her first explanation of the crushing defeat.The campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement Friday that ""no one anticipated"" losing. She said many factors were at work, but she listed Comey as chief among them.""We didn't blame everyone but ourselves,"" Palmieri said. ""We acknowledged a lot of challenges we faced, plenty of mistakes made along the way, some challenges we weren't able to overcome.""She added: ""What changed in the last week that made his turn out go up and our's go down?  The only thing apparent was Comey. It was one thing too many. Could not overcome it.""Democrats close to Bill Clinton said Thursday that one mistake Clinton's top aides made was not listening to the former president more when he urged the campaign to spend more time focusing on disaffected white, working class voters.Many in Clinton's campaign viewed these voters as Trump's base, people so committed to the Republican nominee that no amount of visits or messaging could sway them. Clinton made no visits to Wisconsin as the Democratic nominee, and only pushed a late charge in Michigan once internal polling showed the race tightening.Bill Clinton, advisers said, pushed the campaign early on to focus on these voters, many of whom helped elected him twice to the White House. The former president, a Clinton aide said, would regularly call Robby Mook to talk about strategy and offer advice.But aides said the Clinton campaign's top strategists largely ignored the former president, instead focusing on consolidating the base of voters that helped elect President Barack Obama to the White House. In the closing days of the campaign, Clinton targeted young people, Hispanics and African-Americans with laser like focus, casting Trump as a racist who only sought the presidency to benefit himself.Sanders pushes Keith Ellison for DNC chair as Howard Dean plans runAs Tuesday night's results rolled in, those voters seemingly didn't do enough to propel Clinton past the wall of white, working class people who backed Trump. Clinton's internal polling was also off. Days before the election, Clinton's internal polling showed Clinton up by four points in Michigan, according to an aide.""It's is nothing short of malpractice that her campaign didn't look at the electoral college and put substantial resources in states like Michigan and Wisconsin,"" Democratic pollster Paul Maslin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.Neither Clinton nor Obama visited Wisconsin once during the general election campaign. The state voted Republican for the first time in a presidential race since 1984.Wisconsin is emerging as one case study for where the Clinton campaign fell short. She won voters under 30 by just 4 points, according to exit polls, while Obama won them by 23 points four years ago. An aide said Friday that the campaign's top staffers understood they couldn't ""recreate the Obama coalition"" exactly, but deeply felt that ""college educated whites would be part of a new coalition for her.""""In the end, that did not materialize in big enough numbers in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania,"" the aide said.Another aide pointed to Pennsylvania -- a state Clinton visited 11 times after the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia -- as proof that more visits would not have helped.Asked if there was anything they could have done in states like Michigan and Wisconsin to beat Trump, a top aide offered: ""Not had Comey send his letter."""

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/trump-victory-lgbt-concerns/index.html	"Would the President-elect make good on his pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which protects transgender people from discrimination in accessing health care? Will he appoint conservative judges to the US Supreme Court who could roll back marriage equality and other civil rights? Will Pence's long-ago support for so-called ""conversion therapy"" translate to a directive for LGBT youth?Questions such as these flooded the offices of LGBT advocacy groups nationwide following Trump's victory early Wednesday. Despite being regarded by some as one of the most ""pro-LGBT"" Republican presidential nominees ever, who expressed sympathy for the LGBT community after the Orlando nightclub shooting, critics say his conservative advisers -- Pence included -- and the Republican party's anti-LGBT platform are a threat to the progress made during the Obama administration's  legacy.""We're hearing from really, really scared people,"" said Rachel Tiven, CEO of Lambda Legal, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization. ""We're seeing a fear of an atmosphere of intolerance that began with Trump's campaign.""Spokespeople for Trump and Pence did not return requests for comment.The Human Rights Campaign, which supported Hillary Clinton, held a Facebook Live broadcast on Thursday to address some of the concerns. Here's what their experts and others from national LGBT groups had to say.Is this the end of same-sex marriage?Many same-sex couples worry that their marriages could be invalidated in Trump's America, or that if things are getting serious they better hurry up and make it official before their right to tie the knot disappears.Neither the President nor Congress can take away what the Supreme Court has deemed a ""fundamental right,"" leaving current marriages safe, multiple legal experts said.  While Trump does not have the right to unilaterally scrap marriage equality, he has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices who could. So far, judicial conservatives are said to be very pleased with his potential nominees. But it would take a long time for the court to repeal marriage equality -- if they decide to, Tiven said. Regardless of who replaces Justice Antonin Scalia, the five Supreme Court justices who ushered in marriage equality will remain. The jurists that replace them could be the ones that bring change.By then, though, advocates are optimistic that society will have adjusted to the idea and let it be. ""People's hearts and minds have changed,"" HRC legal director Sarah Warbelow said. ""We've had rights rolled back but it is rare.""What about same-sex adoption?Gay and lesbian parents are worried that their parental rights could be in jeopardy, especially for the non-biological parent. Even if that person's name is on the child's birth certificate, experts say it's best to adopt the child.Also called a second parent adoption, it's a court order that says as a legal matter the adult is a parent, said Jennifer C. Pizer, senior counsel and law and policy director of Lambda Legal. Though the states set adoption and parental rights policies, adoption ensures both parents have a legal tie, which could help in challenges to parental rights at the federal level. ""Court judgments are recognized from state to state as a constitutional rule so even if federal law changes you're a parent of the child,"" she said.  Does this mean more 'bathroom bills'?North Carolina's controversial HB 2 got most of the attention, but 2016 brought similar proposals to regulate bathroom access for transgender people across the country. Advocacy groups fully expected the ball to keep rolling regardless of who captured the presidency. ""It was clear in 2016 that we saw an upswing in anti-trans legislation, more than we'd ever seen before,"" said Transgender Law Center Executive Director Kris Hayashi. ""We anticipated that was not going to lessen but increase in 2017.""In response, advocacy groups have been training across the country for more legislative battles, he said.""What is needed in this moment is for transgender leaders to continue the work we've been doing advocating and organizing for our rights.""What about transgender students?The Obama administration's recommendation to schools to treat transgender students in accordance with their gender identity drew cheers from advocacy groups and criticism from conservatives, including Pence. Trump said transgender people should be protected under the law but rejected the use of federal law to do so, saying it should be left to the states. Even if Trump rescinds the Obama administration's guidance, the laws upon which it was based won't change, said David Stacy, Government Affairs Director of HRC. The directive is largely based on Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, which forbids discrimination based on gender. In recent years, trial court and court of appeals decisions have interpreted Title IX to cover sexual orientation and gender identity, too, extending its protections to the LGBT population.""Schools have an obligation to follow the law whether the guidance is repealed or not,"" he said. ""When it comes to recognizing a name change, or the use of bathroom facilities, under federal law schools have a legal and moral obligation to treat all students with dignity and respect.""Will I lose my Obamacare?Repealing the Affordable Care Act was a benchmark of Trump's campaign. Of the 20 million Americans covered, about 5% are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, Stacy said.The Affordable Care Act has a non-discrimination provision that includes gender identity and sexual orientation. It was especially meaningful for transgender people, who often face discrimination when they try to access gender-affirming health care. Taking away Obamacare would mean removing those protections, Stacy said. But it remains to be seen how Trump would actually do this, leaving groups in a holding pattern for how to respond.Is conversion therapy going to be legitimized?As far as we can tell, at no point in the presidential campaign did Vice President-elect Pence talk about supporting conversion therapy, a widely discredited practice that claims to undo homosexuality.But in his run for Congress in 2000, his campaign website said he endorsed using federal funds to support ""those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.""The position has been widely interpreted as signaling Pence's support for conversion therapy, according to Snopes.com. It got a new life during his run for executive office, leading to panicked calls from LGBT youth who are ""terrified"" that they'll be forced into conversion therapy, said Pizer of Lambda Legal.Because the practice has been widely rejected by mental health professionals and outlawed in some states, it's hard to imagine that it could ever gain credibility or become law, Pizer said -- even with the support of an elected official.""It's up to parents to make lots of decisions for their kids, but mental health professionals know that this type of effort to change who people are is not effective,"" she said. Will I still be able to serve in the military?Though anything could happen, it's ""exceedingly unlikely"" that Pence's opposition to the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" will reverse the decision to let gays and lesbians serve openly in the military, said Warbelow of the HRC. Transgender service began this year, too, signed off on by the chairs of each military branch, she said.""Regulations are not easy to undo,"" she said. ""The military leadership of our country feels good about it and all of those people have skills and expertise that our military needs.""Should challenges arise, she reminded people that there will be a notice and comment period for people to raise their voices.""If you think something is going to affect your future you need to reach out. Even if it's a Republican [lawmaker] they need to hear from constituents."""	What a Trump presidency could mean for LGBT Americans

Since it published, she told Costello, she has received a torrent of abuse on social media. It's a symptom, Nomani insisted, of an increasingly hostile ""liberal honor brigade.""""You know, I felt like this entire election year, we have just silenced so many people,"" Nomani said. ""Even now the idea of speaking out as somebody who voted for Trump is earning me all sorts of lovely labels like 'idiot' and 'f***er' and all these other ideas that I think violate liberal values of free speech and self-determination. So I spoke out because I also believe we have to stand up for the dignity of all people and Trump voters are human beings, too,"" she insisted.At the forefront of her reasons for voting Trump, Nomani said, was her fear of what she dubbed the ""very real and serious threat by extremist Muslims.""""This is a reality that we haven't confronted directly for the sake of political correctness,"" Nomani explained.""If people would hear out the concerns and fears that others have about the issues to refugees and extremists, I think we could find a path that's in the middle. But unfortunately, what happens is that this liberal honor brigade shuts down all conversation, calls you bigot or racist or Islamophobe if you dare to speak your own concerns,"" she added.Asked by Costello what she thought about the fact that Trump's talk of a Muslim ban had made many Muslim-Americans afraid, Nomani replied that the country needed a ""middle path"" in order for true dialogue to take place.""He's indelicate. We got that. But he expresses a truth that people speak,"" Nomani said.""I believe that the left must move to the middle, the right must move to the middle. Then we are going to come up with actually healthy solutions that protect national security as well as human rights"" she added."	"Muslim woman: I'm one of Trump's ""silent voters"""
