Only 4% of Missouri voters say the latest investigation led them to change their mind about the candidate of their choice. The vast majority -- 87% -- say the recent inquiry will have no impact on their vote.The Monmouth University poll included 405 voters likely to vote. It was conducted by telephone from October 28 to 31 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9%. "	Blunt, Kander neck and neck in Missouri Senate race

""But as (former Attorney General) Eric Holder wrote in The Washington Post over the weekend in response to Comey's actions, people make mistakes. And I think (Comey) made a series of terrible mistakes here.""The full interview is set to publish on November 10.Comey set off a political firestorm after he sent a letter to lawmakers Friday that said the FBI is reviewing new emails potentially related to its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state.Ex-AGs Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder, Michael Mukasey rip FBI directorHe said that Comey handled the situation with the emails in the wrong manner, which has led people to start questioning the ""integrity"" of the FBI.""Back in July, when he stood up and said, 'We're not recommending prosecution,' but proceeded to prosecute her publicly, and then went to the Hill a number of occasions and answered a number of questions about this, he went outside the norm,"" Morell told Axelrod. ""And I think he did it with the intent of protecting his organization and trying to keep his organization out of politics but the effect has been just the opposite. And now people are now questioning his integrity, they're questioning the integrity of the FBI, they're questioning whether this is an independent organization,"" he said. ""I feel sorry for him but he made the wrong decisions here.""FBI investigations into Trump-Russia ties yield littleComey has faced criticism not only from Morell and Holder, but Republican former US Attorney Generals Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey, who slammed the way Comey acted, especially with the presidential election looming just days away.""I've been in situations where you have to make a decision to do your job and that decision has political consequences,"" Morell said. ""And what I've learned is that the best approach is to do it the way you always do it. Whatever the issue is, do it the way you always do it and let the chips fall and always fall back on, look I just did my job, politics in mind, and we did this the normal way. We didn't do anything differently.""Morell left the CIA in 2013 to join Beacon Global Strategies, which is a consulting firm founded by longtime Clinton State Department aide Philippe Reines.

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/paul-ryan-trump-name/index.html	"But when House Speaker Paul Ryan took the stage minutes later, he left one ""T"" out: Trump. As he campaigned for Hollingsworth, Ryan continued the awkward balancing act that he has performed across the country for the past several weeks: Make a pitch for Republicans to keep both chambers of Congress and attack Hillary Clinton -- but not mention Trump by name.  Paul Ryan: 'Republicans need to come home'""Republicans need to come home,"" Ryan told voters in Sellersburg, Indiana. ""Republicans need to go vote. Republicans need to make sure we get our country back on the right track."" And he added: ""We are going to win everything including the White House.""Tuesday morning, Ryan took the matter one step further, announcing in his first nationally televised interview in weeks that he voted early in his home state of Wisconsin for ""our nominee,"" avoiding again mentioning the name ""Trump."" ""I am supporting our entire Republican ticket -- I have been all along,"" Ryan said on Fox News Channel. ""My focus personally right now is saving our House majority."" Ryan has been left in this difficult position in the aftermath of the ""Access Hollywood"" video where Trump was caught on a hot mic talking in vulgar terms about women. After those comments leaked, Ryan told House GOP members on a private conference call last month that he could no longer defend Trump or campaign with him -- prompting anger on the right. Hillary Clinton's challenge: Shift focus back to TrumpSince then, Ryan has kept an unusually low profile, hoping to stay out of the fray as he works under the radar for House candidates. But his position has angered ardent Trump supporters, who are eager to pin the blame for a potential loss on Republicans like Ryan and are searching for ways to undermine his bid to win reelection as House speaker next year -- assuming the GOP keeps its majority.Building goodwill amongst RepublicansIt remains to be seen whether his latest gambit -- stepping up his criticism of Clinton and announcing his vote for Trump -- is enough to assuage his conservative critics, some of whom want to remove him from the speakership next year.  Rep. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma, a conservative who voted for Ryan's speaker bid last year, won't commit to voting for him next year in large part because of his move to distance himself from Trump. He urged the speaker to do more for the GOP nominee this week. ""In the face of the prospect of Hillary Clinton becoming president, every Republican should be working hard to elect Donald Trump,"" Bridenstine told CNN Tuesday. ""I'm glad to know Paul Ryan will vote for Mr. Trump. Now he should get out and campaign for him to win Wisconsin."" Ryan officials declined to comment to CNN on his handling of Trump.  But they point to his aggressive work on the campaign trail for House candidates, hitting nearly 25 states and more than 50 cities in October and November, including helping the National Republican Congressional Committee secure more than a $40 million windfall. A Ryan aide said that the speaker helped raise an additional $2.5 million as a special guest at member and candidate fundraising events last month. Such moves are bound to build goodwill among House Republicans, especially if they hang onto their majority. But he still has the specter of Trump looming over him. On Tuesday, Ryan indicated that he wouldn't be campaigning with Trump, saying of his approach: ""I haven't changed anything. He even acknowledged that he had only just learned that Trump planned to campaign in his state with Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday as well.""I just heard about it 10 minutes ago, actually,"" Ryan said on Fox News when asked about the rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. ""I didn't know that.""Some Ryan allies in the House GOP conference privately say the speaker has badly miscalculated in his handling of Trump, first by declining to initially endorse him when he became the presumptive presidential nominee in May and later by telling his colleagues on last month's call that he could no longer campaign with or defend Trump. ""That opening comment startled the Trump people and gives them an excuse to criticize Ryan,"" said one Republican House member on the call. The comments sparked the ire of the far-right of the GOP and even Trump himself, who accused the House speaker of trying to sabotage the Republican nominee and potentially help his own future presidential ambitions. Some threatened to undermine his bid to win the speakership by voting against him and denying him the 218 votes to retain the gavel. Conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus have already warned they are evaluating how the speaker handles year-end spending bill talks. The roughly 40 members of this group are the most vocal critics of the speaker, but they are split about whether to try and back someone else for the job.  The group has a history of criticizing its own leaders, but an unwillingness to field any candidates to replace those in top posts.Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a member of the Freedom Caucus who began the effort to oust former Speaker John Boehner last summer, said extra space on CNN on Monday, ""So at this point, I know of no one running against the speaker. And so it could very well be that he is running unopposed in January.""  While Ryan does not have a challenger yet to take him on, some Republicans could make his life difficult if they withhold their support to deny him a simple majority of support on the House floor in January, causing embarrassment for the speaker. Hopes to move away from Trump talkBut Ryan has sought to pivot away from his flap over Trump in recent weeks, something that could alleviate tensions in the conference. He privately expressed regret about the episode to donors, saying he didn't intend to pick a fight with Trump. Since then, he has avoided the Trump topic, stumping for candidates in events where reporters aren't allowed to ask questions and only sitting down for a handful of interviews with local reporters and friendly radio hosts. But he has sought to tamp down any disagreements with Trump when he's been asked about the GOP nominee a handful of times in the past month. In an interview this week for KETV in Omaha, Ryan responded to a reporter's question about whether he could work with Trump. ""We have common cause on the big foundational issues of the day,"" Ryan said of him and Trump.And in the meantime, he has ratcheted up his attacks on the Clintons, trying to focus on a common GOP enemy. When it was revealed Friday that the FBI was looking into additional Clinton emails, Ryan was one of the first GOP members lashing the Democratic candidate, saying she should be denied classified briefings. Stumping Saturday for House candidates in Nevada, Ryan said that the Clintons play by a ""different set of rules.""  Poll: Blunt, Kander neck and neck in Missouri Senate race""Do we want four years of this?"" he said.Throwing red meat to the conservative crowd in Indiana, Ryan made the implicit case for Trump, even if he didn't say his name.""There's always a scandal, then there's another scandal, and then there's an investigation,"" Ryan said of the Clintons. ""You never know what's coming next. It takes the country through these awful ugly moments."""	Paul Ryan avoids talking Trump as he stumps for a GOP White House

He's called on the Ohio National Guard's elite cyberprotection unit to help secure the election. The National Guard takes orders from the state's governor. The Ohio National Guard cyber unit's election mission consists of specialized teams running penetration tests on the state's computer networks.That means the team is trying to hack the state's network to find vulnerabilities hackers might exploit. The team is also searching the state's election system for malicious activity, like a detective casing a scene to find evidence of a crime.So far, 46 states are now seeking protection from the Department of Homeland Security to fend off cyberattacks against their election systems.But what's happening in Ohio is taking it one step further, deploying a military unit confront the threat.   ""We want to be tested,"" Husted said.  Hacking voting machines in the nation's 9,000 jurisdictions would be a tough task since they're not connected to each other or the Internet.There are also security measures in place. Voting machines are sealed with tamper-proof seals. If the seal is broken or replaced, election officials would immediately know. The serial number on the seal is recorded, and if the seal is broken, that would be visible.However, voter registration databases with names, numbers, emails and addresses are vulnerable. There were breaches in some states, including Arizona and Illinois. More than 20 states have experienced attempted hacks on election systems.Hackers could use voter contact info in those databases to send out erroneous voting locations.They could also wipe the database clean, making names disappear from voter logs, sparking confusion and long lines.In Ohio, Husted said officials have a contingency plan ""that includes additional paper ballots at the polls as well as a paper backup of the voter registration lists.""The National Guard cyber team in Maryland is on standby to assist its state if the governor calls.Major Gen. Linda Singh runs the operation there. She said not many people realize the mission of National Guard Unit's in various states is expanding. ""These are the people responding to the floods, the hurricanes, but they're not necessarily thinking that we are out fighting the technology war.""Maryland's cyber unit is one of the first in the nation.For National Guard Units in both Ohio and Maryland, the goal is the same, identify and stop cyber intruders.These cyber protection units are not in every state yet. The National Guard Bureau tells CNN there are currently 23 units, and by 2019, the plan is to have cyberprotection teams in 34 states.With the election just days away, Husted said ""voters should feel comfortable and confident with the system.""'We have put safeguards in place,"" Husted added. ""It doesn't mean a cyberattack couldn't occur, which would be an inconvenience, but it's not going to change any outcome of an election."""

McMullin grew up with both a father and a mother, but his parents have since divorced and his mother is now in a lesbian relationship.Johnson also alleges -- without evidence -- that McMullin is gay because he is currently single.""Don't vote for Evan McMullin. Vote for Donald Trump. He will respect all women and be a president we can all be proud of,"" the call concludes.The Trump campaign quickly rebuked Johnson.""We strongly condemn this rhetoric and these activities of which we have no knowledge,"" Trump spokesman Hope Hicks said Monday.The campaign distanced itself far more quickly than it has some other white nationalists in the past, including when Trump repeatedly demurred to CNN's Jake Tapper about David Duke's support, before finally condemning him. In an interview with Tapper on ""The Lead"" Tuesday, McMullin said he wasn't surprised by the robocall, saying it ""is exactly the narrative and the approach the Donald Trump campaign has had.""""Trump supporters have attacked me because of my faith, they've attacked my service, we've even received some death threats from these white supremacists, even recently, overnight,"" McMullin continued. ""They've attacked my family, but, you know, they've attacked so many other Americans, too. Donald Trump himself has bragged about sexually assaulting women and attacked people for the color of their skin and their faith. I mean, this is the Republican nominee and none of this should surprise any of us.""White supremacists have found unusual comfort in Trump, who has stoked nationalist sentiment among supporters and launched some racially based attacks during the campaign, from proposing a ban on Muslim immigration and accusing Mexican immigrants of being criminals and ""rapists.""The call has barely any money behind it -- just $2,000, Johnson said, and will go to 193,000 homes between Monday and Wednesday evening. But it is a reflection of the growing threat posed by McMullin, who has lead Trump in some polls in the ruby-red state.UPDATE: This story has been updated to include McMullin's response."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-campaign/index.html	"Over the past 18 months, the Democratic nominee has built an impressive campaign infrastructure that has dwarfed her GOP opponent, Donald Trump, on fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts. The sudden revival of Clinton's private email server as a top campaign issue is emerging as the ultimate test of whether all that work will pay off next week and whether her core message -- that she is the only candidate fit to be president -- will resonate. Clinton campaign accuses FBI of 'blatant double standard'FBI Director James Comey blindsided the Clinton campaign Friday by telling lawmakers newly discovered emails could be pertinent to the probe into the private server. The Clinton campaign and her surrogates are furious that the announcement came so close to the election while Trump and his allies are celebrating the fresh ammunition after spending weeks on defense.Campaigning in Kent, Ohio, on Monday, Clinton brushed away the investigation, saying voters have already made up their minds on the email issue.""I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all this,"" Clinton said. ""Now, what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commander and chief of the United States of America.""If the Trump campaign has run a thoroughly unconventional campaign, with little care for the traditional rules of politics and relatively bare-bones infrastructure, the Clinton operation has devoted much of its time and resources to building out a robust ground game across battleground states.In the final weeks, Clinton has particularly touted her campaign's Get Out the Vote and early voting campaigns, enlisting help from high-profile celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Katy Perry and Jay-Z. The campaign is hopeful that these efforts will be crucial to driving up turnout on and before Election Day.What's next: FBI unlikely to conclude Clinton email review prior to electionClinton aides cite early voting statistics as proof that while the FBI news has drawn heavy scrutiny in recent days, it has not moved the core of her supportEarly voting data show that over 3.5 million people have already voted in Florida -- making up nearly one quarter of all registered voters in the state -- with Democrats outpacing 2012 vote-by-mail numbers. Similarly in Nevada, where nearly one-fourth of registered voters have already cast their ballot, Democrats are outpacing Republicans by nearly 30,000. And Clinton aides say the core of their base, especially Hispanic voters, have already turned out to vote in high numbers, citing trends in Colorado, Nevada and Florida. Some top advisers believe states with robust early voting and absentee balloting, like Nevada, could essentially be decided before Election Day.Worry in swing statesStill, the campaign is on the lookout for any signs of damage from Comey's announcement. In some swing states, aides acknowledge that the FBI's renewed probe appears to have created some volatility with voters.There is anecdotal evidence, for example, of Clinton volunteers fielding questions about the FBI's investigation while door knocking over the weekend. On the flip side, the campaign has also seen evidence of Democrats who are now more eager to vote for Clinton as a way to rebuke the FBI.Since Friday, Clinton and her aides have been adamant: Comey's action is unprecedented this close to an election, and there is nothing to new to be discovered.On Saturday in Florida, Clinton called his announcement ""pretty strange.""""In fact, it is not just strange, it is unprecedented and it is deeply troubling,"" she said at a Daytona Beach rally.And on Monday, Clinton said at two Ohio rallies that while she regrets using a private server, the FBI simply has ""no case.""Her aides are also continuing to pressure Comey. Top campaign officials held a press call on Monday in the wake of reports that the FBI director chose not to publicly comment on the Trump campaign's potential ties to alleged efforts by Russia to meddle with the U.S. election. Campaign manager Robby Mook called the revelation a ""blatant double standard.""The campaign is getting a boost from former attorney generals as well, including General Alberto Gonzales, who said Comey exercised an ""error in judgment."" Trump, meanwhile, is lauding Comey and his announcement as often as he can. ""It took a lot of guts"" for Comey to reopen the investigation, Trump said Monday in Michigan, where he was reaching for votes in the traditionally blue state. ""I really disagreed with him. I was not his fan. But I'll tell you what, what he did, he brought back his reputation.""And while Trump has been criticized for frequently veering off message and at times missing opportunities to seize on his opponent's vulnerabilities, Clinton has stuck to a consistent theme when it comes to Trump.Since the beginning of the general election, the Democratic nominee has relentlessly hit Trump's temperament and readiness to be president through ads and speeches. This calculation was made as soon as it was clear that Trump would be the GOP nominee. And a week before voters go to the polls, Clinton aides are confident that voters have had plenty of time to digest the contrasting choice that they've presented in the election.Clinton continued that attack line on Monday in Ohio, questioning the businessman's qualifications to be commander-in-chief.Introducing Clinton at the event was Bruce Blair, a former ballistic missile launch officer.""If I were back in the launch chair, I would have no faith in his judgment. None,"" Blair said. ""And I would live in constant fear of his making a bad call."""	Clinton camp insists it can't be thrown off course

The ads were crafted months ago during the Democratic primary -- though they did not run -- and the group now sees an opportunity to repurpose them for a general election audience.Brian Baker, the group's president and a political aide to one of its lead donors, the Ricketts family, said the PAC would try to paint her as a ""political chameleon.""""Hillary Clinton says she's a friend of ours. Is it because she needs our votes? A friend would not say this,"" one ad says, before featuring old clips of Clinton comments, with Spanish subtitles, stressing her opposition to illegal immigration.Another spot features similar comments of hers at a 2008 debate: ""Listening to the Hillary of yesterday, we can't trust the Hillary of today,"" the narrator says.Trump himself has not yet aired a single Spanish-language ad in the campaign, which has surprised some GOP hands eager to make inroads in the Hispanic community. The spots will air on Univision and Telemundo nationally, with a particularly heavy rotation in Colorado, Nevada and Florida, and also online.Future 45 and its affiliated nonprofit 45Committee earlier this fall looked poised to help Trump achieve parity in television advertising, but fundraising and spending appears to have slowed in recent weeks. Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam have given $10 million to the super PAC, and CNN has reported that the Las Vegas couple has committed $25 million total to the two groups, though the nonprofit is not required to disclose its donors."

Taco Bell had a promotion for a free taco in the event of the first stolen base.Obama then zeroed in on what amounts to his closing argument on behalf of Hillary Clinton. After spending the last year making entreaties to young people, African-Americans and women to cast their ballots, Obama appealed to an altogether different demographic: men.Speaking at the first in a stretch of closing campaign rallies for Hillary Clinton, Obama argued the Democratic nominee has been unfairly maligned in her decades-long political career. And he implored men in the crowd -- who polls show favoring Donald Trump in next week's presidential vote -- to take a true measure of their opposition to Clinton, the first woman to clinch a major party nomination.""I want every man out there to kind look inside yourself and as yourself, if you're having problems with this stuff, how much of it is that we're just not used to it?"" Obama told a young and rowdy crowd in Columbus.""When a guy is ambitious and out in the public arena and working hard, well that's OK. But when a woman does it suddenly we're like 'Why's she doing that?'"" Obama said. ""I'm just being honest. Just want you to think about that because she is so much better qualified than the other guy.""Obama was launching a week of rallies for Clinton, spread across the electoral battlegrounds that will determine his successor. On college campuses in Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, Obama hopes to galvanize the coalition of voters who propelled him into office to support Clinton this time around.Polls show Clinton with a deficit among men -- not a surprise, given men have overwhelmingly supported the Republican candidate in the past several contests.A CNN/ORC survey taken October 20-23 showed 47% of men respondents backed Trump, with 44% supporting Clinton. That's a closer margin than the 2012 election, when 54% of men backed Mitt Romney and 46% supported Obama.In his remarks Tuesday, Obama said that men wary of the candidate should investigate their own sentiments, suggesting they might be unaware of a latent sexism in their political views. He pointed to his own marriage as an example of a man embracing a powerful woman.""I know that my wife is not just my equal but my superior,"" he said.Even his attacks on Trump sought to ding the billionaire candidate's manliness, saying his attacks on women demonstrated a weak character, and that his appeals to the working class were false.Trump ""ain't never worn a baseball hat 'till he started selling em,"" Obama said, later imploring voters not to be ""bamboozled.""Obama insisted Clinton was a warrior for working class Americans and children, and not the conniving operator he claimed her opponents were painting her as.""If you get beat up enough in this political environment that's so toxic, after a while people start believing stuff,"" he said. ""Hillary Clinton is consistently treated differently than just about any other candidate I see out there.""As expected, Obama didn't mention the FBI controversy that has shaken the presidential campaign in its final stretch. But he did warn the thousands of people who had gathered in a college gymnasium here to ignore ""noise and distractions"" in the waning days of the contest. He cited ""systematic attacks"" on Clinton's character as an example of what the candidate has weathered since entering public life in the 1980s.""Has she made mistakes? Of course. So have I,"" Obama said. ""There's nobody in the public arena over the course of 30 years that doesn't make some. But she's a fundamentally good and decent person who knows what she's doing who will be an outstanding president."""	Obama pushes 'combo meals' in Columbus, tacos and voting

They are set to return Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. to the courthouse in Newark, New Jersey.Bridget Kelly, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former Port Authority deputy executive director, are charged with nine criminal counts, including conspiracy and fraud, related to their alleged involvement in the September 2013 lane closures on the Fort Lee, New Jersey, side of the George Washington Bridge. Federal prosecutors say the traffic-snarling lane closures were a political plot designed to hurt the Fort Lee mayor, who did not support Christie's re-election bid.The Bridgegate charges stem from a series of emails and texts made public in January 2014. One month before the lane closure, with Christie's re-election campaign in full swing, Kelly texted David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and a political ally of Christie: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""""Got it,"" Wildstein replied.Kelly said ""sarcasm and humor"" characterized her messages. She testified she told Christie about a planned traffic study and potential traffic problems one day before sending that email.The Bridgegate case explainedBaroni testified Wildstein, the admitted mastermind of the incident, told him from the beginning  the lane closures were for a legitimate traffic study, and that's what Baroni believed going into the week of the closures.Wildstein avoided trial by pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation.Christie maintained he had no knowledge of the lane closures and fired Kelly. Two months after the emails went public, lawyers retained by Christie's office released a Bridgegate report that exonerated Christie.Former Christie aide: I told him about traffic studyUS Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case, told The New York Times at the time of the indictment that Baroni and Kelly each face a maximum sentence of 86 years.
