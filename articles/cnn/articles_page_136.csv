Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson garnered the support of 5% of likely Ohio voters, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein notched a mere 1% in the survey.Clinton was widely seen as the winner of last month's opening debate against Trump, and she drew an assist by the Republican nominee's subsequent missteps. Her momentum appeared to be reflected in recent polling. A CNN/ORC survey released this week found Clinton with a five-point lead among voters nationwide. Other post-debate polls showed the former secretary of state with leads in crucial battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina.But Trump looks like he might be the favorite in Ohio, which has voted for the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1964. No Republican nominee has ever won the presidency without carrying the state. A Quinnipiac University poll released earlier this week, and conducted entirely after the first debate, found Trump with a five-point lead over Clinton in Ohio.The Monmouth poll was conducted October 1-4 using phone interviews with 405 likely Ohio voters. It has a margin of error of 4.9 percent. 	Ohio poll: Clinton and Trump locked in tight race

""Donald Trump doesn't go there.""Spicer said: ""I think what Mike Pence said is you shouldn't take military options off the table ... Philosophically they're clearly on the same page. As I mentioned, I think Gov. Pence last night went into more detail as far as the crisis there goes.""""I don't know how many times people can go in and try to nitpick the position. Gov. Pence made it very clear last night that he and Donald Trump are 100% aligned on this,"" he said, adding that Trump's campaign doesn't go into details about military strategy with opponents so as not to reveal their plans.""We leave everything on the table so we relieve the maximum options available to us,"" he said.And when asked about whether Trump has paid federal income taxes, Spicer said he was ""probably the last person that Donald Trump is going to share his taxes with."" ""But obviously his son Eric made that statement to (CNN's Dana Bash), and you can take him at his word,"" he said.Trump's son, Eric, said in a Tuesday night interview that his father paid a ""tremendous amount of tax.""""There's a lot of talk tonight about federal income taxes. Can you just put this to rest? Has your father paid federal income taxes?"" Bash had asked Trump.""We pay a tremendous amount of taxes,"" Eric Trump had said.""Federal income taxes?"" Bash asked.""Yes,"" Trump said."	Sean Spicer downplays notion of Mike Pence, Donald Trump split on Syria
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/trump-clinton-debate-prep/index.html	"The stakes are a little different for each of them, too.For Clinton, the second debate is an opportunity to sustain the momentum she's drawn from the first. Polls this week showed the former secretary of state with leads nationally and in key swing states.For Trump, Sunday's debate will be a mulligan of sorts. Clinton was widely seen as the winner of the first debate, and Trump has been at the center of controversy ever since. Here's how each candidate is preparing for round two as of Wednesday.Clinton off the trailThe Democratic nominee is off the campaign trail ahead of Sunday's debate, leaving media appearances and public rallies to her deep bench of high-profile surrogates, including her immediate family, the first family and Al Gore. Clinton does, however, have fundraisers slated for Wednesday and Thursday, including one that will be open to cameras.Advisers say the reason behind the decision is simple: the debate carries far greater importance than a standard campaign event. The first debate was viewed by more than 80 million, far more than the audience for any rally.Clinton's top takeaway from her first debate with Trump was that preparation matters. So ahead of the contest at Washington University, Clinton will hunker down with a select group of aides later this week to refine her attacks on Trump and prepare for the added level of difficulty created by a live audience that asks questions.Clinton is spending Wednesday preparing for the town hall debate at her home in Washington. John Podesta, the campaign chairman, Jake Sullivan, Clinton's top policy adviser, and Ron Klain and Karen Dunn, two top members of Clinton's debate team, were all seen entering her home. The small group of aides were joined by Sara Solow, Kristine Costa and Tony Carrk, all members of the small group of aides working with Clinton ahead of Sunday's debate.Podesta raised the stakes on Clinton's debate performance in a conversation with reporters, arguing that the format is natural for Clinton and bad for Trump.""She is very used to the format. She likes it. She likes answering questions from individual citizens. She listens hard, she relates to people,"" Podesta said. ""And that is a format that Donald Trump isn't as used to. And so we will see. I think it is a natural format for her. She likes engaging with people.""Clinton has not done any mock town hall debates yet, according to sources with knowledge of her debate preparations, but the plan is to do mock debates later this week. Philippe Reines, Clinton's longtime aide and defender who played Trump ahead of the first debate, will continue in the role and people close to him have said he worked to refine his Trump impersonation after the first contest.Reines was not seen entering the home Wednesday.Trump mocked Clinton taking time off the trail to prepare for the first debate, which was held late last month in Hempstead, New York. It prompted Clinton to deliver a retort she has since re-used in stump speeches.""You know what else I prepared for?"" Clinton said. ""I prepared to be president.""Trump slates pre-town hall town hallIn contrast to Clinton, Trump will continue to greet supporters at campaign events prior to Sunday's debate. He has a pair of events scheduled for Wednesday in Nevada.Trump will also participate in a town hall event on Thursday in Sandown, New Hampshire. It will be a tuneup of sorts for the debate, which will be a town hall format.In the meantime, Trump's top aides are pushing the message that the Republican nominee will be prepared, something critics say was lacking in the first debate. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC on Wednesday that the candidate is ""preparing constantly."" ""Mr. Trump will be ready,"" the campaign's communications director Jason Miller said on CNN's ""New Day.""Both Conway and Miller agreed that the second debate's town hall format will be conducive to Trump's style, but not Clinton.""He has gotten very excited about the format,"" Conway said. ""The town hall format is really a sweet spot for him."""	Next debate prep: Clinton's light schedule, Trump stays on trail

Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping submitted their countries' plans to the United Nations last month, which formally ratified the agreement. And since the European Union signed off on the accord this week, the deal is now set to go into effect in 30 days.""Today, the world has officially crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to take effect. Today the world meets the moment,"" Obama said. ""No nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this challenge alone. All of us have to solve it together.""The United States and China are the world's largest carbon polluters, but the deal needed to be ratified by 55 nations that account for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement limits average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.""This gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet we've got,"" Obama said.The deal has been criticized by Republicans, including Donald Trump, who has said that he would ""cancel"" it if elected."

""I guess when we're talking about how good friends treat one another, that's a source of serious concern as well.""The ""public assurance"" came in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's June 2009 speech at Bar Ilan University where he said, ""The territorial issues will be discussed in a permanent agreement. Till then we have no intention to build new settlements or set aside land for new settlements."" Earnest said the construction, which was announced last week, would ""undermine the pursuit of peace."" Israeli officials have characterized the planned construction as an expansion of an existing settlement, and have said it would provide housing for residents of Amona, a West Bank outpost that is supposed to be evacuated and razed later this year. But in a lengthy statement Wednesday, US State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the construction amounts to the creation of a new settlement.""This settlement's location deep in the West Bank, far closer to Jordan than Israel, would link a string of outposts that effectively divide the West Bank and make the possibility of a viable Palestinian state more remote,"" Toner said in the statement, which used diplomatically extreme language saying United States officials ""strongly condemn"" the Israel move.He said the timing of Israel's announcement -- shortly after the US and Israeli agreed on a multi-billion dollar defense agreement, and days after President Barack Obama attended the funeral of former Israeli President Shimon Peres -- was ""deeply troubling.""""It is disheartening that while Israel and the world mourned the passing of President Shimon Peres, and leaders from the US and other nations prepared to honor one of the great champions of peace, plans were advanced that would seriously undermine the prospects for the two-state solution that he so passionately supported,"" Toner said.A statement from Israel's Foreign Ministry said the additional housing was not a new settlement.""The 98 housing units approved in Shilo do not constitute a 'new settlement,' "" the statement said. ""This housing will be built on state land in the existing settlement of Shilo and will not change its municipal boundary or geographic footprint. The units are intended to provide a housing solution for the residents of Amona who must leave their homes in accordance with the demolition order issued by Israel's High Court of Justice.""The statement added that Israel remained committed to a ""solution of two states for two peoples.""Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, decried the Israeli plan in a statement.""Israel continues to impede international efforts to achieve peace in Palestine and the region amidst the complete inaction by the international community to hold Israel accountable for the crimes it continues to commit against the land and people of Palestine,"" he said."

Clinton criticized the Affordable Care Act on Monday calling it, ""the craziest thing in the world."" He later said the legislation ""did a world of good"" at an event Tuesday. While the former president was more affirming of the policy Wednesday, he did not spare the bill of criticism.""But there are problems with it. There are problems with it, and everybody knows it,"" he said. ""The Republicans want to repeal the law, their idea of solving the problem is to take 20 million people who have got insurance and take it away from them, give it all back to insurance companies again.""Clinton said his wife, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who also supports the law, would greatly improve health care access for Americans by providing affordable insurance for low-income people. Fixing the problem is ""doable"" he said. ""Let them buy into Medicare or have another public option so we can all do it. Insurance doesn't work well for healthcare,"" he said."

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/mike-pence-political-future-debate-trump/index.html	"The Indiana governor largely batted away Hillary Clinton running mate Tim Kaine's recitations of Trump's most incendiary comments, dismissing Kaine's pressure as ""pre-done lines"" from an ""insult-driven campaign."" He sidestepped Trump's most politically toxic remarks -- on Muslims, Mexicans, a disabled journalist and more -- and showed how a more conventional Republican could attack Clinton. It had some Republicans crowing about Pence's chances in 2020 -- and others saying they wish he could be promoted to the top of the ticket in 2016. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who has refused to endorse Trump, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday he would vote for Pence for president ""in a heartbeat."" ""If I'm Donald Trump, I'm taking lessons now from how Pence performed and the rave reviews he got and I'm going to mirror that,"" Kinzinger said, in Trump's second bout with Clinton, Sunday night in St. Louis. A half-dozen Republican establishment leaders -- including current and former elected officials and high-level operatives who have publicly supported Trump -- heaped praise on Pence when CNN's Jamie Gangel asked for their take on his performance.  Several sources sent the same response: ""Pence 2016!"" ""It was as if you suddenly remembered, 'Oh right, this is what it feels like when you have a candidate who knows how to debate, knows the issues and sounds like a Republican,'"" one said. Another called Pence the most valuable player of the 2016 campaign. Pence spent most of his time attacking the records of Clinton and President Barack Obama -- themes that he could revisit in a potential 2020 run if Clinton defeats Trump to win the White House. Even some conservatives were talking after the debate about Pence and 2020. Erick Erickson, the blogger and anti-Trump movement leader, tweeted: ""Pence has convinced me conservatives should not write him off for 2020 just by being Trump's VP nominee. He was solid."" Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard who spent months recruiting an anti-Trump third party conservative candidate, tweeted congratulations to Pence for ""throwing (Trump) under the bus last night."" Pence dismissed any notions he had overshadowed Trump in an interview with talk radio host Rush Limbaugh Wednesday afternoon. ""Donald Trump called me right after the debate to congratulate me and we actually talked a couple times last night,"" Pence said. ""I'm very encouraged that some people think I won, but really I'm just telling you ... from where I sat, Donald Trump won. He really did."" ""It was Donald Trump's vision to make America great again. It was Donald Trump's vision to end illegal immigration once and for all,"" Pence said. Trump took credit for Pence's performance, too, at an event in Henderson, Nevada, on Wednesday. ""Mike Pence did an incredible job and I'm getting a lot of credit because this was my so-called first choice, that was my first hire as we would say,"" Trump said during a rally.Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said during a campaign stop at a Christian private school that he was ""very proud"" of Pence's performance.""He won, he won on the issues, somebody said he won on style -- the style doesn't matter -- the issues, the policy matters. He's getting tremendous reviews from me and everybody,"" Trump said.Trump's praise follows reports that Trump was upset about Pence repeatedly dodging opportunities to defend him during the debate.""The media is saying Pence won, but didn't really defend Trump. That isn't sitting well with the boss,"" a senior Trump campaign aide told CNN's John King. Clinton's campaign pushed the theme that Pence's performance was stylistically on-point but substantively disconnected from Trump's candidacy hard after the debate Tuesday and early Wednesday. ""The vice president's job is to go in and defend the top of the ticket. Mike Pence looked more like he was looking at 2020 than 2016,"" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said Wednesday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" Podesta pointed to Pence adopting different positions than Trump on Russia and saying the US military should be prepared to strike the Syrian government. ""He didn't sound at all like what Donald Trump has been saying on the campaign trail. He made a whole new policy up on Syria which embraced Hillary Clinton's approach to what's been going on in Syria,"" Podesta said. Karen Finney, a Kaine aide, made a similar case to CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" ""I think the question was always going to be, how far would Mike Pence go to defend Donald Trump, or would he be more concerned about his own 2020 aspirations?"" Finney said. ""And I think the answer to that is pretty clear after last night. He literally -- he scoffed and he laughed and he tried to shake his head. But he did not defend Donald Trump.""

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/bill-weld-libertarian-trump/index.html	"The former Massachusetts governor told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead,"" the strategy ""is to peel off Republican votes from Donald Trump."" Weld's partnership with his running mate at the top of the ticket, Gary Johnson, has failed to break out thus far in the election. Low polling has kept them off the official debate stages, and Johnson's multiple, high-profile foreign policy gaffes on live television have furthered dampened their outlook.Weld also said concerns that the Libertarian ticket is hurting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with millennials has prompted a liberal backlash.""I'm certainly getting a lot of free legal advice from Democrats -- some who I know, and some who I don't know -- who are sending me emails and telephone calls at private numbers who are saying, 'You've got to get off the ticket. You'll be a disgrace. It'll be a shame on your family if Trump is elected.' But that's just because they don't want to have millennial votes peeled off from Mrs. Clinton,"" Weld said.He also tried to make the case that despite Johnson's appeal to some young voters, their real success was with Republicans.""I like to go hunting where the ducks are,"" Weld said. ""I think there's more ducks to be hunted on the Republican side of the aisle.""Weld attributed the ticket's performance with young voters to a desire for personal independence.""They want to make choices in their own lives, and that's a really resonant message,"" Weld said.The former Massachusetts governor has called Hillary Clinton a friend, and President Bill Clinton once tapped him to be the US ambassador to Mexico, before he had to pull out due to pushback from conservative Republicans. Weld already has not pulled punches against Trump, repeatedly comparing the Republican nominee's rise to that of the Nazis. And despite Johnson's recent high-profile stumbles, Weld called him a good, ""humble"" man.""Don't laugh, he kind of reminds me in many ways of Abraham Lincoln who was another great truth-teller of his time,"" Weld said."

The story said that 85 of 154 private citizens whom Clinton met or had scheduled telephone calls with during her tenure as secretary of state had donated to the Clinton Foundation or ""pledged commitments to its international programs,"" either personally or through groups or companies.But the story did not say they were all ""major donors,"" as Pence claimed, though many clearly were.The AP reported that 40 donated more than $100,000 each, and 20 pledged more than $1 million. The story was also not based on all of Clinton's calendars during her tenure, but only on the more detailed schedules and phone calls from the first half of her time in that office, since that was all the news organization had access to. Finally, the 154 meetings is dwarfed by the thousands of meetings she held with US officials, diplomats and other representatives of foreign governments, which were not part of AP's reporting.So Pence is correct in his basic premise -- that Clinton met with people who donated to her family's foundation while she was secretary of state. While the AP never labeled them as major donors, clearly many were. However, the AP's analysis only accounts for a fraction of Clinton's meetings, so it's misleading for Pence to say that more than half of her private meetings were granted to major donors.For these reasons, we have to say his claim is true, but misleading."

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/trump-playboy/index.html	"CNN's KFILE has now uncovered two more Playboy videos in which Trump makes an appearance, including one in which he is depicted photographing fully clothed models with a Polaroid camera and conducting an interview with a potential Playmate.In that video — a 1994 VHS tape obtained by CNN titled ""Playboy Centerfold"" — Trump takes part in Playboy magazine's search for its 40th anniversary Playmate.  The scenes featuring Trump do not contain nudity or sexually explicit content, but other scenes in the movie depict fully nude women seductively rubbing themselves in different scenarios.In one scene, Trump interviews a potential model, asking her what qualities she possesses that would make her the right choice for the 40th anniversary cover. ""I believe that it's not just beauty, I think it's an attitude,"" the model says. ""I think it has a lot to do with personality and an attitude. I think Playboy really represents that, and I believe that I have that, and I have what it takes to represent them.""""Well I think you have what it takes too,"" Trump replies. ""And I think everyone in this room thinks you have what it takes also.""Bridget Marks, one of the models Trump interviewed, said in a phone interview with CNN that she had a positive experience with Trump that day and whenever she has seen him since.""I thought he was thoughtful. I thought he was respectful. I had a very good time,"" said Marks, a registered Democrat who said she is remaining neutral in the presidential election. ""He has remembered my name and been very nice to me and my family whenever I've seen him.""Jeff Cohen, a senior photo editor for Playboy who was at the event, said that the magazine wanted the publicity generated by Trump to launch its search for the 40th anniversary playmate.""We sat around and decided, 'Let's launch the search in New York City,'"" Cohen told CNN. ""Obviously, the media capital. We'll get a lot of press, we'll get TV, we'll get radio. What's the best way to do that? Aha, I know, we're gonna ask Donald Trump whether he would come and photograph, do the test pictures, of the first girl that comes in.' And that's basically what we did.""Cohen, who said he's voting for Hillary Clinton, also added that Trump was very professional and businesslike in his interactions with everyone there. Trump also appeared briefly in a 2001 Playboy video centered on a fashion show Playboy did with Betsey Johnson. The Republican nominee appears backstage, alongside two Playmates and his current wife and then-girlfriend, Melania Knauss. CNN's KFILE reviewed the video. Trump appeared at the fashion show along with other celebrities. Other scenes in the film, which do not feature Trump, depict fully nude women. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. The revelation that Trump has appeared in several Playboy videos comes as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton seeks to make Trump's  derogatory statements and actions toward women an issue in the campaign. At the first presidential debate, Clinton hit Trump over his past treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump called ""plumpy"" and an ""eating machine"" after she won the pageant in 1996.Last Friday, Trump attacked Machado on Twitter, telling his followers to ""check out"" her ""sex tape"" — an apparent reference to her appearance on a reality TV show in which she was filmed in grainy, night-vision footage having sex with another contestant on the show. The latest CNN/ORC poll, conducted after the first debate, found that 62% of women viewed Trump unfavorably.Trump has a long history with Playboy magazine, famously appearing on its cover in 1990. That interview made headlines when Trump infamously replied, ""I don't have to answer that,"" when asked if his marriage was monogamous. His cover issue even appeared in television ads for the magazine in the early 1990s. In an interview at the 2001 Playboy catwalk event with CNN correspondent Jeanne Moos, Trump was asked if he have ever dated a playmate. ""I refuse to answer that question,"" he replied.""On the grounds that it may be true?,"" Moos asked.""It may be true,"" Trump said."
