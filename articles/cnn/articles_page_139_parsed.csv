""Donald Trump's comments are not just ignorant -- they're harmful because they give voice to the stigma that has led generations of veterans to hide their struggles instead of getting life-saving help.""Clinton said Trump's remarks should be especially troubling given that he is running to be the country's next commander in chief.""Our troops deserve a commander in chief who understands and respects the sacrifices they make,"" she said. ""Every American dealing with mental health challenges deserves compassion whether they've ever served in uniform or not.""Trump sparked an uproar Monday when he appeared to suggest that soldiers and veterans who commit suicide do so because they can't handle post-traumatic stress of war. During a panel in Herndon, Virginia, Trump said: ""When people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over, and you're strong and you can handle it but a lot of people can't handle it.""Trump's critics and some veterans' groups condemned Trump, saying his comments were yet another instance of the GOP nominee disrespecting veterans and the military.Last year, Trump sparked outrage when he said about former prisoner-of-war and Arizona Sen. John McCain: ""I like people who weren't captured.""""The constant disrespect Donald Trump shows towards our veterans and service members is sickening, and completely and totally disqualifying,"" said Jon Soltz, an Iraq War veteran and head of the progressive VoteVets.org.Trump's supporters have insisted that the candidate's remarks have been taken out of context and misconstrued.

The quintessential swing state is a must-win for Donald Trump, and signs there have pointed in his favor. Among his potential prospects: Stark County. Situated in northeast Ohio, Stark is a swing county in the swing state, and it's a generally accurate bellwether that goes the way of the nation.  It has trended Democratic in the past couple of cycles, but this election, it could go Trump.Much has been made of Trump's appeal to the white working class, and that's what this county -- a relatively white, less-educated populace -- is made up of. But there is always potential for backlash: Google Trends data showed high search interest in ""taxes"" even before a New York Times report on Trump's taxes shook up the race.The Republican nominee has a strong opportunity to overtake Hillary Clinton in Stark County â€” a low-key victory that could indicate a win in Ohio ... and from there, a shot at the presidency.PopulationSwing countyRepresentationPopularityTop searchesWho's searching?TrendingSearches by candidate"	Critical counties: Stark County, Ohio, is a swing county in a swing state	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

What to watch in the vice presidential debateKaine's debate night guests highlight the span of his career from fighting housing discrimination as a young civil rights lawyer to leading during the Virginia Tech shooting tragedy as governor. Here's a look at who will be cheering him on tonight: Lily HabtuLily Habtu, a Virginia Tech shooting survivor, has worked alongside Kaine on gun safety legislation. Kaine was governor during the mass shooting that killed 32 and injured 17, something he speaks about rarely on the campaign trail. After paying his respects at the site of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, an emotional Kaine said, ""It's a weird thing to say, but I always hoped that the Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever. As bad as that was, that nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do."" Okianer Dark When Kaine was a newly-minted Richmond lawyer, he represented Professor Okianer Dark in a fair housing case. Dark, a law professor, was denied an apartment in Richmond due to her skin color. Housing discrimination, he wrote in August, was ""the heart of my legal practice for many years"" as he built a career in Richmond, and eliminating housing inequities is a campaign plan he feels particularly passionate about. Carol Schall, Mary Townley and Emily Schall TownleyCarol Schall and Mary Townley were plaintiffs in the case that overturned Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage. Emily is their daughter. Kaine has sharpened his attack on Mike Pence on his record on LGBT discrimination, something that could come up tonight. ""Mike Pence is a guy who believes marriage equality will cause societal collapse. He ran a one-man crusade to allow Indiana businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans, yet Donald Trump saw this and thought, this is the person I want helping me govern this country,"" he said last month at a Human Rights Campaign dinner. Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson will be in the audience. He is a ""personal friend"" of Kaine's, per a campaign official. Jackson also campaigned for Clinton at a voter registration event Tuesday at Virginia Commonwealth University. Henry MarshHenry Marsh, the first African American mayor of Richmond, is a longtime mentor of Kaine since his time as a civil rights lawyer. Marsh endorsed Kaine's 1998 bid for Richmond mayor in the majority-black city."

""But he takes my counsel, other peoples' counsel very seriously. We have a fabulous relationship."" Conway, a veteran Republican pollster, joined Trump's campaign in July after previously serving as an adviser to a super PAC supporting Ted Cruz's presidential bid. She said she finds Trump to be a ""generous"" and ""gracious"" client and boss. Trump enters the final month of the race down in the polls and at the center of controversy. After closing the gap with Hillary Clinton last month, Trump has lost ground with the Democratic nominee after a rocky first debate and public dispute with a former beauty pageant contestant.RELATED: GOP distances itself from Trump -- againA new CNN/ORC poll conducted entirely after the debate showed Clinton leading Trump among likely voters nationwide, 47%-42%. Early last month, a CNN survey showed Trump with a two-point lead over Clinton.When asked Tuesday if she had admonished the candidate over his war of words with Alicia Machado, a past Miss Universe winner whom Trump had mocked for gaining weight, Conway said, ""I think Donald Trump is the best when he sticks to the issues because the issue set is what favors him."" Trump also faces renewed questions about his tax record, after The New York Times obtained records showing that he declared a $916 million loss in 1995, which could have enabled him to avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years.On Tuesday, Conway emphasized that Trump has not broken any tax laws. She said Trump was ""great"" before he suffered that loss, and has been ever since.""He is the original art of the comeback,"" Conway said."

""So in that context, Alisyn, look, if that's a disqualifier to run for president, so be it.""The former New Mexico governor said he struggled to tell MSNBC's Chris Matthews last week the name of a foreign leader he respects because he's met ""a lot of empty suits"" in politics that he previously placed on pedestals.""Getting involved in politics, having never been involved in politics before, I held a lot of people in this country on pedestals and then I get to meet them up front and personal and I find out that they're all about getting re-elected, that they're not about issues, a lot of empty suits that I held up on pedestals,"" he told CNN. Johnson, who was previously criticized for appearing unaware of the Syrian city of Aleppo, said the leading presidential candidates need to be able to do more than name foreign leaders.""But I guess because you can -- you can dot the I's and cross the T's on foreign leaders and geographic locations, that now somehow you're qualified to put us in that situation? Hey, if that ends up to be the case, so be it. I guess I wasn't meant to be president,"" he said.Johnson said US leaders need to admit America's role in creating the conflict in the Middle East.""With regards to Aleppo, look, why can't we admit to in this case we're involved in Syria, we're involved in a civil war where hundreds and thousands of innocent people have died and because we're involved in both sides of this cross fire we have to take some responsibility for a lot of those people that have died,"" he asked.The Libertarian candidate attacked Republican candidate Donald Trump for allegedly losing nearly $1 billion according to a leaked tax return. CNN has been unable to independently verify the documents and Trump's campaign has not confirmed or denied the validity of the documents. ""You know, he's presented himself as this guy who's omnipotent when it comes to investments and clearly he's made money, he's lost money,"" Johnson said. ""How about just admitting to be a human being? Well, he's never done that.""While Johnson is getting less than 10% of the voters in the most recent four-way national polls, he said if matched head-to-head against the candidates, he'd do much better. ""I would love to see a poll head-to-head, Johnson versus Clinton, Johnson versus Trump,"" he said. ""I think that would really be revealing. I think I would be the President of the United States in that poll.""Johnson believes it is millennials who will help him do well this election cycle. ""Among millennials right now, we're tied for the lead with Clinton,"" he said. But Camerota showed the former governor that among likely voters under age 35 in a four-way race, Clinton gets 50% and Johnson gets 17%. ""So how is that tied with Clinton,"" she asked.""Well, maybe I was looking at the wrong -- maybe I was looking at the wrong poll that you're citing right now, but a recent poll that I looked at yesterday that had me at 7%. I thought that's the one that you're talking about,"" he replied. ""If I'm at 7% and you have a non-applicable age group under the age of 50, you know, that's where I draw my votes. I'm leading among independents."" ""Now like I say, I apologize if yours is a different poll than the one I looked at prior to coming on here,"" he added."

And then you throw in the Rush Limbaughs of the world. I don't think these people are going to go quietly into the good night,"" said Lewis, a CNN political commentator.Lewis spotlighted Sens. Ben Sasse and Marco Rubio and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as Republican leaders with promising futures, but warned that Rubio's failed presidential bid this year is an example of placing too much pressure on a ""rising star"" too soon.""One of the lessons we really need to to learn -- whether it's Rubio or (former Alaska Gov. Sarah) Palin -- is that plucking rising stars and throwing them into the deep end too early is very damaging, and that you can really destroy their potential by foisting too much on them too soon,"" he said.GOP policy guru: Trump can't 'fake his way through 90 minutes'Lewis recalled a moment from earlier in the election cycle where a campaign event featured Haley, Rubio and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate's sole black Republican member. ""It's really amazing how diverse and talented the Republican Party is. And it's so sad, that at this moment, where you have Hillary Clinton, this very vulnerable and unlikeable Democratic nominee, who could have gone up against one of these inspiring young conservatives, and the Republican Party let this happen,"" he said. Lewis also took issue with Trump fans and other Republicans who rely to heavily on Ronald Reagan for a party playbook. ""Reagan didn't go back and talk about the good ol' day of like Calvin Coolidge that much. He was more focused on the future and new solutions to address new problems,"" Lewis said, adding, ""It's time to have some new ideas.""To hear about Lewis' love-hate relationship with the GOP's tea party wing, listen to CNN's ""Party People,"" a new podcast where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservative politics and the Republican Party.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/04/politics/vice-presidential-debate-2016/index.html	"The Indiana governor delivered a smooth performance at Tuesday's vice presidential debate, lobbing attacks at Hillary Clinton with far greater effect than Trump in last week's showdown. Facing a feisty Tim Kaine, whose debate appearance will likely be remembered for his aggressive interruptions, Pence was calm and refused to be baited.But defending the polarizing GOP nominee was an almost impossible assignment as Pence was forced to dodge questions and the trail of explosive rhetoric strewn by Trump over the last 18 months. The constant controversies have bolstered the Clinton campaign's momentum and claims that the real estate magnate is simply not fit to serve as President of the United States.""He is not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton,"" Pence said, when Kaine challenged him to explain a controversial comment by Trump that women who get an abortion should be punished. (Trump later walked back that remark.)CNN Reality Check Pence said he was ""happy"" to defend Trump, but most often ignored Kaine's assaults on the GOP nominee, denied some of his running mate's most controversial quotes, or sought to turn the attack back against Clinton over vulnerabilities like her private email server and record as secretary of state.Road test for next debateThe clash at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, allowed both campaigns to road test fresh attacks that Clinton and Trump can use during the second presidential debate on Sunday, which will be co-moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper. It served as a possible reset moment for both campaigns after a week dominated by a series of troubles for Trump following his underwhelming debate performance last week and a stunning New York Times report over the weekend that a loss of more than $900 million could have resulted in him not paying taxes for 18 years.It's unclear whether Pence's strong performance will rub off on Trump.""The media is saying Pence won, but didn't really defend Trump,"" a senior Trump campaign aide said. ""That isn't setting well with the boss.""Kaine, a Virginia senator, was aggressive and sometimes frenetic, a style that threatened to irritate viewers at times by interrupting his rival at the debate table. He repeatedly recalled Trump's harsh rhetoric on women, Mexicans and African-Americans, and accused the Republican nominee of harboring admiration for hardline leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un of North Korea who view the US as an enemy.""Six times tonight, I have said to Gov. Pence, I can't image how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue or the next and on all six issues, he has refused to defend his running mate,"" Kaine said. ""And yet, he is asking everybody to vote for someone he cannot defend.""GOP distances itself from Trump -- againKaine came prepared with pre-packed zingers, branding Pence as Trump's apprentice and asking millions of television viewers at home: ""Do you want a you're hired President with Hillary Clinton or do you want a you're fired President with Donald Trump?""The senator slammed Trump for speaking of Mexicans as rapists and criminals, to which Pence responded: ""You whipped out that Mexican thing again.""Pence winsA CNN instant poll conducted after the event showed that 48% of viewers who watched the debate believed that Pence won and 42% thought Kaine was victorious.The poll, however, does not represent the views of all Americans and samples only those who watched the debate. Its sample of debate-watchers broke down as 41% Democratic and 30% Republican, reflecting the make-up of the television audience.Veep debate in 140 characters (and more)Pence may be scored the winner on style points, though his evasions on defending Trump could end up being more of a story in the days to come.Pence's solid performance may also have cheered Trump's camp following the Republican nominee's terrible week since his first debate with Clinton which has seen him veer off topic, feud with a former Miss Universe over her weight, bring up Bill Clinton 1990s sex scandals and defend his taxes.Kaine's performance, and the decision to repeatedly stress Trump's liabilities and press the case for women's and minority rights, may also have fired up Democratic base voters, as the Clinton campaign seeks to build late emerging enthusiasm for her campaign.But vice presidential debates rarely change the course of presidential elections. And Tuesday's clash will likely fade from memory within days in the build-up to Sunday's crucial second presidential debate between Trump and Clinton. Only then will voters learn whether Trump can harness his emotions and volatile personality and build the kind of case against Clinton that Pence was able to construct on Tuesday.Kaine's strategyKaine's strategy on Tuesday night -- to brand Trump as an unacceptable choice for President -- was clear from his opening answer when he said that for him and his wife, who have a son deployed overseas as a Marine, ""the thought of Donald Trump as commander in chief scares us to death.""He brought up Trump's suggestions that nations like Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia should get nuclear weapons, which Pence denied his running mate had ever said. Pence also denied that he and Trump had both said that Putin was a better leader than Obama, though both clearly made that case.Pence argued that if anyone is running an insult driven campaign, it's Clinton. He said Trump's comments were ""small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket full of deplorables.""Pence made an effective assault on the Obama administration's foreign policy, which he said had been orchestrated by Clinton, reflecting the underlying theme of the campaign â€” a contrast between continuity and change. He said after Clinton traveled the world as secretary of state, America was less safe than when Obama took office in 2009. ""It's absolutely inarguable,"" Pence said. ""Mostly, it's been a lack of leadership.""But Kaine framed national security questions as a test of Trump's character, which he said would be lacking as commander-in-chief.""He trash talks the military,"" Kaine said. ""He wants to tear up alliances. ...He loves dictators. Last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.""Clinton Foundation had filing issues, tooPence mocked Kaine for what he said was a pre-cooked line. ""Did you work on that one a long time, because that had a lot of really creative lines in it?"" Pence said, and branded the Clinton/Kaine campaign nothing but an ""avalanche of insults.""In an apparent departure from Trump's stated policy on Syria, Pence said the US should be open to military action against Syrian targets of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad if what he called Russian provocations -- namely attacks on civilians in besieged rebel-held areas of the city of Aleppo -- continue.""I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength, and if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo,"" Pence said.He also called for the setting up of safe zones for civilians in Syria -- an idea that has been considered by the US government -- and also backed by Clinton, But it has been judged impractical given the military complications it could entail -- including direct confrontations between US and Russian military aircraft over Syria.Pence also struggled to effectively defend Trump over the tax issues raised by the New York Times report about Trump's mammoth tax write off.""He actually built a business. Those tax returns showed he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago,"" Pence said, adding that the tax code was designed to allow businessmen like Trump to come back after taking risks."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/04/politics/julian-assange-wikileaks-october-surprise/index.html	"While most of America was sound asleep, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had scheduled a major news conference for 3 a.m. ET. It was billed as an ""October surprise"" by Trump backers like Roger Stone and Alex Jones, who promised that the forthcoming WikiLeaks revelations would undo Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.""I have total confidence that @wikileaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon,"" Stone tweeted on Monday.But the two-hour news conference on Tuesday produced no new disclosure. Assange, speaking over a video feed from the Ecuadoran embassy in London -- where he has spent more than four years in self-imposed exile to avoid questions about a rape allegation -- instead used the opportunity to commemorate WikiLeaks' tenth anniversary and ask for donations. He said WikiLeaks will publish new information every week for the next 10 weeks, but he downplayed the notion that his disclosures will derail Clinton's candidacy.In the summer, WikiLeaks released hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee showing officials actively favoring Clinton over her primary rival Bernie Sanders.""There's been a lot of misquoting of me and WikiLeaks publications,"" he said during a question-and-answer portion of the news conference. ""In this particular case, the misquoting has to do with that we intend to harm Hillary Clinton or that I intend to harm Hillary Clinton, or I don't like Hillary Clinton -- all those are false. They come about as a result of (inaudible) it seems of this campaign and this trying to personalize our publications. Our upcoming publications are significant in relation to the US election, yeah, we think they're significant. Do they show interesting features of US power factions and how they operate? Yes, they do.""That might not satisfy the Trump backers who set their alarms. Several observers on Twitter complained early Tuesday that Assange had failed to deliver the goods.""Release the documents NOW @wikileaks! We only have a month before #Election2016 comes to an end!""
