""This is something that is a huge black mark on our society and we would never want to do it again.""However, Higbie did note on Thursday evening's show that the US Supreme Court's 6-3 decision ruling the exclusion order constitutional was never overturned, prompting the host to push back.""What are you saying here?"" asked Burnett.Seated next to Higbie, guest Keith Boykin jumped in.""He's back-tracking, Erin,"" suggested the former Clinton White House aide. ""That decision that you talked about -- that Korematsu decision of 1944 -- even Justice Antonin Scalia said it is one of the worst decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court ... We don't want to go back to that precedent.""Higbie kept his messaging big picture, insisting that despite suggestions to the contrary, the President-elect would not advocate for an internment camp-style policy, and is most certainly not anti-Muslim.Boykin asked his fellow guest to ""tell that to the Muslim people,"" a challenge which Higbie accepted.Higbie stared directly into the bright lights, saying ""All right, Muslim people of the world, Donald Trump is not in fear of the Muslim community.""Still staring straight ahead, he added, ""He's in fear of the radical faction of the Muslim community that has done harm to Americans and abroad.""Thursday's CNN appearance came only one night after Higbie's cross-town visit with Fox News' Megyn Kelly. That segment first raised the reference to internment camps and resulted in immediate condemnation from not only Kelly but also a Japanese-American member of Congress. Higbie was speaking with Kelly when she asked him about reports that Trump's transition team was drafting policies that would set up some sort of registry for immigrants from Muslim countries. ""It is legal, they say it will hold constitutional muster,"" Higbie said. ""We've done it with Iran, back a while ago, we did it during World War II with the Japanese, which, call what you will.""Kelly interjected: ""Come on, you're not proposing we go back to the days of internment camps, I hope.""""I'm just saying there is precedent for it, and I'm not saying I agree with it,"" Higbie replied.Kelly again appeared incredulous, saying talk like that scares Americans about what the President-elect might do.""Look, the President needs to protect America first. And if that means having people that are not protected under our Constitution have some sort of registry so we can understand, until we can identify the true threat and where it's coming from, I support it,"" Higbie said.Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Trump's immigration adviser and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach has clarified that the registry he referred to would be a national immigration registry that would focus on people from high-risk countries, though critics say that could amount to a Muslim registry depending on how it was configured. During World War II, after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans were rounded up and put into internment camps until the end of the war -- a time period considered a stain on American democracy. Thursday morning, California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, called on Trump to denounce the remarks from his supporter. Takano cited his own parents' and grandparents' internment and called it ""one of the darkest chapters in American history.""""More than 100,000 Japanese-Americans were accused of no crimes and received no trial before being relocated, interned, and stripped of their possessions,"" Takano said in a statement. ""I am horrified that people connected to the incoming Administration are using my family's experience as a precedent for what President-elect Trump could do. These comments confirm many Americans' worst fears about the Trump Administration, and they reflect an alarming resurgence of racism and xenophobia in our political discourse.""Trump's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It did not suspend immigration from those countries, but rather required an additional layer of screening for people coming from countries inhabited by known terrorists, like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan—all Muslim-majority nations.  The screening included extensive interviews, fingerprinting, and for some, monthly checks.The program being mentioned now was blasted by civil rights activists, and the ACLU told CNN in an interview this week that NSEERS ""actually made genuine efforts at trying to combat terrorism more difficult by destroying relationships with immigrant communities and actually negatively impacting the ability of the federal government to cooperate with foreign governments in fighting terrorism."" The program also ignores data, compiled by groups like The New America Foundation, which shows most domestic terror attacks are carried out by US-born or naturalized citizens. A DHS inspector generals' report in 2012 called the program ""obsolete,"" ""unreliable"" and an ""inefficient use of resources.""A Muslim banA registry for people from these countries is the latest iteration of a Trump proposal that began with a shocking call in December 2015 when he said he wanted ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on."" That bold claim has become more muddled over time after Trump came under fire for nakedly targeting an entire religion.As for Trump's developing policy, the source did not specify how many or which countries would considered high-risk but said ""it's a moving target"" given the ISIS threat. Not all countries with large Muslim populations are part of the current list, according to this source, who added that a complete ban of immigrants from high-risk countries is ""something we're prepared for, but it's unlikely ... all options are on the table.""Last year, in response to a reporter's question, Trump said he would ""certainly implement"" a database on all Muslims living in the US. When pressed by other reporters, Trump later said he was in favor of a database tracking Syrian refugees in the US, though he never ruled out a broader Muslim ban.The Trump transition team denied Thursday that he ever advocated for a registry.""President-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is completely false,"" spokesman Jason Miller said. ""The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe, but the President-elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in.""AG candidate architect of programOne of the architects of the NSEERS program helped Trump's campaign form immigration policy, and is reportedly being considered for attorney general, according to some news reports. Kris Kobach, the current secretary of state of Kansas, is a lightning rod for critics who have accused him of extreme racism and having ties to white nationalists. His involvement with the transition team is causing a ripple of alarm among civil rights and immigration activists.Kobach told CNN he was part of the transition assisting with immigration, however a Trump spokesman said Thursday he is not officially an adviser. It is unclear if that changed after media reports on the new immigration plan were reported.Related: Who could be in Trump's cabinet?Kobach is almost single-handedly responsible for some of the nation's strictest immigration laws in at least a half-dozen states—he not only writes the laws, but advocates for them and battles on their behalf in court. He is often cited as the chief architect of what Arizona's SB 1070, which was passed in 2010 and led to protests and state boycotts for encouraging the profiling of Latinos and other minorities.The Arizona law requires police to determine a person's immigration status when there is ""reasonable suspicion"" that they are not legally in the US; it was partially upheld by the Supreme Court, but had other sections struck down by the court in 2011. Modeling a new program off the NSEERS program could be more legally sound for Kobach and Trump since courts never ended it.The 'show me your papers' lawThe Arizona law, which critics call the ""show me your papers"" law, was fought by the ACLU and numerous other civil rights organizations, because it ""invites rampant racial profiling"" against Latinos, Asian-Americans and others based only on how they look or sound. Kobach was also behind a change in voter registration in his home state of Kansas, requiring voters to show passports or birth certificates to register to vote, although that law has suffered setbacks in court.Kobach has also spearheaded and pushed through restrictive voter laws for immigrants in at least six states, including Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky; he has often himself been the attorney in court representing the states trying to push the new laws. Kobach has worked with groups including the Federation for American Immigration Reform that have pushed for tough measures on undocumented immigrants. The Southern Poverty Law Center has listed FAIR as a hate group since 2007.While voter fraud by immigrants has been proven to rarely occur, Kobach has said it is a real problem and the reason harsher measures are needed.""Unfortunately, it rarely gets prosecuted,"" Kobach said in an February 2015 interview. ""This is not a victimless crime. Every time an alien, legal or illegal, participated in an election. That effectively cancels out the vote of the US citizen, effectively disenfranchises that US citizen. And we have many cases in Kansas of aliens getting on our voter rolls and voting. Sometimes and just not realizing they are breaking the law. Sometimes it is part of the coordinated effort.""ACLU: Kobach's policies a 'history of utter failure'The ACLU has been involved in many of the lawsuits opposing Kobach in various states.""The history of his policies is a history of utter failure -- failure in the courts, and failure on the ground,"" said Omar Jadwat, a staff attorney at the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, speaking to CNN on Wednesday.""The notion that he pushed around the country that state and local police have inherent authority to work as immigration agents, his proof of citizenship requirement that he imposed on US citizen voters in Kansas, the local laws that he pushed, the anti-DREAMer lawsuits that he attempted. If you look at those policies, and you think about what has been the fate of those policies in the courts, they have all failed miserably to stand up to legal scrutiny and have been found either unconstitutional or illegal on other grounds or both,"" said Jadwat.In an interview earlier this week, Kobach told CNN that he believes that the US shouldn't wait for undocumented immigrants to be convicted of a crime before deportation, citing a lack of resources to prosecute every crime. ""This guy's is a known gang member. He's gotten arrested multiple times. Sure, they haven't convicted him yet, but we ought to get him out of the country and that is what this administration, the Trump administration, will probably do and what the Obama administration has not been doing,"" he told CNN's Brianna Keilar.Strong proponent for wall along US-Mexico borderKobach is also known for his views that numerous undocumented immigrants will leave the US, or ""self-deport,"" if more restrictive immigration laws are enacted, and more undocumented immigrants are detained. But in the absence of self-deportation, Kobach has strongly upheld the idea of mass deportations when undocumented immigrants are found.He has been labeled a racist by the Southern Poverty Law Center and also the ACLU. In an online publication, the SPLC writes:""Given Kobach's racially charged main efforts of recent years -- working to restrict voting rights and curtail immigration -- his relationship with racist groups isn't too difficult to understand. Maybe it's time to question Kobach's claims that he is simply pursuing these issues to enforce the law. His strange bedfellows in the white nationalist movement would certainly agree that fewer immigrants and stricter voting procedures are a good thing, because, well, that would stop brown and black people from being empowered.""Kobach is a strong proponent for a wall along the US-Mexico border and other measures to stop undocumented immigrants from entering the US, and at the Republican convention this summer, he successfully petitioned to have language in the official platform call for a wall on the southern border, in line with Trump's campaign slogan.Though he is hardly known outside of immigration and conservative circles, Kobach is cited even by critics as one of the best thinkers and intellects among his peers. He is not only Ivy-league educated, but also has an elite international pedigree, with degrees from Harvard, Oxford and Yale Law School. An adviser to Mitt Romney during his run for President, Kobach was chair of the Kansas Republican Party from 2007-2009, and was elected secretary of state there in 2010."

He has multiple meetings with Congressional leaders throughout the day Thursday, including with House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.House Republican leaders -- emboldened by strong election results last week -- already have ambitious plans of their own, starting with a maneuver that could undo some of President Barack Obama's executive actions. Republican leaders told rank and file members at this morning's conference meeting that they intend to use a somewhat obscure statute -- the Congressional Review Act -- to nullify some of the most recent Obama Administration regulations, according to multiple GOP sources -- including a rule expanding who qualifies for overtime pay.Republicans could alter their short-term funding bill, dubbed the ""CR"" inside the Capitol, to wipe out Obama executive orders made this year. The maneuver would allow them to reach back in the year a limited amount of time -- 60 days on the legislative calendar, which is different than a regular calendar -- to wipe out the regulations. But to do that, they'll have to pass the measure as soon as possible -- well before the end of this calendar year.Ryan and other top House GOP leaders told members at Thursday's Republican conference meeting that they plan to hold a vote on a CR that would fund the government just through March 31, 2017.   That means Trump would be in office for only about two months when a fresh funding bill will need to be enacted  -- to avoid a government shutdown -- allowing him to implement spending priorities and reforms he advocated while a candidate.Current government funding runs out on December 9.  By moving this short term bill, Republican bypass the chance to approve all the government spending bills, which are tailored for the needs of each agency, something minority Democrats have pressed to do.It's not clear how this strategy will play out in the Senate where Democrats have the votes to filibuster a bill they oppose. The addition of the Congressional Review Act might be considered a poison pill to many Democrats.As Republicans packed into their regular meeting with Pence, the mood was jubilant -- with lawmakers taking selfies with their former colleague, and celebrating big (and unexpected) wins. The House Republicans' tweeted a photo of Pence and the members, with one word, ""UNIFIED.""With control of the House and Senate, as well as the White House, the biggest question Republicans are facing now is how fast to move and what to do first. One option discussed was speeding up the rollback of Obamacare through an option called the ""reconciliation shell bill"" -- which would allow them to dodge a filibuster by Senate Democrats. Pence told the members ""buckle up, it's going to move fast in the first 100-200 days,"" Rep. Bill Flores, a Texas Republican. The measure that Republicans are eying now, which would clear the decks for the new Trump administration is passing a government-funding bill that would last until March 31 -- postponing what has become a perpetual fight in the Capitol for at least three months.Congressional Republicans are moving on a plan that would allow Trump to put his stamp on federal government spending very early in his new administration.Pence, who has also been tasked with recruiting new members to the Trump White House, did not comment on the efforts of the transition team. But three House members -- Reps. Tom Price, Jeb Hensarling and Mike Pompeo -- either have met or were meeting with Trump this week."	Mike Pence to House GOP: 'Buckle up' for breakneck pace

The authors work for the podcast.  ""There's very real concern in Europe over the language that President-elect Trump is using in relation to Vladimir Putin, partly as a consequence of the actions that he took in Ukraine, partly because of his determination to divide Europe and weaken Europe,"" the Rt. Hon. Douglas Alexander, the Labour Party's former shadow foreign secretary, told David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.""There's real anxiety, not just amongst people who have long worried about Russia's influence on the continent, but amongst a growing section of the population who think actually this is the first time that we've seen international borders transgressed in this way in recent decades,"" Alexander said. Specifically, Alexander said Trump's campaign statement that NATO was ""obsolete"" has caused concern in the Baltic states, especially in light of Trump's suggestion that he might not honor the treaty's pledge of mutual defense against outside aggression. ""If you're in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, there is deep fear as to whether he takes seriously the terms of collective security, which is the fundamental basis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the alliance that has served the interests of Europe so well over the decades,"" Alexander said.President Barack Obama on Monday said Trump had assured him during a White House meeting that he remains committed to NATO. Alexander argued that Russia's alleged determination to disrupt Western political processes is not only contained to America.""I'm afraid there's growing evidence that the kind of brazen meddling that we've seen in the US political system over recent months is finding an echo and a reflection in politics in Europe,"" he said. ""You know, some of these far-right parties are securing loans and funding from Russian banks and Russian organizations.""Alexander, who served as chief strategist for Ed Miliband's losing campaign and lost his own seat in Parliament in the May 2015 general election, noted the similarities between the Democratic Party's recent setbacks in the US with the Labour Party's defeats last year and in this year's vote to leave the European Union.""Economic anger is a big part of it, but so also is a sense of cultural loss,"" he said. ""And for many people, they feel a deficit of money, but also a deficit of recognition -- that people feel their way of life, their neighborhood, the culture of which they are a part, is not being recognized and valued in the ways that the economy and society are changing."" During the hour-long conversation with Axelrod, Alexander, currently a visiting fellow at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, plotted a path forward for center-left parties on both sides of the Atlantic. ""We need to be about more than anger. We need to be about answers,"" he said. ""And the only winning formula, I think, for center-left parties to secure that majority support, is to combine authenticity with credibility.""

Asked whether he supported the use of waterboarding -- which Congress banned along with other interrogation torture techniques in 2009 -- Hoekstra hedged, at first saying that ""Congress has spoken on that."" ""If there was a decision to move in another direction and to perhaps do that, that would be a process that you would have to work through with Congress,"" he added.""Are you personally comfortable with using waterboarding as a tactic?"" Camerota followed up.""Well, you have to take a look at specifically what is going on and what the circumstances are at any given situation as to where you would use it,"" Hoekstra said. ""I think that this will be a clear discussion between this administration and Congress to develop a long-term strategy in terms of how do we get the information that a president and Congress needs to make the right decision to keep America safe?""Hoekstra was then asked how the Trump administration should respond to Russia's role in cyberattacks aimed at disrupting the US presidential election. ""We shouldn't tell the Russians that we are going to retaliate. One of these days, maybe the Russians will wake up and they will be taking a look at something and they'll say, 'wow, I wonder what happened here. How did this happen?' And they'll be left wondering whether it was the United States or some hacking group, or whether it was something else that caused a problem within Russia,"" he said.""You don't send signals as to what you are going to do. There may be direct discussions between the president and Mr. Putin. There are a number of options, but what you don't do is you don't telegraph to the Russians and to others exactly what you may or may not do,"" Hoekstra added.Hoekstra also said that he's not a member of Trump's transition team, explaining that ""at this point in time, I'm an informal adviser, and we're kind of working through the details as to what role I may play in the transition team.""Trump's transition team announced Wednesday night anyone being vetted for a high post in the administration must provide a termination of lobbying form if they are a registered lobbyist.

The ban will apply lifetime to representing foreign governments, he added Thursday.""Not only will people not be able to (be) registered state or federal lobbyists, but when they leave government, they will be banned from being a registered lobbyist for five years,"" Spicer said Wednesday.""Why that is crucial is that it goes back to Mr. Trump's goal of making sure that people aren't using the government to enrich themselves and using their service in government to do that,"" he added.President Barack Obama imposed a two-year lobbying ban for officials who left his administration, a policy instituted by executive order on his first day in office. Why hasn't Trump's transition team called the Pentagon?Any ban on lobbying, however, depends on how it is written and enforced. A common practice in Washington is for key power players not to register as a lobbyist, but instead work as a consultant or adviser -- allowing them to take their experience and contacts to make hundreds of thousands of dollars on K Street.The announcement comes as Trump's transition team works to remove lobbyists from its ranks after Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over the efforts from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The transition operation working before Election Day was staffed with long-time Washington experts and lobbyists from K Street, think tanks and political offices, drawing questions about Trump's commitment to reforms.On ""60 Minutes"" Sunday, Trump acknowledged the transition team was stacked with DC insiders.

Those connections have raised conflict-of-interest concerns that could complicate his ability to serve as the nation's top diplomat. The former mayor appeared on 'Evening With Ivan Ivanovic,' a late night Serbian talk show, in April 2012, during a visit to the European nation to consult with Serbian politician Aleksandar Vucic, who at the time was running for mayor of Belgrade.  Vucic, now the prime minister of Serbia, is a former hardline nationalist who was once aligned with autocrat and convicted war criminal Slobodan Milošević. As minister of information in the late 1990s, Vucic instituted fines for journalists who criticized the government and banned some media. Vucic later moderated and expressed regret for his past actions. During his trip, Giuliani also met with Tomislav Nikoli, who was running for president of the country that year. Both Vucic and Nikoli are members of the Serbian Progressive Party.""We're here to give advice to Mr. Vucic, who is running for mayor, about economic development and about how to organize a program to redevelop Belgrade, make it into a great world city,"" said Giuliani, adding he wanted to help the city lower unemployment and debt.  ""Those are things I'm an expert on, it's what I did in New York City, and I've advised other cities throughout the world about how to straighten up those problems.""""We've worked in Mexico City, we've worked in Puerto Rico, we've worked in Colombia. We've worked in some American cities, and we've done a good deal of security work in the Middle East,"" he said.Giuliani added that his company was being paid for the consulting.""We're not involved in the election, we're not making an endorsement in the election. I don't know enough about the election to do that. We're just here to advise him, give our advice. My company gets paid for it, I don't get paid for it. That's what my company does, gets paid for giving advice, but that's being done by a private company not by the campaign.""A spokesperson for Giuliani did not return an email and a phone call from CNN.The former mayor defended his foreign business ties in an interview with The New York Times this week. ""I have friends all over the world. This is not a new thing for me. When you become the mayor, you become interested in foreign policy. When I left, my major work was legal and security around the world,"" he said. Giuliani's visit caused controversy at the time. The US embassy in the country issued a statement declaring  that the former mayor's visit wasn't an endorsement of a candidate by the US government.

Before joining the Cabinet, Laird had been an influential Republican congressman representing Wisconsin for 16 years with an expertise in defense and military matters. He was a well-respected World World II veteran and Purple Heart recipient. Laird had become a vocal critic of President Lyndon B. Johnson and his secretary of defense, Robert McNamara's policy on the Vietnam War. Laird had several goals as secretary of defense. He wanted to end the draft, disengage from the war and reach a peace settlement.""Wars are easy to enter into,"" he said in 2010. ""They're very difficult to get out of.""Laird pushed a policy of ""Vietnamization,"" which meant withdrawing US forces while equipping and training South Vietnam's military. He also instituted sweeping changes in US foreign and defense policy, most importantly by shifting the US military from a conscripted army to an all-volunteer force. Laird said it was a matter of equity. ""It is pretty much an economic issue because conscript labor -- paying young men in the military very low rates -- was unfair.""""Yes, it was a difficult fight ... but I maintained and by the time I left the White House, there was no draft.""US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter praised Laird's contributions in a statement issued Wednesday.""Secretary Laird led the Defense Department through a time of great change in the world and within our department. Through it all, he demonstrated an unfailing commitment to protecting our country, strengthening our military, and making a better world.""Laird also publicly highlighted the inhumane treatment of American prisoners of war and pushed for their return.""Those of us who fought and those of us held prisoner in Vietnam will always have a special place in our hearts for Sec Melvin Laird,"" tweeted Sen. John McCain. Laird stepped down in 1973, serving four years in the administration as he had vowed to do.Legacy outside of Vietnam policy Born in Omaha, Laird came from a family in which both parents had held political office. It seemed natural that he should enter politics. He represented the Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District from 1953 to 1969.  Laird and Democrat Congressman John E. Fogarty, from Rhode Island, formed a bipartisan alliance to expand federal funding for medical research projects and institutions -- including the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""It was a great start to what ultimately became the reward of the NIH to the nation and to the world, with its research resulting in better health care for people all over the world,""  Laird said in a 2014 interview.The Laird Center for Medical Research in Wisconsin is named after him as a tribute to his health advocacy. ""His work helped shape medical research as we know it,"" said Dr. Susan Turney CEO of the Marshfield Clinic Health System where the Laird Center is based. Laird had fondly looked back on his days working across the aisle with Fogarty. ""The two of us put aside our party affiliations and worked ... to prove how working together could build a national program for health research and education that would be the envy of the world,"" he said in a 2014 interview."
