The campaign has reserved $34.7 million in advertisements between Tuesday and Election Day, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. RELATED: The new birthers: Debunking the Hillary Clinton health conspiracyQuestions surrounding Clinton's fitness, though widely debunked, reached a fever pitch within conservative media late this summer, with pro-Trump forces like the Drudge Report and Sean Hannity routinely indulging conspiracy theories that the Democratic nominee is secretly in grave health. The Trump campaign also gave legitimacy to these theories. In August, Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson asserted that Clinton has dysphasia, a brain disorder that affects speech.RELATED: Clinton, Trump clash in 2nd debate: CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claimsThe Clinton campaign has condemned those who are pushing the theories, and the candidate's physician has said she is healthy and has not developed any new conditions this year.The fainting episode last month was the result of pneumonia, for which Clinton had been diagnosed only days earlier.Trump has repeatedly said that Clinton ""doesn't have the stamina"" to be president, a charge he repeated at the first presidential debate last month.But at the end of the second debate on Sunday, Trump offered uncharacteristic praise of his opponent's toughness.""I will say this about Hillary: She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that,"" Trump said. ""I tell it like it is. She's a fighter. I disagree with much of what she's fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait."" "	Trump targets Clinton's health in new ad	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""He should not be criticizing foreign heads of state and governments for their policies. This is not his business. He should be more focused on his specific responsibilities."" Russia's diplomatic protest was first reported by the Associated Press.In an April speech at Case Western Reserve University's law school in Cleveland, three months before Republicans held their convention in the city nominating Trump, Zeid said ""a front-running candidate to be president of this country declared, just a few months ago, his enthusiastic support for torture,"" a reference to remarks by Trump in which he pledged to restore waterboarding and even harsher interrogation methods for suspected terrorists.While he didn't mention Trump by name, Zeid said the candidate was engaged in ""a full-frontal attack -- disguised as courageous taboo-busting -- on some fundamental, hard-won tenets of decency and social cohesion.""Zeid noted he was a Muslim who had studied in the United States and has spent many years living in what he called a country ""embodied by its bonds of inclusion, the freedom to be yourself, represented well and served fully by a government transparent and accountable for all its citizens' individual rights.""The Russian protest fuels questions about links between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin, after US intelligence agencies publicly blamed Russia for recent hacks into the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic-affiliated groups, which if true would be a stunning display of a foreign power's meddling in a presidential election. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has sought to make Trump's glowing comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia-friendly foreign policy platforms an issue in the 2016 election. Her campaign has also raised concerns about connections between Moscow and members of Trump's campaign, arguing that if the Republican nominee is elected, he would be someone Putin could manipulate. ""This is not only strange -- it's scary,"" Jake Sullivan, Clinton's primary foreign policy adviser, said of the Russian complaint to the UN. ""A major party candidate for the presidency of the United States is being protected by the Kremlin. Wow.""Hope Hicks, Trump's campaign spokeswoman, told CNN the campaign was not aware of Zeid's remarks or Russia's protest.In  a second speech last month at the Hague, Zeid, the former Jordanian ambassador to the US, lumped Trump with several populist European politicians whom he blasted as ""demagogues and political fantasists,"" including Nigel Farage, a leader of Britain's pro-Brexit campaign, French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen and Dutch Nationalist leader Geert Wilders, who received the lion's share of his criticism. In August, Wilders' Freedom Party promised a platform calling to close mosques and Islamic schools and ban the Koran if it won the Netherlands' election next March. Zeid also singled out other politicians who have taken anti-Muslim, anti-migrant and pro-Russian stances, including Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Czech President Milos Zeman and Austrian presidential candidate Norbert Hofer.""All seek in varying degrees to recover a past, halcyon and so pure in form, where sunlit fields are settled by peoples united by ethnicity or religion,"" Zeid said, adding that he believed the politicians had similar sentiments to ISIS.Churkin told reporters Monday he had not seen Zeid's remarks and that he delivered the protest to the UN upon instructions from Moscow in one of his regular meetings with Ban. He said he also raised the issue with Zeid. RELATED: Trump dismisses running mate Pence's Syria viewChurkin said he did not not bring up Trump in his protest. ""If it were Trump (who Zeid was referring to in his speeches), then the United States should have complained because it would have meant that he is interfering in their domestic presidential campaign,"" he said. ""But I am not working for the United States. I am working for the Russian Federation, so why should I complain when somebody is trying to interfere with the US presidential campaign?""However, the UN diplomats said Churkin specifically complained to Ban about Zeid's mention of Trump and other politicians. The diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid appearing to criticize Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

""My fix, which I still like: You start with four debates,"" the Americans for Tax Reform president told CNN's ""Party People"" podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham in a recent conversation. ""The first one (is) all the candidates in front of the governors who are not running for president, and they have to discuss politics in front of Republican governors. I don't think Trump could have called somebody long face or small hands or whatever it is and gotten past the governors going, 'Excuse me, I was asking about Medicare and Medicaid.'""Grover Norquist: Donald Trump still hasn't signed tax pledgeNorquist's proposal for the next three primary debates would have a similar format, one being hosted by members of Congress, another being hosted by Republican party officials and the last one being held by Republican appointed ambassadors to address foreign policy issues. Norquist took issue with the current system because, he said, debate moderators throughout the primaries -- TV journalists, for the most part -- set the agenda.""Because the moderators thought that gay marriage was a fascinating topic, they asked about that all day,"" Norquist said, adding later, ""We allowed the moderators to decide what the Republican party was perceived as caring about.""Despite the drama surrounding the top of the ticket, Norquist had high praise for state level Republicans as a sign of the party's future, saying, ""The modern Republican party is extremely healthy.""In particular, Norquist praised actions by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as Republican leaders who made significant strides shaping the party for the better.""I almost want to pass a Constitutional amendment saying only governors can run for president so that you can prove you can do it,"" he said. That's not an amendment that would be very likely to get through the US Senate, where many presidential candidates spend part of their career.To hear how Norquist feels about his no-tax-increase pledge and how he starting going to the Burning Man festival, listen to CNN's ""Party People,"" a new podcast from CNN where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservative politics and the Republican party.

To that end, Obama announced that the government is ""working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space.""

""If the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton, so be it. At least it is a moral, ethical choice.""GOP on the precipiceBeck, who founded media venture TheBlaze after rising to prominence as host of his eponymous radio and TV show, campaigned for Texas Sen.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/trump-stern-mike-tyson/index.html	"The GOP nominee — who is facing widespread criticism for his 2005 comments on a hot-mic in which he describes forcing himself on women — went after Hillary Clinton at the debate on Sunday for defending an accused child rapist as his court-appointed attorney in 1975.Trump vigorously and very publicly defended Tyson during his rape trial in early 1992, proposing that Tyson be allowed to pay off victim Desiree Washington with money from future boxing fights instead of serving time in prison. Speaking with ""NBC Nightly News"" on Feb. 21, 1992, he said Tyson was ""railroaded in the case"" and suggested the victim wasn't a victim at all. Trump also told ""New York"" magazine Tyson relayed to him that the victim ""wanted it real bad.""In a February 1992 interview on the ""Howard Stern Show"" reviewed by CNN's KFile, Trump lamented how the rape accusation had affected Tyson.""It's so sad because I've known Mike more or less from the beginning,"" said Trump. ""He started off having his first fights at my place and he's had his biggest fights at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City. He was so incredible and the last few years he's just not been the same — number one he's not been the same fighter, he's not been the same man, he's not been the same anything."" ""The truth is he's been very loyal to me, he has most of his fights at my places,"" added Trump. ""He does best at my places in terms of his best fights and he's been great and I just hate to see what's happened to him. It's a travesty, it's a travesty.""Trump also told Stern that he never saw Tyson touch a women inappropriately but that he did observe women groping Tyson.""I've seen women going around touching him,"" said Trump with a laugh. ""He walks in a room and the women start grabbing him and grabbing his ass and grabbing anything else they can grab on him.""The Trump campaign did not respond to a request to comment on Tyson for this story. Trump touted Tyson's support in Indiana earlier this year, the state where Tyson was convicted. ""Mike Tyson endorsed me,"" Trump said. ""I love it. He sent out a tweet. Mike. Iron Mike. You know, all the tough guys endorse me. I like that, OK?""Trump and Tyson's friendship dates back to the 1980s. Trump's 1990s book, ""Surviving at the Top,"" featured a chapter on the duo titled ""Iron Mike and Me.""In the 1992 Stern interview, Trump explained his plan to keep Tyson out of jail. ""My concept is for the state of Indiana, maybe $20 million, a lot of money,"" Trump said. ""The proceeds from his next fight, his next two fights for rape victims, and I think that's a lot better than having Mike Tyson serve jail for 10 years or something.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-bill-clinton-accusers/index.html	"""Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously,"" said Trump.What's the truth here? Did she? Let's look at the cases one-by-one.Juanita BroaddrickOne of the women, Juanita Broaddrick, had accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978 when he was attorney general of Arkansas. Broaddrick's allegation that Hillary Clinton warned her to remain silent about the rape stems from an encounter she had with Hillary Clinton at a fund raiser that same year. In an interview with the website, Breitbart, last week, Broaddrick recalled how Hillary Clinton held her hand and said to her, ""I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do.""Broaddrick told Breitbart: ""What really went through my mind at that time is 'She knows. She knew. She's covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.""Broaddrick did not initially report the alleged assault to law enforcement, but she did make the claim in interviews with the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Years later, she was subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. As part of her testimony, she signed an affidavit denying that Clinton sexually assaulted her.She later recanted that denial when interviewed by investigators from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office. But, House managers chose not to call her as a witness in the case to impeach President Bill Clinton.In a February 1999 NBC interview, correspondent Lisa Myers asked Broaddrick, ""did Bill Clinton or anyone near him ever threaten you, try to intimidate you, do anything to keep you silent?"" Broaddrick answered: ""no.""Gennifer FlowersAs the 1992 presidential primary campaign got under way, the former lounge singer asserted that she had had a long-running affair will Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton stirred up controversy when she told ABC News that Gennifer Flowers was ""some failed cabaret singer who doesn't have much of a resume to fall back on."" The New York Times recently reported that, by some accounts, Clinton gave the ""greenlight"" to hiring a private investigator who collected disparaging accounts from ex-boyfriends and others who knew Flowers and then provided these stories to news organizations. Internal campaign memos unearthed by the Times describe the aim of the work of the hard-nosed investigator was to ""impugn"" Flowers' character, ""until she is destroyed beyond all recognition."" But the New York Times reporting was not clear how involved Hillary Clinton was in this effort.Monica LewinskyYes, Hillary Clinton did call Monica Lewinsky, who had an affair with her husband, a ""narcissistic loony toon."" That phrase is from a journal kept by Diane Blair, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas and a person Hillary Clinton described as her closest friend. Blair, who died in 2000, kept notes of her conversations with Clinton. After Blair's death, her husband donated her papers, including her personal journal, to the University of Arkansas Special Collections Library.  Blair wrote in her journal, about a September 9, 1998, conversation she had with her friend, in which Clinton tried to put his actions into context, but did not excuse, her husband's behavior. But, Clinton also had harsh words about Lewinsky who had said she had seduced the president.""It was a lapse,"" Blair writes, describing Clinton's view of her husband's affair, ""but she says to his credit he tried to break it off, tried to pull away, tried to manage someone who was clearly a 'narcissistic loony toon;' but it was beyond control.""So it is true that Hillary Clinton used an ugly description of Lewinsky. But, it is also true that this was made in a private conversation with a confidante. It was not a public statement made in a speech, a tweet, an interview or to Lewinsky's face. As such, it is difficult to make the argument that Clinton was trying to humiliate or bully Lewinsky by making this statement.  Kathleen WilleyWilley, a former White House aide, charged that Bill Clinton fondled her in 1993. She later told the Daily Caller that the Clintons tried to intimidate her into not telling the truth in court. Her evidence was a lunch between Clinton supporter Sidney Blumenthal and reporter Christopher Hitchens during which Blumenthal reportedly said of Willey, ""well she looks good today ... she's not going to look good by Friday."" Willey also asserted that she found a dead cat on her porch, spotted a man under her deck one night and a person in her neighborhood asking about her children.Paula JonesBill Clinton entered into an $850,000 settlement with Jones, an Arkansas state worker who alleged that in 1991, he propositioned her and exposed himself. We have not uncovered instances of Hillary Clinton directly attacking Jones after she filed suit in 1994. But Jones recently told The New York Times that after her lawsuit, ""they sent out people to dig up trash on me.""ConclusionSo it is clear that Hillary Clinton reacted in what could be seen as negative ways. According to some accounts, she at the very least went along with the hiring of a private investigator to look into the background of Gennifer Flowers. Some see her reaction as especially problematic coming from a person who promotes herself as a champion of women.Still, Broaddrick's example of intimidation is open to interpretation, and is weakened by her answer to NBC that no one ""near Bill Clinton"" had tried to intimidate her. Willey is not able to link the incidents that occurred directly or indirectly to Hillary Clinton. The comments Clinton made about Lewinsky were spoken in private to a close confidante. And Paula Jones has not pointed to a specific attack.All, in all, we think Trump's blanket charge that Clinton ""viciously"" attacked these women to be an exaggeration too far."

It's a meltdown unprecedented by a presidential nominee this late in the year.""It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,"" Trump said in a tweet that raised the prospect of a full on civil war in the Republican Party. Such a battle would pit his loyal supporters against the rest of the GOP, including vulnerable lawmakers running for re-election that could threaten the party's hold on Congress.Trump's outbursts come with his national polls tanking and his route to the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House closing fast. Trump also called Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican, ""very weak"" and ""ineffective"" -- an attack that comes the day after after Ryan told House colleagues he'd no longer defend or campaign for the GOP presidential nominee.""Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty,"" Trump tweeted.""Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support,"" he also tweeted.Trump also criticized GOP Arizona Sen. John McCain who rescinded his endorsement of the Republican presidential nominee over the weekend.""The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his  primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!"" Trump tweeted.Trump said Republicans who are ""disloyal"" are ""far more difficult"" than Clinton.""Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don't know how to win - I will teach them,"" he tweeted.Trump's move to go rogue and incite anarchy in the party leaves Republican leaders in a tough position. His behavior risks alienating moderate and swing voters vital to maintain GOP control of the Senate. But repudiating Trump entirely would risk a backlash by the record breaking millions of voters who flocked to the Republican nominee in the primary process.He reiterated his frustration at his first post-debate fundraiser Tuesday in San Antonio, according to two sources. He repeated what he tweeted, saying that he feels ""free from the shackles"" and appeared generally in a good mood. He also mentioned Ryan, saying it was unfortunate that a small part of the party was not focusing on balanced budgets/immigration. Ryan sought a middle ground Monday when he told House Republicans on a conference call he will no longer defend or campaign for Trump, instead spending the campaign's final four weeks focusing on House and Senate races in an effort to help the GOP maintain control of Congress. GOP on the precipice""Paul Ryan is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same,"" Ryan spokesperson Brendan Buck said Tuesday, a statement echoing his response on Monday.""The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities,"" Ryan's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said in a statement Monday. Trump even cast the Democratic Party -- which nominated Hillary Clinton -- as a stronger organization than the GOP that nominated him.""With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!,"" he tweeted.The feud follows an outpouring of high-profile Republicans slamming the real estate mogul, after the release Friday of a 2005 recording featuring Trump making lewd and sexually aggressive comments about women.Republican elected officials and party elders lined up Saturday to denounce Trump's incendiary remarks. Some sitting members of Congress pulled their support entirely, while others blasted the remarks but continued supporting the GOP standard-bearer. Some said they wanted Trump to step aside so that his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, can lead the ticket. Pence said in a CNN interview Monday that he's sticking with Trump. Even a top ally, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, criticized Trump for not going far enough to apologize for his lewd and sexually aggressive comments about women that emerged in a video from 2005.""I was there when he found out about it and there's no question in my mind he's embarrassed by it,"" Christie told WFAN radio in New York. ""But I think that he should have been much more direct and much more focused on saying, just saying 'I'm sorry' and only 'I'm sorry,' and that's what I would have done.'"" And Trump is not just targeting his own party. At a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night, he raised the prospect that the election is being rigged to stop him becoming President, a scorched earth narrative that threatens one of the bedrock principles of American democracy -- faith in the electoral system itself.""I hear these horror shows, and we have to make sure that this election is not stolen from us and is not taken away from us,"" Trump said in Pennsylvania.Trump will have his first chance to demonstrate his shackle-free approach at an evening rally in Florida on Tuesday night, that could offer a preview of how he plans to act in the final four weeks of the election, if his campaign tips into a deeper free-fall."

Bush, told the Washington Post in an interview Monday that ""it would be like a banana republic"" if Trump followed through on his threat at Sunday night's debate. ""Putting political opponents in jail for offenses committed in a political setting, even if they are criminal offenses -- and they very well may be -- is something that we don't do here,"" Mukasey said.Trump brought up apparent speeches Clinton made to Wall Street leaders released by Wikileaks, and repeated his calls to prosecute her at a Pennsylvania rally Monday.""During a speech, crooked Hillary Clinton, oh she's crooked folks, she's as crooked as a three dollar bill. Here's one, just came out. Lock her up is right,"" Trump said in response to supporters' chants. Mukasey has forcefully criticized Clinton related to her use of a private email server as Secretary of State. He argued that she could have been criminally convicted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in January, titled ""Clinton's Emails: A Criminal Charge is Justified.""But Mukasey expressed discomfort with Trump's line of attack during the second presidential debate. While he maintained his belief that there is a legal case against Clinton, he cautioned against using the law to further political ends.""If we were arguing policy here rather than straight law, I would argue against bringing charges,"" he said. ""The notion of carrying out prosecutions to pursue a political agenda, that's something that should never happen.""The former Republican official's remarks echoed those of another former Attorney General, Democrat Eric Holder, who blasted Trump in a storm of tweets on Sunday for the threat. ""So @realDonaldTrump will ORDER hi AG to take certain actions- when Nixon tried that his AG courageously resigned. Trump is dangerous/unfit.""Mukasey's remarks also make him the second high-profile Clinton critic in recent days to come to the Democrat's defense amid escalating attacks from Trump.
