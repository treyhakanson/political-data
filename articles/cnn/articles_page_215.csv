And that's just this month.Clinton: Trump campaign built of prejudice, paranoiaRace and racism have always coursed through American politics. But racial issues aren't just sparking the occasional flashpoint this campaign cycle -- they are a constant and troubling feature of the contest. The developments over the past month underscore the steady stream of divisive language, racially charged imagery and flat-out racist statements permeating this election season. All this comes as Trump tries to enhance his image among minority voters, particularly African-Americans and Latinos. The Republican nominee will head to Mexico Wednesday to meet with the president of that country ahead of a major immigration speech in Arizona. He will be in Detroit this weekend to speak at a black church.""Tonight I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants to see a better future, who wants to see real, positive change,"" Trump said late Tuesday during a speech in Everett, Washington.But he faces an uphill climb -- to say the least. Trump's rhetoric around race, ethnicity and nationality have depressed his numbers among every demographic -- he is underperforming past Republican presidential candidates in nearly every voting bloc.A Quinnipiac poll released last week found that a majority of likely voters -- 59% -- think that the way Trump talks appeals to bigotry. Some 29% of Republicans think that way and 72% of non-whites have the same view. Trump's attempts to broaden his reach beyond his core supporters have largely backfired and likely hardened views against him.Mark Burns, Trump's most prominent black surrogate, spent much of Tuesday apologizing for tweeting an offensive cartoon that showed Clinton in black face and speaking in dialect. The tweet was supposedly an attempt to broaden Trump's appeal to African-Americans by suggesting Clinton didn't deserve the support of black voters.  (Trump now polls in the low single digits among black voters). ""Obviously, my message, I stand by it, but the methodology I do not,"" Burns said Tuesday in an interview Tuesday with CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The message is simply this: I believe that the Democrat party has been using the black vote.""  Trump backer apologizes for blackface tweet, but stands by messageTrump will likely aim to hammer that message when he appears in Detroit on Saturday. Yet he has mostly stumbled in his appeals so far, displaying a tin ear when it comes to a key voting bloc.""You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?"" Trump asked African Americans as he stood before an overwhelmingly white audience in Michigan recently. Chicago rapper gets political: Donald Trump ""is the problem""Last weekend, when NBA star Dwyane Wade's cousin was shot, Trump put a political spin on a family tragedy.""Dwayne Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago,"" he tweeted, misspelling Wade's name. ""Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!""Bishop Wayne T. Jackson is set to host Trump on Saturday morning at his church, Great Faith Ministries International. He told the Detroit News that he is facing some backlash for his meeting with Trump, but planned to bring up tough issues.""I'm going to ask him that question: Are you a racist?"" Jackson said in an interview with the Detroit News. ""I'm going to ask him questions that pertain to the heart of our community. ... But there's a lot of emotional anger tied to this, and we need to make sure that our concerns as a community are met."""	Race and racism in the 2016 campaign

""My work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces. I made policy decisions based on what I thought was right.""She added: ""I know there's a lot of smoke, and there's no fire.""Trump has recently upped his attacks on Clinton and her family's namesake foundation, saying that foreign governments and business leaders gave primarily to get something in return.""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins,"" Trump said Tuesday night at a rally in Austin, Texas. ""The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech.""'Unique circumstances'Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, has laid out some steps the foundation will take if his wife wins. It will only accept donations from US citizens, legal residents and US-based independent foundations, and the 42nd president will step down from the board and stop fundraising.Asked by Cooper about why she is waiting until a possible presidency to make the changes rather than implement them immediately, Clinton said, ""Obviously, there will be some unique circumstances.""""Didn't those unique circumstances exist when you were secretary of state?"" Cooper interjected.""No, no, look -- I know there is a lot of smoke and there is no fire,"" Clinton replied, before blasting an Associated Press report out this week that said more than half of the private citizens with whom she met while at the State Department donated to the foundation.""It draws a conclusion and makes a suggestion that my meetings with people like the late, great Elie Wiesel or Melinda Gates or the Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders,"" Clinton continued. ""That is absurd. These are people I would be proud to meet with, as would any secretary of state would have been proud to meet with, to hear about their work and their insights.""Pushback from PowellClinton has reportedly told FBI investigators that her use of the private server was inspired by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who has pushed back against the suggestion, saying, ""Her people have been trying to pin it on me.""Cooper asked the Democratic nominee about the disparity in the two former diplomats' claims.""I am not going to relitigate in public my private conversation with him,"" Clinton replied. ""I have been asked many, many questions in the past year about emails and what I have learned is that when I try to explain what happened, it can sound like I am trying to excuse what I did. And there are no excuses. I want people to know that the decision to have a single email account was mine. I take responsibly for it. I apologize for it. I would certainly do differently if I could.""She added, ""I believe the public will be and is considering my full record and experience as they consider their choice for president.""Clinton's faced some criticism even among Democrats who have criticized her response to email scrutiny. David Axelrod, a former Obama senior adviser and CNN contributor, said jokes Clinton about the issue on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel earlier this week fell flat. ""I think she should not joke about this. She's done this a few times. She seemed flippant about it. Obviously there are concerns about how she handled these emails and all these jokes fall flat and it makes it seem as if she's not taking the issue seriously,"" Axelrod told CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday.

Trump ally: I'm not peddling 'conspiracy theories' about Clinton's healthChaffetz continued: ""You're just going to have to do that, it's too important. So both candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, should show both their medical records and tax returns, absolutely.""Earlier this month, Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy also told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Trump should make his tax returns available to the public.""We deserve all the information about these candidates that we can get our hands on to make an educated vote in November,"" Duffy said during an interview on ""The Situation Room."" Trump has said he will release his tax returns when he is no longer being audited. In refusing to release the returns, he has broken with decades of modern presidential campaign precedent.Clinton's campaign recently began airing a new television ad that hits the real estate mogul for refusing to be more open with his tax returns, despite his claim in a 2014 interview with an Irish television station that he ""absolutely"" would.Clinton released her 2015 tax returns earlier this month and eight years of personal income tax returns in 2015. Meanwhile, both candidates have faced questions about their physical fitness for the Oval Office. Like Clinton, Trump has released minimal medical information, most notably in the form of a December 2015 letter of a few paragraphs from his personal physician, a gastroenterologist, that described his blood pressure and lab results as ""astonishingly excellent"" while suggesting a President Trump would be the ""healthiest individual ever elected.""But Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, found much of that language surprising and, in some cases, almost comically lacking in objective data."

Let me go a step further -- they'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,"" Trump told Sean Hannity when asked if he would allow for exceptions to his long-held position.Donald Trump's immigration policy: Then and nowHe continued: ""Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out. But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject -- and I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me -- and they've said, 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,' I have it all the time. It's a very, very hard thing.""At the same event, Trump also indicated an openness to ""softening"" his immigration policies, which also includes building a wall on the border with Mexico.Trump all week has made rumblings about a position change, and he had previously planned to deliver an immigration speech this week in Colorado. But the address was postponed as he and his advisers indicated that his positions on key tenants of immigration policy were not settled.Wednesday night, a Trump campaign source confirmed the real estate mogul will outline his immigration policies in a speech next Wednesday in Phoenix.At a campaign rally in Jackson, Mississippi, Wednesday night, Trump insisted any immigration policy pass three broad tests: It must improve jobs and wages for US citizens; must improve citizens' safety and security; and improve citizens' quality of life.""Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who chose to come here illegally,"" Trump said. ""I want to focus on the American families who've been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton supports.""Asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper after the rally about Trump's apparent policy shift on deportations, Clinton brushed off the remarks, calling them part of a ""shuffle"" and his ""third different position"" on the matter.""Somebody has told him, I guess, the latest people he's consulting, how damaging his statements have been, how terrible his deportation plan is, how offensive his views on immigrants have been from the very first day of his campaign,"" Clinton said.Echoes of primary opponentsTrump's apparent suggestion to offer some undocumented immigrants a form of legal status resembles positions offered by other Republicans during the primary fight -- stances Trump cited to vanquish his opponents.Here's how Florida Sen. Marco Rubio campaigned in November in South Carolina: ""We will enforce our immigration laws. That being said, I don't think it's reasonable to say you're going to round up and deport 11 million people. And I think people are going to be reasonable and responsible about what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 years who otherwise has not violate the law, has learned English, paying taxes, paid a fine and wants a work permit.""In New Hampshire last September, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush used similar language. ""You come out from the shadows. You receive a provisional work permit. You pay taxes. You don't receive federal government assistance. You learn English,"" he said. ""You earn legal status, not citizenship. That, to me, is the most practical way of dealing with this problem.""Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Bush, said in a statement Wednesday it was ""unsurprising that Donald Trump is finally faced with reconciling his immigration policy with reality, something Governor Bush predicted last year.""Former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor added his thoughts Thursday, tweeting, ""Pleased to see @realDonaldTrump embrace @JebBush's immigration plan."""

And someone who has questioned the citizenship of the first African-American president, who has courted white supremacists, who has been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color, who has attacked a judge for his Mexican heritage and promised a mass deportation force, is someone who is very much peddling bigotry and prejudice and paranoia.""Clinton will hit Trump and his advisers in Reno for ""embracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of America,"" a Clinton aide who previewed the speech told CNN on Tuesday.A little over an hour earlier in Jackson, Mississippi, Trump issued his bluntest and most provocative characterization yet of Clinton as part of his accusations that she treats minorities, and black people in particular, simply as votes to be counted.""Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future,"" Trump said at a campaign rally here, speaking to an overwhelmingly white audience of supporters in the deep-red state. ""She doesn't care what her policies have done to your communities. She has no remorse. She's going to do nothing for Hispanics and African-Americans.""Trump last week accused Clinton of ""bigotry"" -- a term Clinton has occasionally invoked on the trail as well to criticize Trump -- but ratcheted up that language Wednesday night. His prepared remarks, which the Trump campaign released ahead of his latest verbal assault, included the ""bigot"" accusation.Trump has made a direct appeal to African-Americans at each one of his rallies in the last week, decrying inner-city poverty and accusing Democratic policies of failing voters of color, who are a critical voting bloc to the Democratic Party.The Republican nominee also has taken flak from critics for issuing his appeal to minority voters in towns and cities that are overwhelmingly white.And he's been accused of going too far by overplaying poverty statistics and suggesting that virtually all black and Hispanic voters are impoverished inner-city residents.""You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?""

He treated us as if we were nothing,"" Farage said -- Farage declined to endorse Trump. But he freely opined on the US presidential election.""I will say this: If I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me. I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me,"" Farage said, as Trump's supporters roared with approval.Farage later thanked Trump on Twitter for his ""tremendous introduction"" at the event.Political observers have drawn a slew of similarities between Trump's campaign and the pro-Brexit movement -- particularly their populist and nationalist appeal -- and Trump has also approvingly likened the two political movements.""They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT,"" Trump, who had predicted the U.K. would vote to leave the EU, tweeted last week.""I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like we're going to be voting for on November 8th,"" Trump said Wednesday night. ""They voted to reclaim control over immigration, over their economy, over their government.""Farage's visit comes as Trump continues to struggle in the polls, and the conservative British politician also sought to encourage Trump supporters not to despair, pointing to polling in the UK that hinted at defeat for the referendum to leave the EU.""And actually they were all wrong,"" Farage said.

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/voter-id-rights-cases/index.html	"The pressure is on to resolve key issues in a timely manner as courts are often reluctant to make legal changes too close to Election Day. ""It's very important not to disrupt the machinery and the administration of the voting process,"" says Edward Foley of the Moritz College of Law at the Ohio State University. ""Judicial rulings too soon to the election can be disruptive, and in the past the Supreme Court has made it very clear that it doesn't want that disruption.""Here's a look at what's unfolding in some key 2016 battlegrounds:North CarolinaIn the coming days, Supreme Court justices will rule on an emergency petition filed by North Carolina asking the court to allow provisions of the state's omnibus 2013 election law to remain in effect. The law boosts voter ID requirements, restricts early voting days and eliminates same-day registration.Challengers include civil rights groups and the Department of Justice that won a major victory in July when a federal appeals court ruled the law had been enacted with a racially discriminatory intent. Furious with that ruling, lawyers for the state have filed a petition with the Supreme Court asking it to freeze parts of the appeals court opinion now so as not to disrupt the election. In court papers, lead lawyer Paul Clement blasts the opinion as ""extraordinary."" ""Mere months before a general presidential election, the Fourth Circuit has invalidated several provisions of North Carolina election law as intentionally discriminatory even though the court did not disturb the District Courts' extensive and exhaustive factual findings that those provisions will not actually have a discriminatory impact on minority voters,"" Clement wrote. The Supreme Court's response to the emergency petition in the case could send a signal to the lower courts currently considering similar challenges to laws passed by Republican-led legislatures and challenged by civil rights groups. North Carolina's bid will be made more difficult by the fact that there are currently only eight justices on the bench. The late Justice Antonin Scalia might well have voted in the state's favor, but as things stand, the court could end up deadlocked in a 4-4 tie which would leave the lower court ruling intact. Parties on both sides argue that their position does the most to maintain the status quo until courts have the time to rule on the merits of the case. In his brief, Clement says, for example, that while he thinks the entire appeals court opinion should be put on hold, he is only asking for relief for those parts he argues would alter the status quo. The Voter ID provision, for example, was used in the primary. ""North Carolina should not be forced to scramble mere months before the general election to rejigger settled election plans at the Fourth Circuit's command,"" Clement wrote. Challengers to the law say that the appeals court ruling came down in plenty of time for the state to make the necessary adjustments to prevent confusion. Allison Riggs, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, says that since that ruling, North Carolina has already made adjustments and trained county officials on how to run the election in accordance with the opinion. ""The only scrambling that would occur is if the Supreme Court put the lower court opinion on hold, "" Riggs said.WisconsinLitigation is also percolating in Wisconsin concerning challenges to the state's election laws passed by GOP-led legislature. Just this week, a federal appeals court denied a request to freeze a lower court opinion that struck down parts of Wisconsin's election laws including a provision that cutback early voting hours.   ""What this means,"" election law expert Rick Hasen wrote on his election law blog, is that ""Wisconsin needs to go ahead and let localities continue to set voting hours and otherwise implement the judge's order.""  Dale Ho of the ACLU praised the decision. ""The court's ruling will ensure that early voting opportunities, which the state had tried to eliminate, will remain available in November which means that more people will be able to participate."" After the decision, a spokesman for Attorney General Brad Schimel announced that the state would not ask the Supreme Court for a stay of the ruling. But the full panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering a separate request concerning the state's voter ID law. The provision was softened by a district court judge, but a three-judge panel of the appeals court issued a stay of that ruling. Now challengers are hoping the full court will lift the stay. ""The big question is still out there, and that is whether or not this voter ID law which if left in place will undoubtedly prevent some people from voting remains on the books for November,"" said Ho.Ohio's 'Golden Week'On Tuesday, a federal appeals court ruled that Ohio does not have to reinstate Golden Week -- the week-long period in the state where in previous cycles voters could both register and cast an early ballot at the same time. The ruling was a big blow for Democrats who have relied on Golden Week in the past. In May, a federal district court found that the elimination of Golden Week imposed a ""modest burden"" on the right to vote for African Americans and said the state's justifications for the law ""fail to outweigh that burden.""  In-person early voting will still be available for 29 days. ""Bad for voters,"" Marc Elias, the general counsel to Hillary for America -- which is involved in the case, tweeted.  ""Bad for voting rights.""Ohio's Secretary of State Jon Husted defended the state law -- Senate Bill 238 -- that cut back early in-person voting from 35 days to 29 days. Tuesday's 2-1 ruling by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit court reverses the district court opinion. The appeals court held that Ohio was a ""national leader"" when it comes to early voting opportunities and that the law that cut back early in person voting opportunities by six days was still ""really quite generous."" The Democratic Party of Ohio could appeal the decision to a larger panel of judges on the Appeals Court or the Supreme Court. "	Clock running out on challenges to voting rights cases in key states
