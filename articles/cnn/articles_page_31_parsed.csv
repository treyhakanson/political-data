READ: Team Trump already filled with Washington insiders Trump's contemplation of Bannon as chief of staff comes as his presidential transition team is feverishly ramping up its efforts to build out an administration after his surprising win Tuesday. It also highlights how Trump is contending with competing impulses as to whether he should fill the ranks of his White House with the right-wing figures who energized his campaign or more establishment figures experienced in the ways of Washington.Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman who has become a close confidante of Trump's in the final months of the campaign, is also reportedly in the running for the top White House post. Priebus is an experienced Washington politico with establishment credo who has also earned Trump's trust as he put the weight of the RNC's ground and data operation behind Trump's candidacy, and stuck by Trump's side through the controversies that dogged his campaign. Priebus and Trump have talked about the chief of staff position, according to a source with knowledge of the transition process who added that ""I think he (Priebus) really wants it.""The New York Times first reported Thursday that Bannon was being considered for the post, though the has previously said he was not interested in joining the administration should Trump be elected.Both Priebus and Bannon have traveled with Trump in the final months of his campaign. Bannon in the final week of the campaign was frequently spotted in the wings at Trump rallies at the side of Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law who has helped manage the presidential campaign.Bannon has also been a major force behind some of Trump's more controversial stunts, including when Trump held an impromptu press event with women who had accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault and misconduct. Bannon was spotted in the back of the room smiling as reporters were led in for the debate night surprise.WATCH: Trump campaign CEO accused of domestic violence in 1996Scrambling to fill jobs; Trump to meet with transition teamThe President-elect's transition team is rushing to fill top cabinet positions as well as the hundreds of posts that require a security clearance.A transition source told CNN on Thursday that Trump's transition team will brief the newly-elected president on their planning for the transition to a new administration. As those staffers work to vet the individuals who will serve in the 15 executive departments, they are also finding themselves competing with lobbying firms, which are scrambling to hire Republicans in Washington who can do business with the new administration. Many of those K Street firms have spent months hiring more Democrats with the assumption in mind that Clinton would win the election.That adds to the Trump transition team's already more limited pool of qualified contenders as they face a long list of Republicans who have rebuked Trump. A GOP official who is helping to find candidates for some of the 4,000 government jobs the transition will eventually have to fill said the work is made harder by the competition from K Street, which is also working to scoop up 30-something staffers on Capitol Hill who are a prime target for transition efforts. Adding to that, there are still some young staffers who appear to be resisting opportunities to work in a Trump administration for fear it will hurt their careers. No contact with key agenciesThe Trump transition team still remains in the early stages of its efforts and has yet to reach out to some key executive departments, including the State Department, Pentagon and Justice Department. Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said Thursday that while the department stands ""ready to engage with the designated transition leaders...to the best of my knowledge that has not yet happened."" The State Department's deputy spokesman Mark Toner also said the Trump transition team has not yet put a single envoy in touch with the diplomatic agency to discuss transition plans. And while the Justice Department expected Trump envoys on Wednesday, officials from the transition team are now expected to meet with officials at that department on Monday."

The photo was snapped by former President Bill Clinton, who was there as well.It is the first time the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee has been seen outside the election bubble since she conceded the race to Donald Trump early Wednesday.""She seemed as well as anybody could be expected after such a crazy, crazy experience,"" Gerster recollected to CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront"" Thursday. ""She couldn't have seemed any nicer or, you know, kinder and gracious to me.""Gerster said she was trekking a path she hikes every day when she found the former first couple and immediately flashed an ""awkward, huge grinning smile"" -- or, as she put it, ""fan-girling.""Gerster told Clinton about how proud she was to vote for her, and how she very much wanted to hug Clinton after Election Day, which she did on Thursday.""She was taking a nice, peaceful hike through the woods. I don't think she wanted to talk serious politics,"" Gerster said.Gerster told CNN earlier on Thursday that she posted the photograph to ""make people smile.""""It was a very dark day yesterday, I just feel like the fact I ran into Hillary while I was trying to clear my head, was sort of like a hopeful sign,"" she said.

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/donald-trump-paul-ryan-meeting/index.html	"Now, he's putting his differences behind them and embraced the President-elect at a midday meeting on Capitol Hill to chart out plans to help him enact a sweeping conservative agenda.Trump, Ryan, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and future First Lady Melania Trump ate lunch at the Capitol Hill Club and then headed to the speaker's office for a meeting. Ryan rolled out the red carpet for Trump, taking him out to his balcony in his Capitol office, which overlooks the Washington Monument, and the platform under construction where Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president. Ryan also pointed out Trump's new hotel which recently opened and was visible from the balcony.Sitting at a conference table flanked by Pence and Melania Trump, Ryan described ""a fantastic, productive meeting."" He told reporters he and the President-elect discussed how ""we're going to hit the ground running"" and then, borrowing a phrase from Trump, said they would ""make America great again.""Trump talked about his eagerness to join forces with the speaker to begin implementing new policies. ""We can't get started fast enough. And whether its health care or immigration, so many different things, we will be working on them very rapidly,"" Trump said.   Later on Thursday, Ryan told Fox News' Bret Baier he looked forward to working with Trump on his administration's platform.""Being in Congress without having the White House has been extremely frustrating because we haven't been able to get things done,"" he said. ""We have a unified Republican government. We can actually get things done for the people of this country. We now have that.""Ryan refused to say whether he agreed with Trump's stance of building a border wall, which is a stance he campaigned on heavily during the election.""I'm in favor of securing the border and I do believe that we need to have physical barriers on the border,"" Ryan said. ""I would refer to the experts on what is the right way to actually secure the border. And remember, it's not just border security, you have to have interior enforcement.""A crucial timeThursday's sitdown came at a crucial time for both men. Trump started his day at a historic handoff meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House, preparing to take the reins and roll back some of the signature accomplishments put in place after eight years of a Democrat holding the highest office. Ryan is still under fire from fellow Republicans for his decision not to defend the his party's presidential nominee after leaked video tapes surfaced showing Trump making graphic comments about women. Even before that he broke with Trump on several occasions. Ryan faces a vote next Tuesday to keep his job as speaker and appears in good position to keep his gavel. But an enthusiastic vote of confidence from the President-elect could help smooth over ill feelings within the party and ward off any potential protest vote against him.Pressed on Fox News if he was worried about a challenge from conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus in next week's vote for another term as speaker, Ryan said, ""No, we're excited about going forward and about working on executing an agenda so the Democrats are the ones who are in turmoil.  The Republicans are the ones who are unified and we're excited about working with our president-elect with a good transition so we hit the ground running.""Pence is a friend and former colleague from his time serving in the House as representative from Indiana. The meeting was the first face-to-face get-together since the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, although the speaker noted Wednesday he spoke twice with Trump since he was declared the winner.Trump calls Obama 'a very good man' after historic White House meetingAfter the brief Capitol tour with the speaker, Trump and Pence walked across the Capitol for a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who, despite tough challenges in races across the country, held onto the GOP majority in the upper chamber. McConnell said they went over the transition and ""issues that we obviously agree on"" and called it ""a first-class meeting.""A day earlier at his post-election press conference, McConnell split with the incoming president, saying he didn't plan to move to enact term limits and disagreed with Trump's criticism of NATO.The speaker, just like most everyone else in official Washington, was surprised by the reality star turned candidate's upset Tuesday, but was quick to give him credit for tapping into a sentiment other politicians didn't appear to grasp.""Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected with -- he connected in ways with people no one else did. He turned politics on its head and now Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government,"" Ryan said Wednesday at a news conference in his Wisconsin home town.Ryan also said Trump helped GOP candidates across the country get elected and declared he ""earned a mandate."" Along with the presidential victory, Republicans maintained their control over both chambers in Congress. Paul Ryan's next movesWhile Trump didn't lay out many specific policy details during his campaign, Ryan worked diligently on a platform, dubbed ""A Better Way,"" for the GOP nominee to use. It includes major plans to overhaul the tax code, repeal and replace Obamacare, scale back government regulations, address poverty and strengthen the military."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/mexico-reaction-donald-trump/index.html	"""A Temblar"" (Time to Tremble) blared one bold headline just hours after Donald Trump was declared president-elect of the United States.Some of the more tabloid-style papers carried headlines with expletives and depicted Trump with a clown nose.  The news was a stunning shock for a country where the vast majority of people expected a Hillary Clinton victory.World reacts to Trump victory""He's going to screw us all,"" said one newspaper vendor as they waited for the fast-moving cars to come to a brief stop at the intersection so they could sell more papers.""We're going to have bad relations with the United States now,"" said another vendor.Many Mexicans say Trump catapulted himself to the presidency, in large part, by insulting Mexican immigrants with racist and xenophobic speech.Trump has vowed to build a wall along the southern US border and force Mexico to pay for the multibillion-dollar construction, vowed to round up and deport millions of undocumented immigrants and threatened to tear up the NAFTA trade agreement.The news of Donald Trump's election happened to coincide with thousands of people marching in protest demanding stronger social programs for Mexico's poorest workers. Jose Torres Hernandez, 62, was one of those protesters and Trump's election weighed heavily on him as he marched.Torres is a farmer in the northern Mexico state of Nayarit. He said he's crossed illegally into the United States many times to find work in the United States to pick fruits and vegetables on farms.Torres dismissed the idea that a wall could keep him out of the United States to find a job that will help feed his family.""We have to find a way to feed our needs. We are not there to rob our neighbor. We are going to win so we can sustain our families,"" Torres said. ""He (Trump) will cut our throats in the sense of trying to end our path to the United States. And I see that as bad.""Armando Flores Gutierrez, 48, also laughed at the idea of a wall keeping out Mexican immigrants who are looking for manual labor jobs north of the border because they are desperate to feed their families.Can Trump right the ship with Mexico?Flores said he has crossed illegally into the United States at least 25 times since he was 16 years old.  He said he's worked farm fields picking watermelons, onions and grapes from Arizona and California to Virginia and Idaho. He also said he's never been caught by Border Patrol agents as he moved across the border in the Arizona desert.Flores said he fears Trump's election will have a negative impact on Mexico's economy but also said the idea of removing millions of undocumented workers from the United States would cripple the American economy. ""If he tries to remove all of the Mexicans in the United States, Donald Trump will realize what a huge mistake that is and how much the US economy depends on Mexican immigrants,"" said Flores.Even though there are few supporters of Donald Trump in Mexico, they do exist. Bill Bonilla, 68, is a retired resident of Mexico City and he says he understands why Trump's rhetoric of sealing off the border resonates with American voters.""Mexico in recent years has seen a horrible increase in crime of all kinds,"" Bonilla told CNN. ""This is why Trump wants to build the wall.""In his victory speech Wednesday, Trump said: ""I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.""Mexican government officials quickly gathered on Wednesday to reassure Mexican citizens that the election of Trump would not destabilize the country's economy. In the hours after Trump was declared the winner, the value of the Mexican peso dropped nearly 12% against the US dollar, but by late Wednesday, the peso was beginning to stabilize.President Enrique Peña Nieto has endured scathing criticism for the way he handled his September meeting with Donald Trump in the middle of the presidential campaign.On Wednesday, the Mexican President avoided any specific discussions of the most controversial issues that Trump vows to push during his time in office. Peña Nieto said he's agreed to meet again with Trump before the new president is sworn in January.""Mexico and the US are allies, associates and neighbors. When Mexico does well, the US does well. And when the US does well, Mexico does well,"" Peña Nieto said.And Mexico's foreign minister also sent a signal that Mexico would be open to, not dismantling NAFTA, but to modernizing the trade agreement.""We are willing to talk about this with the new (American) government and with Canada as well,"" said Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu."

Barron Trump will become the first since John F.

""The Obamas are staying here so she can finish school there. There's a chance Barron could go there, too. There could be overlap there,"" she said.But when it comes to navigating the challenges of raising her young son in the White House, Brower said that Melania could do like her predecessors, and simply ask another first lady for advice.

""He will take the agreement, review it, send it to Congress, demand from the Iranians to restore few issues or change few issues, and there will be a discussion.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trumps-america/index.html	"In Trump's America, foreign Muslims will be banned from the US, Syrian refugees sent back to their war-torn country and free trade agreements torn to shreds. And, of course, the US will build a ""great wall"" on the US-Mexico border, which Mexico will have to pay for.In Trump's America, the US attorney general will push to indict the president's general election rival.That's if everything goes as the Republican nominee has promised during his insurgent presidential campaign.The newly-minted President-elect is now faced with the task of turning his hardline policy proposals into concrete legislative proposals and ultimately law. But with many of his more extreme proposals opposed even by some Republicans in Congress, Trump will face an uphill climb to implement the very proposals that drew his most ardent supporters to his insurgent campaign.His challenges with uniting the American public behind his proposals were on clear display Wednesday as protests broke out from Boston to Los Angeles.Should he succeed, though, in implementing the policies that carried him to victory in the Republican primaries and ultimately the general election, Trump would usher in a radical reimagining of the United States from its laws to its values.Trump's very election broke a set of barriers, becoming the first billionaire president and the first to have never before served in public office or the military. And while his business experience was a key part of his appeal to a broad swath of Americans, they will also raise unprecedented questions of conflict of interest and could pose challenges to his ability to sell legislative proposals that could affect his personal bottom line.Beyond his businessman credo, it seems voters were most drawn to Trump's promises to shake up Washington and implement radical change in every sector of government.ObamacareTrump has repeatedly promised to ""immediately repeal and replace"" Obamacare, to start. That is something congressional Republicans have been eager to accomplish, but unable to without a Republican president. But even with Trump in office, repealing and crafting a replacement for the law will be an arduous task in Congress, where Senate Democrats will fight the slim Republican majority's efforts.It's still unclear exactly what Trump's replacement will look like. He has vowed it will be ""terrific"" and said it will involve knocking down state insurance lines and incentivizing the establishment of health savings accounts.ImmigrationEven as Trump has unrelentingly promised at his rallies to build a wall on the US southern border with Mexico, his plan does not yet appear to have the backing of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who repeatedly dodged a question on whether he supports the wall.""I want to achieve border security the way that's most effective,"" he told CNN's Manu Raju Wednesday when asked about it.The border wall proposal is just one of a slew of controversial immigration policies proffered by the real estate mogul, who launched his campaign by labeling undocumented Mexican immigrants criminals and ""rapists."" He has also vowed to deport all undocumented immigrants. In the latest iteration of that policy, he focused on the deportation of criminal undocumented immigrants, but he has not forsaken his pledge to deport all estimated 11 million who currently reside here illegally.TradeOn trade, the Republican nominee has vowed to renegotiate or completely withdraw the US from NAFTA, the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that Trump has dubbed the ""worst trade deal in history."" He could single-handedly do that without Congress, just as he could stymie the Trans-Pacific Partnership he has railed against. He has also pledged to go after Chinese currency manipulation and impose additional tariffs of as much as 35% on certain foreign countries and on US companies that move their factories abroad -- which could see consumer goods rise by that same percentage.Trump's presidency could radically alter the increasingly interconnected global economy, which has shot in the direction of more free trade, not less, in recent years. His presidency could usher in a more protectionist era.TerrorismTrump will also seek to rethink how the US combats terrorists, tossing aside the attempts by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama to bring Muslim-Americans and other Muslim countries into the fold, rather than risk alienating them.Trump has said he would seek to work with Muslim countries eager to join in the fight against ISIS, but he has also stoked Islamophobic sentiment in the US and proclaimed, ""Islam hates us.""His rhetoric on the campaign trail and policy proposals on that matter could prove a roadblock to those efforts of increased cooperation with Muslim majority countries. During his presidential bid, Trump called for the creation of a national database to register all Muslims living in the US, called for targeted surveillance of US mosques.And last December, he famously called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" a proposal he has never explicitly retracted. Trump has since focused on his ""extreme vetting"" proposal, which would include a ban on individuals from terror-prone countries, though he has not outlined which countries will be included in that list.It is still unclear exactly how he will take on ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Trump has at times said he is open to sending in tens of thousands of US troops and consistently vowed to ""bomb the s***t out of ISIS."" At other times, he's said he would like to keep the US out of the civil war in Syria, and instead favored ceding regional influence to Russia.He has promised to work toward a closer relationship with Russia, which has ensconced itself as a top US adversary in recent years, and has promised to renegotiate the Iran deal, which he has trashed. Economic policyTrump's economic proposals have focused on tearing down government regulations he views as overly burdensome on US businesses -- which would include undoing environmental protections erected under the Obama administration -- and reforming the US tax code.But a cloud of uncertainty hangs over how the whopping across-the-board tax cuts he has promised will affect the US deficit. While he has promised to keep the proposals revenue-neutral, tax policy experts have said Trump's proposals could add billions, if not trillions, of dollars to the US debt.Ultimately, many in Washington and across the country are now wondering how much of Trump's campaign promises will the soon-to-be president stick to once he walks into the Oval Office and the Situation Room.Beyond the campaign promises and incendiary rhetoric during his 17 months campaigning for his job as president, Trump also repeatedly touted his willingness to compromise and reach ""deals.""Pressed on his immigration proposals in March on Fox News, Trump offered a simple reply: ""Everything is negotiable."""

""That's right, I said world champion and Cleveland in the same sentence.""""That's what we're talking about when we talk about hope and change,"" the President quipped over laughter from the crowd.After the victory in June, Obama, whose love of basketball has been well-documented, called Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue, telling him he hoped the team would ""have a chance to come by the White House before I leave office.""Lue responded: ""We're definitely going to do that,"" adding, ""We're going to schedule it when you're in the White House, for sure."" The trip by the Cavaliers was planned weeks in advance to coincide with the team's game Friday night against the Washington Wizards.The Cavaliers are led by Finals MVP LeBron James, who endorsed Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, and appeared with her at a rally in Cleveland the Sunday before Election Day. James took to Instagram on Wednesday to write, ""Parents and leaders of our children please let them know they can still change the world for the better! Don't lose a bit of faith! They're our future and we must remain stronger than ever!!""Another Cavalier, J.R.

Smith wrote.James and Smith aren't the only Trump opponents who were at the White House Thursday. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a fierce rival of Trump's from the primary, attended the ceremony. Kasich rebuked the President-elect by casting his ballot for Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nominee.Kasich told reporters that Obama and Clinton were ""inspirational"" for the way they accepted the election outcome, saying he was praying for Trump's success.When it comes to attire for the White House visit, the President made clear early on that shirts were not optional. He urged Lue in June to ""tell J.R. and everybody to put on a shirt"" after Smith was seen bare-chested for days after the victory. ""He can't just be wandering around without a shirt for, like, the whole week,"" the President said.Obama on Thursday gave special thanks to Smith's shirt for ""showing up"" to the event.""I wasn't sure if it was going to make an appearance today,"" Obama joked.
