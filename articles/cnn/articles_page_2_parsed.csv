By ""it,"" we mean a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure over a 10-year period. To date, there are few details on what the plan would actually look like, but Trump says it will spur economic growth and create thousands of jobs. The President-elect's website mentions the desire to fix the nation's airports, highways, bridges and pipelines -- but the blueprint for how to do it is not yet clear.Based on data from American Association of State Highway and Transportation officials, a $1 trillion investment could cover the cost of repairing and expanding the national highway system and aging bridges.However, the American Society of Civil Engineers says while a $1 trillion investment is significant, ""it still falls short ""of the $3.6 trillion needed to restore all of the nation's infrastructure.""There's bipartisan support for a plan. Following Trump's win, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi expressed a willingness to work with the President-elect on infrastructure, saying in a statement: ""We can work together to quickly pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill. But on Capitol Hill, the divide is always over how to pay for it.""Republican Rep. Mark Meadows told CNN there is an appetite to work with the President-elect on his plan.""Well, it's a very aggressive plan,"" Meadows says. ""What I've come to admire about President-elect Trump is that he sets a bold vision and then he figures out ways to accomplish it. ""Last December, Congress passed a $300 billion highway bill for projects spanning six years. The final bill was much lower than the $478 billion plan President Barack Obama proposed, so there's skepticism about whether Congress would stomach a $1 trillion plan.""It's the way that you pay for it. You can't just raise taxes because eventually that bill will come due. So how will we pay for the infrastructure bill that was the major disagreement there,"" Meadows said.Meadows said if Trump's plan can be done without burdening the deficit, Republicans will be on board. But for years, lawmakers have struggled to come up with alternative ways to fund infrastructure without raising taxes or adding to the deficit.Trump hopes to entice the private sector to fund these projects with tax credits.Critics, however, say the projects need to generate profits to sweeten the deal for private investors and that could mean more toll roads and bridges.""There will be a lot of local opposition to turning roads into toll roads just to do maintenance,"" said Michael Sargent, a research assistant at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank. ""Throwing tax credits at the problem would tend to move investment to new things rather than fixing the old things and that tends to be detrimental in the long run.""For now, Republicans are publicly showing support for making Trump's big-ticket infrastructure plan a reality. Privately, industry insiders and people on Capitol Hill say because of the hefty price tag, Trump likely wont get his wish. If Trump sticks to his guns, it could become his first battle with his own party."

Police are interviewing him about his whereabouts since Tuesday, authorities said. Officials are unsure of the circumstances surrounding his disappearance and couldn't provide details of exactly how he was located. Conyers, 21, was last seen Tuesday afternoon by his roommate at their apartment near the University of Houston, where Conyers attends college.When the younger Conyers' disappeared, his girlfriend, Daisha Lewis, told CNN that he seemed like a happy person and she cannot understand what has happened.""He wouldn't do anything irrational and especially with not telling me,"" she said. ""Like he tells me everything. I see him every day.""Lewis talked to CNN on Thursday about the puzzling clues that emerged since Conyers went missing:Message from Conyers' account: 'I'm OK'Lewis said she last saw Conyers on Monday. On Wednesday morning she went to his apartment and found his bedroom out of its usual perfect order.Clothes were on the bed next to a backpack. His wallet was there, pictures were in an envelope, his primary cell phone was cradled in its charger. Nothing appeared missing, except Conyers and his old second phone.The next morning at 10:30, Lewis received a direct message from Conyers' Twitter account, saying, ""I'm OK.""Lewis, who was at his apartment, asked him to call. She told him people were worried.A reply came an hour later. It said, ""Everyone come meet me at the UBC,"" referring to a student center on campus, Lewis said. Lewis, Conyers' roommate, and other friends began the short drive over. But Lewis thought something was odd about the tweet, so she went back to the apartment.When she got back to the bedroom, Conyers' ID was now gone, as was his debit card, she said. Someone had taken more clothes out of a drawer.The roommate realized Conyers' house keys were missing. His car and bicycle were still at the apartment.He suddenly shaved his beardConyers had spent at least a year growing a beard, but sometime before Tuesday evening, he shaved it off.Roommate Chet Ball told reporters and CNN affiliate KTRK that Conyers was in the kitchen about 6 p.m. He was cooking and covering his face with his shirt.Ball thought it was strange, but chalked it up to stress.""School can be hard on a person,"" he said Thursday.The roommate asked Conyers how he was and reportedly was told, ""I had a crazy day"" before he went to his room. It was the last time he was seen. Conyers didn't go to work Tuesday, Lewis told CNN. When she went by his job and asked what time he left, she was told he never showed up.A second phoneConyers had an old iPhone that he uses for music. Lewis looked at user-related data for the tweets that were sent and saw that the IP address was the same as the Wi-Fi for the apartment. She thinks Conyers, or someone else, was in the parking lot using the phone while she was inside his bedroom. She has no idea why he would take that phone.""Honestly, it doesn't make sense to me,"" she said. ""It had no service.""Computer clues?Conyers had shared his passwords with Lewis. But he apparently recently changed the one on his primary phone.But she was able to get onto his laptop.She checked his phone messages there. Nothing suspicious.She checked his FaceTime. Nothing suspicious.She checked to see if he bought a plane ticket or a bus ticket. Nothing suspicious.She checked his browser history. Most of it was basketball related.She checked his bank account. Nothing suspicious.Police were called on Wednesday, after Lewis and Conyers' friends came back to discover the missing ID and debit card. They have the laptop. What has his family said?John Conyers is the longest-serving active member of the US House of Representatives, representing a district that includes a large portion of Detroit. He has been in Congress for more than 51 years. Rep. Conyers notified the FBI and told The Detroit News ""I'm very worried. It's very unlike him. He's a very stable young guy.""A spokeswoman for the House said: ""Yesterday, Rep. John Conyers, Jr. and his wife Monica Conyers learned of the disappearance of their son, Carl Conyers, who is a student at the University of Houston. Rep. Conyers and his family ask for privacy as they work through this situation of uncertainty and ask that anyone with knowledge of their son's whereabouts, contact the Houston Police Department immediately."" Lewis told CNN that Monica Conyers was on her way to Houston but wasn't sure whether his father could break away from congressional business.Monica Conyers arrived Thursday afternoon, KTRK reported.""I just want my son to come home,"" she told the station. ""If something happened, if you have my son, just let him go. ... Carl, if something has happened to you, just come home.""She told KTRK she last spoke to her son on Tuesday. He had no reason to run away, she said. Carl Conyers' older brother, John Conyers III, told CNN late Thursday that the two talked on Monday. ""The last time I spoke with him, everything was fine. We were joking as we normally do.""Carl, a leader with the campus Black Business Student Association, was to attend an event on the day he went missing. Carl had been planning it for more than a month, John Conyers III said.John Conyers III earlier posted a message to Instagram, along with a picture of the two siblings. He asked Carl to get in touch.What are officials saying?Houston police issued a missing persons flier at the time of Conyers' disappearance and the FBI assisted in the search, Shauna Dunlap of the agency's Houston office said."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-donald-trump-consideration/index.html	"Sessions, 69, is currently serving his fourth Senate term and was the first sitting senator to endorse Trump. During Trump's campaign, he served as a key validator from within the Republican establishment at critical times and urged Republicans to coalesce around Trump.Sessions had been in consideration for several Cabinet positions, and as one of Trump's earliest and most loyal supporters.""Jeff has been a highly respected member of the U.S. Senate for 20 years,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He is a world-class legal mind and considered a truly great Attorney General and US Attorney in the state of Alabama. Jeff is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him.""United by their hardline stance against illegal immigration, Sessions helped Trump craft his campaign's national security policy. His top policy adviser, Stephen Miller, also joined Trump's campaign. Sessions dogged by old allegations of racismSessions was one of President Barack Obama's fiercest opponents, voting against his nominees to the Supreme Court from his post on the Judiciary Committee and opposing Obama's other major domestic initiatives.He's broken ranks with Republicans, as well, voting against the bank bailout amid the 2008 economic collapse. The former US attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and Alabama attorney general isn't without controversy. His appointment to a federal district court by then-President Ronald Reagan sank when a former Justice Department employee testified that Sessions had made racially tinged remarks. Donald Trump's transition moves to right the shipHe had denounced the 1965 Voting Rights Act and had labeled the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP ""un-American"" and said the organizations ""forced civil rights down the throats of people.""A black Justice Department staffer said Sessions had called him ""boy"" and claimed he had thought the Ku Klux Klan ""were OK until I found out they smoked pot.""  Sessions was mentioned as a potential running mate for Trump and advised him on his selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who is now helming Trump's transition effort. In May, Trump called Sessions a ""fantastic person.""The Alabama senator said during a taping of Politico's ""Off Message"" podcast that same month that ""the leaders in all parties tend to adjust to reality. They just have to or they won't remain in office ... Already, many are sensing it.""Sessions has also defended one of Trump's most controversial policy proposals: His ban on Muslims traveling into the United States. Trump offers Flynn job of national security advisor""He simply said, and the way I understand it is, that we should slow down. Let's have a pause and begin to analyze where the threats are coming from,"" Sessions told CNN in June, amid questions about whether Trump's position was shifting. ""We have a toxic ideology, hopefully very small within Islam; certainly most people, most Muslims don't agree with this violent, jihadist approach. And we need to figure out a better way to identify that.""In the past, Sessions has signaled support for a no-fly zone in Syria. ""We need to consider the political ramifications. What's happening to Europe as a result of refugee flows is just incredible. Three senior European officials told me the European Union is threatened by this, the very existence of it,"" he said in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in January 2016. He has also critiqued Obama's handling of Syria. ""The situation in Syria is a colossal disaster. I do not believe it had to happen. I believe a wise statesman could have foreseen some of the difficulties we're facing today. And we should have been more cautious and careful in our declarations of how we expect Syria to develop over the years. It hasn't developed like President Obama projected. And disaster has been the situation,"" Sessions said at a September hearing. ""It seems to me that the problem is that, with our support, ISIS is being damaged, but they're not utterly destroyed."" Like Trump, Sessions has questioned whether European countries are contributing enough to NATO. ""I am wondering do they have a will to survive themselves and/or have they just gotten in the habit of expecting us to step up to the plate to fund their defense. It is an unacceptable thing,"" he said in March. "	Donald Trump picks Jeff Sessions for attorney general	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]
3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/trump-asks-rep-mike-pompeo-to-be-cia-director-sources-say/index.html	"""He has served our country with honor and spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens,"" Trump said Friday in a statement. ""He will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies.""Pompeo announced Friday evening that he accepted the nomination, saying in a statement that he's ""honored"" and ""humbled"" by the president-elect's decision.""This was a difficult decision. I have genuinely loved representing the people of Kansas in Congress -- working to make our community stronger and more prosperous,"" he wrote. ""But ultimately the opportunity to lead the world's finest intelligence warriors, who labor tirelessly to keep this nation and Kansas safe, is a call to service I cannot ignore.""Pompeo has made his mark during his three terms in the House as a conservative voice on national security issues. Speaker John Boehner viewed him as a rising star and tapped him to serve on the House Intelligence Committee and the Select Committee on Benghazi, both posts that usually go to more senior members.  He also got a coveted seat on the Energy and Commerce panel and has proposed measures regarding energy production.He staked a tougher line on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton than some other Republicans. Pompeo was one of a handful of conservatives who argued House Benghazi committee chairman Trey Gowdy did not go far enough in his report on Clinton earlier this year.The Kansas lawmaker was a strong critic of the Iran nuclear deal and introduced several bills focused on security concerns about the Iranian government, including one bill raising concerns about the cooperation between Russia and Iran.Pompeo backed Sen. Marco Rubio in the primary and criticized Trump from the right, but later developed a relationship with the Trump campaign. The campaign called him every once in a while to get advice on key national security issues, and during the vice presidential debate, Pompeo was a surrogate for Vice President-elect Mike Pence.After the elections, Pompeo met with Trump, including earlier this week in New York where they talked about the job. Trump seems to have trusted his gut that Pompeo was best suited for the role. Pompeo met with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Pence, the leader of Trump's transition, at the Capitol Thursday. He declined to comment on their meeting as he left. The Kansas Republican becomes the first member of the House tapped by Trump, although Republican Reps. Jeb Hensarling and Tom Price both met with the President-elect this week and are being mentioned for other Cabinet positions.One of Pompeo's close friends and mentors on Capitol Hill was Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence panel. Rogers, who some considered as a possible pick for the CIA post, left the Trump transition team earlier this week after the President-elect removed those on the committee with ties to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.Democrats pounceDemocrats were quick to paint Pompeo as a member who touted the party line, a quality they worried about for a nominee for the top intelligence post.""The Department of Justice and the CIA need nonpartisan leaders the American people can trust implicitly. Yet Congressman Mike Pompeo, a leading cheerleader of the Benghazi witch hunt, is now being asked to fill one of the most serious and sober national security positions there is,"" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Friday. Before joining Congress, Pompeo graduated first in his class from the US Military Academy at West Point. Pompeo was a classmate of Sen. Ted Cruz's at Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review -- although he declined to support Cruz in the Republican primaries.The selection of Pompeo rounds out a trio of national security picks Trump has made -- including Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn for national security advisor that were announced Friday. Pompeo had considered running against Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran in the Senate Republican primary this year, but the Senate Republicans scrambled to prevent that. The National Republican Senatorial Committee hired a retired FBI agent to dig up dirt against him. And numerous senators, as well as Speaker Paul Ryan, urged him to stay out. Pompeo ultimately released a scathing statement when he decided not to run.Democratic groups blasted Pompeo's selection Friday. They cited Pompeo's allegations in 2013 that Muslim Americans do not speak out enough against terror attacks and could therefore be ""potentially complicit"" in those attacks.""That mindset is horribly wrong when it comes to views of civil rights and civil liberties of Muslim Americans. Statements like those also further propaganda of radical terrorists, who, right now, are celebrating the election of Donald Trump, because they believe it will bring about a war of religions,"" said Jon Soltz, chairman of the liberal group VoteVets.org.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/kfile-flynn-tweets/index.html	"A CNN KFile review of Flynn's Twitter account finds that the retired lieutenant general, who once served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, tweeted routinely with members of the so-called alt-right movement, going so far as to endorse a book by one controversial figure who regularly makes offensive comments.Flynn faced criticism in July when he retweeted an anti-Semitic message. Flynn said the retweet was an accident and deleted the message. Emails to a spokesperson for President-elect Trump and Flynn seeking comment were not returned. A follow up question to Flynn asking who managed his Twitter account also went unreturned.Tweeting with the fringe:Flynn regularly interacted on Twitter with members of the alt-right movement — a far right ideological group whose members primarily use social media as platform to spread their message.On 15 different occasions, Flynn tagged in his tweets alt-right figure Mike Cernovich, who regularly tweets inflammatory and unfounded conspiracy theories.Cernovich runs a website called Danger and Play, which has pushed conspiracy theories that the Orlando Pulse shooter did not act alone and that Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman was part of a sex cult.  Flynn urged his followers to follow Cernovich, tweeting in October, ""Follow Mike @Cernovich He has a terrific book, Gorilla Mindset. Well worth the read. @realDonaldTrump will win on 8 NOV!!!""Cernovich once wrote in a since-deleted tweet: ""Have you guys ever tried 'raping' a girl without using force? Try it. It's basically impossible. Date rape does not exist.""  Last February, Cernovich tweeted: ""Not being a slut is the only proven way to avoid AIDS. If you love black women, slut shame them."" In July Cernovich tweeted, ""The 'alt-right' hasn't killed anyone, but #BlackLivesMatter regularly slaughters the innocent. Know the real threat. Think! #Dallas""In late October, Flynn linked to a Cernovich story titled  ""How to Save Twitter,"" where he argued harassment wasn't a big issue on Twitter and said ""the company is being run by rabid SJWs [social justice warriors] who don't care about users."" The article included a tweet of Cernovich calling a woman raising awareness about the herpes virus ""ugly and has herpes.""Flynn wrote of the story, ""I totally agree...Citizen journalism is the new future for truth because truth fears no questions. @Cernovich @IngrahamAngle #TruthMatters.""In August, Flynn retweeted a Breitbart article by alt-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, who was banned from Twitter earlier this year, titled ""Hillary Clinton Is About To Embarass(sic) Herself On The Alt-Right.""  On three occasions, Flynn tagged in his tweets Jared Wyland, an alt-right, anti-Semitic commentator who has tweeted about the ""Liberal Jewish media."" Flynn also shared some of Wyland's tweets that linked to videos, including one Wyland tweeted with the message, ""MUST WATCH: Ex-Muslim schools Obama on how #ISIS is practicing Islam to the letter Choose Reality America!""Flynn shared the video with his own comment, writing, ""Brother Rashid is worth listening to for 8:47. Most powerful message I've heard in a long time.""Some examples of past tweets from Wyland include him writing, ""Liberal Jewish media wants us to embrace diversity. We should start by making sure they're only 1.4% of the media.""Wyland once tweeted at the executive director of the Arizona chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). ""You talked a lot of shit and now you're months away from being tied to a terrorist organization,"" Wyland wrote a recent tweet juxtaposed with a picture of a prisoner at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. ""Tick Tock.""In August, Flynn retweeted a Breitbart article by alt-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, who was banned from Twitter earlier this year, titled ""Hillary Clinton Is About To Embarass(sic) Herself On The Alt-Right.""Tweets about Muslims:Flynn has also shared Islamophobic tweets and sentiments.""In next 24 hours, I dare Arab & Persian world 'leaders' to step up to the plate and declare their Islamic ideology sick and must B healed,"" Flynn tweeted in July of this year following the terrorist attack in Nice, France.In February, Flynn made waves when he tweeted it was rational to fear Muslims.""Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions,"" Flynn said with a link to a video claiming Islamophobia was rational and that Islam wanted 80% of humanity enslaved or exterminated.Sharing false or misleading news:Days before the election, Flynn tweeted a false story claiming the NYPD had found evidence on Anthony Weiner's laptop ""to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life.""In late October, Flynn retweeted a false claim that United Nations Agenda 21, a sustainable development program, would create a one world church where Christianity was prohibited and that choosing nationalism was the only way to stop Clinton.In July, Flynn linked to a tweet that falsely claimed Clinton was ""wearing hijab in solidarity with islamic terrorists."" The picture was from a 2009 trip Clinton took to Pakistan as secretary of state, in which she donned a head covering during a visit to a mosque as a diplomatic courtesy.""This is not showing respect. This is showing disrespect for American Values and Principles. #NeverHillary,"" Flynn wrote in his link to the tweet.In another instance, he linked to a LifeZette article questioning if an Iranian scientist was executed recently because he was exposed on  Clinton's private email server  While Clinton advisers did discuss the scientist over email in July 2010, Clinton also publicly commented on the case of Shahram Amiri at the time, and The New York Times reported at the time that he was a CIA informant."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/trump-offers-flynn-job-of-national-security-adviser/index.html	"The announcement Friday said that Flynn was among three high profile national security positions -- including Mike Pompeo for CIA director and Jeff Sessions for attorney general -- that had been offered and accepted. Flynn, 57, was a top adviser and high-profile surrogate to Trump during his campaign, introducing the President-elect at rallies and serving as a top cheerleader on his hyper-active Twitter feed. ""General Flynn is one of the country's foremost experts on military and intelligence matters and he will be an invaluable asset to me and my administration,"" Trump said in a statement. His appointment won't require Senate confirmation, which is potentially helpful for Trump, as Flynn has a long history of controversial remarks and was fired as President Barack Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Flynn wrote in his 2016 book, ""The Field of Fight,"" that he was booted from Obama's administration by ""censors"" who were unhappy he'd told a congressional committee ""that we were not as safe as we had been a few years back."" However, US officials said Flynn was pushed out because of his contentious management style. Flynn's Twitter feed -- regularly updated with pro-Trump comments -- is another source of potential scrutiny. Flynn apologized in July after retweeting a message that bashed Jewish people. The retweet came after Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said on CNN that Russia was to blame for hacks of the Democratic National Committee. ""The corrupt Democratic machine will do and say anything to get #NeverHillary into power. This is a new low,"" Flynn tweeted. With it, he shared a link to a tweet by a user who had written, "">Cnn implicated. 'The USSR is to blame!' ... Not anymore, Jews. Not anymore."" Flynn later apologized, saying he'd only meant to retweet Mook's remarks. A critical roleFirst created in the early days of the Cold War, the job of national security advisor is seen as critical to implementing a president's worldview on the various departments and agencies involved in national security. Famous national security advisers who made a major impact on American foreign policy have included Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft. Susan Rice is the current national security advisor.Flynn enjoys tremendous access and credibility with Trump, especially because he's had several tours of duty on the battlefield.""What makes Gen. Flynn different from so many others that we've heard about on Donald Trump's transition team is he is the one with the real experience fighting on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq,"" said Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst.""Certainly, he would be a very plausible candidate for national security advisor, which is arguably the most important national security position in the government,"" Bergen added.But the question may be whether his management style rubs people the wrong way.Given Trump's reputation for loyalty, it is no surprise that Flynn would find himself in a key role in the Trump administration.But Flynn, having only retired from the Army in 2014, is actually limited in the positions he could fill. By law, military officers must be out of uniform for at least seven years before they are eligible to become secretary of defense, though it is possible that Congress could grant a waiver that would allow Flynn to be named to that post.Even before it was announced, the idea of Flynn becoming national security advisor was met with opposition from some Democrats.Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday, ""I'd be worried about an impulsive president with an impulsive national security advisor.""Handling of classified informationAt the Republican National Convention, amid shouts of ""lock her up"" from the audience, Flynn delivered a fiery speech condemning Clinton's handling of emails on her private server.""I have called on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race because she put our nation's security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server,"" Flynn said.But Flynn's own record with classified information has been called into question during his military career. On at least two occasions, his handling of classified information came under scrutiny by the US military.Two former government officials with direct knowledge of the issue tell CNN that while Flynn oversaw intelligence in Afghanistan, he shared classified information with Pakistan on terror networks responsible for killing American troops. The intelligence, the sources say, came from another agency. Flynn wasn't supposed to share it. They say he was trying to convince Pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists.Asked by email about the allegation, Flynn told CNN, ""It is not true ... not even close."" Flynn declined to comment further.In separate incident, the two officials with whom CNN spoke said Flynn did not follow established security procedures when he shared classified intelligence with allies.In an August interview with The Washington Post, Flynn has acknowledged the incident.""The investigation on me was for sharing intelligence with the Brits and Australians in combat, and I'm proud of that one,"" he told the paper. ""That was substantiated because I actually did it.""Flynn says he had permission to share the classified information. In both cases, sources say the retired general was informally reprimanded but never charged with wrongdoing.And in 2010, while still a serving senior officer, he published an article criticizing the state of US intelligence operations in Afghanistan. CNN has learned the CIA was so furious at Flynn for publicly disclosing shortfalls that the agency complained to the Pentagon, which had signed off on the article."

Abe stressed that he emerged feeling that the US and Japan will be able to maintain a ""relationship of trust"" with Trump as president. First meetingThe sit-down with Abe was Trump's first in-person meeting with a foreign head of state since he clinched the presidency last week. It comes after Trump's repeated suggestions during the campaign that Japan should shoulder a bigger financial burden regarding US military forces stationed in the region.The Japanese government released several photos of Trump and Abe, some of which included Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and retired Lt. General Michael Flynn. It is not known what role the three played in the meeting.CNN is not publishing or airing these photos because news organizations were denied access to the meeting.Abe wants to 'build trust'""I am very honored to see the President elect ahead of other world leaders,"" Abe told reporters before his departure.""The Japan-US alliance is the axis of Japan's diplomacy and security. The alliance becomes alive only when there is trust between us.""While vague, this statement would be reassuring to the Japanese public, Jeffery Kingston, director of Asian studies at Japan's Temple University, told CNN. ""Abe has invested a lot of critical capital in strengthening alliance with the US, and would have been worried to see his entire agenda go up in the air,"" he said.""By meeting Trump, Abe wants to show the rest of the world that the US and Japan still stand side by side.""A top aide to Abe, Katsuyuki Kawai, said that he'd been told by members of Trump's transition team that Trump's previous remarks should not be taken literally.Abe declined to say if the two men hashed out the defense issue or discussed their disagreement over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, but stressed that he emerged ""convinced that Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have confidence.""""I conveyed my various views on different issues, but since he hasn't assumed the office, I would like to refrain from touching on details,"" Abe said. Maintaining the alliance During the campaign, Trump alarmed Japan and South Korea, two of America's strongest allies, by suggesting they were free-riding on US security commitments.Particularly jaw-dropping were the suggestions that Japan, which until last year had a pacifist constitution, should obtain nuclear weapons to protect itself from North Korea.Abe's meeting with the President-elect ""sends a reassuring signal that despite Trump's rhetoric, things remain more or less on track,"" Kingston said. Brad Williams, a professor of international relations at the City University of Hong Kong, told CNN that the early meeting was brought on in part from Japanese concern for the future of the US-Japanese alliance and also owing to practical concerns.""Abe is on the way to the APEC summits, so he would have flown through the US anyway,"" he said. Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University was more skeptical of the Trump-Abe meeting. Nakano told CNN that the Japanese administration had rushed to see Trump even before he assumed office while he was busy forming a new admnistration.""What is there to gain, I have no idea?"" said Nakano. ""(Abe) is not talking to a president yet.""How future relations between Abe and Trump will play out remain to be seen. Kingston, however, suggested that the Trump-Abe relationship could be off to a good start given the kind of leaders Abe looks favorably on.""If you look at who Abe admires around the world, he likes strong leaders like Putin, Modi and Erdogan, who have despotic tendencies,"" he said."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/nseers-muslim-database-qa-trnd/index.html	"Then a source familiar with the incoming administration told CNN there willNSEERS was a Bush-era program enacted shortly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It disproportionately targeted Arabs and Muslims and was a point of contention between rights groups and the federal government for nearly a decade.It was also a mega failure -- both strategically and, critics say, ethically.What is the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System?NSEERS, sometimes referred to as ""Special Registration,"" was a program for registering non-citizen visa holders -- such as students, workers and tourists -- that President George W. Bush's administration enacted on September 10, 2002. The program had three parts. First, it required non-citizens to register when they entered the US -- a process that included fingerprinting, photo taking and interrogation. Second, it mandated that these people, as well as others already in the US, register and regularly check in with immigration officials. Third, it kept track of those leaving the country to make sure that temporary guests did not remain illegally.  Violators were arrested, fined and even deported.Who did NSEERS affect?Mostly Arabs and Muslims.All males 16 years of age or older from 25 countries were forced to register. Although no religious groups were explicitly targeted, all but one was a Muslim-majority country. The countries included: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen. The sole exception: North Korea.Trump promised during his campaign to start a program that will register and track people from certain high-risk countries, such as Iran, Syria and Afghanistan.What was the program's purpose?US officials at the time believed the program was necessary to identify and capture terrorists who might enter the country on false pretenses or already be living among the population. Then-Attorney General John Ashcroft said the September 11 attacks exposed ""the vulnerabilities of our immigration system"" and made the case for NSEERS. ""In this new war, our enemy's platoons infiltrate our borders, quietly blending in with visiting tourists, students, and workers,"" Ashcroft said. ""They move unnoticed through our cities, neighborhoods, and public spaces. They wear no uniforms. Their camouflage is not forest green, but rather it is the color of common street clothing. Their tactics rely on evading recognition at the border and escaping detection within the United States. Their terrorist mission is to defeat America, destroy our values and kill innocent people.""Trump has made similar arguments to ban and monitor Muslims, as well as oppose the US' resettlement of Syrian refugees.How is NSEERS any different from what Trump is proposing?The President-elect has floated and walked back a number of controversial policies regarding Muslims, including a ""temporary ban,"" a process of ""extreme vetting"" and even forcing all those living in the US to register with a national database. The flip-flops make it difficult to say for sure how his program would be different from NSEERS.His campaign promises hinted at a more draconian system that targets a specific religion, bans an entire group and imposes registration on American citizens. However, his transition team says that's not the case.A source who spoke to CNN said the program Trump is considering would register and track foreign visitors from high-risk countries, including but not limited to Muslims. The source did not specify which countries would be impacted, but said it would be a ""moving target"" given the diffuse terrorist threat.When asked about a complete ban on Muslims, the source said ""it's something we're prepared for, but it's unlikely,"" before adding ""all options are on the table.""Trump spokesman Jason Miller denied that Muslims would be the target of a new program.""President-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is completely false,"" Miller said. ""The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe, but the President-elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in.""Assuming Trump brings back NSEERS, what will be the likely impact?It would be pretty devastating for the Arab and Muslim communities.The previous program registered and monitored more than 80,000 men and boys, according to a 2012 report by Penn State Law and Rights Working Group, a coalition of local, state and national rights organizations. More than 13,000 of those registrants were placed in deportation proceedings, the report added.Rights groups slammed NSEERS for targeting Arabs and Muslims, striking fear into those communities, confusing registrants with ambiguous and complex instructions that resulted in needless penalties, and even uprooting and tearing families apart.""NSEERS targets only people from Arab and Muslim countries, along with North Korea, that is discrimination based on national origin. It is time to end the shame of NSEERS,"" Mary Rose Oakar, former president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said in 2007.NSEERS faced a number of legal challenges from affected individuals and rights groups, who called for its repeal. However, none ever achieved much success.Okay, but it was pretty effective in stopping terrorists -- right?Actually, no. It didn't result in a single terrorism conviction.The American Civil Liberties Union told CNN this week that NSEERS ""actually made genuine efforts at trying to combat terrorism more difficult by destroying relationships with immigrant communities and actually negatively impacting the ability of the federal government to cooperate with foreign governments in fighting terrorism.""The program also ignored credible data from think tanks, including the New America Foundation, showing that most domestic terror attacks are carried out by US citizens.In 2011, nearly a decade after its creation, President Barack Obama's administration suspended NSEERS by taking all 25 countries off its list. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attributed the program's suspension to its redundancies and inefficiencies, not pressure from rights groups -- though it did welcome the decision.So how is Trump going to revive a dead program?Well, it never really died. By taking all 25 countries off the NSEERS' list, the DHS said it ""effectively ended"" the program. However, the structure remains.Furthermore, NSEERS was technically suspended because of administrative issues -- not legal action or rights concerns. So there's really nothing stopping Trump from adding countries to the list and reviving the program.Nevertheless, the ACLU has vowed to fight Trump's efforts. Citing the President-elect's controversial campaign promises, ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero recently wrote: ""If you do not reverse course and instead endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at every step."""

This glorious golden pheasant at the Hangzhou Safari Park has become a thing because, well, look at him. He's got that ""Trump hair in the front, medieval samurai in the back"" thing going on. His nickname is ""Little Red."" Oh, he's perfect. We really needed this today.The only bad thing about this news is that The People's Daily in China beat us to the Platonic ideal of bird puns. Heh. Here, enjoy more Trump bird: According to The People's Daily, Little Red's keeper says the bird is ""more colourful than the other pheasants because he is very healthy,"" which honestly  sounds like something Trump's personal physician would say. Is it possible for a soul to inhabit two bodies? Is there room in the White House for an aviary?"	Haha guys, this bird looks like Donald Trump	['Trump']	[]
