Obama this week became the first sitting US president to visit Laos. Sombath, meanwhile, has vanished -- stopped on a street in this sleepy Mekong outpost in 2012, stuffed into a pick-up truck, and never heard from again.Lao authorities have remained silent on the teacher and activist's disappearance, drawing the concern of human rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Those organizations pressed Obama ahead of his trip here to raise Sombath's case with Lao President Bounnhang Vorachith.Before he was taken, Sombath was a prominent activist in Laos, though not a strident opponent of the government. Focused mostly on advancing development in the country's rural provinces, he was critical of development plans that forced villagers from their homes.On Thursday morning, Sombath's wife, Shui Meng Ng, met with Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, for 20 minutes in the Vientiane hotel where the President is staying. In an interview afterward at her home here, she said Rhodes assured her the President raised the issue of human rights broadly in his meeting, but didn't press her husband's case directly. ""(Obama) is in a position to say a lot of things that not very many Lao people may have the courage nor necessarily the avenue to say,"" she said. ""He has the ears of the highest leaders in Lao party and government.""""He could have said more,"" she continued. ""That's from my own personal perspective. He could have stressed more about human rights, particularly about some of the rights violations, including disappearances.""In his dealings with the Lao government this week, Obama is facing the same delicate challenge he faces with authoritarian governments around the globe: How to raise human rights in a meaningful way while avoiding a confrontation that could sour important diplomatic partnerships.In China, the first stop of Obama's final Asia swing, the topic barely arose, at least in public. During meetings with Prime Minister Xi Jinping, Obama said he would be ""candid"" in his approach to human rights, but he avoided mentioning any specific cases during his public remarks.  In Laos, the balance is complicated by a haunted period that saw the US bombard this landlocked Southeast Asian nation with millions of bombs during the Vietnam War. Obama worked to reconcile that past this week by announcing $90 million in new aide for clearing unexploded bombs. But the horrors of millions of American explosives still embedded in fields here muddied his standing in pressing leaders on their own human rights transgressions. Those transgressions are grave, say rights groups. Eight cases of disappearances in Laos have been referred to a United Nations working group since 1994, but the actual number of incidents could be higher.""We believe that there are dozens more cases, especially from rural areas, or ethnic minority enclaves, where people have disappeared,"" said Phil Robertson, the deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. ""Laos is very opaque in the way its government and its prison system work, and people can literally be held and the key thrown away.""During remarks in Vientiane on Tuesday, Obama insisted the US would ""continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future.""But as he's argued in places like Saudi Arabia, China and Vietnam, Obama insisted a cooperative relationship was the best path toward progress on human rights.""Even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries,"" Obama said.Speaking ahead of his meeting with Sombath's wife, Rhodes said it's standard for the President to raise human rights concerns broadly in his meetings with leaders, but for specific cases to be raised separately, and at a lower level.""The President addresses these issues around civil society and human rights in his meetings, and then we tend to raise individual cases with the government around those meetings,"" he said. Sombath's case, he said, has long been on the US radar.""We stay in regular contact with her and we care very deeply about her case and her husband.  We believe that she deserves to know what happened to her husband and what the status of his case is,"" he said. ""The response that we get from the Lao government is what she referenced, which is that they're continuing to investigate this. And oftentimes, they indicate that they do not know and that there is an ongoing investigation.""For Shui Meng Ng, a blackout on her husband's case persists.""I have no information,"" she said. ""That's the hardest part."""	For disappeared man's wife, Obama trip yields little

Read the poll resultsClinton faces a smaller expectations gap than President Barack Obama did heading into his debates in 2008 and 2012. About 6 in 10 said they thought Obama would be the better debater over both John McCain and Mitt Romney.And although Trump is on the losing side in this question, he fares better than almost every Republican in the last 24 years. The lone exception: George W. Bush during his re-election campaign in 2004, when 52% thought he would outperform John Kerry before their first debate. What last night's forum taught us about Trump and ClintonExpectations for Clinton are highest among her own supporters, 91% of whom expect her to do a better job than Trump. Among Trump's backers, 78% think he will emerge as the better debater and 18% expect Clinton to fare better. Among registered voters who say they could change their minds between now and Election Day, 60% think Clinton will get the better of Trump at the debates and 38% expect the businessman to top the former secretary of state. Overall, two-thirds of voters say they are more interested in watching this year's debates than previous ones; just a quarter say they are less interested. Trump's supporters are especially enthusiastic: 75% say they're more interested in this year's face-offs than in previous years, compared with 58% of Clinton's supporters.Personal brawls dominate 2016 raceVoters see Clinton as better able to handle the public scrutiny that comes with being president, with 52% of registered voters saying she'd be better on that point as opposed to the 43% who think Trump would. And they say her ability to withstand scrutiny has been more needed than Trump's: 53% say he and his campaign have unfairly attacked Clinton, while just 43% think Clinton's attacks on Trump have been unfair. There's a particularly large gender gap in perceptions of attacks, with 60% of women saying Trump has unfairly attacked Clinton, compared with just 44% of men, while there's a smaller gap in the share of men (49%) and women (38%) who think Trump has been unfairly maligned by Clinton. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. TrumpThe poll tested public reaction to several recent critiques raised by the candidates against their opponents, which were highlighted in a presidential forum hosted by NBC last night and on the campaign trail Thursday.Clinton has pointed to Trump's performance at Wednesday night's forum, which focused on military issues, as evidence that a Trump presidency would put the country at risk. The public is split on that issue, with 51% saying his approach would unnecessarily put the country at risk while 48% say his approach would instead be a necessary shake-up in Washington. Political independents tilt toward seeing Trump's tactics as a necessary shake-up, 52% to the 47% who see his style as unnecessarily risky.National poll finds Trump, Clinton locked in virtual tieAnd perceptions of Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, which came up frequently in Wednesday night's forum, has shifted over the last year and a half from an issue that voters deemed mostly irrelevant to her character or ability to serve as president to one which almost two-thirds judge as an indicator of her fitness for the job.Just over 6 in 10, 62%, say the way Clinton handled her email while serving as secretary of state is an important indicator of her character and ability to serve as president, just 36% say it has no bearing on her character or abilities. In March 2015, when news of the server first broke, 52% said it was not indicative of her character. For Bill Clinton, hitting Trump's foundation is 'personal'Most voters see Clinton's family foundation, which has come under sharp criticism from Trump over how donors to the foundation interacted with Clinton while she was secretary of state, as an organization that should be shuttered if Clinton is elected to avoid possible conflict of interest, with a sizable share saying it should be closed down now. Overall, 38% say it should be shut down now to do so, another 22% say it should be shut down if Clinton wins the presidency, and 34% say it does too much good to be shut down completely. Clinton also is seen as more apt to change her positions for political reasons -- 51% say she's more apt to flip-flop, 42% say Trump is, and another 6% say both of them are equally likely to do that.The CNN/ORC poll was conducted by telephone September 1-4 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. The survey includes results among 886 registered voters and 786 likely voters. For results among registered or likely voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

The organization had $41.5 million on hand as of August 31, money it is pouring into swing states to finance what has so far been a relentless paid media campaign against Trump, though his poll numbers remain competitive.The group, now led by Clinton loyalists, struggled at the beginning of the campaign to install donor confidence, but has over the course of the race raised more than $130 million from Democratic donors. The group claims another $29 million in commitments.The names of their latest donors will not be disclosed until later this month, but several perennial Democratic heavyweights -- from Haim Saban to Donald Sussman -- have cut the group checks in recent months.Trump's several super PACs, on the other hand, have largely sputtered, with none managing to convince donors that they are the premier place to park their cash. The most successful group, Rebuilding America Now, has raised more than $13 million but has had trouble in recent months convincing major GOP donors to invest in Trump. That discrepancy has led to an unprecedented advertising advantage for Clinton forces, who spent much of the summer blasting Trump on the airwaves with little reciprocation from the Republican nominee.""Hillary Clinton and her super PACs have spent over $130 million on negative political ads,"" Trump's finance chair, Steven Mnuchin, said in a statement earlier Thursday. ""And yet we are virtually tied (or better) in the most recent national polls and leading in many of the important swing states."" "	Clinton super PAC hauls in $21M in record-setting August

Is climate change important to you? I would hope you would support my mom. She's the only person running for president who recognizes climate change is real, who has a plan to address it, and also realizes it's a real opportunity to create jobs in our country,"" Clinton said.Another reporter asked Clinton about how she and her family are planning to spend the 15th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks this weekend.""I haven't talked to my mother about how she plans to observe the day,"" Clinton said. ""I know my husband and I will be home ... so certainly we'll be particularly grateful when I look down at my children that we are safer now. I recognize that we still have tremendous work to do.""Chelsea Clinton, who has primarily been on the fundraising circuit since having her second child in June, was not asked during the five-minute session about her mother's performance in Wednesday's ""Commander in Chief"" forum, Donald Trump or her mother's email controversy.Going forward, the Clinton campaign sees Chelsea's role as someone who can help raise money and turn out millennial voters. She is also seen as the best character witness her mother has.On that point, Clinton said she trusts her mother more than anyone.""I don't trust anyone more than my mom,"" she said. ""If anything were to happen to me, my mother would take care of my children. I couldn't imagine a better sign of faith or trust than that."""

Trump only began questioning the merits of the war several months later, as US forces became mired in a war against Iraqi insurgents.Just days after President George W. Bush announced US forces had begun invading Iraq, Trump said in an interview on Fox that the war ""looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.""Pressed Thursday by CNN on that praise for the invasion, Trump retorted, ""You know what that meant.""He ignored follow-up questions asking for clarification.Moments earlier, Trump insisted in scripted remarks as he has repeatedly during his presidential campaign that he ""was opposed to the war from the beginning"" and said that he would have voted against invading Iraq had he been in Congress at the time.Trump first publicly stated his support for the Iraq War one month before Congress voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq, when radio host Howard Stern asked him if he favored invading Iraq.""Yeah, I guess so,"" Trump said. ""You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.""Trump said that comment was ""long before"" the war started, even though it came in the heat of the debate on the Iraq War as Congress prepared to vote on the issue.""It was the first time anybody ever asked me about Iraq and I said, 'Well, I don't know,'"" Trump said Thursday, adding those comments were ""superseded"" by his late comments against the war. Trump on Thursday pointed to comments he made three months after Congress voted in favor of military action in Iraq, when he told Neil Cavuto of Fox News that ""the Iraqi situation is a problem,"" but that ""the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" He did not say he was opposed to the invasion.Trump's first and most extensive comments against the Iraq War came in an interview with Esquire magazine in August 2004, one year and five months after the US invasion, which Trump described as ""very early in the conflict, extremely early in the conflict, right at the beginning"" of the war.But Trump insisted Thursday that ""Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race,"" pointing to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's October 2002 vote to authorize military force in Iraq when she was a US senator from New York, which Trump called ""a big mistake.""Trump has repeatedly called into question Clinton's ""judgment"" over her Iraq War vote, even though his own vice presidential nominee Mike Pence also voted in favor of military action as a member of the House of Representatives at the time.The Republican nominee made his case that he was against the Iraq War by pointing to comments he made in the first months of the Iraq War as ""yet more evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.""Trump on Thursday pointed to comments he made to the Washington Post four days after he called the invasion a ""tremendous success"" in which he called the war a ""mess.""But Trump's comments on March 25, 2003, at a post-Oscar party appeared to be a reference to a friendly fire incident that day in which a US missile downed a British fighter jet, causing the stock market to drop more than 300 points.""If they keep fighting in the way they did today, they're going to have a real problem,"" Trump said then. ""The war's a mess.""Trump also noted that in July 2003 he said on MSNBC that he would like to see some of the money being spent on the war effort go to ""New York City and some of the cities and some of the states ... because you know, they really need it and they need it badly.""He did not say he opposed the war in that interview."

A HALO is generally only attempted when there is no other option.The American University in Afghanistan opened in 2006.

The school is regarded as a symbol of cooperation between Afghanistan and the United States.The university has become a target of Taliban-linked insurgents in recent weeks. Three weeks after the aforementioned kidnapping, a group of gunmen wearing suicide vests stormed the campus in August and killed 12 people, including students, security guards and police.A spokesman for the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan told CNN that ""a small number"" of coalition military advisers had assisted their Afghan counterparts in securing the university.The US plans to keep 8,400 US troops in Afghanistan after 2017.

Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time, you don't want to seem 'walled off,'"" she told the popular website Humans of New York, a blog featuring street portraits and interviews collected on the streets of New York City.Two blog posts from the interview were published Thursday. Clinton sat down for the interview last month with Brandon Stanton, the blog's creator, at the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel.She spoke of an experience of being harassed while taking a law school admissions exam at Harvard University.""My friend and I were some of the only women in the room. I was feeling nervous. I was a senior in college. I wasn't sure how well I'd do,"" she said. ""And while we're waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: 'You don't need to be here.' And 'There's plenty else you can do.' It turned into a real 'pile on.'"" She continued, ""One of them even said: 'If you take my spot, I'll get drafted, and I'll go to Vietnam, and I'll die.' And they weren't kidding around. It was intense. It got very personal. But I couldn't respond. I couldn't afford to get distracted because I didn't want to mess up the test. So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.""Clinton has shared this story before, including in an interview with New York magazine in May.The former secretary of state eventually went to Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action and met her future husband, former President Bill Clinton. ""Sometimes I think I come across more in the 'walled off' arena. And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility. I don't view myself as cold or unemotional. And neither do my friends. And neither does my family. But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can't blame people for thinking that.""Humans of New York has also featured multiple posts about President Barack Obama and wrote an open letter critical of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.In the second blog post, which posted later Thursday, Clinton praised Obama and her husband former President Bill Clinton""But I'm married to one and I've worked for the other, so I know how hard they work at being natural,"" Clinton wrote. ""It's not something they just dial in. They work and they practice what they're going to say. It's not that they're trying to be somebody else. But it's hard work to present yourself in the best possible way.""Clinton wrote that having that ""naturalness"" could harder for when because of a lack of role models in higher elected offices, and that women are viewed through a ""different lens.""""I've learned that I can't be quite so passionate in my presentation. I love to wave my arms, but apparently that's a little bit scary to people. And I can't yell too much. It comes across as 'too loud' or 'too shrill' or 'too this' or 'too that.' Which is funny, because I'm always convinced that the people in the front row are loving it.""On Friday, Trump's campaign manager criticized Clinton for ""trying to have it both ways.""""Screaming about sexism when you're running as the first female president of the United States with two months to go, seems to me a bit desperate,"" Kellyanne Conway said on CNN's ""New Day.""

It was very weak. We made it good,"" Trump said. ""We even re-did the tennis courts. They were very tired, and we built new tennis courts.""Videos of Donald Trump's and Eric Trump's depositions were obtained by CNN this week through a court motion.Members of the club are seeking $6 million from the Trumps, claiming the club kept collecting dues even after they ended their membership and were barred from entering the club. The Trumps bought the club from Ritz Carlton in 2012 and later instituted a new membership plan to help pay for renovations.Eric Trump testified about how great the improvements were they made to the course.""When we came into this club, you know, it was a bit of a sick puppy,"" Eric Trump said. ""The place was losing money, losing members. There was very little spirit at the club. Quite frankly, I think when we came in we rejuvenated a lot of that, we put a lot of capital investment in it.""The case currently is awaiting a decision from the judge, which may not come until next months.Donald Trump's testimony came as he was considering his bid for the White House and it lacked much of the trademark bluster which helped him upend the Republican field and the 2016 campaign cycle.Instead, Trump is casual and nonchalant throughout the 30-minute interview. It's a marked change from his responses in another lawsuit involving his development of the Old Post Office Building just blocks from the White House. Trump bragged, in that case, that his comments about Mexicans at the start of his campaign had actually helped his business and he accused the two celebrity chefs who backed out of restaurant deals there of trying to use him to grandstand.The most notable case involving Trump, a lawsuit against Trump University, is not set for trial until after the election. In that case, it wasn't Trump's comments to lawyers that drew attention but instead his public allegation that the judge in the case could not be trusted because he was ""Mexican.""

But recent presidential trips have made headlines not for the lavishness of the reception but for the perceived ""snubs"" that have met the president and vice president upon arrival.Just this week in Asia, two rather undiplomatic incidents marred President Barack Obama's trip. They come atop a year in which Turkish, Saudi and Israeli officials have been similarly discourteous while engaging their American counterparts.RELATED: China loomed over Obama's final pivot to AsiaWhen Obama arrived in China on Saturday, the absence of red-carpeted stairs for Air Force One and open quarreling on the tarmac between Chinese and US officials over press access drew unwanted attention as other leaders arriving for the G20 were greeted with a far grander welcome.And after the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, used foul-language in an exchange with a reporter while talking about Obama, the White House called off a scheduled meeting between the two leaders.Obama downplayed both incidents, dismissing any hidden meaning in the logistical issue in China. ""I wouldn't over-crank the significance of it,"" Obama told reporters.And of Duterte, with whom the White House said Obama did exchange brief ""pleasantries"" at a conference in Laos later in the week, the US President said, ""What I indicated to him is that my team should be meeting with his and determine how we can move forward on a range of issues.""RELATED: Duterte's tongue the least of Obama's Philippine problemExperts, however, see such putdowns as potential agents of policy, a way of expressing dissatisfaction and sending a diplomatic message via other means.Alan K. Henrikson, a professor of the history of diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, told CNN that while the slights often are ""accidental snafus ... sometimes they are fully intentional, even instruments of policy."" Lawrence Dunham, the State Department's assistant chief of protocol from 1989 to 2005, told CNN that snubs can be a way of ""telegraphing a message"" to a foreign government.Dunham added that it ""was really the job of the protocol officer to make sure that these type of slights don't happen by accident."" RELATED: Obama announces $90 million to clear Laos' unexploded bombsIn the case of the Duterte, the US was ""clearly trying to send a signal that they were displeased at what he had to say,"" Dunham said, referring to the cancelation of the planned meeting.And the US and China have plenty to disagree about, from disputes over China's island building and claims in the South China Sea to Beijing's perception that Obama's pivot to Asia is directed against its rise. Some scholars think that Saturday's diplomatic brushoff was one way the host country delivered a message. ""Sometimes, 'snubs' are quite ordinary, unimaginative, and hardly dramatic,"" Henrikson said, pointing to being kept waiting in an office, not being met at an airport, not being invited to an event and even not showing up. In sum, Henrikson concluded, they can range ""from rhetorical insults hurled at UN Security Council meetings to minor etiquette errors.""RELATED: Trump tells voters again he opposed the Iraq war -- but he didn'tViolating the protocol of greeting VIP visitors during a foreign visit is a common tactic.US presidents and vice presidents are often welcomed by senior level officials upon their arrival, typically heads of state, government or foreign ministers.But during an August visit to Turkey, Vice President Joe Biden was greeted by the deputy mayor of Ankara.That visit came amid heightened tensions over Ankara's push for the extradition of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, under suspicion in Turkey for helping plot a failed July coup, as well as US backing for Syrian Kurdish groups fighting ISIS that Turkey considers to be terrorist organizations.RELATED: What last night's forum taught us about Trump and ClintonSimilarly, during Obama's April visit to Saudi Arabia, observers noted that the governor of Riyadh, a relatively low-ranking Saudi official, greeted the president at the airport.At the time, the Saudis were rankled over the deal the US and world powers inked with Iran over its nuclear program; the emergence of legislation in Congress that could allow Saudi Arabia to face lawsuits connected to 9/11, and an interview in which Obama urged Riyadh to find a way to ""share the neighborhood"" with bitter rival Tehran.A US official at the time, however, said the Saudi king's absence upon arrival was not taken as a snub and noted that Obama rarely greets foreign leaders when they land in the US for meetings.RELATED: Clinton on Trump: 'Everything is a game' to himAnother closely watched relationship, the US-Israel alliance, has also been beset by diplomatic slights.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled his March visit to Washington that included an invitation to meet Obama. Israel didn't inform the White House before announcing the decision to the media.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said ""if they weren't able to make the meeting, they should have just told us before they told a reporter.""A year earlier, Netanyahu had earned the White House's open ire by appearing before the US Congress and blasting the administration's landmark deal with Iran over its nuclear program.RELATED: Mike Pence defends Donald Trump comments on Vladimir Putin: 'inarguable'While the snubs can be symptomatic of more chronic issues, former diplomats said the incidents within themselves don't tend to do lasting damage.Henrikson said that efforts like Obama's decision to make light of the significance of the Chinese stairs brouhaha is the best way to respond.""In diplomacy, it is often wisest deliberately not to notice what otherwise might be, even accurately, considered a snub,"" he said.But he acknowledged that such a reaction can be difficult given the media's interest in the issue.""The press can be itself a major anti-diplomatic factor if (it's) looking for insults,"" he said.Indeed, media interest can give them extended life, often forcing a visiting dignitary to use public appearance to address protocol controversies rather than the policy issues at issue in the trip.Obama found himself still being questioned on the stairs incident days later in Laos. Obama called all the discussion around his arrival ""overblown.""""If this theory about my reception and my rebalance policy is based on me going down the short stairs in China, yes, I think that is overblown,"" he said. ""Any reasonable person, certainly any person in the region, would be puzzled as to how this somehow became indicative of the work that we've done here."""	Rash of snubs complicates US diplomacy
9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/mike-pence-on-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/index.html	"In a sit-down with CNN's Dana Bash at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the GOP vice presidential nominee said Donald Trump was speaking ""boldly"" as did the 40th president of the United States.  ""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that's going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president,"" Pence said.But pressed by Bash on the difference between the two nation's governments -- namely that in the US democracy presidents share power with Congress, Pence acknowledged that Trump was not advocating for a dictatorship. ""Donald Trump said last night he doesn't particularly like the system,"" Pence said in reference to Russia.Clinton, Trump talk national security at forumThe comments were notable because Pence often softens Trump's controversial statements. But in this instance, he doubled down. Pence was responding to comments Trump made the previous night at a ""commander in chief forum"" on NBC News. ""Certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader,"" Trump said, when asked about his repeated praise and kind words for Putin despite Russia's increasing aggression toward the United States.   Pence also defended Trump's comments that ""the generals have been reduced to rubble"" under the Obama administration, responding to critics that interpreted those words to mean Trump was putting down the US military.  ""I think he was talking about the commander in chief reducing the influence of generals to rubble,"" Pence said. He added that Trump was describing a ""sense that he got recently that in fact our President had not taken all of the counsel of our military advisers in confronting and defeating ISIS."" Trump has been focusing on his national security policy in the past few days, including announcing that his plan to combat ISIS would include ordering military generals to put together a plan to defeat the terrorist group in his first 30 days.That has stood in contrast with statements Trump made last year that he had a ""foolproof"" plan to defeat ISIS already. Sessions: No 'fundamental contradiction' for TrumpPence refused to answer whether Trump has shared his secret strategy with his running mate: ""I'll keep our private conversations private,"" he said. But he did say that the military could do more under a Trump administration than it has under an Obama administration when asked why the military would have different ideas under Trump than it does now. ""The military commanders serve at the pleasure of civilian authority. The commander in chief makes the call,"" Pence said. ""And I'm confident that our military commanders can bring forward the ideas once the commander in chief makes the mission clear, and Donald Trump has made the mission clear.""Pence refused to say whether Trump would consider sending in significant ground troops to the Middle East, saying he would not ""signal to the enemy"" his plans. Comparisons to Reagan's 'humility'Throughout the interview, Pence compared Trump and Reagan, saying he believes they are similar leaders. He was at the presidential library to give a speech on the comparison between the two men.  ""Their styles are different, surely, between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, but I think both men are truth tellers,"" Pence said. ""They speak plainly about the failings of the administrations of their time, but they also, I think they both give voice to the aspirations of the American people, that we can be better, we can bet stronger.""He added that comparison applies to one of his favorite adjectives to describe Reagan: ""Humble.""As Bash questioned how that word could describe a man with his name on so many buildings, Pence said Trump reveals his ""humility"" in private. ""Ronald Reagan had his name on a lot of marquees. I think at their very core, both men are the kind of leaders that have a core of humility,"" Pence said. ""Donald Trump is always the first person to say, when we say enormous crowds turn out for rallies ... he's always the first one to say, 'This is a movement. This is not about me. This is about the ideas we're advocating.'""Debate prepAs the vice presidential nominee, Pence will have his own debate against his Democratic counterpart, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, this fall. Pence said he's preparing ""in a very traditional way,"" despite reports that Trump has eschewed any mock debates or typical debate prep. ""My running mate is a masterful debater,"" Pence said. ""I'm confident he's going to acquit himself well.""As for Pence, he noted that he's been focused on his state as governor of Indiana, and is working to get up to speed on national and international policy. ""We're really taking some time to brush up,"" Pence said. ""I want to make sure that I'm ready to tell Donald Trump's story to the nation.""And he confirmed that his camp has a stand-in for Kaine for mock debates. ""We actually do. I'll leak it to you later,"" Pence said. Trump's first debate is September 26, while the sole vice presidential debate will be October 4.
