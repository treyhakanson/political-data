Bush in 2000.Clinton has struggled in recent polls with the millennial voter demographic, whose voters appear disproportionately open to backing Stein or Johnson. A Quinnipiac survey out last month found that 44% of voters 18-34 said they would vote one of those two third-party hopefuls.

""What occurred at the penalty phase of this trial is indefensible,"" said Justice Samuel Alito who called the testimony ""bizarre.""""What competent counsel would put that evidence before a jury?"" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Justice Stephen Breyer queried whether there was ""some good reason"" Buck shouldn't be able to re-open his case. Buck has been on death row for the 1995 murders of Debra Gardner and Kenneth Butler. He is not arguing his innocence, but is asking for a new sentencing hearing because his own trial counsel was ineffective.Buck's case has been caught in procedural knots for years, and Texas argues in part that his lawyers failed to raise his claim in a timely manner. The case is one of the first high-profile cases of the Supreme Court's new term and comes as the country and the court grapple with the issue of racial bias in the criminal justice system. The legal issue before the court is whether Buck's case meets the ""extraordinary circumstances"" test justifying the reopening of his sentencing. At the heart of the matter is testimony provided by Dr. Walter Quijano, one of two psychologists retained by the defense. Quijano tesfitied that the fact that Buck was black ""increased the probability"" that he would commit future acts of criminal violence. In Texas, so-called ""future dangerousness"" must be established before a death sentence is rendered. ""Put another way,"" Buck's current lawyers argue in court papers, ""Mr. Buck's lawyers presented evidence that Mr. Buck was more deserving of a death sentence under Texas law because of his race."" They say such prejudicial evidence is the ""epitome of ineffective assistance of counsel."" They point out that the state itself eventually conceded error in six other cases where Quijano's testimony had been elicited.Wednesday, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller drew a distinction between Buck's case and the others because it was the defense itself who called Quijano and elicited race-related testimony on direct examination.But the justices seized on that distinction. Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked why it should matter which side elicited the issue of race. She was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan on that question. The justices did, however, struggle with where to draw a line regarding when an inmate meets the criteria necessary to have his or her case opened up. Alito worried about other inmates ""opening the door"" and asking to raise ineffective counsel claims. Roberts worried that Buck's ""unique case"" was not the proper platform to issue general rules. Keller began his time at the podium addressing the circumstances surrounding Buck's crime, including the fact that he murdered his ex-girlfriend, Gardner, in front of her children. Keller pointed to the fact that he also shot his step-sister at point blank range and shot another man through the heart.But he was cut off, as the justices circled back to the race-based testimony. Keller also argued that Quijano's testimony played a limited role at trial and other evidence of his future dangerousness came from the brutality of the murders, Buck's lack of remorse after he was apprehended as well as the testimony of another ex-girlfriend.   In most cases, supporters of the parties file so called ""friend of the court briefs"" in support of the party they believe has the stronger legal argument.  There are no such briefs filed in support of Texas perhaps in part because the case is so fact specific to Buck's circumstances. A group called the National Black Law Students Association, however, filed a brief in support of Buck emphasizing how the group believes the case impacts race relations today. ""When an expert witness told the jury that Mr. Buck was dangerous because he is Black, he dredged up into the open for all members of the jury to see the monstrous specter that is never far from the surface: the violent Black brute, the single most fearful, dehumanizing, and cruel stereotype Black people have had to endure,"" wrote the group's lawyer, Deborah N. Archer."	Justices skeptical of testimony black man more dangerous because of his race	['Roberts', 'Buck', 'Black', 'Gardner']	[]
3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/intelligence-contractor-arrested-stealing-secrets/index.html	"According to a criminal complaint, Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, was charged with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor after searches of his home and property revealed hard-copy and digital files containing ""highly classified information.""Martin worked at Booz Allen Hamilton as a contractor to the National Security Agency, according to a law enforcement source. The files allegedly obtained by Martin contained top secret information, the complaint said. Top secret is the highest level of government classification and is defined by the government as material that if disclosed ""reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.""Among the documents the FBI believes Martin stole were some detailing a hacking tool that the NSA developed to break into computer systems in other countries. Documents detailing the tools were posted on the Internet in recent months. FBI investigators haven't concluded what Martin's motivation for stealing the documents. But so far they don't believe he did it for a foreign country. 'Mere allegations'In a statement, Booz Allen did not refer to Martin by name but acknowledged one of its employees had been arrested. The company said it has offered its ""total cooperation"" to authorities and fired Martin.""There have been no material changes to our client engagements as a result of this matter,"" the company said. ""Booz Allen is a 102-year-old company, and the alleged conduct does not reflect our core values. Thousands of our employees support critical client missions with dedication and excellence each day. Their professionalism, values and ethics are what define our firm.""Martin's attorneys, Deborah Boardman and James Wyda, said in a joint statement that the charges are ""mere allegations.""""We have not yet seen any evidence,"" the attorneys said. ""There is no evidence that Hal Martin betrayed his country. What we do know is that Mr. Martin loves his family and America, he served his nation honorably in the US Navy as a lieutenant and has devoted his entire career to making America safe. We look forward to defending Hal Martin in court.""Martin's wife said outside their Glen Burnie, Maryland, home that her husband is a ""good man"" and asked for privacy. ""I love him very much,"" Debbie Martin said. Martin served in the US Navy and Naval Reserves for more than 10 years, reaching the rank of lieutenant, according to his service record obtained by CNN. He received several awards and distinctions, including the Joint Meritorious Unit Award and Navy Unit Commendation.The New York Times was the first to report the arrest.Martin was arrested in late August, according to the Justice Department. No explanation was given for why his arrest was not announced until Wednesday. Martin has been detained since his arrest, but has not been formally indicted yet. Murray Bennett, a neighbor of Martin's, told CNN that Martin's arrest was conducted by heavily armed FBI agents, some of whom had camouflage uniforms, helmets and guns drawn as they ran across his yard.""It was like the third World War had started,"" said Bennett, who added that Martin was a ""good guy.""Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property, according to the complaint.Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin was speaking at a conference in Boston Wednesday when the news broke and confirmed the arrest. He wouldn't get into details, but said it highlights the risk of insider threats. ""We have made an arrest of an individual who's involved in taking classified information,"" Carlin said, saying it shows concerns beyond external hackers in systems. ""We also need to take into account -- whether it's economic espionage or traditional espionage -- the focus on those who are trusted within our companies, within our government who can exploit that trust to cause enormous harm.""No known connection with SnowdenEdward Snowden famously disclosed a number of NSA surveillance techniques and fled the country in 2013. He also worked for Booz Allen, though there is no known connection between Snowden and Martin.Snowden speculated on Twitter that Martin's arrest could be linked to a leak of NSA secrets.""This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?"" Snowden wrote. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama ""takes quite seriously"" the potential theft of top secret intelligence by a government contractor.The revelation was a ""good reminder for all of us with security clearances about how important it is for us to protect sensitive national security information,"" Earnest said.He added that he was ""sharply limited"" in what he could say about the case since a criminal investigation is ongoing.News of Martin's arrest follows the August release of what appeared to be top secret computer code that the NSA had used to target the computers of other governments and actors, though there is no known connection between the two incidents.That release, by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, was of code that dated back to around 2013, according to James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The documents were posted for sale online.At the time, it raised the prospect that the world's pre-eminent cyberspying agency had itself been hacked."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/vp-debate-takeaways/index.html	"But the Indiana governor's big night in Tuesday's vice presidential debate might not transfer to his running mate, Donald Trump.Kaine -- Hillary Clinton's number two -- spent his night throwing all of Trump's most politically damaging lines at Pence and asking him to explain them. For the most part, Pence passed, dismissing his ""pre-done lines"" and ""insult-driven campaign."" Here are five takeaways from the vice presidential debate:Pence's temperament wins the nightThe Indiana governor -- once a self-styled ""Rush Limbaugh on decaf"" radio host -- was in full talk-radio mode Tuesday night. Kaine, meanwhile, should switch to decaf.  His interruptions -- one after another after another -- were so distracting that it often detracted from the substance of the debate and made policy conversations hard to follow.The Virginia senator was trying to mimic Vice President Joe Biden's style against Paul Ryan in 2012 -- but Kaine can't pull off lines like ""malarkey."" And Pence, who honed his skills reacting calmly to angry callers on his radio show, knew exactly how to deal with it. An unflappable Pence benefited from the contrast and won the night -- with 48% of those who watched it saying he had the best night, compared to 42% saying Kaine won, per a CNN/ORC poll of debate viewers.Pence, however, had a different take when speaking about the debate Wednesday in Harrisonburg, Virginia.""From where I sat, Donald Trump won the debate,"" Pence said.But Kaine gets in hits against TrumpKaine was determined to spend the night throwing out as many of Trump's controversial and incendiary remarks as possible, hoping that some would sink in for the large audience watching Tuesday night. And at the same time Pence was accusing Clinton and Kaine of running an ""insult-driven campaign,"" Trump was on Twitter, attacking Fox News host Megyn Kelly and retweeting supporters who said Kaine looked like a ""fool"" and an ""evil crook out of the Batman movies."" Kaine spent much of the debate lobbing Trump's own words at Pence.  At one point, Kaine accused Trump of ""shooting himself in the foot"" by attacking a Latina former Miss Universe; claiming to know more than the generals about fighting ISIS; trash-talking Sen. John McCain's military service; supporting a ""personal Mount Rushmore"" of dictators and believing ""the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons."" Trump had indeed said those things.Pence deflected, saying Kaine's attack had ""a lot of creative lines in it."" And Kaine shot back: ""See if you can defend any of it."" Pence freelances on Trump's foreign policy agendaThe vice presidential nominee split -- sometimes in big ways -- from the top of his own ticket. The most glaring example: Russia.  Pence called Vladimir Putin a ""small and bullying"" leader -- and denied that Trump has praised Putin, even though Trump has offered kind words about the Russian president throughout the entire campaign, repeatedly labeling him a ""strong leader.""Kaine also reminded Pence that he praised Putin as well. Pence told CNN's Dana Bash last month that it was ""inarguable"" that Putin is a stronger leader than President Barack Obama.Pence goes further than Trump on Syria military actionHe also suggested the United States ""should be prepared to use military force"" against the Syrian government if Russia doesn't stop supporting President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Pence also said that ""what America ought to do right now is to immediately establish safe zones"" to protect Syrian refugees -- a departure from Trump, who has praised the idea of safe zones but put the burden on Middle Eastern countries to establish and maintain them.The major policy splits between Trump and Pence pose a series of new questions about their foreign policy that could dominate the next week -- and become the most important result of the vice presidential debate. Pence didn't take the baitPence displayed a discipline that Trump did not in the first presidential debate: He didn't take the bait. When Kaine threw a litany of attacks on Trump in Pence's direction, Pence often scoffed, batted them away and moved on -- never addressing them directly, never helping Kaine to make Trump's most incendiary words sink in. And always turning the conversation back to Clinton.The problem: Part of Pence's role is defending Trump. While Tuesday night's debate helped Pence, it's not clear that those gains will transfer to Trump. Post-debate, social media was abuzz that the debate was Pence's 2020 coming-out party. The ambitious Indiana governor eagerly attacked Clinton, but by often letting Kaine's attacks on Trump go untouched, he did nothing to ease the political challenge those criticisms have posed for Trump's campaign.But did Pence do too well?A senior Trump campaign aide told CNN's John King: ""The media is saying Pence won, but didn't really defend Trump. That isn't sitting well with the boss.""Trump was frusturated by the reviews after his first debate with Clinton. A long-time Trump friend said, ""what I worry about is him hearing Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence are better debaters than him. That isn't what he likes to hear.""And when Kaine attacked Trump's June 2015 remarks that Mexican immigrants are ""rapists"" and ""criminals,"" Pence -- in a remark that could deepen the campaign's trouble with minorities -- complained: ""You've whipped out that Mexican thing again."" America learned nothing about the VP candidatesVice presidential debates are proxy affairs -- all about defining and defending the top of the tickets. So the political histories of Pence and Kaine weren't mined at all. That moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS was uninterested in the would-be veeps' backgrounds was clear when the topics of trade and gay rights never came up. Sticking firmly to script, Elaine Quijano loses the debateBoth have flip-flopped on the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- ditching their support for the 12-nation trade deal to embrace Trump and Clinton's opposition to it, without ever offering detailed explanations for their reversals. Pence signed a ""religious freedom"" law that set off a national debate about what should happen when LGBT rights and business owners' religious beliefs come into conflict. He wasn't even asked about it — and Kaine didn't mention it either.The night's topics and performances underscored that 2016 is really all about two of the most famous figures in American life: Trump and Clinton. They'll be back in the spotlight Sunday night in St. Louis for the town-hall debate. "	5 takeaways from the vice presidential debate	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Pence', 'Paul', 'Kaine', 'Obama']	['gay']
6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/donald-trump-laugh/index.html	"He has lamented over and again during this campaign that the United States is a ""laughing stock,"" a global figure of fun for everyone from the Chinese -- most often it's the Chinese -- to Mexico and ""the Persians.""Given this purportedly dire predicament, it would be odd to see Trump hooting along the hustings. And yet, it's a long campaign. Hillary Clinton's laugh has been studied with Talmudic precision.Lately, though, a question has begun to percolate in places like reddit, the online message board, and with some of the reporters who now monitor the Republican nominee for a living.Does this guy ever laugh?He certainly jokes. He grins, winks, puckers and preens. Trump works to get his crowds to laugh, even when he's promising to make ""them"" stop laughing at us.But how about a laugh from him -- from the belly, mouth agape -- a real booming, sustained cackle?A few weeks ago, The Nation asked readers, ""Have You Ever Seen Donald Trump Laugh?"" Erstwhile Gawker blogger Brendan O'Connor wondered the same back in August, only to realize with some concern that he ""could not recall having seen the Manhattan real estate developer laugh -- like, genuinely laugh -- a single time.""A Google search yields images of Trump in what would appear to be the act of laughing, and he would chortle occasionally during interviews with Howard Stern in the early 1990s, but more recent evidence had been harder to come by. The conundrum came alive in a seven-months-old thread on a subreddit called ""The Donald.""The user Ebolatastic asked if anyone had seen Trump laugh ""in front of a camera?"" ""My gf and I are actually debating it,"" he wrote, ""and the press has too many articles titled 'donald trump is laughing at <group>' right now. I can't find any footage at all and cannot recall a single moment of laughter out of him ever in like 20 years of seeing him on TV.""The responses came quickly -- but as ""ImStanleyGoodspeed"" noted immediately: ""We all posted the same clip.""That video, from a January rally in New Hampshire, finds Trump being interrupted by a screeching sound. ""What was that?"" he asks. ""Was that a dog?""""Hillary"" an audience member yells back. And with that: Donald Trump laughed.The code had been cracked, albeit briefly. Compare Clinton, a human person who most recently served as US secretary of state, to a dog, and Trump will chuckle. But many months would pass without similar mirth, and the questions returned. Would there be a reprise? The Granite State supporter certainly wasn't the last to insult Clinton in that way, but the candidate had, so far as we could tell, done little more than grin ever since.Until this weekend.Again, it was the mention of Clinton that made him whoop. The trigger: a suggestion by Trump himself, who was speaking in Pennsylvania, that the Democratic nominee had been unfaithful in some way to her husband.""Hillary Clinton's only loyalty is to her financial contributors and herself,"" he said. ""I don't even think she's loyal to Bill if you want to know the truth. And really, folks, why should she be?""And then, again, he laughed. Case closed.Fast forward to 37:06 for the evidence -- and don't blink; it's more of a chuckle. If there are publicly recorded laughs this informal investigation has missed, please tweet them to us @CNNPolitics."	The one thing that can make Donald Trump laugh	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/mike-pence-tim-kaine-vp-debate-poll/index.html	With two relatively unknown politicians taking the stage, those watching seemed more impressed by Pence than Kaine. About two-thirds of debate-watchers said Pence's performance was better than they expected, just 14% said he did worse than they thought he would. Reviews of Kaine tilted toward the negative, with 43% saying he did worse than they expected and 38% saying he outperformed their expectations.Read the complete CNN/ORC instant poll resultsThe debate itself focused more on the candidates at the top of the ticket than the two men on stage. Most debate watchers said Kaine did the better job defending Hillary Clinton, 58%, while just 35% thought Pence better defended Donald Trump. Still, 29% of debate watchers said what they saw Tuesday made them more apt to vote for Trump, compared with 18% who said it made them more likely to back Clinton. Most debate watchers, 53%, said their vote was not swayed by Tuesday's face off. After the first Clinton-Trump debate last week, 34% said it made them more apt to vote Clinton, 18% Trump.Kaine's performance fell short of Clinton's on several other measures in the poll as well. Tuesday's debate watchers were split on which candidate expressed his views more clearly, 47% named each, a metric on which Clinton soundly beat Trump in last week's presidential debate.5 takeaways from the VP debateAnd 48% said Kaine had a better understanding of the issues, edging out Pence at 41%. Clinton topped Trump by a better than 2-to-1 margin on that score after their first debate.Kaine and Pence emerge from the debate with near identical and net-positive favorability ratings, but Kaine appears to have taken a hit among those who watched. Pence, meanwhile, boosted his numbers somewhat. Pence was largely seen as the more likeable candidate on the stage, 53% to 37%, and nearly all of the movement in Kaine's favorability rating post-debate was toward the negative side: His unfavorable rating rose from 28% among this same group of debate watchers when they were interviewed pre-debate to 40% after, while his favorability number held about even at 55%. For Pence, his favorability rating bumped up 7 points to 57%, from 50% pre-debate. His unfavorable numbers held about even 40%.Both men are broadly judged qualified to take over the office of president if needed, 77% say Pence is qualified, 70% that Kaine is. Most voters who watched Tuesday night said Kaine's positions on the issues are about right ideologically (57%) while 36% see him as too liberal and 5% too conservative. Assessing Pence's positions, about half, 49%, think he's about right, 46% too conservative and just 3% too liberal.The CNN/ORC post-debate poll includes interviews with 472 registered voters who watched the October 4 vice presidential debate. Results among debate-watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Respondents were originally interviewed as part of a September 28-October 2 telephone survey of a random sample of Americans, and indicated they planned to watch the debate and would be willing to be re-interviewed when it was over.

Of the 10 early voting centers that offer longer weekday hours, ""most of them are located in zip codes with low Democratic and minority populations,"" he said.The tension between the party and county officials comes in the wake of a letter from the civil rights division of the Justice Department last March concerning reports that voters there waited several hours to cast a ballot during the primary election.Elizabeth Bartholomew, of the Maricopa County Recorder and Elections office, confirmed that her office had received the complaint and had moved to extend weekday hours in one facility, the South Mountain Community Center.""The complaint was that in the minority areas the early voting locations were not open as late as some of the other early voting locations,"" she said.""The Democratic Party brought this to our attention, and we moved to fix it,"" she said.But Bartholomew stressed that there are more early vote centers in the county than there have been in the past and that for the most part it is the city, and town clerk officers at the voting sites who set the hours for the facilities.
