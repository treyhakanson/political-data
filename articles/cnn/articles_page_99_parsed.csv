Maggie Hassan, who is challenging Ayotte.The ad opens with a quick glimpse of the now-infamous footage taken on the set of ""Access Hollywood"" 11 years ago. Trump can be heard on the tape making extraordinarily vulgar remarks about women.The spot also shows Trump mocking a reporter last year who had a disability.Earlier in the month, Ayotte had said she would ""absolutely"" point to Trump as a role model for children, later walking back the remark by saying she ""misspoke."" And after the 2005 tape surfaced, Ayotte said she would not vote for him.Hassan's spot pounced on Ayotte's shifting positions.""A political calculation just to re-elect herself,"" the ad said. ""So what else has Kelly Ayotte done to get re-elected?""The ad is the latest effort to tie Trump to down-ballot Republicans, particularly as his poll numbers sink. Republicans in tough re-election fights have been weighing how aggressively to elbow out their presidential candidate. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson on Friday pitched himself as a counterweight to a potential President Hillary Clinton, allowing him to effectively concede the presidential race without having to invite Trump's scorn with an un-endorsement."

""There isn't going to be any relationship more important to us.""The Embassy of Pakistan did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.However, in an interview with the Hindustan Times just before addressing the crowd of Indian-Americans, Trump said he'd be willing to play a mediating role in addressing the ""very, very hot tinderbox"" of Kashmir between India and Pakistan.India and Pakistan's Kashmir dispute: What you need to know""If it was necessary I would do that. If we could get India and Pakistan getting along, I would be honored to do that. That would be a tremendous achievement ... I think if they wanted me to, I would love to be the mediator or arbitrator,"" Trump said in the interview. India has long opposed third-party mediation on Kashmir. It rejected United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's offer in late September to play a role. Pakistan, on the other hand, has sought international help in resolving the decades-long conflict.Recently, it accused India of what it sees as humanitarian violations in Indian-administered Kashmir.The conflict in Kashmir has flared up in recent weeks, with tensions at their worst in a decade. More than a dozen Indian soldiers were killed in an attack on an army base last month. India pointed the finger at Pakistan, which denied the accusations, and responded by carrying out what it called ""surgical strikes"" in the disputed border region.Another mediation offer raised eyebrows in India in 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama, a candidate for president, suggested a US role in mediating the Kashmir dispute. Obama hasn't again suggested such a role. And the United States' position has been that it would mediate, but only if both sides reached out and asked it to step in.

""But it's more of the idea of making a big false splash. Her campaign advisers like the idea she could maybe draw a huge crowd in a place like Salt Lake City. And yeah, it's interesting -- and some of the holdup though I am told comes from Robby Mook, who's Clinton's notoriously cautious campaign manager. He has been saying throughout this election he wants to get to 270 Electoral College votes in the most efficient, easiest way possible.""2) And if the target is Georgia, the Atlanta suburbs loom largePicking Georgia as a late Clinton target makes sense for a number of reasons: The polls of late are close, plus there is the history of Bill Clinton winning the state in 1992.But as Hillary Clinton's aides debate the pros and cons, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reminded us the key to winning Georgia would be suburban Atlanta, an area that isn't as favorable to Democrats as, say, the suburbs in northern Virginia or just outside Philadelphia.""The reason it's tough is because (in) the vast Atlanta suburbs, there are plenty of voters there who don't like Trump that much. But the Clinton campaign feel like it's less like, for example, Northern Virginia and Raleigh (North Carolina) and more like a traditional Southern suburb, and so it's a little bit tougher for them down there. So if you see her there in the last week or so, we're going to know they are feeling good,"" Martin said.3) Is Trump hedging his bets -- on himself?On the campaign trail, Trump brags he is beholden to no special interests or big donors because he is self-funding his campaign.That hasn't been the case for some time -- Trump gets most of his campaign operating budget the traditional way: through fund-raising. But he has been cutting his campaign checks on a regular basis -- and Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg Politics said a look at the most recent filings offers some important insights.""One of Donald Trump's fund-raisers told me last night that no major donors have asked for their money back because of all this stuff, but federal records show that Trump's contributions to his own campaign are getting smaller and smaller,"" Jacobs said. ""He said on the campaign trail this past week in Florida, again, that he intends to donate $100 million to his own campaign, but to date he's at $56 million."" 4) GOP hoping for a throwback election: The return of ticket splittingThree weeks is a long time, but many Republican strategists appear convinced the presidential election is over, and they are trying to find ways to keep GOP Senate candidates from getting washed out if Trump is defeated.So if your Senate candidate sounds more like someone running for sheriff or mayor in the final weeks, don't be surprised.The Federalist's Mary Katharine Ham took us inside the ""all politics is local"" scramble among Republican Senate candidates.""For Republicans, because they got this huge nationalized story about Trump, that's very hard to get away from. The National Republican Senatorial Committee had these guys running more local sheriff-type race from the very beginning, so this might be an issue for them,"" Ham said.""(Sen. Ron) Portman (in Ohio) is the perfect effect example of how this has done well for him. But can it do well enough to last him these last three weeks?""5) If Trump is 'cratering,' how deep is the point of no escape?A new wave of research for Republican allies in those critical Senate races finds that, in the words of one person involved, ""Trump is cratering.""This source said Trump leads only in Iowa among the eight or 10 states viewed as traditional presidential battlegrounds.In this research, he is down double digits in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania -- which of course also happen to have critical Senate races. The GOP incumbents are both down a few points, running better than Trump but still in the danger zone.In Nevada, for contrast, Trump trails but in the single digits, and GOP Senate candidate Joe Heck is up a little.So is 10 points the line at which a Trump defeat would inevitably wash out other Republicans on a statewide ballot?GOP strategists said there is no one-size-fits-all rule, but that as much as they have given up on Trump, they said they hope he can at least climb back into a single-digit deficit in those states.And they are urging GOP candidates to spend the final weeks making the case that voters need a Republican Senate to keep a check on a liberal Clinton presidency."

Pat McCrory on Monday called the fire an ""assault on our democracy.""Speaking from the scene, McCrory said the incident won't get in the way of fair elections.Hillsborough police said they are still processing evidence from the scene and they are receiving assistance from the FBI, North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.A bottle of flammable liquid was thrown through the Orange County Republican headquarters, police said. ""The flammable substance appears to have ignited inside the building, burned some furniture and damaged the building's interior before going out. The substance was housed in a bottle thrown through one of the building's front windows,"" according to a statement by the town of Hillsborough. A 911 call was made by the owner of a business nearby, the town said.""Someone has firebombed through the window of the Republican Party next to me and sprayed all over the side of my building, 'Nazi Republicans leave town or else,' "" the caller said.The caller said: ""They threw some sort of firebomb through the window because it smoked up under the porch and all around the window frame. ... I can smell smoke, so obviously it went out on its own or didn't work well, but it is some sort of incendiary device.""Hillsborough is about 10 miles northwest of Durham.North Carolina is a key swing state in the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Early Sunday evening, the Clinton campaign tweeted a note of sympathy. ""The attack on the Orange County HQ @NCGOP office is horrific and unacceptable. Very grateful that everyone is safe.""""The office itself is a total loss,"" Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the state Republican Party, told The Charlotte Observer. ""The only thing important to us is that nobody was killed, and they very well could have been.""The weekend firebombing episode become fodder for claims by Trump that the election is ""rigged"" in Clinton's favor, reflecting the intensity surrounding the campaign in the final weeks of the race. In the evening, Trump -- without evidence -- blamed the firebombing on Clinton supporters. ""Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP,"" Trump tweeted Sunday night. Woodhouse told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan that roughly 80 county GOP offices were told to close early Sunday, and a temporary mobile office was erected in Orange County, near the site of the firebombing. A group of Democrats started a GoFundMe fundraising page to help with rebuilding the office. The campaign has accumulated more than $13,000.  ""We've had a lot of people reach out. We've had a lot of people who aren't political who are at the office volunteering,"" Woodhouse said. ""We have heard from some Democrat groups. I agree with both Ms. Clinton and Mr. Trump that these were animals who did this, no matter who they represent, and it's disgusting and unacceptable. Democratic office vandalized Fifteen miles south, in Carrboro, a Democratic office was spray-painted with the words ""Death to Capitalism.""   Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Matt Hughes says the office was closed midday Sunday after employees discovered the scrawl. Capt. Chris Atack of the Carrboro Police Department told CNN in an email that the graffiti is consistent in theme with others officials have seen in the downtown areas for years. He said the incident was not believed to be related to the GOP vandalism in Hillsborough.""We have no information suggesting that this is in any way related to the proximity to Democratic campaign headquarters or events in Hillsborough,"" Atak said. Hughes, the Democratic Party chairman, says it is ""a heck of a coincidence."""	Local GOP office in North Carolina firebombed	['McCrory', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/16/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-reality-check/index.html	"Get outta my space!During the presidential debate, Donald Trump, at times paced the stage like an angry man, sometimes bringing him physically close to Hillary Clinton. This led to an argument over just who was invading whose space.""He was really all wrought up and you could just sense how much anger he had,"" Clinton told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview. ""And, so he was really trying to dominate and then literally stalk me around the stage and I would just feel this presence behind me and I thought, 'Whoa this is really weird,' so I was just trying to stay focused.""Trump saw it differently. ""I was standing by my lectern, and all of a sudden from nowhere, she walks right in front of me,"" Trump told Fox News's Bill O'Reilly later in the week. ""I never walked near her. She stands right in front of me. The next day, it was I was in her space. I was standing at my chair, my lectern.""So who's right? As the old sportscaster Warner Wolf used to say, let's go to the videotape.There are a couple of instances where Trump and Clinton have close encounters on stage. But the one that stands out occurs during a question from an audience member about the Affordable Care Act. Here's the blow-by-blow:Trump is about to answer the question when he is reminded by CNN's Anderson Cooper, who co-hosted the debate, that it's actually Clinton's turn to respond. As the two candidates banter over who should speak first, Trump walks towards the front of the stage, away from the questioner and away from his chair and lectern. When it is decided that Clinton will go first, she crosses the stage behind -- not in front of -- Trump towards the questioner. She stops just in front of Trump's chair and lectern and begins her answer. As she speaks, Trumps walks back to his chair and stands there waiting for her to finish. That takes him perilously close to Clinton who is still standing only a few feet in front of him.There is no question that Trump, a big man, looms almost ominously behind the much smaller Clinton. It is especially jarring because the camera angle from the front makes him look even closer. But, the fact is, he is correct. He is standing by his chair and his lectern. Sure, he could have backed away from Clinton but the area close to the chair and lectern is his space and he has every right to be there. He does not appear to be ""stalking"" her.This round goes to Trump.Latest Trump adA new ad from the Trump campaign called ""Corruption"" contains a bevy of explosive charges. Check out the script:Pretty hard-hitting, right? The only problem is that by compiling unsubstantiated claims, misleading statements and one outright falsehood, the Trump campaign has produced an ad that is breathtaking in its dishonesty.It is certainly true that the Clintons went from what Hillary Clinton termed ""dead broke"" when they left the White House in 2001 to earning more than $10 million in 2015 and $28 million the year before, as well as owning at least three properties -- two in New York, one in Washington -- valued in the millions.But the ad suggests the couple became rich because of ""staggering amounts of cash"" given to the Clinton Foundation. This is false. The Clintons, according to the foundation's tax records, do not receive any income from the foundation. And according to the Clinton's personal tax records, they receive most of their income from books and paid speeches.Neither the narrator, nor any background text in the ad identify the criminals, dictators and countries that ""hate America"" that have allegedly given to the foundation. To be sure, the relief effort in Haiti following the catastrophic 2010 earthquake -- an effort that was, in many ways led by Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation -- has been a mixed-success.  Some aspects of the overall relief effort have been criticized for poor planning and cronyism. But because the ad does not specifically say how Haitians were ""exploited,"" we can't issue a verdict.The charge that Clinton personally gave American uranium rights to the Russians is, at best, misleading. The US government did, indeed, approve a deal that allowed a Russian state agency to purchase a controlling stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company with significant uranium assets in the US. The company, at one time, included investors who had contributed to the Clinton Foundation.The State Department did approve the transaction. But it was one of nine US agencies, including Treasury, Commerce, Defense, Energy and Homeland Security, as well as at least one state regulator, that had to sign off on the deal.Overall this ad is false.'She wants to knock the hell out of Social Security'At a Pennsylvania rally last week, Trump said that excerpts of speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street bankers show the Democrat wants to gut entitlement programs.  ""The speeches also show that Crooked Hillary supports cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits, one more example of how Hillary Clinton's public position is a lie. She wants to knock the hell out of your Social Security. She wants to knock the hell out of your Medicare and Medicaid. And I am going to save them,"" he said.The excerpts were contained in Clinton campaign officials' emails which were hacked and revealed by WikiLeaks.  In the excerpts, Clinton spoke approvingly of the approach taken by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, who co-chaired a commission to come up with ways to reduce the federal debt. ""So, you know, the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,"" she told a gathering sponsored by Morgan Stanley. ""The specifics can be negotiated and argued over. But you've got to do all three. You have to restrain spending, you have to have adequate revenues and you have to have growth. And I think we are smart enough to figure out how to do that.""Among the recommendations that Simpson and Bowles made was a plan to shore up the Social Security Trust Fund. The plan included gradually increasing payroll taxes on high earners, a restructuring of benefits to increase the amount of retirement payments for lower income workers while decreasing the amount for upper income ones. The plan also called for gradually increasing the age a person could draw full Social Security benefits from age 66, which it was in 2010 when the recommendations were made to 69 in 2075.Whether one agrees that raising taxes on high earners and raising the retirement age by three years over a 65-year-period is ""knocking the hell out of Social Security,"" the fact is the excerpts released by WikiLeaks so far do not show Clinton specifically calling for cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Indeed, she said the specifics of Simpson-Bowles approach ""can be negotiated.""Who knows what Clinton will do if she is elected president. But, based on what she has said so far, there is no evidence that she would severely cut Social Security or Medicare.Clinton wrong on whether intelligence agencies say Russia is favoring TrumpDuring the presidential debate, Clinton asserted that Russia was behind the hacking of computer systems related to the Democratic Party as well as WikiLeaks' release of thousands of emails. Clinton said Moscow was trying to influence the presidential election to favor Trump.""Our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election and WikiLeaks is part of that as are other sites where the Russians hack information,"" she said.""We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,"" Clinton added. ""And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected. They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.""Recently, the Obama administration said it was ""confident"" Russia was behind recent hackings of the Democratic National Committee emails and the sites of other Democratic Party-linked organizations over the summer.""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement.The statement also said the hacks and then publishing of these emails are ""intended to interfere with the US election process.""Russia has denied all involvement in hacking attacks on US servers and organizations, saying the accusations are ""nonsense.""While there has been speculation that the hacking benefits Trump as it has targeted Democrats and Clinton, the intelligence community has not reached that conclusion.So Clinton's assertion that the hack was meant to benefit Trump may be her hunch, but not the conclusion of investigators. We rate that false.Obama wrong on Trump calling vets weakIn his speech on Friday in Cleveland, President Barack Obama put out a litany of reasons he said made Trump unfit to be commander in chief.""You can't have a guy who's insulted POWs and attacks a Gold Star mom and has called our troops and veterans weak,"" Obama said.Just a minute here. Called troops and veterans weak?Obama is, no doubt referring to remarks that Trump made recently to a group of veterans. In response to a question about programs he would use to combat PTSD, Trump said: ""When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and you're strong and you can handle it. But a lot of people can't handle it. And they see horror stories. They see events that you couldn't see in a movie, nobody would believe it.""This kind of stream-of-consciousness sentence could easily confuse anybody. It has led many people to conclude that Trump was saying anyone who suffers from PTSD is weak. But a fair parsing of his words done by some fact-checkers such as Snopes.com does not lead to that conclusion. Just because some people in the room, in Trump's view are strong and can handle the horrible things they have seen in war, doesn't necessarily mean that others in the room -- or outside for that matter -- who can't handle horrible memories of war are weak, a term Trump never used.But, even if that is what Trump meant, Obama takes it a step too far by suggesting that the Republican called all troops and veterans weak."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/16/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-polls/index.html	"Clinton is 11 percentage points ahead of Trump, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out Sunday. An ABC News/Washington Post poll, meanwhile, pegs her lead at 4 points. In the NBC poll, Clinton has 48% support compared to 37% for Trump, 7% for Libertarian Gary Johnson and 2% for the Green Party's Jill Stein. In a two-way race, Clinton leads 51% to 41%. The NBC poll shows Trump could have paid a steep price for the ""Access Hollywood"" tape that showed him bragging about sexually assaulting women, which was followed by nine women claiming specific instances of Trump groping or kissing them without consent.In a head-to-head with Trump, Clinton leads by 20 points among women -- while Trump is ahead by just 3 points with men. However, just 32% say the video disqualified Trump from being president and that he should drop out of the race, while 53% disagree. Clinton's debate performances have helped, too, the NBC poll found. Thirty-one percent of those surveyed said the two debates have made them more likely to vote for Clinton, while 14% say the debates make them more likely to back Trump. The NBC poll shows voters' distaste with Trump doesn't extend to all Republicans: 46% of those polled say they want a Democrats to control Congress, while 44% say they favor a Republican-led Congress. In the ABC poll, meanwhile, Clinton has 47% support to Trump's 43%, with Johnson at 5% and Stein at 2%. That's little change from an ABC/Washington Post poll conducted just before the first debate and before the controversy over Trump's taped remarks about sexually assaulting women, which had Clinton's lead at 46% to 44%.However, the poll did find some shifting dynamics in the race. Enthusiasm among Trump supporters is down to 79%, while Clinton's is up to 83% -- erasing the 10-point advantage in that measure that Trump had before the first debate. And two-thirds of registered voters say the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape doesn't affect their vote. Thirty-eight percent say they think Trump's apology for those comments is sincere, and 68% say Trump probably has made unwanted advances toward women.The NBC/WSJ poll surveyed 905 likely voters between October 10-13 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.The Washington Post-ABC poll surveyed 740 likely voters between October 10-13 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points."

""You want me to (say) that I think the election in Philadelphia and Chicago is going to be fair?

""Look, the American people will speak in an election that will culminate on November the 8. But the American people are tired of the obvious bias in the national media. That's where the sense of a rigged election goes here, Chuck.""Tapper pushed back on Giuliani, saying even Republicans had debunked the conspiracy theories pushed online that low vote totals in Philadelphia in 2012 for Mitt Romney were the result of a rigged process. Giuliani said as a prosecutor, he remembers an election in Chicago in which 720 supposedly dead people voted -- and that 60 dead people cast ballots in his own mayor's race.He said elections fraud would only make a difference in a 1 to 2 percentage point races.He also said that only Democrats do it, because it happens in inner cities. ""I can't sit here and tell you that they don't cheat. And I know that because they control the polling places in these areas.

Johnson, both under construction at Bath Iron Works in Maine.Among the things that set the Zumwalt apart from its predecessors in the Arleigh Burke-class of destroyers:-- A larger flight deck that enables operations with new F-35 fighters and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft;-- Larger vertical launch missile tubes that can fire larger and more advanced land attack and anti-ship missiles;-- An electrical power system that generates almost as much electricity as the nuclear power plants on aircraft carriers: ""The ship can operate all of its systems and still generate enough electricity to power a small town,"" the Navy says,-- The ability, with that extra power, to accommodate weapons of the future, such as electronic rail guns and laser.But for all that, the Navy plans to buy only the three Zumwalt-class destroyers it has on order, down from 32 originally envisioned early in the program.The Navy is now focusing on an updated version of the current -- and more conventional -- Arleigh Burke class.Bryan Clark, a naval analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments told USNI News earlier this year that it's likely the Zumwalt-class ships will be called on for different missions than Burke-class destroyers.""If you get into a war then you would use it differently than you would a regular (destroyer),"" Clark told USNI News. ""They wouldn't do regular patrols ... they would do intelligence-gathering. They would do special ops.""And some critics wonder if that's worth the $22.5 billion cost for the three Zumwalt-class ships.""One US nuclear submarine, the newest in the fleet, costs about $2.2 billion. In other words, they used the budget for two nuclear subs to build one Zumwalt,"" one Russian commentator, retired Col. Viktor Baranets, told Russia's state-run Radio Sputnik earlier this year. ""Americans love grandiose projects which sometimes go beyond the scope of reason."""	USS Zumwalt stealth destroyer joins Navy fleet	['Clark']	['guns']
