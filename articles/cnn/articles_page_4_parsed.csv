Who could be in Trump's CabinetTrump teams for the Defense, State and Justice departments, as well as the National Security Council, have begun to reach out to their Obama administration counterparts, a transition aide and the White House confirmed. The transition team expected to identify those individuals on their website on Friday morning.  Meanwhile, former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was actively directing individuals meeting with the President-elect in Trump Tower to speak with reporters gathered in the lobby, all of them delivering a message that things were moving along nicely. Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, among others.On Saturday, Trump will meet with former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- a discussion fueling speculation about a possible nomination as secretary of state.The process of landing teams had formally been held up by paperwork. The White House needed the transition to provide names of the individuals who would be moving into agencies and have those people make certain declarations regarding a code of conduct and conflict of interest policy. That had been delayed by the change in leadership of the transition last week from Chris Christie to Mike Pence and a new anti-lobbying policy installed early this week.Slowing things down The beginnings of normalcy came after a week of confusion within the transition brought on by Trump's surprise win.  Trump himself and his inner circle of advisers had paid no attention to the work that former transition chairman Christie had been supervising for months prior to the election, and discovered on Thursday after a meeting with the New Jersey governor that they were not satisfied with the results, senior Republican and transition officials told CNN.On Friday, the transition announced it moved Christie to vice chairman, along with other key Trump surrogates and advisers from the campaign, and declared Vice President-elect Mike Pence as chairman and the former chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions, Rick Dearborn, as the executive director, replacing a close Christie ally. They moved very quickly to announce Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as Trump's White House chief of staff and former Breitbart and campaign executive Steve Bannon as a senior adviser. Initially, the team felt announcements about further personnel had to come quickly. But late last week, they realized that time was needed to get organized and figure out how they would search and vet people beyond the inner circle, the sources said.  The decision was made to slow things down and get a process in place. Sources: Kushner at the center of Trump team 'infighting'Reaching out to RepublicansPart of the strategy established was to take a wider look at candidates beyond inner circle loyalists to see who Trump might be comfortable with to round out a Cabinet.  As with any transition, time was also being taken to vet possible candidates and screen for potential confirmation trouble before naming any names. Another part of the redirection was a strategy to reach out to people who did not support Trump to show that he is unifying the party. Now, sources say, there is a more organized search to talk to candidates beyond the inner circle and establish protocols and  procedures. The sources point to the parade of more establishment-oriented Republicans like Haley, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and a scheduled weekend meeting with Mitt Romney -- who spoke forcefully against Trump through the election. The transition team has begun holding daily press briefings with the media to update the press and tamp down confusion, in addition to making insiders available in Trump Tower.The first time there was a printed agenda was at one of the first senior staff meetings Sunday evening, a transition official said. The gesture was seen as a message to everyone that there needs to be an order first before moving to the big things.  Confusion at the outsetChristie had been chairman of the transition leading up to the election and had built out a robust team of staff dedicated to agency engagement, policy development and developing and vetting a cabinet.But on the Thursday after the election, the Trump team met with Christie to go over the transition memo, which included staffing and cabinet positions for the President-elect's administration. Trump's team considered the memo a non-starter because it reflected the Washington establishment, including lobbyists, a source said.Christie was called in on Friday, demoted and marginalized. He was told that this did not reflect the future Trump administration -- that it wasn't what Trump campaigned on and it didn't ""drain the swamp.""It was after that meeting that Pence was elevated to take charge of the transition and effectively was put in a position to start all over.Pence on Tuesday moved to ban lobbyists from the transition -- though it was initially unclear in the first few days what that meant.  Trump transition delays cause confusion in WashingtonCNN obtained an organizational chart of the transition's staff from before the announcement, and at least eight agency leads had been a registered lobbyist, though some had already been let go of the transition for other reasons. On the policy side of the transition, a review of the chart showed that eight out of 17 names listed had been registered lobbyists at one time.On Thursday, transition officials told the press that lobbyists on the transition were being asked to sign affidavits that they had deregistered as lobbyists before they could continue working with the transition, and that any former lobbyist that joined the administration would be prohibited from lobbying for five years after leaving the transition. But not all sources familiar with the transition said the narrative was entirely accurate.Trump himself defended the lobbyists serving with his transition in a ""60 Minutes"" interview on Sunday. ""That's the only people you have down there,"" when asked about the number of lobbyists on his transition. ""Everybody's a lobbyist down there ... But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.""He said the goal would be to end the system over time, adding: ""I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out.""Focus on Christie's roleA source close to Christie and the transition said the early transition process didn't have a choice but to hire lobbyists, and that Christie was a convenient fall guy to blame. The source said some Washington Republicans who joined the transition pre-election were making sort of ""back-door bets"" to ""hedge"" their future, meaning they could work on the plans for the Trump administration without tying their career to his campaign. ""That backfired,"" the source said, meaning the individuals involved are now being forced to choose between their current job status and continuing work on the transition and, possibly, the administration. The phenomenon of Republicans wanting to have it both ways with Trump, and a ""paucity of people to pick"" from, led to many lobbyists being on the team. Thus Christie had an ""imperfect situation to work with which was in conflict with the campaign post-election,"" the source said. That is being ""reconciled"" now, the source added. Leaks that Christie was pushed out because of lobbyists' involvement came after reports that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was rubbing allies the wrong way in efforts to purge the transition team of Christie associates, per other sources. The source close to Christie said it could be strategic to spin a narrative that Christie was too reliant on lobbyists and not delivering, saying, the story ""has been leveraged to deepen the wound -- particularly in the New York media market.""Christie himself, once rumored to be a leading contender for a number of Cabinet positions before convictions were handed down to some of his former top aides in the Bridgegate trial, said Thursday he would not be serving in the administration. ""For everyone worried about what I'm going to do, and what job I should take and where I should live -- let me give you all an update. I have every intention of serving out my full term of governor and I have no reason to believe as we stand here today that I will do anything other than serve out my full term as governor,"" Christie said in a news conference in New Jersey on Thursday."

The subject of the conference, sponsored by the conservative Federalist Society, was the jurisprudence of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. But the talk in the hallways was devoted to the unexpected election results and the pending Supreme Court nomination -- expected to be a conservative who would continue Scalia's legacy. Indeed, several of the judges Trump is considering for the Supreme Court were milling about in the hallways, dodging journalists and moderating various panels. ""It's not the wake we thought it was going to be,"" said Randy Barnett, a professor of Georgetown law who was an architect of the first legal challenge against the Affordable Care Act.The Republican blueprint for Supreme Court nominations John Malcolm of the conservative Heritage Foundation said that when he was planning to come to the conference a few weeks ago, he thought the lawyers might join together to ""commiserate"" Clinton's win. Instead, he said, ""we are here to celebrate."" Luther Strange III, the attorney general of Alabama spoke about the dozens of lawsuits he and other Republican state attorneys general filed against the Obama administration in areas such as immigration, transgender rights and the Clean Power Plan. ""We are no longer the last line of defense,"" Strange said. ""We are now the spear."" The annual event, always popular, held several panels with standing room only crowds. Malcolm pointed to attendees wearing lanyards attached to event ID cards and joked that some of the people populating the rooms should have their resumes attached to the lanyard. ""Many are surprised that they have a shot at a position in government,"" he said. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, met with Trump in New York on Wednesday. After that meeting, Leo offered few clues to the gathered journalists outside of Trump Tower. ""I would say that he's looking for someone who is independent, courageous, smart, very high quality,"" Leo said. He added that he thought Trump would move forward ""as swiftly as he can to make sure that the court's full 9-member bench is restored."" The Republican blueprint for Supreme Court nominationsTrump has often repeated that he will seek a nominee in Scalia's mold to take the seat. He's released a list of 21 potential successors -- all of whom are very conservative. Of that list, a short list is already being circulating in judicial circles emphasizing two qualities: a commitment to principles of limited government and experience outside of Washington. ""All the people who I know on the short list are going to be sympathetic to interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning,"" said Barnett. Ilya Shapiro, who works for the libertarian Cato Institute noted that the event would have been very different had Clinton won. ""It's cautious optimism now,"" he said. ""We dodged one bullet, and things should go in the right direction now."" Judges Diane Sykes, William Pryor, Thomas Hardiman, David Stras and Joan Larsen moderated panels but they kept their comments to Scalia's jurisprudence. In his remarks Thursday morning, Alito highlighted his late colleague's contributions, not only in the areas of constitutional interpretation and the structure of government, but also Scalia's impact on hot button issues such as the Second Amendment and freedom of religion. ""We've had 26 argument days"" since Scalia's death, Alito said. ""On every single one of them there has been a palpable emptiness."" Thomas was more forward-looking in a speech Thursday evening. Reading through some of Scalia's most well-known opinions, Thomas suggested that his late colleague's words should carry on.""Justice Scalia has done his part,"" Thomas said. And then he charged the audience with the responsibility of ensuring ""that these words spoken and written by Justice Scalia"" not be ""the final words.""""Rather, they ought to be a prologue,"" he said."

Vance, a former Marine and Yaw Law School graduate who wrote ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" a memoir of his childhood in a poor town in rural Ohio.Where he's from, Vance said, ""People don't pay that much attention to the day-to-day politics.""""I think what Trump will be judged on by the folks that voted for him ... is whether things start to get a little bit better over the next few years. And ultimately that doesn't depend on whether Jeff Sessions is the attorney general,"" he said, referring to the President-elect's decision that the senator from Alabama should lead the Justice Department.Trump announced his nominations Friday for top national security posts, proposing Sessions as attorney general, US Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas as CIA director and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser.Vance noted that Trump had ""rewarded the loyalists"" with his appointments so far.""But that list is getting shorter by the day,"" Vance said.""Unless he wants to appoint (his daughter) Ivanka as secretary of defense, he's got to start expanding beyond the circle,"" he added."

""The time is so short between alert and execution.""Less than 15 minutes in the case of an emergencyTrump, like other presidents before him, could have less than 15 minutes in the case of an emergency to get briefed by military aides and make a decision on whether to order a nuclear strike.""Donald Trump will have the unfettered ability to wage nuclear war,"" said Joseph Cirincione at The Ploughshares Fund, an anti-nuclear organization. ""He can launch one weapon or a thousand weapons, and no one can stop him, outside of mutiny by the armed forces.""Contrary to popular mythology, the ""nuclear football"" does not contain a button but instead the equipment and the decision-making papers that Trump would use to authenticate his orders and launch a strike.The Presidential Emergency Satchel, as it is formally called, contains four things, according to former White House Military Office Director Bill Gulley's book ""Breaking Cover.""There is a black book listing a menu of strike options; a 3-by-5-inch card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity; a list of secure bunkers where the president can be sheltered; and instructions for using the Emergency Broadcast System.On Inauguration Day, the aide with the satchel will arrive at the swearing-in accompanying President Barack Obama, and after the ceremony, will accompany Trump. Trusting Trump with nuclear codesNot everyone is comfortable with the prospect.""How can you trust him with the nuclear codes?"" Obama said at a rally in Durham, North Carolina, earlier this month. ""You can't do it.""And Bruce Blair, a former nuclear missile launch officer who supported Hillary Clinton, says his concerns about Trump persist. ""He has proved himself over and over again to be quick-tempered, defensive, prone to lash out,"" he wrote in Politico. If a nuclear crisis arises, ""Trump's erratic and volatile personality makes for low confidence in his ability to reach the right decision.""A president's order could only be stopped by mutiny, according to Kingston Reif at the Arms Control Association, and only if more than one person were to disobey the president's orders.""The president has supreme authority to decide whether to use America's nuclear weapons, period,"" he said. ""Full stop.""Trump's transition team did not respond to an inquiry to clarify his nuclear policy. But his rhetoric on the campaign trail may have fed the concerns of his national security critics.""Somebody hits us within ISIS, you wouldn't fight back with a nuke?"" he said to Chris Matthews on MSNBC in March.But he was more tempered during an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show in April. ""I will be the last to use it. I will not be a happy trigger, like some people might be,"" he said.Trump's stance on Iran worries proliferation expertsStill, Trump's disdain for the agreement with Iran to limit their nuclear program has worried proliferation experts, as has his stated openness to allies like Japan obtaining nuclear weapons of their own if they refuse to contribute more to American military protection.""Wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?"" he said to CNN in March.A few days later, he walked that back -- but only partially.""I would rather have them not armed,"" he said at a rally in Wisconsin. ""But I'm not going to continue to lose this tremendous amount of money. And frankly, the case could be made that, let them protect themselves against North Korea.""Cirincione said that Trump is undermining a decades-long American stance against nuclear proliferation. And by making America's defense of allies like South Korea and Japan contingent on their paying more to the US, he said, Trump may prompt nervous allies to wonder whether they need to obtain nuclear weapons systems of their own.""The president of the United States must be absolutely clear that we do not want them to do that,"" he said. ""That is not the path to security.""Metzger said that, in his experience at least, the president takes the responsibility of the nuclear codes very seriously.""The president is well enough rehearsed in these things to know, if I come in and look them in the eye, he or she knows there's something going on. I'm not coming in to order breakfast,"" he said.""The result of a decision the president would make is so grotesquely horrible -- it would change the face of the earth, it would change humanity, it would change mankind."""

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/donald-trump-drain-the-swamp/index.html	"That's because they've heard and seen this before.""I am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over,"" then-Sen. Barack Obama said in November 2007. His administration put a two-year ban on lobbying post-service.In 2016, Trump channeled the same anger against Washington and is proposing to build on the same policies Obama instituted. ""Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose the Trump campaign. That's because I don't need them. I don't want them. I'm going to do what's good for you,"" Trump said in Akron, Ohio, in August. ""Or some big-time lobbyist says they oppose Donald Trump's campaign. Because I don't want the lobbyists. I've had plenty of lobbyists. They do a good job. They give you whatever you want. I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.""The announcement the President-elect would ban administration officials from returning to lobbying for five years after they leave government sent shockwaves through the influence industry on Thursday, even if the exact definition of ""lobbyist"" wasn't given.The move, along with a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments, immediately introduces another disincentive for an administration already struggling to retain top talent and raises the prospect of a vibrant lobbying industry that hums along as well as ever — but underground and hidden from disclosure, not eradicated.The chaser: as under Obama, the swamp need not be drained, merely sprayed with Febreze.""The swamp is so deep in Washington that simply saying that there are some people who can have jobs in the administration but can't cash in for five years is such a weak response to the pretty significant message that America just delivered last week,"" said David Donnelly of Every Voice, one of the many good-government groups split by the new Trump guidelines. ""If this is the only thing he did, they will see that nothing has changed.""Transition officials said Wednesday that they would expand upon Obama's executive order which forbid administration officials from registering as lobbyists for two years after serving him, a rule that many influence-peddlers today say has done little to actually curb ethics breaches or impact K Street. The Trump aides added Thursday that the new policy would apply to officials looking to work for overseas governments, too, for their entire lives.Yet the worry among lobbying officials on Thursday wasn't that they would suddenly be out of a line of work. The five-year ban would merely redouble their resourcefulness as they search for workarounds that allow them to not technically classify as ""lobbyists"" once leaving the administration but rather to occupy some other very similar role in Washington officialdom.""People will escape: 'I'm a grassroots person.' 'I'm a digital person.' 'I'm this or that.' But you're actually doing the same thing I'm doing,"" said Paul Miller, a leader for a Washington lobbying trade group. ""If you implement this, you're going to have a chilling effect.""Miller said he was already fielding conversations on Thursday from concerned lobbyists worried about the emergence of a ""shadow lobbying community"" that operates free from disclosure laws meant to shine a spotlight on how influence is created and wielded in Washington. Miller said he had contacted Trump Tower on behalf of the lobbying industry but had not fetched a response.He chalked the move up to pure politics.""I have to question the motives. You had a campaign that at the 11th hour in October decided to pull out ethics reform,"" Miller argued, who said his worries spiked this week when the transition team purged its corps of lobbyists, even though they sorely needed the experience. ""You better not be skeptical. You better take this as a real threat — not just this. We are a target.""Questions remain outstanding: How will officials enforce a five-year-ban that theoretically could outlast a one-term president? Will the administration monitor and penalize lobbyists who de-register in order to avoid the stricter guidelines? And how will Trump learn from Obama, who came into Washington preaching hope and change but largely disappointed ethics-reformers who dreamed of a gridlock-free government?""They were worthy of praise, but at the same time it became pretty apparent over the next eight years that there were big holes,"" said Paul Ryan, a prominent Washington ethics reformer, of the Obama platform points. ""I would not call this cosmetic. I would say this is one small step."""	Can Trump actually drain the swamp? The answer is murky	['Paul', 'Obama', 'Donnelly', 'Trump']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/cop22-trump-ban-ki-moon/index.html	"Speaking to CNN at COP22, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged Trump to ""really work for humanity.""""I hope the President-elect Trump will really see the reality, will consult with his senior advisers and world leaders and take wise and correct decisions for their future involvement in world affairs,"" he said.""I count on the US continued engagement and leadership to make this world better for all,"" he added.Delegates, business leaders and members of state gathered in Morocco for the summit are concerned that the President-elect might pull out of the Paris Agreement, the fruit of more than two decades of international negotiations often painstaking and tortuous.Earlier this week, more than 350 US businesses including Starbucks, General Mills, Nike, Mars and Intel issued an open letter to Trump, Obama and the members of Congress, urging them to ""continue US participation in the Paris agreement,"" and warning that ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.""And on Wednesday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin reiterated that climate change was not a hoax -- a reference to Trump's 2012 claims -- adding that it's possible for Republicans to continue to support the process of addressing it. However, there were some positives from the summit. Japan, Australia and the UK formally ratified the Paris agreement, joining the US and China, the world's biggest emitters of CO2, bringing the total tally of countries that have signed up to 111. The Action Proclamation confirmed the goal for developed countries to jointly raise $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries with climate change, and stated that there's been ""extraordinary momentum on climate change worldwide, [...] driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels,"" and calls it ""irreversible."" Here's what leaders and delegates from some of the countries that are significant contributors to global emissions had to say over the last week.United StatesSecretary of State John Kerry, in a passionate speech, conveyed a firm determination to defend the Paris agreement: ""No one should doubt the overwhelming majority of citizens of the US who know climate change is happening and we are determined to keep our commitments in Paris,"" he said.Stressing that ""time is not on our side,"" Kerry urged for more action, and noted that ""At some point even the strongest skeptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening.""He then highlighted the fact that clean energy means good business: ""Most business people have come to understand that investing in clean energy makes simply economic sense. You can make money and do well at the same time.""Indirectly referring to Trump's support for the coal industry, he noted that ""Coal is the single biggest contributor to global greenhouse emissions,"" before saying that ""No one has a right to make decisions that affect billions based solely on ideology or without proper input.""His closing remark was even more direct: ""I know the election has left some uncertain about the future. I can't speculate about what policies the President-elect will pursuit, but I've learned that some issues look a little bit different when you're in office compared to campaign. Climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue in the first place.""Jonathan Pershing, the US Special Envoy on climate change, said to UN delegates that ""The transition to clean energy is inevitable.While we have many profound challenges to wrestle with, the momentum is insurmountable: there is no stopping.""FranceSpeaking at the opening ceremony on Tuesday, French Prime Minister Francois Hollande called the Paris agreement ""irreversible"" and told the US that ""as the second biggest greenhouse gas emitter, it must respect the commitments that have been made.""He added: ""Not only it is their duty, but it's also in their interest and in the interest of the American people."" ChinaBeijing took the chance to hit back at Trump's claim -- from a 2012 tweet -- that global warming is a Chinese hoax.Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin reminded reporters that climate change negotiations began with the UN's International Panel for Climate Change in the 1980s, supported by the US Republican-led administrations under Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.It was the EU and the US who brought full climate change awareness to China, he said, according to notes sent to CNN by a Chinese delegate traveling with him.Liu reiterated that climate change was not a hoax and that it was possible for Republicans to continue to support the process of addressing it, the delegate said.United KingdomSpeaking to the press, UK Climate Change and Industry Minister Nick Hurd said: ""I think it's very important that this COP sends a very clear signal to the world that everybody is still committed to the Paris Agreement.""ItalyGian Luca Galletti, the Italian Environment Minister, said in the UN plenary hall in Marrakech that ""Italy wishes to state before the nations of the world that there is no going back from the Paris agreement. We will raise the issue at the G7 in 2017, when Italy will assume the rotating presidency.""NorwayIn a panel moderated by CNN's Isa Soares, Norway's Minister of Climate Vidar Helgesen said: ""The tremendous climate leadership we've seen from the US is very likely to fade - we need to step up to protect the Paris agreement. China and the EU have already done that at this conference.""MoroccoSpeaking to CNN, COP22 President Salaheddine Mezouar said: ""The Paris accord has entered into force and that creates a responsibility for countries and civil societies. We are in a fight for our planet and our future, not a political debate. I have no doubt that the US as a responsible country will maintain its commitment.""Aziz Mekouar, Former Moroccan Ambassador to the US and member of the steering committee of COP22, said: ""I think that there is a full commitment to implement the Paris agreement and that's what we're expecting from all the countries that have ratified it.""Said Mouline, also a member of the COP22 Steering Committee member, told CNN: ""We are switching, all over the world. You cannot stop that. It's a matter of economics and it wouldn't make sense for the US to not follow. This is a transition, not a rupture.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/democrats-nuclear-option-donald-trump/index.html	"""I have absolutely no regret,"" said Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who led the charge to weaken the filibuster, freeing up scores of President Barack Obama's executive and judicial branch nominees. ""We'd never seen abuse of advice and consent in the history of our country so that was a necessary way to correct it."" Frustrated by numerous GOP filibusters against Obama's nominees, Merkley and other junior Democrats in 2013 lobbied their leaders to change the rules. Senior Democrats initially were wary of the bold step, reminding their younger colleagues that they would not be in the majority forever and that the move could come back to haunt them. But in November of that year, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democrats became convinced GOP delaying tactics were crippling Washington. They triggered the nuclear option which -- over the objections of Republicans -- lowered the threshold to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51 votes.""The supermajority was used as a tool to assault the executive branch and judicial branch and that was the only cure available was to make it a simple majority,"" recalled Merkley.Merkley has spent much of the past week targeting Trump's new chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, who the senator said should be fired for being a ""white nationalist"" who ""specializes in hate."" In news conferences, interviews, and floor speeches, Merkley and other Democrats pressed Trump to fire the controversial aide.While Bannon's west wing job doesn't require Senate confirmation, Merkley was asked by CNN if he would be sorry not to have the supermajority filibuster if Trump had named Bannon attorney general or some other top sensitive position that requires Senate approval.The liberal Merkley quoted Gandhi, who said an eye for an eye would make the whole world blind. ""If the minority is always paralyzing Congress, than Congress can never act to address problems,"" Merkley said. ""We live in a country as a democracy where a simple majority is the vision of how we make decisions. The majority makes decisions, not the minority.Other Democratic senators also stood by the nuclear option and said they would have other ways to hold accountable Trump's nominees.""I generally oppose the filibuster and I'm going to vote my conscience on these nominees, particularly when it comes to conflict of interest and qualifications for the position,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. ""But my feeling generally is that the president should have the opportunity to select his team, and if he makes mistakes, he will be held accountable and so will they.""Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, agreed. ""I think you start with the premise that presidents should have the right to name their cabinet. It's our job to do the oversight and scrutiny and review that's appropriate,"" he said. ""I'm not persuaded we should got back to the old way,"" Casey said, noting the 60-vote filibusters are still available for controversial legislation and Supreme Court nominations.However, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham argued Democrats made a huge mistake triggering the nuclear option and it will lead to more strident nominees being confirmed. ""When you go simple majority you basically turn it over to one party and many times you get the harshest of the harsh,"" Graham said. ""I think they did the Senate a disservice."""

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/donald-trump-national-security-team-sessions-flynn-pompeo/index.html	"Unveiled Friday were nominations of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director, and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security advisor. Sessions and Pompeo would be subject to Senate confirmation, while the position of national security advisor is not. All three men take an uncompromising approach to national security and differ sharply from the Obama administration's doctrine. The trio indicate that Trump intends to stand by some of his more controversial national security positions from his campaign, rather than appointing more moderate-leaning candidates. Sessions is most known for his tough stance on immigration, much like Trump, and backed the Republican presidential nominee's proposal early in the campaign to temporary block all foreign Muslims from entering the US -- a position Trump has since walked back.Flynn has a reputation for a fiery temperament and has courted controversy with his strident positions on Islam and terrorism, as well as his penchant for sending out conspiracist tweets.Pompeo, who was not a Trump supporter during the primary, co-authored an ""additional views"" report to the Benghazi Committee's report on its investigation into the diplomatic mission attack in Benghazi, believing the Republican-led committee's report was not hard enough on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. Who could serve in Trump's Cabinet?Despite Trump's anti-Beltway ""drain the swamp"" pledge, all three candidates have or have had official positions in Washington. Flynn, who was pushed out of the Defense Department in 2014, runs a firm that does lobbying. And Sessions and Pompeo come directly from Congress, which has a near-historic low approval rating. But the trio have also served as thorns in their party's side at times. Flynn was pushed out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for his contentious management style, according to US officials, though he says it was because he raised warnings about Islamic terrorism. Sessions was a leader of the opposition to the ill-fated Gang of Eight immigration reform compromise bill negotiated by his more moderate Republican colleagues and Senate Democrats. That bill passed through the Senate, but ultimately died in the House. And Pompeo pushed for more strident findings on the Benghazi Committee, which was already widely criticized by Democrats as being a politically motivated witch hunt against Hillary Clinton.In fact, Pompeo, Sessions and Flynn have been some of the toughest members of their party on Clinton's use of a private email server, with Flynn leading ""lock her up"" chants at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer and Sessions criticizing the handling of her investigation by FBI Director James Comey.As attorney general, Sessions would be ultimately in charge of the prosecutorial decisions made on investigations like the one Comey oversaw on Clinton -- and could clash with the bureau director, who is serving a 10-year term. Trump has pledged to have a special prosecutor investigate Clinton, though he has hedged on whether he will pursue that since being elected. The move to reinforce Trump's tough campaign rhetoric with his nominees comes as his transition organization has made an effort to portray the President-elect as courting moderates for other positions in the administration -- including publicizing meetings with former critics South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, both on the topic of secretary of state. But so far with the exception of GOP Chairman Reince Priebus being named chief of staff, he has drawn from outside the establishment for his Cabinet and advisers.   Flynn's son, chief of staff pushed conspiracy theories onlineHard-line positionsSessions, Pompeo and Flynn all have taken strong positions on hot-button issues.Flynn is especially critical of Islamic terror, including a vocal twitter feed on which he has written ""fear of Muslims is rational."" Sessions also defended Trump when he called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" temporarily in the face of terrorism.Trump has since walked back that position, most recently saying he will pursue a policy similar to after September 11 that requires immigrants from high-risk countries, most of which are Muslim-majority nations, to register in a tracking system.Flynn has also been criticized for his closeness to Russia, including appearing on a Russian television network and sitting alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner celebrating the network, RT. But he has said he didn't take money directly from Russia for his appearance and said he went to tell the Russians to crack down on Iran's involvement in Middle East conflicts. Sessions dogged by old allegations of racismThe willingness to engage with Russia corresponds with Trump's own positions, which drew criticism during the campaign. Trump has repeatedly expressed respect and admiration for Putin, and said he would look to work with Moscow as President.In addition to his tough position on Clinton's responsibility for the Benghazi attacks, Pompeo has advocated for strengthening the American surveillance apparatus again, calling for the restoration of surveillance powers that were curtailed in bipartisan reforms after the disclosures of Edward Snowden. ""Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed,"" he wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.  National security experienceFriday's picks come from a variety of backgrounds and have different levels of experience on issues related to foreign policy, national security and intelligence.Flynn is a former defense intelligence chief and retired lieutenant general, bringing hefty national security experience to the table. But he has also drawn criticism from within defense community ranks for his management style and for his tendency to espouse positions that are outside of mainstream intelligence and defense thinking.Sessions, who would oversee both a domestic and national security portfolio at the Justice Department, has a long legal career with experience as his state's attorney general and as a prosecutor. In the Senate he served as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Pompeo is a graduate of West Point and a veteran of the Army. He has a law degree from Harvard, founded an aerospace company and managed an oilfield service and manufacturing company before joining the House, where he serves on the House Intelligence Committee. While Pompeo has been active on issues of intelligence, he has no experience from within the actual intelligence community agencies, leaving Flynn as the most experienced member of Trump's team on national security and intelligence. Trump has not yet indicated who he will pick for other key national security posts, including at the Pentagon and to be the Director of National Intelligence.Flynn will have Trump's ear as his close adviser and will be close to the President-elect in the White House, making it likely that he will have a strong influence over the whole administration's posture.Flynn picked for national security advisor"	Donald Trump signals changing guard with national security team picks	['Haley', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Pompeo', 'Obama']	[]

Sahebjami told CNN there are a lot of parents she knows who ""don't know what to say"" to their kids after such a divisive election. The solution: let kids say things for themselves. So Sahebjami started the Facebook group ""Dear President Trump: Letters from Kids About Kindness.""  It now more than 10,000 members.The rules are simple: Be under the age of 18, be a productive communicator and explain why it's important to be kind. ""There were things that Donald Trump had said during the campaign that, beyond politics and policies, were just unkind about certain groups of people. And kids knew that,"" Sahebjami said.Many of the letters do prove her point, mentioning many of the groups that President-elect Trump may have insulted during the campaign. One letter, shared by a parent on Twitter, asks that Trump ""be President of all Americans,"" including his gay, lesbian, African-American and Hispanic friends.The group purposefully doesn't ask children to write letters to ""President-elect Trump"" because Sahebjami hopes the project will continue into Trump's presidency. Kids are also welcome to write letters to Trump's wife, Melania. ""Kindness is not a partisan issue,"" Sahebjami said. And if these letters can teach America anything after this dumpster fire of an election year, it's that it's cool to be kind.

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/trump-transition-meetings-abe/index.html	"The two men are set to discuss ""governing moving forward"" and potentially a role for Romney in Trump's Cabinet,  a senior Republican source told CNN on Thursday. Romney has long told friends that he would like to serve in government again and the one job he is interested in is secretary of state, a senior Republican with knowledge of the transition tells CNN. The source says that Romney is meeting with Trump in part to discuss it.The former Massachusetts governor is being presented as a choice that would show Trump is looking for ""adults"" because he would bring a team of professionals along with him, the source said, adding that the nomination is being seen as a ""serious"" possibility. The meeting with Romney comes as concern about Rudy Giuliani's chances of confirmation continue -- a factor, the source said, that has been discussed with Trump. It's also the latest in a series of Trump's conversations and encounters with Republicans who did not support his candidacy in an effort to reunite the GOP following a divisive election that fractured the party establishment.Trump is also maintaining a jam-packed schedule Thursday as the President-elect's team looks to tamp down reports of disarray and infighting within the transition effort, which has been slow to ramp up following Trump's shocking victory last week. One close friend expressed healthy skepticism that Romney would ever serve in the President-elect's Cabinet. Romney has often talked how his father, George, did not enjoy serving in President Richard Nixon's Cabinet. After McCain won in 2008, Romney told friends that he didn't want to go into McCain's Cabinet, if he won. ""Trump's Cabinet seems like an even lower probability,"" the friend said. ""I wouldn't say never, but I would be surprised.""A Romney appointment would be a startling shift in the two men's relationship. One former Romney adviser was surprised by the meeting, but said of Romney, ""he cares that much. He's a patriot. This isn't about Donald Trump."" Another Romney ally added that the only position that would attract him would be secretary of state. ""He's known as the economy guy, but look at his book. He is and was more involved in foreign policy issues. And he was right about everything from ISIS to Russia,"" the person said.But on Russia there is major disagreement -- at least in attitude -- between the two men. Romney, during his 2012 campaign, considered Russia an existential threat to the US, while Trump has emphasized the possibility of working closely with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Romney is pro-trade agreements and pro-NATO, while Trump has questioned the US-Europe relationship and campaigned against pacts like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific  Partnership.Trump repeatedly slammed the former GOP standard bearer during his ultimately successful bid for the a Republican nomination for his defeat to President Barack Obama, describing him in characteristically colorful terms as a failure. Romney returned fire, repeatedly and forcefully arguing that Trump was not qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. In an eviscerating speech last March, before Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Romney slammed Trump as a ""con man,"" a ""phony"" and ""a fraud.""Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Romney refused to endorse Trump in the general election. He argued In favor of allowing the Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson onto the debate stage, but did not endorse him either.Romney also actively sought to recruit a third-party candidate to carry the conservative banner into the 2016 general election and continued to level heated criticism against Trump in the general election.In a June interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Romney warned that Trump's presidency could usher in ""trickle-down racism.""Romney and Trump's meeting will come a week after Romney called to congratulate Trump on his victory, a call Trump tweeted was ""very nice!""Trump's former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Thursday she believes that Romney and Trump could work together.""I think what happens with consensus-builders and good negotiators and successful businessmen who know you have to take the counts of many different people, rivals, allies, is that they find a way to work together,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I think it will be a productive conversation."" Packed schedule to show transition is on trackTrump is meeting Thursday with more than a half-dozen potential candidates for top administration posts, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.Trump's transition spokesmen also announced Thursday he will name members of the so-called ""landing team"" of transition officials to work with US officials at the departments of State, Defense Justice and the the National Security Council. Concerns about the slow pace of the transition effort have grown in recent days as US officials at various agencies said they had still not yet established contact with the Trump transition team.Why hasn't Trump's transition team called the Pentagon?Following the national security landing team announcement Friday, the transition team will also announce early next week the names of individuals who will lead the transition with economic agencies and domestic policy agencies and groups, RNC communications director Sean Spicer said on a conference call with reporters Thursday.In the eight days since Trump's victory, the President-elect replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as chairman of the transition with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and a slew of transition officials who worked under Christie were subsequently booted from the transition effort.Trump is also scheduled to meet with his transition team for two hours on Friday to discuss their progress and go over potential appointments, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Thursday.""My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA,"" Trump tweeted.Miller declined Thursday to provide a timetable for cabinet appointments, stressing that the focus is on ""getting it right,"" rather than an ""arbitrary timetable,"" echoing the comments of Conway.""In the words of Vice President Biden just yesterday after meeting with Mr. Pence, nobody should expect the government to be formed overnight,"" Conway said Thursday morning on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Nobody is in a rush to do the wrong thing.""Trump will seek ideas on his administration from nine ""top shelf people"" he is set to meet with Thursday at Trump Tower, some of whom Miller said are ""up for cabinet positions"" -- though he did not specify which ones.Trump has announced RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff and his campaign CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor.Meetings with Haley, Kissinger, business leadersAs he focuses on filling key national security posts, Trump sought the counsel of 93-year-old former Secretary of State Kissinger. Trump met with Kissinger for a private meeting in May, but the hawkish former secretary of state has also advised Trump's presidential rival Hillary Clinton, who said she ""relied on his counsel"" during her time helming the State Department.Trump also met with Nikki Haley, the South Carolina governor who was deeply critical of Trump during the Republican primary, who is under consideration for the secretary of state post and other cabinet positions, according to a transition source.And continuing with the national security bend of the day, Trump was schedule to speak with Adm. Mike Rogers, the current director of the National Security Agency, and Gen Jack Keane, a retired four star general who advised Clinton in recent years.The President-elect will also meet with a pair of Fortune 500 CEOs, Oracle's Safra Catz and FedEx's Fred Smith, as well as Cincinnati Mayor Ken Blackwell and Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, who is under consideration to helm the Treasury Department.Shinzo AbeTrump also met Thursday afternoon in New York with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the first foreign head of state Trump met with in person since becoming president-elect.The Japanese prime minister told reporters after the meeting that he feels the two leaders will be able to maintain ""a relationship of trust.""On the stump, Trump repeatedly argued that Japan should pay a larger share of the costs for US military bases on its soil and even suggested the country should shoulder a greater burden of its defense against the aggressive actions of North Korea and provocations from China."
