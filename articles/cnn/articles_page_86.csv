But it's one moment that will haunt the Republican nominee and define the narrative heading into the campaign's last days. ""I will look at it at the time,"" Trump said when asked whether he would concede if he loses on November 8. ""I will keep you in suspense.""To emphasize the extraordinary nature of Trump's statement, Clinton responded: ""That's horrifying.""The comments -- combined with a knock on Clinton as a ""nasty woman"" and a quip about ""bad hombres"" -- is certain to dominate the political conversation in the remaining 19 days of the race. Though Clinton enjoys a commanding lead in the polls, the overwhelming narrative is likely to be about Trump's potential refusal to accept defeat and whether that could trigger a historic confrontation in the days following the election.The Republican nominee doubled down on his comments about the election Thursday during a rally in Delaware, Ohio, where he said he would accept the results ""if I win.""CNN Reality CheckExasperated Republicans have no choice but to once again weather the fallout. It's an especially tough task for Senate Republicans facing voters next month, as those who have not already disowned their party's nominee could come under renewed pressure to do so.Trump's troublesTrump's troubles have been brewing for weeks. He has been unable to move past damaging stories about his treatment of women, including a flood of recent sexual assault accusations -- allegations he denies. Trump is now trailing Clinton in the polls and confronting a rapidly narrowing path to the White House, as even reliably red states such as Arizona have become battlegrounds.The swirling controversies have only emboldened Trump, who has taken to furiously lashing out in all directions: at his accusers, the media, GOP leadership and, most recently, the political system. He is now outlandishly warning -- with no evidence -- that the election is ""rigged"" in favor of Clinton.When questioned about the women who have come forward to accuse him of having inappropriately touched them, a visibly irritated Trump was defiant, going as far as to say he believes the women are part of a Clinton set-up. ""Those stories have been largely debunked,"" Trump said, despite the fact that some of the women's stories are corroborated by others. ""It was lies and it was fiction.""Trump Jr.: Running for president a 'step down'Clinton seized the moment to remind viewers that Trump has insulted the physical appearance of his accusers. ""He said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough to be sexually assaulted,"" she said.These exchanges came after what had at first been a relatively subdued and policy-heavy debate. But it did not take long -- or much -- for Trump to lose his composure as he repeatedly interrupted Clinton and rolled his eyes from behind the podium.At one point, Trump even lashed out by calling Clinton ""such a nasty woman."" The comments were particularly remarkable given that they were discussing what should have been a relatively sleepy topic: entitlements.Missed opportunityUltimately, the debate was one more missed opportunity for Trump to tackle his biggest handicap -- the widespread perception that he lacks the temperament to be president. That could very well prove to be fatal. Trump won't have another opportunity before November 8 to reach the sheer number of people who have tuned into the debates.Even before Trump's disastrous debate performance Wednesday night, there was growing evidence that the past few tumultuous weeks had taken a serious toll on his campaign.Clinton now leads her GOP rival by eight points among likely voters, according to CNN's Poll of Polls released Wednesday. Trump's public image has also taken a hit from the recent scandals: A Bloomberg survey released on the day of the debate showed that Trump's unfavorability rating had gone up to 62% from 56% a month ago (Clinton's ticked down to 52% from 56% in September).And Trump's path to 270 electoral votes is also looking increasingly tough. Key battleground states including Florida and Nevada are now leaning in Clinton's favor, while traditionally Republican strongholds like Arizona are now in play for Clinton. Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton III: The most memorable linesWhile Trump has tried to stay afloat, Clinton has largely stayed the course. She has let Trump stew in his controversies while continuing to hammer the message that he is fundamentally unfit to be president. Her campaign has also recalibrated its resources to seize on Trump's falling momentum by expanding their map and focusing on early voting and get-out-the-vote efforts.  Trump's standing in the 2016 race has grown progressively worse through the three debates.In his first match-up against Clinton, Trump was consistently on the defensive, as his challenger needled him on everything from his temperament, refusal to release his tax returns and past comments about race and women. It was clear that Trump's lack of intense debate preparations -- including his refusal to hold mock debates -- was damaging, particularly as he went up against a veteran and practiced candidate like Clinton. Next to his opponent, Trump appeared angry and erratic.Heading into the second debate in St. Louis last weekend, Trump's critical mission was to slow the bleeding.Last strawThe damning ""Access Hollywood"" tape had become the last straw for many of Trump's fellow Republicans, who finally cut ties with the controversial nominee. Things only grew worse when multiple women came out  to accuse Trump of exactly the kind of behavior he was heard describing on that tape.But rather than using the second debate to express genuine contrition, Trump tripled down. He convened a surprise media gathering featuring women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, before saying on the debate stage: ""Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.""Following the debate, even Trump's top adviser struggled to answer for her candidate's refusal to say he would accept the results of the election.""Donald Trump will accept the results of the election because he's going to win the election,"" campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Dana Bash.Pressed by Bash on why Trump didn't say that on the debate stage -- and whether Conway will personally urge Trump to accept the outcome -- Conway grew impatient.""Absent evidence of widespread abuse and irregularities, yes, I would say that, but I actually think I'll be saying to him: 'Congratulations, Mr. President,'"" she said.Cutting the interview short, Conway walked away, telling Bash: ""I'll see you there in two weeks."""

3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/bridgegate-bill-baroni-testimony-chris-christie/index.html	"Bill Baroni, the former New Jersey Port Authority deputy executive director, is charged with fraud and conspiracy in connection to the closures and ensuing scandal that has come to be known as Bridgegate. The controversy that preceded the trial of two Christie aides permanently dented the political career of the New Jersey governor, though it never led to charges for Christie. He unsuccessfully ran for president and now serves as the transition chief to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. After several weeks of prosecution witnesses, the defense began presenting its case last week. Baroni testified Monday that David Wildstein, a former Port Authority executive and admitted mastermind of the incident, told him from the beginning that the lane closures on the Fort Lee, New Jersey, side were for a legitimate traffic study, and that this was Baroni's impression going into the week of the closures.Baroni claimed he was originally told the September 2013 lane closures were a legitimate traffic study.His testimony and cross-examination concluded Wednesday. Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, is also on trial and has yet to take the stand.September 11, 2013Baroni testified that the conversation about traffic problems he had with Christie and Wildstein at Ground Zero on September 11, 2013, was led by Wildstein.This was day three of the closures, and at this point Baroni thought the traffic was part of a study, he testified in federal court in Newark.Wildstein and Christie's discussion included whether or not more traffic could move across the bridge, which would have allowed Christie to announce that he had fixed the problem at the bridge, Baroni testified.The conversation was not about political retribution, punishment or endorsements, Baroni testified.Federal prosecutors pulled up a photo of the three men laughing at Ground Zero and asked Baroni if they were laughing about the lane closures.""Absolutely not,"" Baroni said to the jury.'Radio silence'Wildstein previously testified that Baroni led this conversation and that it centered around the traffic and Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich not receiving phone calls back from the Port Authority despite his numerous pleas for help. Much of the controversy focuses on the claim that the lane closures were meant to punish Sokolich for not endorsing Christie's 2013 re-election bid.Christie has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or involvement, and he has never been charged with any crime related to the handling of the incident. On the first morning of the lane closures, September 9, 2013, Baroni testified that he was instructed by Wildstein to remain silent towards Sokolich.""Radio silence,"" Wildstein told Baroni in an email, in spite of a message Sokolich left Baroni earlier that morning expressing concern for an ""urgent matter of public safety.""Baroni wanted to call the mayor back, but when Baroni got in touch with Wildstein, Wildstein said if Baroni spoke to Sokolich, Baroni might end up ruining the study, or ""wimp out"" because Baroni and Sokolich were close.Wildstein told Baroni that he would ""handle it"" and that the study was too important to the governor's office. Baroni believed him, according to Baroni's testimony.Baroni received more texts and voicemails from Sokolich as the week progressed, and Baroni felt frustrated because he wanted to reach out to Sokolich, according to his testimony.'Punitive overtones'On September 12, 2013, Baroni received a letter from Sokolich saying Sokolich felt there may be ""punitive overtones"" to the lane closures. Baroni testified that he went to Wildstein and asked if there was any truth to the accusation.""David, tell me right now, is this true?"" Baroni asked.Wildstein looked Baroni in the eye and replied, ""Absolutely not,"" according to Baroni's testimony, and Baroni believed him.On September 13, 2013, Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye emailed Baroni and several others expressing anger about what was happening at the bridge. Foye also ordered the lanes be reopened on September 13. Foye has previously testified that he knew nothing about the lane issue until late in the week.Baroni forwarded Foye's email to Wildstein who then got former Port Authority chairman and Christie ally, David Samson, involved. Samson did not have a good relationship with Foye, and Samson ordered Baroni to ask Foye to close the lanes again, according to Baroni's testimony. Foye refused.Baroni testified that he became seriously concerned that what he had understood to be a New Jersey traffic situation was now rising to the executive director and senior staffers in Christie's office.In response to several questions from his attorneys and federal prosecutors, Baroni testified he believed what Wildstein told him -- that this was a traffic study and that Wildstein would take care of it -- and that to this day he regrets not calling Sokolich.Baroni said at the time he believed the statistics and information in the report to be accurate. Wildstein testified earlier in the trial that the information in the report was intentionally misleading.Wildstein previously testified that Baroni was his boss, but Baroni testified Monday that while Wildstein was below him on the staff flow chart, Wildstein did not report to him. Rather, Wildstein reported to the governor's office, Baroni testified.Wildstein also said he considered Baroni one of his closest friends. Baroni said this week that this was not the case.""I don't define a friend as someone who would lie to me over and over and over,"" he said, a comment that was objected to by prosecutors in court."

""So you look at all that stuff, and you say, I'd be a little bit cautious about automatically accepting that Hillary Clinton will be legitimately anything,"" Gingrich said. ""We are in the worst cycle of corruption in American history, and in many ways, we resemble Venezuela and Argentina more than we resemble traditional America.""Trump in recent days has pointed the finger at the media and made claims that there is widespread voting fraud to argue that the election will be rigged if he loses. There is no evidence to support Trump's claim of an illegitimate election.Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov.

""Because based on what she is saying, and based on where she's going and where she's been, you can take a baby and rip the baby out of the womb. In the ninth month, on the final day and that's not acceptable.""While Clinton has said she believes a fetus lacks constitutional rights, she did vote against a ban on late-term abortions in 2003 while serving as a senator from New York.""The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make,"" Clinton said in the debate Wednesday night, adding that Trump was using ""scare rhetoric.""CNN's complete Reality Check of the final debate""I have met with women who have, toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one can get -- that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy,"" she said. ""I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions."" Roe v. Wade, decided by the Supreme Court in 1973, made abortions legal during the entire term of a pregnancy, but put restrictions on the procedure during the second and third trimesters. Clinton does believe mothers should be allowed to terminate a pregnancy at any point -- up until birth -- if her life is in danger, but abortions as late in a pregnancy as Trump suggests are almost unheard of. We therefore rate Trump's claim as true, but misleading.Reality Check: Trump justices would overrule Roe v. WadeBy Steve Vladeck, CNNTrump also claimed that the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade would be overruled by justices he would appoint to the Supreme Court ""automatically,"" but that statement is belied by history.Although Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush appointed justices who they believed would overrule the 1973 decision recognizing a woman's constitutional right to choose an abortion, three of those appointees -- Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter -- famously voted to preserve the Roe decision in 1992.Even if a President Trump were only to appoint ""pro-life"" justices, there is simply no way to ensure that any particular decision, including Roe, would be ""automatically"" overruled.Verdict: False."

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/rodrigo-duterte-us-interests-philippines/index.html	"After White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that Duterte's comments were ""creating unnecessary uncertainty in our relationship"" and hadn't been clarified, Duterte himself explained them in a way that will do little to ease US concerns or the sudden tensions between the allies of 70 years.  ""It is not severance of ties,"" Duterte said at a press conference Friday on his return from a state visit to China. ""You say severance of ties, you cut the diplomatic relations. I cannot do that. I said separation -- what I was really saying was separation of a foreign policy.""The Philippines leader's comments risk disrupting not just US ties to his country, but US ties to the larger Asia-Pacific, a region that President Barack Obama has made a central pillar of his foreign policy ambitions as he looks to anchor the US in the Pacific century.Unusually sharp comments from Earnest earlier Friday about a Filipino official's attempts to clarify Duterte's ""separation"" remarks may reflect White House uneasiness about the implications of the country's stance. Philippine Trade Minister Ramon Lopez said Friday that his country would not stop trade and investment with the US. ""The statement the President made maintains the relationship with the West. What we are saying is that there will be less dependence just on one side of the world,"" Lopez told CNN.Asked about Lopez's comments, Earnest said ""I've dubbed that person the Filipino Mike Pence,"" a reference to the Republican vice presidential candidate, who has often walked back or cleaned up comments by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Duterte had announced the ""separation"" from the US during a visit to Beijing Thursday, specifically citing both military and economic ties in a move that surprised the Obama administration, raised questions about the US role in the region and threatened a realignment of US relationships in Asia. RELATED: In China, Duterte announces split with US: 'America has lost'  ""America has lost now,"" Duterte said at a business forum Thursday during a four-day state visit to Beijing. ""I've realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world -- China, Philippines and Russia. It's the only way.""Duterte's declaration is the latest indication that the Philippines' president, just five months into his six-year term, intends to reshape his country's ties to its closest ally by doubling down on his pivot away from the US and toward China.Given the Philippines' crucial importance to US foreign policy goals in Asia -- including its military bases, a regional maritime security initiative and efforts to help smaller Asian countries resist pressure from the regional behemoth of China -- Duterte's clarification on Friday is not likely to provide much comfort. ""The key question is whether Duterte is going to rescind our access to our bases in the Philippines,"" said Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.The Obama administration's maritime security initiative with Southeast Asian countries, with a major role for the Philippines, is aimed in part at helping those countries resist Chinese pressure as Beijing aggressively pursues territorial claims in the South China Sea.The loss of the Philippines bases would be ""a significant blow,"" said Manning, a former official at the State Department and National Intelligence Council.""If the Philippines are out -- and they're in the thick of it -- that starts to raise questions about our whole approach"" to the region, he said.An administration official said it still wasn't clear what Duterte's rhetoric would actually mean in practice, particularly since several senior voices in the Philippine government have walked back his comments -- a pattern the White House has noted in recent weeks. The official said the White House will seek more clarity and that they expect the subject to come up during a visit over the next few days by the State Department's senior diplomat on Asia. Daniel Russel, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, heads to the Philippines Friday as part of a long-planned trip to meet with government officials and do youth outreach.On Friday, Duterte joked that he couldn't say who his favorite US presidential candidate was because it could affect ""these splendid relations with the Americans."" Instead, he quipped that his ""favorite hero is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.""Though the White House is trying to emphasize the positive aspects of the longstanding relationship with the Southeast AsianRELATED: Duterte's tongue the least of Obama's Philippine problem  State Department spokesman John Kirby said the US would seek an explanation for the President's comments, which the US hadn't known were coming.He described them as ""yet another string in some pretty strong rhetoric that we think, we believe is at odds with the kind of relationship that we have had and continue to have the Filipino people.""Duterte's stated break from the US comes on the heels of other anti-US moves and rhetoric.He recently called for ending joint military drills with the US, in August he described the US ambassador as ""a gay son of a whore,"" and in September he dismissed President Barack Obama himself as a ""son of a bitch"" -- in part a response to US criticism of his war on drugs, which killed 2,400 people in two months.If Duterte is realigning his county with China on an economic and even military level, ""that would have potentially fundamental implications for the future of the Philippines and Philippine-US relations,"" according to Jamie Metzl, another Atlantic Council senior fellow.The US and Philippines operate under a 1951 mutual defense treaty, which Duterte has said he doesn't plan to abrogate. Metzl pointed out that doing so would require approval of the Philippine parliament, in a country with ""one of the most pro-US and anti-Chinese populations in Asia.""RELATED: Is Duterte scaring away investors?Senior US officials told CNN Duterte may have been grandstanding in China, but it's not yet clear where he's headed.Duterte's stance may be driven by a sense that the US presence in the Philippines diminishes his country's standing, they said. He may also feel threatened by US questions about his approach to human rights and the drug war.Sandy Pho, a senior program associate at the Wilson Center, agreed that Duterte resents US power in the Philippines.""I think Duterte comes into the presidency with this mindset,"" she said. But she also pointed to a perception in Asia that the US is bogged down in the Middle East.""The US can't focus"" is the sense, she said, ""so quite frankly, he's hedging his bets, thinking an overreliance on the United States probably isn't the best bet.""Either way, the Obama administration realizes that the relationship it once had with Manila can no longer be taken for granted.""He's going to be difficult,"" one official said.In its initial response to Duterte's announcement in China, the White House stressed the positive.Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said that the ""US-Philippines alliance is built on a 70-year history, rich people-to-people ties, including a vibrant Filipino-American diaspora, and a long list of shared security interests."" She also cited strong economic ties, including more than $4.7 billion in US foreign direct investment.Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington on October 11, the State Department's Russel said that while there have been ""ups and downs"" between the two countries, the various links ""keep us very closely tethered together.""The US has no problem with the Philippines engaging with China, he added: ""We don't regard this as zero sum, but we value our relationship with the Philippines and we want to keep it on even keel.""Obama has focused considerable diplomatic energy on the US relationship with Asia during his two terms, seeing greater engagement with the world's fastest growing economies as a source of American jobs and exports.The President's ""pivot"" to Asia was also seen as a way to integrate China into an international order with rules that the US and Western allies have set -- as opposed to rules Beijing might favor -- on core issues like human rights, labor protections and the environment.All the while, tensions between China and its smaller Asian neighbors over the resource-rich South China Sea have been escalating. The US has urged that these conflicts be solved through international institutions and multilateral talks, and backed Duterte's predecessor when he took China to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.The court ultimately rejected Beijing's claims to the Spratly Islands, but in August, Duterte signaled that he's willing to go along with China's desire to ignore the ruling and have bilateral talks ""within the year.""The US held the Philippines as a colony from 1898 until 1946. Around a quarter-century ago, Manila's leaders pushed to have US troops leave the country.Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino, reversed course on a US security presence in his country in 2014 in the face of China's regional muscle-flexing, signing an agreement that would place more ships in Philippine ports.Kirby said that the US isn't the only country taken aback by Duterte's move.""It isn't just the United States who is baffled by this rhetoric,"" Kirby said. ""We have heard from many of our friends and partners in the region who are likewise confused about where this is going, and also, we believe, are trying to learn more on their own about what it portends."" "	White House: 'Filipino Mike Pence' walks back Duterte's words

The ""process of presidential authentication with the Pentagon war room and the formatting of a launch order by the war room prior to its dissemination to the Minuteman firing crews would add another 1 minute or so, for a grand total of 4-5 minutes.""And Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, which specializes in nuclear issues, tweeted out public references to the same assertions regarding timing.But even if the information is publicly available, those with clearances cannot reveal anything they learn in a classified setting.Asked about the sensitivity of this specific information, US Strategic Command, which oversees the US nuclear arsenal, declined to weigh in on the specifics.""We do not disclose operational timelines, but we do work to provide the President as much decision space as possible,"" Capt. Brook DeWalt, chief spokesperson for Strategic Command, told CNN in a statement.Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who appeared at news conference with his South Korean counterpart Thursday, demurred on a similar question about whether such information was classified, saying that the question was ""cast in terms of the ongoing presidential campaign."""
