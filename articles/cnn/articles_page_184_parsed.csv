November 8 is just under two months away, but in states like Iowa, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, Election Day is much, much closer. Early voting -- both in-person and by absentee ballot -- has exploded in recent presidential elections.Clinton's campaign is banking on a huge organizational advantage over Trump's camp -- one built on a steep investment in analytics and field organizing from her launch in early 2015, and on lessons learned by President Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 races. In 2012, more than half of all Florida ballots -- nearly 4.5 million -- were cast by mail or in-person before Election day,  with 43% coming from registered Democrats and 39% from Republicans, according to Florida Division of Elections. In North Carolina, 2.7 million people voted early -- 48% Democrats and 32% Republicans. When and where to vote earlyHelping Clinton's camp: It's already made contacts, often multiple times, with her potential supporters in swing states, and has used Clinton, running mate Tim Kaine and top surrogates to underscore key early voting dates to top backers and volunteers at campaign events. As of August 29, Clinton's campaign had 34 field offices in Florida for every one of Trump's, and it has double the number of field offices as Trump's in Ohio.""You should be ready,"" said Jeremy Bird, Obama's national field director in 2012 and a Clinton consultant. ""You should be starting to do dry runs for get-out-the-vote in any state that has early vote starting in October. Your operation should be ready to turn out the vote.""Early voting is particularly popular among minority voters — a critical Democratic constituency — and older voters who might look to cast their ballots when lines are shorter. And while the results won't be released until polls close November 8, many states have historically released party breakdowns on the voters who have cast their ballots early. That information provides a gauge of where the election stands -- and helps each campaign decide where to focus the bulk of its attention headed into Election Day. ""It allows you to run Election Day multiple times. You don't just have one bite at the apple -- you have multiple bites,"" Bird said. ""You're able to see every single day who is turning out, and then basically you're shrinking your list (of targeted voters) every day.""A total of 37 states, plus the District of Columbia, allow their voters to cast ballots by mail or in-person before the November 8 election with no excuse for missing Election Day required. Elections officials began mailing absentee ballots in North Carolina last week. Iowa starts early voting on September 29.  Ohio and Arizona begin early voting on October 12, with Georgia coming five days later and Nevada on October 22. In Colorado, where voters will receive their ballots by mail, they can return them in-person starting October 24. Wisconsin, Florida and North Carolina's in-person locations will all open by Halloween. In many of those states, more than half of all voters could cast their ballots early -- before the second and third presidential debates, set for October 9 and October 19, take place. Jeff Weaver, who ran Bernie Sanders' primary campaign, said Clinton's early voting operation was already finely-tuned in their winter and spring contests. He credited Clinton's campaign with cultivating deep ties with local Democratic groups, African-American churches and Democratic activists and loyalists who play outsized roles in pushing voters in their communities to vote early. Early voting ""requires a tremendous amount of infrastructure and a particular kind of organizing that they were just very good at,"" Weaver said of Clinton's operation. ""Their early voting operation was extremely effective -- and I can't think of an exception.""Mitch Ceasar, the Democratic chair in Broward County -- Florida's most Democratic county -- pointed to Bill Clinton's recent trip there to meet with black ministers as evidence of the Clinton campaign's targeted outreach. ""The local parties have been activated to register new voters, and are also chasing people who have also voted in the past but maybe missed a cycle,"" he said, referring to Democratic-leaning voters who cast ballots in 2012 but skipped the 2014 midterm cycle. Trump's campaign, meanwhile, is rapidly expanding its own footprint, opening new field offices in swing states under the leadership of new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. Most of its data collection has come from Trump's massive rallies, which can draw up to 20,000 supporters. The pro-Trump turnout operation is mostly being run by the Republican National Committee, which has claimed to make major gains in voter data and targeting since the 2012 race.  ""The RNC has been leading the field efforts since 2013, and we're working hand-in-glove with the Trump campaign, and we're focused on the entire ticket,"" said Lindsay Walters, an RNC spokeswoman. ""We've been on the ground engaging with voters, collecting data and voter files for well over 1,000 days longer than Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, and we've seen the return in voter registration.""The party has dramatically expanded its field presence since 2012, as well. Then, the RNC had 576 staffers on the ground; now, it boasts 6,000. In calls with Trump campaign aides, including David Bossie, the newly-hired deputy campaign manager, Trump officials have praised the RNC's turnout efforts. National Republican officials acknowledge that Democrats' historical advantage in early voting will be impossible to erase -- in part because Democrats' more urban voter base makes early voting events in which backers are encouraged to make a group trip to the polls that day much easier for the party's allies to pull off. But Republicans point to voter registration in Florida and Pennsylvania, where data shows the GOP has significantly narrowed the gap since 2012. ""When it comes to this cycle versus '12, engaging with voters face-to-face has proven to be a more successful model in turning out low propensity voters, than it is to be sitting in an office phone-banking,"" Walters said.

It was part of an overhaul of the state electoral system. But in 2013, Republicans moved to cut back early voting from 35 days to 28 days.Democrats charge that Republicans pushed for the new law because a disproportionate numbers of African Americans, who were exerting a growing political influence in the state in support of President Barack Obama, had come to rely upon more early vote opportunities.In court papers, Marc Elias, a lawyer for the Ohio Democrats, said that ""Golden Week has formed an essential part of the election reforms that ameliorated, but did not completely remedy, the long lines, chaos and confusion that plagued the 2004 presidential election in Ohio.""Elias, who also serves as general counsel for the Clinton campaign, argued, ""Tens of thousands of Ohio voters have relied on Golden Week during the past two presidential elections, and African-Americans have done so at far higher rather than other voters."" Lawyers for Ohio had urged the court to leave the lower court opinion undisturbed. They argued that even without Golden Week the state had generous early vote opportunities compared to most other states. ""Ohio remains a ""national leader when it comes to early voting opportunities,"" the state's Attorney General Mike DeWine argued in court papers. Earlier this year, a federal district judge said the state must reinstate Golden Week. A federal appeals court reversed that last month, in part citing the options Ohio gives for early voting.  ""The issue is not whether some voter somewhere would benefit from six additional days of early voting or from the opportunity to register and vote at the same time,"" Judge David McKeague of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, wrote in the opinion. ""Rather, the issue is whether the challenged law results in a cognizable injury under the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. We conclude that it does not.""The law afforded ""abundant and convenient opportunities for all Ohioans to exercise their right to vote,"" the court added.Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch, writing in dissent, said she agreed with the district's court finding in May that the law ""improperly burdens the right to vote of African-American citizens of Ohio and constitutes a violation equal protection.""McKeague and Judge Richard Allen Griffin were appointed by President George W. Bush, while Stanch is a nominee of Obama."	Supreme Court won't reinstate Ohio's 'Golden Week' of early voting	['Allen', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/donald-trump-foundation-charity/index.html	"But when it comes to his own charity -- The Donald J. Trump Foundation -- the Republican presidential nominee has not donated any money since his last contribution in 2008.A review of the Trump Foundation's tax records by CNN finds that although the charity has received more than $4 million in contributions from other organizations and individuals and in turn donated millions to various charitable causes since 2009, Trump has not made any personal contributions to the foundation in that time.The charity appears to have functioned in recent years as a conduit that disburses money donated by third-parties, such as World Wrestling Entertainment, which donated $1 million in 2009, and $500,000 in 2012 from NBC Universal, the company that contracted Trump's show ""The Apprentice.""Philanthropy experts describe the practice as irregular since private family foundations traditionally fund charitable causes at least in part through their founder's personal wealth. ""It's uncommon for a private foundation with somebody's name on it to not be receiving contributions from that individual,"" said Richard Marker, a philanthropy professor at the University of Pennsylvania.Marker said that although unusual, the practice is not illegal if other requirements are met. He noted that many foundations accept contributions from private individuals and organizations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has received large sums from investor Warren Buffet, but Marker pointed out that Bill Gates also contributes to the charity.In recent years, Trump's foundation has disbursed money to dozens of organizations, some with connections to Trump, such as $100,000 donated in 2012 to the Citizens United Foundation, the foundation arm of Citizens United, whose president, David Bossie, became the Trump campaign's deputy manager.Between 2009 and 2010, Trump's charity donated $150,000 to The Palm Beach Police Foundation, an organization that supports police officers in the Florida county where Trump owns property.Yet The Washington Post reports Trump earlier went to New Jersey and asked the foundation of deceased businessman Charles Evans for a donation on behalf of the police foundation. Tax records show the Evans foundation donated $150,000 to Trump's foundation in the years following, in effect covering some of Trump's charitable contributions to the police organization.Additionally, The Palm Beach Police Foundation has hosted annual fundraiser balls at Trump's ritzy Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, yet the police charity paid to rent Trump's club, such as $276,463 paid to the club in 2014.In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Trump's foundation said Trump has donated tens of millions of dollars to charities both through his Foundation and otherwise.""Mr. Trump serves the Foundation without compensation and additionally makes regular personal contributions to charities and causes of his choosing outside of the Foundation. All in all, the Foundation supports many worthy causes, and the Foundation distributes its funds to get the money into the hands of those in need as soon as possible,"" the spokesperson said.Between 2001 and 2008, Trump personally contributed about $2.8 million to his foundation, tax records show.Scrutiny on Trump's foundation comes amidst Republican criticism and government watchdog questions surrounding the Clinton Foundation. Trump has called for a special prosecutor to investigate what he says was undue influence over Hillary Clinton's actions as secretary of state.While both foundations raise funds for charity, the Clinton Foundation functions as an organization with hundreds of staffers who implement and direct programs in various countries, while the Trump foundation makes contributions to other organizations with their own operations.The Trump foundation has no paid staffers but lists four members of the Trump family, including Donald, Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr, along with Trump Organization staffer Allen Weisselberg, as officers.According to tax filings, the Clinton Foundation had more than $300 million in assets in 2014, compared to more than $1 million held by Trump's foundation that year.Still, Janet Camarena, the director of transparency initiatives at the Foundation Center, a nonprofit that analyzes philanthropies, says both of the foundations can be seen as celebrity charities that solicit donations through the large network and name recognition of their founders.""This can actually be common in the world of celebrity charity. The giving becomes a vehicle of the brand,"" Camarena said, drawing the distinction that the Clinton Foundation has stated purposes for its projects while the Trump foundation has not disclosed a particular strategy. Despite their differences, and in contrast to the tension of the current presidential campaign, Trump's foundation has donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation."

The incident has been seized upon by members of both parties as an example of government mismanagement and America's aging infrastructure.Critical counties: Genesee, Michigan, and the 2016 electionTrump spoke to The Detroit News about the water crisis earlier this month.""I think it's a horror show that it was allowed to happen, and to be honest with you, it should have never, ever been allowed to happen,"" Trump told the paper. ""That was really the problem.""Throughout most of his campaign, however, the real estate mogul has rarely addressed the crisis or offer his views, including whether Rick Snyder, the state's Republican governor, should resign amid mounting pressure.When he was asked in January as the crisis gained national media attention about the situation, Trump said he ""shouldn't be commenting.""""Well it's a shame what's happening in Flint, Michigan. A thing like that shouldn't happen, but again I don't want to comment on that. They've got a very difficult problem,"" Trump said then.And in an interview with a local Michigan TV station on the morning of the state's primary, Trump called it a ""catastrophic event,"" but declined to say whether he believed Snyder should resign.More than 40% of Flint's 98,310 residents live below the poverty line. And more than half are African-American, a historically strong Democratic voting bloc that Trump has recently appealed to on the campaign trail. His visit to Flint will come one day after the airing of an interview he gave with the minister of a predominantly black church he visited in Detroit earlier this month.Flint's most high profile moment in the 2016 election came in March when the city hosted a debate between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her primary rival, Bernie Sanders.Clinton spoke in Flint earlier this year, arguing that had the water crisis had happened in a rich Detroit suburb, the response would have been faster and more effective.""I think every single American should be outraged,"" she said in January. ""We've had a city in the United States of America where the population, which is poor in many ways and majority African-American, has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care.""Clinton has been criticized, namely by Snyder, for politicizing the water crisis."

The Democrats specifically cite anti-bribery laws in their request.The donation gained new attention following reports that Trump agreed to pay a $2,500 fine to the IRS because he originally gave to Bondi's campaign from his charity, the Trump Foundation.The request also comes as new questions were raised in a Washington Post report about whether Trump has donated as much to charity as he claims. The Trump campaign has repeatedly declined to provide evidence of his donations.Trump running mate Mike Pence told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Monday that Trump has donated millions of dollars to charity. ""Anyone who knows anything about Donald Trump and his career knows that this is a man who's given away tens of millions of dollars to charitable causes throughout the course of his business life -- he's been incredibly generous,"" Pence said.

Jeffrey Harrigian, the commander of the US Air Force's Central Command, told reporters that 12 aircraft in all were used to hit the facility, which also served as an ISIS headquarters, at 50 different points.""We don't know for sure at this point"" what chemicals were involved, Harrigian said at a Pentagon briefing.The strike follows a United Nations-backed report issued last month that found that both the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ISIS have used chemical weapons in the five-year-long war that has ripped the country apart. The year-long investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found in August that Syria's government -- in particular its air force -- had used chlorine gas at least twice since 2013. It also pointed the finger at ISIS for a mustard gas attack. At the time, National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the US-led anti-ISIS coalition had placed ""a high priority on targeting"" ISIS chemical weapons capabilities. ""We will continue to remove leaders from the battlefield with knowledge of these weapons and will target any related materials and attempts to manufacture such chemicals going forward,"" Price said last month. Harrigian said the attack on the ISIS chemical facility took place Monday in the vicinity of Mosul. The aircraft involved included F-15s, A-10s, F-18s, F-16s and a B-52, he said. A ""red line""The use of chemical weapons in Syria has been a point of intense international concern and political minefield for the Obama administration. In 2012, President Barack Obama declared the use of chemical weapons a ""red line"" that would change his calculus on military intervention in Syria's civil war. When he decided not to take action in August 2013 after the Syrian regime attacked a Damascus suburb with sarin gas, Middle Eastern and European allies, political opponents and even Democrats decried that decision.  The US instead pursued a 2013 agreement with Russia to rid Syria of lethal chemical agents that eventually led to the disposal of 1,200 pounds of deadly material. That agreement allowed the Syrian regime to keep chlorine, which has non-military uses. Since weaponized chlorine is considered a chemical weapon, Syria's use violated UN resolutions and the US-Russia agreement."	US bombs ISIS chemical weapons plant	['Obama']	[]

""We've had correspondence with them. I didn't make a big deal out of it or hold a press conference. But we have been looking into the Trump Foundation to make sure it's complying with the laws governing charities in New York.""The inquiry comes amid a series of reports by The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity, The Donald J. Trump Foundation, on himself, used it to recycle others' contributions to make them appear to have come from him and hasn't given to the foundation since 2008.In another article, The Post had reported that the recipients of five charitable contributions listed by the Trump Foundation had no record of receiving those donations. But the newspaper updated its report after CNN questioned the accuracy of three of the five donations it had cited. ""My interest in this issue really is in my capacity as regulator of non-profits in New York state, and we have been concerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view,"" Schneiderman said.The Trump campaign called Schneiderman ""a partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years and has endorsed Hillary Clinton.""""This is nothing more than another left-wing hit job designed to distract from (Hillary Clinton's) disastrous week,"" said Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman in a statement.A source familiar with Schneiderman's actions said the New York attorney general's office is conducting ""an inquiry into the Trump Foundation about troubling transactions that we've seen.""The IRS fined the Trump Foundation $2,500 earlier this month for making a $25,000 political donation to a group supporting the campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. At the time, Bondi's office was reviewing allegations into Trump University and considering opening an investigation.A formal investigation was never opened, and Trump and Bondi have both said there was no wrongdoing and said the donation was not tied to any favors. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday sent a letter asking Attorney General Loretta Lynch to open an investigation into the Trump donation to Bondi.The New York attorney general's office and Trump's foundation have been corresponding since June, four letters CNN obtained from a source familiar with the correspondence show. The correspondence begins with a June 9 letter from the attorney general's office to both Trump's presidential campaign and his foundation.

Weisselberg asserts the foundation and Trump learned of the mistake in March 2016 after seeing it in the media and Trump paid the excise tax due with a personal check. ""This was an isolated occurrence,"" Weisselberg added. ""From January 1, 2013 to the present, there have been no other similar incidents.""Goldman replies in a July 15 letter asking for all documentation related to the ""And Justice for All"" contribution.On July 25, the attorney general's office receives a letter from Sheri A.
