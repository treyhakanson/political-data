Kaine wants ensure Hillary Clinton can solidify her post-debate gains in several swing states and in national polls. Here are five things to watch when the vice presidential nominees sit down for their only debate:How will Pence respond to Trump's troubles?On releasing tax returns, birtherism, debate prep and name-calling, Pence has chosen to go his own way during the campaign.  He has also talked about his record in Indiana as a conservative governor. That daylight has left Trump in a somewhat awkward position and it's allowed Pence to maintain a future in politics. But breaking with your opponent in a studio interview is one thing, doing it on stage next to an opponent who wants to pummel your running mate is something else entirely. Pence has to defend Trump, who is boasting about ""brilliantly"" using tax laws for his benefit, after a New York Times story outlining a more than $900 million loss and suggesting he may not have paid federal income taxes for 18 years beginning in 1995. Look for Kaine to possibly exploit the fact that Pence has been transparent in releasing his taxes, compared to Trump who hasn't released them and is the nominee. And the Virginia senator will no doubt talk about Trump's temperament as commander-in-chief.Pence will go on the attack against Clinton's policy record. Trump missed opportunities at the first debate to go after Clinton on obvious lines of attack like the Clinton Foundation and Benghazi. Pence, a former talk-show host, won't make the same mistake. ""Hillary's record on foreign affairs alone could literally take up the entire 90 minutes and it wouldn't be pretty,"" he told supporters Monday night.QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump?How personal does it get? Donald Trump and his surrogates have spent the last week suggesting that this race will get nastier. Trump hinted that the next big debate topic would be the Clinton's marriage. He questioned Saturday night whether Clinton was loyal to her husband -- without offering any evidence that she isn't -- and mimicked her stumbling to a car when she was ill with pneumonia. Meanwhile, Clinton and her surrogates have hammered Trump over comments he made about a former beauty pageant and for pushing birtherism. Focusing too much on personality -- rather than substance -- could further turn off swing voters. But for Kaine, picking up the baton from Clinton, who had a successful performance, that could mean getting more distance in the polls. And for Pence, floating Clinton's marital troubles could lay the groundwork for Trump as a kind of trial balloon.And also look for Kaine to highlight Pence's record on LGBT issues to paint the GOP ticket as out of step with swing voters. ""I've been in elected life for 22 years, it's not knowing another fact, but it is about thinking hard about the material, thinking hard about Pence's record, and also what Pence's record would say about the guy who chose him, since it really is more about Donald Trump than it is about Gov. Pence,"" Kaine said about his approach to the debate.Can they help close the likeability gap?Clinton and Trump both have record high unfavorability ratings: the latest CNN/ORC poll puts Clinton's at 54% and Trump's at 59%. Both VP candidates may try to sand off some of the rough edges and make people more open to backing their ticket.Pence has argued that Trump is a decent and good man worthy of comparisons to Ronald Reagan. He has talked about quiet moments of prayer and reflection with Trump. And Kaine has vouched for Clinton's honesty and said that he can brag about Clinton in a way that Clinton can't brag about herself. But it is one thing to say good things about their running mates, and it's another to show it. And this is where stories and anecdotes -- something this campaign has been short on -- can be helpful. Some of that was featured at the conventions this summer, with family members vouching for the candidates. For swing voters, who are sitting on the fence out of disgust with both candidates, humanizing and memorable portraits could be helpful.   A debate surprise? In the first debate, Clinton introduced Alicia Machado, a beauty queen who Trump disparaged for gaining weight. She also got Trump to say it was ""smart"" that he possibly didn't pay federal income taxes. Both subjects have ended up in campaign ads and underscored Clinton's argument against Trump in new ways. Pence and Kaine have the same opportunity. Trump failed to bring up Benghazi and the Clinton Foundation in his debate, and didn't break much new ground on the e-mail scandal either. A recent North Carolina poll shows that a majority of voters in that crucial swing state are bothered a lot by those issues. Clinton didn't talk much about Trump making his products out of the country. So Pence and Kaine both have opportunities. The key is to cover old ground in new ways, either by using catchy phrasing (Clinton's ""Trumped-up trickle down"" was not so catchy), or by introducing actual new information. Clinton clearly had studied Trump's record. Pence and Kaine have a chance to frame an old issue in a new way, but it means hitting the briefing book and figuring out how and when to drop it in a debate. Both should study Clinton's playbook. Does anyone make it to Saturday Night Live? Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon have their hands full with Trump and Clinton. But surely there is room on the SNL stage for their running mates? Yes, Kaine and Pence are boring by comparison. That is their purpose in this race, to soften their running mates. Pence says he isn't a name-caller. Kaine embraces his suburban dadness. They are standard issue politicians from the pre-Trump era. And perhaps that's where the funny is -- Kaine and Pence as a nice-and-nicer duo beleaguered by the foibles of their running mates. SNL's writing crew will be watching. Tuesday night could turn into a Saturday Night cold open. Casting tip: Bobby Moynihan as Kaine and Beck Bennett as Pence.Or perhaps ""Hamilton"" creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda, who is hosting."

He was assigned to Company B, 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort Carson, Colorado,  the Department of Defense said.""We are heartbroken by this loss, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the service member,"" Gen. John W. Nicholson, commanding officer for US forces in Afghanistan, said in a written statement Tuesday before Thomas' name was released.He was killed during a patrol with Afghan forces when an improvised explosive device was triggered.The incident took place in the Achin district of Nangarhar Province as part of a counter terrorism mission going after the ISIS branch in Afghanistan.  An investigation into the incident is underway, the Department of Defense said.""Despite this tragic event, we remain committed to defeating the terrorists of the Islamic State ...  and helping our Afghan partners defend their nation,"" Nicholson said in the statement.At a briefing with reporters at the Pentagon, Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said Defense Secretary Ashton Carter had spoken with Nicholson about the attack, and added there was no indication the US service member had been specifically targeted.Earlier this year, the Pentagon granted new legal authority to allow US forces in Afghanistan to go after ISIS elements inside the country. Essentially, the change allowed for US forces to pursue ISIS elements and attack them as a threat to America. Previous rules of engagement required ISIS elements to first pose a threat to US forces in the area or to be pursued as part of a specific counter-terrorism mission, officials said.""This is an effort to try and address a threat not only to the Afghan people and the Afghan government but a larger threat to the United States and we'll continue to target and go after ISIL wherever it appears,"" Cook said, using another acronym for ISIS. There have been a total 2,381 US deaths in Afghanistan operations since 2001."	US service member killed in Afghanistan	['Cook']	[]

It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax returns as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns. CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by The Times. Before The Times report, Hillary Clinton raised questions during the first presidential debate about whether Trump had paid income tax in some years, which Trump didn't deny.In fact, he said: ""That makes me smart.""The findings from the leaked tax returns threatened to put the controversy over Trump's unprecedented refusal to release them as the focus of his presidential campaign with less than 40 days until the election. Poll: Post-debate, Clinton takes the leadThe poll also found that 73% of registered voters surveyed think Trump should release his tax returns for public review, including about half of Republicans at 49%.And out of the voters surveyed, 57% believe that Trump is hiding something by not releasing his tax returns while 33% believe that he's holding back due to the audit -- although Trump is allowed to release his tax returns regardless of the audit.What Trump tax report could mean for his campaignIt's been one of the toughest weeks for Trump's campaign after he struggled to bounce back from his widely panned debate performance, in which analysts and scientifically conducted polls considered Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as the winner.The poll showed Clinton topping Trump 47% to 42% among likely voters with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson at 7% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 2%. CNN Money: Trump supporters want his tax returns releasedThe CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 28 through October 2 among a random national sample of 1,501 adults. Results among the 1,213 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. It is 2.5 percentage points among the 1,335 registered voters interviewed."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/donald-trump-tax/index.html	"With 36 days remaining before Election Day, the real estate mogul's campaign is consumed with the fallout from a New York Times story published over the weekend that found Trump reported a $916 million loss in 1995. That loss could mean Trump went 18 years without paying federal income taxes.Those findings -- which Trump's campaign isn't disputing but haven't been independently confirmed by CNN -- would be daunting for any presidential candidate to overcome. But they're especially challenging for Trump, who is losing control of the campaign's narrative after a strong September in which he narrowed the race with Hillary Clinton. 6 questions about Trump's taxes and the political falloutIn just the past week, Trump delivered an underwhelming debate performance, struggled to recover from it, engaged in a counterproductive feud with a Latina beauty queen, posted early morning Twitter tirades and spewed insinuations without any evidence about Clinton's marriage. The tax story -- which could undermine Trump's image as a successful businessman -- will dominate the next few days.Time is dwindling for Trump to regain his grip on the campaign's message as Clinton supporters seize on the drama to reinforce their point that he isn't suitable for the presidency.'Meltdown'""The reality is that we are in day six of the meltdown,"" Clinton supporter Neera Tanden said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""He had a terrible debate performance. Everybody sees that. He sees the state polls moving towards Hillary. Eleven state polls were out this week. She's beating him in every single one. He can't take that. And so this is the latest meltdown.""Of course, the tax story might not emerge as the kind of October surprise-style impact that Democrats hope. It is possible that Trump truly is a Teflon candidate who is so appealing to voters that his actions don't really matter. The GOP nominee's closest surrogates launched a fierce defense of Trump Sunday, portraying him as a master of business who expertly used the tax code to his benefit -- and that of his investors.In a spirited showdown with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani hailed Trump as a ""genius.""""He knows how to operate the tax code for the benefit of the people he's serving,"" Giuliani said.Giuliani: False claims about Clinton's marriage are 'fair game'Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie dismissed the idea that Trump had done anything wrong or that the report would hurt him.""This is actually a very, very good story for Donald Trump,"" Christie said.The impact of the story -- and the swirling controversies that have bubbled up over the past week -- will come into greater focus Monday as Trump returns to the campaign trail in the key swing states of Virginia and Colorado.He largely stuck to the script at the first event of the day in which he discussed cybersecurity. But he stumbled during a question and answer session when he suggested that American soldiers and veterans who commit suicide do so because they can't handle the post-traumatic stress of war.""When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over and you're strong and you can handle it but a lot of people can't handle it. They see horror stories, they see events you couldn't see in a movie, nobody would believe it,"" Trump said during a panel interview at the Retired American Warriors PAC, in Herndon, Virginia. VP debateThe tax issue will almost certainly play a significant role in Tuesday's vice presidential debate. If that's the case, it will be a lost opportunity for Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, to present himself to the country as a moderating force on the GOP nominee and someone who can offer a coherent case against a Clinton presidency.And ahead of the next presidential debate on Sunday, there's no sign Trump will do something to address the lack of focus, preparation and impulse control that helped contribute to Clinton's win at last week's showdown. Trump is now vowing to be nastier than Clinton at the second debate, bringing up Bill Clinton's marital indiscretions. At a wild rally on Saturday night, he even questioned whether Hillary Clinton had been ""loyal"" to her husband.How Donald Trump could have - legally - paid no taxesSuch rhetoric not only calls into question Trump's strategy, it lets Clinton slide on some of her most significant vulnerabilities, such as her email server and questions of trust and honesty. Trump's approach, and refusal to ignore a trap laid by Clinton in the first debate over his treatment of former Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado, raises doubt over whether he can make inroads with educated women voters who could be vital to claim must-win states like Pennsylvania.The freewheeling Trump on display in recent days is particularly notable because he had been doing so well and appeared keen to project more discipline under his retooled campaign team. The GOP nominee effectively wiped out Clinton's lead in national polls after an effective spell through August and mid-September. He was beginning to match her in swing states on the electoral map.Donald Trump and the art of losing moneyThen, after an encouraging first 30 minutes of the debate, it all went downhill. Trump has not allowed himself to get back on message ever since.""What happened to him was he was doing well,"" said Van Jones, a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton, on ""State of the Union."" ""I was terrified 10 days ago this guy was going to be able to be disciplined. Hillary Clinton in 15 minutes said two or three things and threw him off his game and he has not been able to recover since the debate.""Trump's Rust Belt routeThe GOP nominee's only route to the White House lies in running the table through the Rust Belt from Pennsylvania, through Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. That's why the tax story could prove powerful if struggling blue collar workers disaffected with the Democrats and considering Trump are alienated by the revelation -- even if everything was perfectly legal.The tax issue also allows Democrats to reclaim the narrative about economic equality and fairness that proved so powerful for President Barack Obama against Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Clinton's primary rival, Bernie Sanders, relished the chance to make that point.""So, you have got the middle-class people working longer hours for low wages. They pay their taxes. They support their schools. They support their infrastructure. They support the military. But the billionaires, no, they don't have to do that, because they have their friends on Capitol Hill. They pay zero in taxes,"" Sanders said on ""State of the Union."" ""So, Trump goes around and says, 'hey, I'm worth billions, I'm a successful businessman, but I don't pay any taxes. But, you, you make 15 bucks an hour, you pay the taxes, not me.'""He added: ""That's why people are angry and want real change in this country."""

But Weld dismissed concerns that his ticket could hand Donald Trump the presidency. ""On the technical question of who we're taking votes from, I'm quite sure at the end of the day we will end up with a lot more moderate Republican voters than we will votes coming from Mrs. Clinton. That's just my view, but I do think that's all right.""Weld defends Johnson after ""Aleppo"" momentCuomo followed up, asking, ""If pollsters and someone you trust and come forward and said -- hey, our data is showing that we draw independents largely and we're biting into Clinton's part of that apple, Trump's numbers (are) fairly fixed, there's attrition on her end, it's coming to us -- would that change your analysis of what to do with your campaign?""""You know, it wouldn't change my analysis of what to do,"" Weld answered.
