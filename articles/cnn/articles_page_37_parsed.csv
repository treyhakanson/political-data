Trump confounded pundits and upended projections to become the President-Elect of the United States?It will be hard to forget such a moment, or the pivotal images that have immortalized it. To set the stage, here is CNN's Wolf Blitzer making the announcement: The emotion was instant. You could see it in the crowds dotted with bright red hats who cheered, sobbed and embraced at Trump's election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown hotel. It was a moment of pure elation. The emotion was there too on the stunned faces of Hillary Clinton's supporters who had gathered to celebrate what had, once, seemed like a likely victory.For them, it was a moment of pure desolation.In that moment, in the early hours of November 9 after nearly two years of an unprecedented and at times unbelievable campaign, the Empire State building glowed an uninterrupted red. Its facade bore a stories-high projection of  Donald Trump: America's next President. See more photos from election night here: 	Election results: The moment America knew	['Wolf', 'Trump']	[]
1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/republicans-senate-election/index.html	"The Senate majority leader, who had reached the pinnacle of his power just two years prior, now suddenly sensed his hard-fought majority was at risk because of a lackluster campaign run by Burr, the North Carolina Republican who many thought was safe at the beginning of the cycle.  Burr had only four campaign staffers prior to the fall. The National Republican Senatorial Committee was forced to install aides to help run the senator's campaign, but he still wouldn't hire a campaign manager. He was spotted playing golf in Sea Island, Georgia, with donors and took a late summer vacation to Michigan's Mackinac Island. He also frequently wouldn't tell his closest confidantes where he was on any given day, often jumping in his car with one aide and his wife and popping up in random locations throughout the state, shaking voters' hands.  And yet like Donald Trump and other Republicans who ran unconventional campaigns, Burr won. In an extraordinary turn for Republicans who came into 2016 facing the possibility of losing the Senate and the White House, the GOP managed to re-elect most of its at-risk lawmakers.   The inside story of how Senate Republicans privately plotted to hang onto power is based on interviews with more than a dozen key sources. They detailed how the party schemed to avoid a Trump tidal wave -- and separate themselves from the top of the ticket -- in a campaign bound to reshape GOP politics for years to come. But they also benefited from Trump's coattails in states like North Carolina, Missouri and Pennsylvania. The GOP had to constantly scramble to respond to Trump's penchant for controversy, forced the NRSC to overhaul key spending decisions -- including to spend big bucks earlier to help shore up incumbents in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania in the aftermath of Trump's September squabble with a beauty queen.  There was distrust and back-biting between officials at the Republican National Committee and the NRSC, so much so that NRSC officials believed that the RNC intentionally dragged its feet to help allocate millions of dollars to Senate candidates nationwide in order to use as leverage over the Illinois Senate race. RNC officials said they forced the NRSC to spend money in Wisconsin against the Senate committee's will. ""We recognized that 2016 presented some unique challenges,"" said Steven Law, head of the McConnell-allied super PAC Senate Leadership Fund, which spent more than $140 million this cycle along with its affiliated non-profit -- including nearly $32 million in New Hampshire alone. GOP takes out primary foesRepublicans entered the election cycle with an initial goal: Prevent primaries from taking out their Senate foes. The NRSC began to put together plans to spend big against primary foes should serious threats emerge in states like Pennsylvania or Ohio. None did. fBut it was a state that was not a battleground that was a cause of GOP concern: Kansas. When Rep. Mike Pompeo was considering challenging the former NRSC chairman, Sen. Jerry Moran, Republican officials in Washington promised Pompeo he would be faced with a brutal onslaught. They hired a retired FBI agent to dig up dirt about Pompeo's past. And senator after senator urged Pompeo to drop his plans, and he even fielded a call from House Speaker Paul Ryan. Pompeo ultimately decided against running.The GOP had other major coups, including a furious effort to persuade Marco Rubio to abandon plans to quit the Senate and instead run for reelection; Sen. Rob Portman's trouncing of a well-known former Democratic governor in Ohio; and quashing a tea party threat in the Indiana GOP primary and later Rep. Todd Young's dismantling of a scion of Indiana politics, Evan Bayh. In the surprise of the night, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson pulled off an enormous upset to defeat a formidable foe -- former Sen. Russ Feingold -- winning on a late surge of money from GOP outside groups and heavy spending on TV by the Trump campaign. The victory came despite tension with Johnson and some of his advisers, including one top consultant who was no longer on speaking terms with the senator. A concern with MissouriWard Baker, an ex-Marine and executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, didn't like what he saw in Missouri. In late August, he surveyed the polls and saw the veteran Republican Roy Blunt's favorability numbers underwater in the state. And he noticed that a large portion of Missouri voters didn't know Blunt's opponent, Jason Kander, something that the Democrat could use to his advantage. So Baker -- known for his no-nonsense, tell-it-like-is-style -- told 17 people on a call: ""I think you're going to lose,""  referring to Blunt. Blunt's team was perplexed, given that the senator was still leading in head-to-head matchups. But Republican officials in Washington recognized that the polls showed that Blunt was unpopular -- in no small part because of his reputation as someone with deep ties to Washington and a close family association with lobbyists, including his son Andy, who was running his campaign. Republican sources told CNN the NRSC wanted Andy Blunt out as the senator's campaign manager, something the senator resisted. Some Republicans were worried with the perception that Blunt did not spend enough time in the state. A day after the late August Baker phone call warning that Blunt could lose, the senator was spotted at a farmer's market in the ritzy Palisades neighborhood of Northwest Washington.   Blunt spokeswoman Burson Taylor disputed that the senator did not spend much time in Missouri, arguing that he had done more than 3,000 events statewide in Missouri since becoming a senator. And she argued that few GOP operatives knew the state -- or were as successful at running campaigns -- as Blunt's son Andy. Blunt continued to reassure McConnnell and GOP leaders that he had the race under control, unveiling a flurry of ads late tying his opponent to Hillary Clinton -- a move that seemed to work in a state that Trump won handily. In late October internal GOP polling, more Trump voters approved of Kander than they did of Blunt, according to a review of the polling memo. Yet Blunt managed to turn that around. Dealing with Trump, Access Hollywood videoGOP leaders saw the problems of a Trump candidacy coming far before he was the nominee -- even though he ended up helping their candidates on Election Day.In September 2015, Baker gathered GOP chiefs of staff with a warning: Get ready for Trump. He told them there would be an ""88.5 percent"" chance that Trump would be the nominee. The room erupted in laughter. But some took it seriously, including Portman and Sen. Chuck Grassley. The message from party leaders: Define your race on your terms, focus on specific issues important to your state and attack your opponents early and often. And if Trump says something controversial, distance yourself from Trump -- quickly.  And each candidate had his or her own strategy for dealing with Trump. In the aftermath of the ""Access Hollywood"" video where Trump talks crudely about groping women, McConnell called all of his vulnerable members to gauge their views, with some like Blunt saying that his supporters were not deterred by the video and others like Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire eager to withdraw her support. McConnell himself criticized Trump but declined to rescind his endorsement, giving his members space to side with his stance or decide to go further. During other Trump controversies, however, the NRSC was forced to recalibrate its tactics in dealing with their nominee. The group, which already was spending more money on TV earlier than in past election cycles, had to spend money in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire earlier to help shore up the positions of Sen. Pat Toomey and Ayotte in the aftermath of Trump's post-convention fight with the Khan family. And after Trump ridiculed the weight of a Latina beauty queen after the first presidential debate in late September, GOP officials similarly moved spending in all their battlegrounds -- other than Illinois and Wisconsin -- earlier in the calendar. NRSC v. RNCPerhaps the most contentious relationship was between the NRSC and the RNC. In April, the NRSC's political director, Sarah Morgan, asked the RNC to sign off on the spending authority needed to release funds that the senatorial committee could use in coordination with the Senate campaigns -- a step required by campaign finance laws. Such authority is usually handed over without question. But, according to several sources familiar with the matter, the issue became contentious. GOP sources said the RNC dragged its feet for two months. And the sources said that ultimately the RNC chief of staff, Katie Walsh, said it would only release funds if the NRSC gave the full coordinated cash -- worth $1.9 million -- to vulnerable Sen. Mark Kirk in Illinois, who many thought had no chance of winning this year. NRSC officials balked at such demands, which are unusual for party committees to make. They argued that it would be a waste of precious resources with so many states to spend cash in order to save the majority. Ultimately, the RNC relented. But when the RNC transferred over $4.5 million to the NRSC, it did so on the condition to spend six figures to help Kirk and Johnson in Wisconsin.  Asked for comment, RNC officials pushed back, saying they were concerned the NRSC wasn't planning to help in Illinois and in Wisconsin. RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the committee was ""concerned the NRSC wouldn't be able to fund coordinated for incumbent senators and offered to help in states where the NRSC would not commit to the campaigns."" Walsh added that the committee was willing to help candidates the NRSC wouldn't. ""The RNC told the NRSC multiple times we would immediately sign over any authority they wanted as long as they committed to funding whatever they asked for. .... The goal was to make sure we could be helpful since their fundraising was lagging.""  Moreover, Senate Republicans privately scoffed at the RNC's data program aimed at targeting voters, with most campaigns -- other than Blunt's -- opting instead to use one created by the Koch network. Walsh said that the RNC talked to Senate campaigns ""daily,"" providing them with key data about voters in their states. And when NRSC officials read in the New York Times in April that the RNC was creating a fundraising apparatus to help with Senate campaigns, they said it was the first they heard of it. No such fundraising committee was ever created, and RNC officials later said they misspoke to the Times. Even though they both ended Tuesday with frosty relations, they both ended up getting what they wanted: A GOP White House and a Republican Senate.

Bush had to deal with the Lockerbie bombing and a deadly aerial clash between US and Libyan warplanes in 1988, while Richard Nixon took over from Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 with the Vietnam War in full swing.While these crises weren't necessarily tied to the transition, they kicked off as a new administration with little to no experience on the matter was preparing to take over. Adversaries look for advantage""We're also looking at how some of our adversaries might try to take advantage of some type of transition that they think will lead to some discontinuity either in focus or attention,"" CIA director John Brennan told CNN's Erin Burnett last month.""The new team coming in, they need to get up to speed very quickly. So right after Election Day, we're going to have the responsibility for briefing that new team, that new president, to make sure that they understand what lies ahead,"" he added.The CIA expected its Cold War adversaries to take advantage of the unusually sudden transition between Nixon and Gerald Ford upon the former's resignation. Analysts later wrote in the President's Daily Brief that, ""It may be that many have not had time to consider how the situation might be turned to advantage"" after America's enemies appeared to not act immediately after Nixon's.RELATED: CIA declassifies Nixon, Ford daily intel briefingsFormer senior officials who have been through the presidential transition tend to agree with Brennan's assessment that it's a sensitive time.""Literally within hours of taking over power, you could be in the middle of a major crisis,"" Stephen Hadley, President George W. Bush's national security adviser, said at an event hosted by the Partnership for Public Service, an organization that has been pushing reforms to the transition process ahead of Election Day.Appearing alongside Hadley, Clapper's predecessor, John Negroponte, agreed, stressing the need to adequately brief any incoming president.""You've got to prepare the president-elect for these potential contingencies, so get them thinking about that they'd do now before it actually happens.""He added, ""What are you going to do if North Korea detonates a bomb or China captures all the Spratly Islands?""November surprises?One crisis likely to face the incoming president on Day One is the fight against ISIS.The battle to recapture Mosul, the last ISIS bastion in Iraq, kicked off earlier in the month and is expected to be fierce, with an estimated 4,000-strong ISIS force defending Iraq's second-largest city. The potential for a mass refugee exodus as the assault gets further underway is also growing.Some analysts also believe that some of America's adversaries are ramping up their activity in order to take advantage of the transition. North Korea, for instance.The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, released a study this month October estimating that a North Korean nuclear provocation was more likely in the period immediately before and after a US presidential election.""North Korean missile/nuclear tests and other major kinetic provocations have clustered increasingly closer to US elections,"" the report said.Some experts think the Russian and Syrian regimes' intensified bombing of Aleppo, Syria, is part of a bid to recapture that major city before a new administration is inaugurated and able to change US policy towards the five-year-long Syrian civil war -- making a final bloody assault on the city during the transition period likely.Asked if he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin might take advantage of the transition, retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling told CNN: ""I don't think he will; I know he will.""Preparations underwayThe Trump transition is headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The team has long had planners at work, with intelligence briefings having been provided during the campaign and now being stepped up.President Harry S. Truman inaugurated the pre-Election Day intelligence briefings for nominees after feeling unprepared upon assuming the presidency in 1945 following the death of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.""I'm really glad as a citizen he made the generous decision to prepare his successor,"" Clapper said of Truman in September.With the election complete, the intelligence briefers will start holding daily briefings with the president-elect, including about the ""crown jewels"" -- their term for the most sensitive intelligence.RELATED: The next US president faces a world of trouble""The sooner these kinds of briefings of the president, presidential candidates, and/or the president-elect start the better and the more deeply they get into it the better, because a lot of these issues are pretty complicated, there's a lot of background to learn,"" Negroponte said.""A good time to be asking lots of questions is when you haven't yet assumed office, because the pace will pick up once you get in,"" he added.Both Hadley and Negroponte, who were involved in several presidential transitions, said the process has improved significantly in recent years.""We've come a long way,"" Hadley said, noting that when he left at the end of Ford administration, all the paper records were taken from his office the day the presidency was handed to Jimmy Carter, making it even more difficult for the incoming staffers to get up to speed.New laws improve transitionRecent legislation has helped to improve the process, however.A law passed in 2010 allowing staff picked by the nominees to undergo security clearance investigations before the vote has been held so that they can be ready to start the job on Day One.And a measure passed this year created presidential transition councils, which can meet with presidential candidates and enable additional planning even before the contenders have secured their party's nominations.Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning in late October outlined some of the steps the services were taking in order to better prepare the incoming administration.""Travel dries up right after the election, so that we can make the transition as smooth as possible. So we have a whole series of binders and information papers and information available for the team when it shows up,"" Fanning said as part of a panel moderated by CNN's Barbara Starr at the Center for a New American Security.Fanning's Navy counterpart, Secretary Ray Mabus, concurred, stressing the need for a smooth transition.""One thing the Pentagon does very well in my experience is get you ready to go in in terms of briefings, in terms of where we are in any specific thing, in terms of making sure that nothing falls through the cracks as you move from one administration to the next,"" he said.""There's no luxury of having a couple of days after the inaugural to figure things out,"" he added.

""It's been a long hard road, many hours, a lot of states, a lot of hours, but it's all going to pay off because he is going to affect change,"" Doucette told CNN on Election Day hours before the polls closed. As Trump's campaign co-chair in the first in the nation primary state Doucette often found himself defending Trump's controversial comments, but his support never wavered.

Doucette felt certain that there were many voters who weren't public about their support for Trump, and that it would all show up in the election results. But in the early hours of Wednesday morning on November 9, as Trump's victory party attendees spilled out onto New York City sidewalks, Doucette was in shock.

I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans,"" Clinton said.""Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,"" said Clinton, who was composed and dignified even as she admitted how painful her defeat was in her first public comments on the result of the election.""This is not the outcome that we wanted and we worked so hard for, and I am sorry that we did not win this election,"" Clinton told supporters and campaign workers in New York.Clinton also addressed the historic achievement for which she twice strived in losing presidential campaigns.""I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.""""And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and to achieve your own dreams.""Clinton's speech was devoid of bitterness and seemed at times to be an attempt to inspire her supporters about the virtues of public service and of fighting for what they believe.But she also put Trump on notice that the core American values which many Democrats believe Trump abhors, citing his proposals for a ban on Muslim immigration and rhetorical assaults on female journalists during his campaign, would not be forgotten.""Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things: the rule of law, the principle that we are equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them.""Tears flowedMuch of the seating at Clinton's remarks was for staff and aides and the campaign was treating it as a farewell to the people who have spent the better part of two years working on her behalf, an aide said.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine also was on hand. The Virginia senator was not with Clinton Tuesday night.""I'm proud of Hillary, because she loves this country,"" said Kaine, who had tears in his eyes, as he delivered introductory remarks.Aides throughout the ballroom were sobbing during Clinton's remarks. Quiet moments in the speech were filled with tears, sniffles and some sobs. Clinton's top aides, seated in the front row, were almost all crying.Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, was wiping away tears. Nick Merrill, Clinton's traveling press secretary, was weeping.The most somber moment in Clinton's speech was when she specifically noted her impact to women and girls.""To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,"" Clinton said, her voice breaking with emotion.There were audible cries -- and some sobs -- throughout the room.Bill Clinton, while working the ropeline, wiped away tears.Huma Abedin cried during the speech but kept a stoic face during much of the ropeline.Clinton worked the ropeline after the event, moving from tearful conversation to tearful conversation.She first spoke with Anastasia Somoza, the 32-year old woman diagnosed with cerebral palsy and spastic quadriplegia who interned for Clinton's Senate office. Bending down to hug Somoza, Clinton told her, ""You were so wonderful in every way. I love you.""""Thank you for all your work,"" Clinton told Somoza's mother.She hugged Joel Bennenson and John Anzalone, two of her pollsters, who acknowledged to other aides last night that they didn't see the Trump wave coming.She hugged Jim Margolis and Mandy Grunwald, who created many of the campaign's television ads.Clinton left somewhat unceremoniously, departing through a blue curtain to the left of the room and later to her motorcade.End of a campaignHer speech marked a bitter conclusion to a campaign that will be remembered for failing to fully energize Democratic voters and for squandering the party's traditional heartlands in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.It also marked what could be the final act on the national stage of the Clinton double act, the political partnership between Bill Clinton and the former first lady and secretary of state that had seemed poised for a remarkable comeback, 16 years after they left the White House.Campaign staffers had spoken throughout Clinton's presidential bid of the extreme pressure many of them felt in facing Trump, whom Clinton argued was temperamentally and intellectually unfit for the presidency and to be in charge of the US nuclear arsenal.Now she is under pressure to call on a nation, split almost exactly down the middle, to unite behind the next president.Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, lauded her speech.""Very classy speech from @HillaryClinton. Important step in bringing our country together,"" he tweeted.It was not the first time Clinton has tasted the pain of ending a defeated presidential campaign. In 2008, she folded her primary bid against Barack Obama in Washington and bemoaned her failure to break the ""highest and hardest glass ceiling"" by becoming the first female president. That was to be her fate again in 2016, though the personal recriminations are likely to be even more intense this time given that Trump is seen by many Democrats as antithetical to American values.Clinton called Trump in the early hours of Wednesday to concede defeat after he shattered her Democratic firewall in the Midwest and swept to victory after the most vitriolic general election in generations.But she did not appear at her election night party in New York. At the time, her campaign chairman John Podesta explained that the campaign wanted to ensure that every vote in still undeclared states was counted -- though her position already seemed hopeless.Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Wednesday that she was with Trump when Abedin, called to say her boss wanted to talk to the president-elect.""I handed him the phone and they had a maybe one-minute conversation, very gracious, very warm. I heard Mr. Trump's side of it,"" Conway told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day. ""He commended her for being smart and tough and running a very hard-fought campaign. And I am told Secretary Clinton congratulated Donald Trump on his victory, and conceded to him,"" Conway said."

Their economic relationship is crucial not only to each country's financial health but to the global economy as well. But rarely, if ever, have two global powers been so intrinsically linked economically while sitting on different sides of so many other issues.Start with the South China Sea, one of the world's tensest geopolitical situations.  China's aggressive seizures of land and building of artificial islands have caused alarm in the United States.  The fear in Washington is that China could become a de facto hegemonic power, coming to dominate Southeast Asian nations who have competing territorial claims in the area but no real military might with which to back them up.The South China Sea is also one of the world's most important shipping waterways. Trillions of dollars of goods pass through it every year -- and the US is concerned that China's expansion could eventually allow them to control the waterways outright, and therefore the ability to impact the free flow of trade.There are a host of other China issues facing Trump, including cyber security concerns and fears of Chinese currency manipulation. Many economists have said China's ongoing economic slowdown could have negative effects globally. And China's massive consumption of coal is contributing to global warming. What should be Trump's top priority on China in the first 100 days?The most immediate concern might not actually be China itself. Instead, look to the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte is reversing decades of foreign policy tradition.The US sees the Philippines as perhaps its strongest ally in Southeast Asia. But on a recent trip to Beijing, Duterte said he wants ""separation from the United States,"" both economically and militarily, and pursue closer relations with China.What happens next could alter the balance of power in the South China Sea. Dealing with the surprise change in the Philippine-US relationship -- and how that might affect China's regional ambitions -- should be a top priority for Trump. Both candidates had tough talk for China on the campaign trail.Trump has focused his attacks mainly on China's economy, saying that Chinese economic policies have been responsible for millions of American jobs that have left the country.  In May, he said: ""We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing."" Strong rhetoric like that might make the first meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping awkward, to say the least. Can Trump fix this in the first term?No. Both countries are playing the long game in the South China Sea. China's new artificial islands, and the military equipment it has installed on them, aren't going away anytime soon. And the US military, under a policy established with the help of then Secretary of State Clinton, has shifted more of its focus to China.  These are both long-term strategies, and both countries have the resources to implement them. Two global powers competing for influence over one of the world's key strategic waterways is a struggle that will likely play out for some time.How big a priority is China for CNN readers?China is the number two international priority, according to a very unscientific poll of CNN readers who took part in our interactive feature on the 10 biggest global challenges facing the next President.

""And that mandate is going to be somewhat different than what we've had, it's a repudiation of some of the things we've had.""After it became apparent that the reality-star-turned-politician was elected the 45th president of the United States, Conway said she received a call from Clinton aide Huma Abedin, letting her know that the former secretary of state wanted to talk to Trump.""I handed him the phone and they had a maybe one-minute conversation, very gracious, very warm. I heard Mr. Trump's side of it,"" Conway said. ""He commended her for being smart and tough and running a very hard-fought campaign. And I am told Secretary Clinton congratulated Donald Trump on his victory, and conceded to him.""Conway did not say whether or not Trump would follow through with his vow to prosecute Clinton over her use of a private email server at the State Department.""I have not discussed that with him, Alisyn,"" she told Camerota. ""Especially since he became the next president of the United States.""Trump in victory: 'It is time for us to come together'Conway said the Trump campaign always knew that places like Michigan and Wisconsin -- states Clinton was counting on as part of her ""blue wall"" -- were always in play.""We always felt that Hillary Clinton promising to put coal miners out of work, or steel workers, that wasn't going to go well in a place like Pennsylvania. Michigan, Wisconsin, the same thing,"" she said. ""So it just all started to come together.""Conway said it was the ""undercover Trump vote"" is what led the outsider's campaign to the White House.""We saw two things that ended up being true: One is the undercover Trump vote, these people who want to take the country in a new direction, have an unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton but don't look the part of a Republican presidential voter,"" she said.Conway said some of these people previously backed Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, and even President Barack Obama, but now resonated with Trump's message.""Maybe they vote for Democrats in the off year but it's the combination of the message and the messenger this year and their reluctance to go for more of the same and go for Hillary Clinton that really made them available to us,"" she said.Clinton also struggled to attract the support needed to defeat the number of people backing Trump.""The second thing that we saw was that Hillary Clinton just had a very difficult -- and it turns out impossible -- time to bust through her ceiling of 45%, 46% in some of these states that President Obama carried twice with more than 50%,"" she said."
