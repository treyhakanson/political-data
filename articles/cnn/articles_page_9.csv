Sotomayor -- who wrote an unusually candid autobiography in 2014 -- is known as the ""people's justice"" for her ability to connect with her audiences.Near the end of the evening, a woman named Jessica stood up and asked an unusually poignant question. She identified herself as a security guard at the Metropolitan Museum in New York who had traveled from New York to meet the justice after being inspired by reading her book.""What would your advice be when you are feeling sometimes hopeless or discouraged in any aspect or spectrum of your life?"" asked Jessica, in a question seemingly unrelated to the election.Sotomayor, did not hesitate to respond.""I am not perfect, I get discouraged and I get sad and there are moments in my life where I thought 'why do I bother?'"" she said.She explained however, that her thinking has been shaped by the fact that she was diagnosed as a child with diabetes, something she discusses in great detail in her book. She said at the time the prognosis for the disease was very poor.""I believed most of my childhood, and I probably didn't change my mind until I reached 50, that I was going to die young,"" she said. ""And the one thing that that thought gave me was a drive to pack as much as I could in my life as fast as I could.""She went on to advise the woman to to find her passion: ""Don't give up, good luck."""

""They don't really like institutions, they don't need institutions. If they want change, they go on the Internet, find a half million people who agree with them, and insist on the change and they usually get it.""Dean said people are disheartened by this election in a way to could lead them to get more involved in politics. ""So I really think this election, they're so disheartened, so down and so tired and discouraged, this may be their Kent State or their Edmund Pettus Bridge,"" he said. ""Where you finally realize that you've got to do something, that you can't — the path as Martin Luther King said, 'the arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.' Well it only bends toward justice if you make it bend toward justice.""""We've got to reach out to these folks,"" added Dean, noting that young people voted for Democrats three elections in row. ""They don't consider themselves Democrats, because after all, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are institutions, and they don't particularly have an interest in institutions.

Earlier Tuesday, he had tweeted: ""After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming ""you LOST!"" Will be ugly.""Cohen, part of the #NeverTrump conservative coterie, recounted his experience working with a friend on Trump's transition team -- despite his personal opposition to Trump, Cohen had still hoped to discreetly ""steer good people to an administration that understandably wanted nothing to do with the likes of me.""But Cohen explained that a contentious exchange led to his friend ""seething with anger directed at those of us who had opposed Donald Trump,"" and that ""the episode has caused me to change my mind about recommending that conservatives serve in the administration.""""This was a tipping point. The tenor of the Trump team, from everything I see, read and hear, is such that, for a garden-variety Republican policy specialist, service in the early phase of the administration would carry a high risk of compromising one's integrity and reputation.""""In a normal transition to a normal administration, there's always disorder,"" Cohen wrote, but ""this time may be different. Trump was not a normal candidate, the transition is not a normal transition, and this will probably not be a normal administration.""Cohen savaged the team assembled around Trump -- ""The President-elect is surrounding himself with mediocrities whose chief qualification seems to be unquestioning loyalty"" -- and argued that ""by all accounts, (Trump's) ignorance, and that of his entourage, about the executive branch is fathomless.""The former Bush official warned that as a result of the disarray and the people involved, ""their mistakes -- because there will be mistakes -- will be exceptional,"" and that the new administration ""will smash into crises and failures""""My bottom line: Conservative political types should not volunteer to serve in this administration, at least for now,"" Cohen wrote. ""They would probably have to make excuses for things that are inexcusable and defend people who are indefensible. At the very least, they should wait to see who gets the top jobs.""""I hope that I am wrong.

There's no one at the (Democratic National Committee) now. We've got to -- we've got to say, what's America 2.0 look like?"" Ryan said in an interview on CNN's ""New Day.""""We've got to re-evaluate what we're doing as Democrats, especially in the congressional campaign,"" the Ohio Democrat said.Asked by CNN's Poppy Harlow whether he was planning on challenging Pelosi when Democrats hold their leadership elections after the Thanksgiving break, Ryan was coy. ""That's the conversation we're having right now. My main goal was to get the election delayed. We were supposed to have it tomorrow, and now it's delayed for a couple weeks so we can actually have that conversation,"" Ryan said.Pelosi formally announced Wednesday in a letter to supporters that she was seeking re-election. ""It is with both humility and confidence that I write to request your support for House Democratic Leader,"" Pelosi said. ""As of this writing, I am pleased to report the support of more than two-thirds of the Caucus.""Ryan was careful to also express his admiration for Pelosi and said he didn't blame her for Democrats' stinging losses in 2016. ""Let me just say, I love Nancy Pelosi. She's an amazing woman. She's got more energy than probably half of our Democratic caucus and is a terrific fundraiser, and I don't blame her for the past election. It wasn't her fault. We did get caught up in a national wave.""And Ryan said he hadn't yet decided whom to support in the race for chair of the DNC, adding, ""I've got a lot of respect for all"" the candidates and that ""I don't have a horse in that race yet.""Ryan also discussed President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of Stephen Bannon as a senior adviser, a move assailed by critics who have accused Bannon of catering to white supremacists and nationalists in his former role as chief of Breitbart News. ""I think it's going to be very, very hard to work with,"" Ryan said. ""I can see a scenario where there's going to be a lot of Democrats who aren't going to want to be in meetings or want to work with Trump if that guy is in the room.""He continued, ""First and foremost, it would be very helpful if he didn't appoint somebody or give someone a very high position that was very sympathetic to white supremacist groups.""Ryan said that ""there are things we would work with him on,"" such as reforming campaign finance and passing an infrastructure spending bill. But he added, ""If he pushed this right-wing agenda, we're going to fight him every step of the way.""The Democrat also sketched out his vision for the kind of messaging he believes Democrats should adopt, stressing the importance of speaking to the kinds of working-class voters who carried Trump to the White House.""People don't want to hear about job retraining. People don't want to hear about running a computer. They want to -- they want you to talk to them about how they can run machinery, or run a back hoe or sling concrete block. That's what they want to do. So we need an agenda for Democrats that speaks to those workers,"" Ryan said.He pointed to the renewable energy industry as an example of an issue Democrats could seize on to recapture those voters.""I don't think we talked about it enough. There are 8,000 component parts to a windmill. There's gear shifts, hydraulics. These things need to be manufactured. And if the United States of America says we're going in on a clean-energy economy, and we are going to manufacture those products -- in coal country, in Youngstown, Ohio, in the industrial Midwest, in the Great Lakes region -- I mean, that is what we do in that region.

""It sounded like there was no pathway to victory for Trump ... as I watched him get to 270 electoral votes, my heart dropped.""Now that Trump is set to become the 45th president of the United States, the rapper said he is fearful that his ""biggest nightmare"" could come to life, as large groups of Americans — from women to Latinos to Muslims to African-Americans and other people of color — are fearful that their rights will not be protected under a Trump administration.""Now that Trump sits in one of the most powerful seats, probably the most powerful seat in the world, it's scary how this album could in four years be some sort of a prophecy,"" Wickliffe said.Common reflects on black America, Obama's legacy and the silver lining of TrumpThe President-elect's appointment of Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign CEO and executive chairman of Breitbart News, as chief strategist and senior counselor did little to diminish these fears. Bannon has called his site ""the platform for the alt-right"" — a far-right movement  that been aligned with white nationalism, racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism.News of Bannon's appointment appeased white nationalist groups around the country and Wickliffe said that could exacerbate divisions and ensure that minorities will not have a seat at the table.""When you look at somebody who made racist comments, who surrounds himself with people who made racist comments — campaign CEOs and all ... then you take a look at somebody like (House Speaker) Paul Ryan who says he's an upstanding Republican but he still votes for a  racist, a bigot, a sexist,"" Wickliffe said.White nationalists see advocate in Steve Bannon who will hold Trump to his campaign promisesA message left with Trump's transition team was not returned.The album touches on issues like climate change, the Flint water crisis and poverty in the inner cities but the issue of police brutality is a central theme.While it is yet to be seen how a Trump administration would handle racism within police departments, during the 2016 campaign, Trump slammed the Black Lives Matter movement. He accused the civil rights movement of instigating killings of police officers, called for more cops on the streets and suggested he might order his attorney general to investigate the group if he becomes President.  ""I don't want to see the future that I'm predicting on that album,"" Wickliffe said. ""I don't want to see politicians afraid to come out in public to run for office because they're getting shot down. I don't want to see police murdered in the street because the law and order candidate said it's alright to come out and kill unarmed minorities.""The rapper said he voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election because she is ""better"" than Trump, but he was not one of the Democratic presidential nominee's enthusiastic supporters."

They could at least give him a chance.""She added that those involved in the protests, which have broken out across the country since Trump's election last week, ""obviously don't have jobs.""""What day are we going on now, seven?"" said Brewer. ""And they're still out there protesting. And obviously, I have even recognized a couple of people and the signs are the same signs that we've seen all seven days, practically. They obviously don't have jobs, right? So what better things do they have to do? So they're just out there marching away. And these kids that are leaving school.

""People have said publicly that he was the strategist and that he has the ear of Donald Trump and he won so he owes a lot to Steve Bannon. And if he was good at doing that, then why not give him a chance at this? I don't think Donald Trump will keep if he goes berserk like people what people think that he is. I can't believe that he's like that to tell you the truth because I know Donald Trump and Donald Trump is not like that at all. I mean, he is not like that at all. Whatsoever. At all.""Brewer also said in the interview that she expected Trump to try to follow through on most of his promises, through he has ""backed down a little bit"" on some since the election.""I think we'll see a lot of it,"" she said. ""We know from his conversations since he won that he has kind of backed down a little bit on some issues but he still wants to secure the border, he still wants to lower your taxes, and he still wants bring jobs in.

The mayor also expressed concern that large-scale deportations would ""sew distrust"" between law enforcement and communities.Trump's former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described the meeting to reporters outside Trump Tower as ""very productive."" ""I think they both said it was a very productive meeting and it lasted about an hour or so. I was glad that the mayor came here,"" Conway said.

Bannon's website has been accused of promoting white nationalism, racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism. De Blasio said he also brought up Trump's promise to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, a piece of legislation meant to reform Wall Street, saying he had ""deep concern that we would go backward and that our economy would be in peril again and we would run the risk of another crash.""As the hour-long meeting was underway, across town there was a different move to distance New Yorkers from the President-elect: the removal of Trump's name from three luxury apartment buildings he helped develop on the west side."
