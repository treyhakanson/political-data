Trump, however, has continued to campaign there. In a Quinnipiac University poll released October 17, Clinton had an edge over Trump with 45% to 37% among likely voters, with Johnson at 10% and Stein with 3% support. The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.In Colorado's Senate race, Democratic candidate Michael Bennet is leading Republican candidate Darryl Glenn by eight percentage points -- 48% to 40%. The poll surveyed 550 likely voters between October 29-31 and has an error margin of 4.2 percentage points."	Poll: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tied in Colorado

It is spending $25 million on TV ads in the final week of the campaign in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Those ad buys are based on the assumption that Trump doesn't need extra help to keep Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Texas or any other traditionally red state in the Republican column. Can Teleprompter Trump stay disciplined?Trump starts with four must-wins: Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa. Those -- plus making sure he doesn't surrender other typically Republican states, and winning the one electoral vote that can come from Maine's Second Congressional District -- get Trump to 260 electoral votes. ""We believe 100% that we're winning all four of those. And once we do that, then we put ourselves in a position to win one of those other swing states,"" Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie said. The other targets include bigger states -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia and Michigan, any one of which would put Trump over the top -- and smaller states, Nevada, New Hampshire and New Mexico, of which he'd have to win two. Those make up Hillary Clinton's firewall, and Trump has to crack it somewhere. ""I think all of those, we are closer in some than others, but we're within the margin of error in many. We are fighting for every single vote,"" Bossie said. Here's a look at some scenarios in which Trump could get to 270 electoral votes:The no-margin-for-error mapThis one, according to polls, is probably Trump's best bet -- but it's also one in which he has no margin for error. Trump could carry every state Mitt Romney won in 2012 (including North Carolina) and flip the Barack Obama states of Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire. How tight would this path be? So tight that Trump would also have to lock up Nebraska's Omaha-based congressional district and Maine's rural district to get those single electoral votes. This map places him at exactly 270, without a single electoral vote to spare:If there's a 'silent majority' of working-class whites This is Trump's dream scenario, because it cracks Clinton's blue wall of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- which he hasn't been able to win in polls.In this map, Trump doesn't need to sweat tight races in Nevada or New Hampshire. As long as he locks in Florida and Ohio, he could afford a fumble like North Carolina, as well:If Clinton bleeds votes to Gary JohnsonThree smaller, fiercely independent states could tip from Clinton's column to Trump's if she loses many of the Republican-leaning voters who just aren't comfortable with Trump -- not to the GOP nominee, but to Libertarian Gary Johnson. Those states are Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado -- all places where Johnson has beaten his poll numbers from big swing states -- and they'd be enough for Trump to win:If African-American turnout dropsThere are signs in the early vote numbers from North Carolina, Florida and Georgia that fewer black voters (who typically back Democrats) are turning out compared to previous election cycles -- resulting in whiter electorates. That would help Trump in those three states -- and could boost him in Michigan, too, where much of the Democratic vote comes from African-Americans in cities like Detroit and Flint: If Latinos don't vote as expectedAll of a sudden, the West could become much more competitive -- with Trump securing Arizona and having a chance at flipping Florida, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico. This scenario would also lock up Florida for Trump, and would allow him to forget about New Hampshire: If the Northeast loves TrumpForget Maine's Second District -- perhaps Trump can flip the whole state. And he could take New Hampshire with him. In this scenario, Trump would vastly outperform expectations among suburban, middle-class voters -- and win the election's biggest prize of all: the Philadelphia suburbs: CORRECTION: A map in an earlier version of this story mislabeled Florida. In the no-margin-for-error map, Florida would go to Clinton."	6 ways Donald Trump could win 270 electoral votes

Following the release Friday morning of this presidential election's final monthly jobs report showing the unemployment rate tick down to 4.9%, less than half of its high point of 10% in 2009, Democrats hope voters will take the jesting phrase to heart.An improved economy has remained Hillary Clinton's most potent positive policy message in this year's presidential contest, reflected by her campaign's relentless use over the last year-and-a-half of Obama's record on jobs. In the campaign's final stretch, the loudest messenger has been Obama himself, mentioning the millions of jobs created since he took office in virtually every one of his campaign speeches for Clinton.Final jobs report before election: what you need to knowObama has benefited from several months of solid job growth to aid his campaign stump. Last month, the US economy added 156,000 jobs; the month before, 151,000 were added. A higher-than-expected GDP growth rate reported last week also aided Obama's economic argument. More likely voters than ever before said in a CNN/ORC poll last week the country is heading in the right direction.But in a contest that has focused almost exclusively on character, temperament, and fitness to be president, there's little evidence that policy arguments and economic indicators are holding much sway. A sample of Clinton supporters waiting to see Obama speak in Jacksonville on Thursday said the economy played a smaller role in their political decision-making than it did when the economy was teetering in 2008, despite universal credit offered to Obama for his success in managing the recovery.""I think we were more concerned in '08, because we were in a deep ditch. There was far more concern back then than there is now, Republican or Democrat,"" said Gary Farris, a 72-year-old retired veteran, who identified social issues as his top concern over any particular economic policy or jobs record.""That's why I'm a Democrat and not a Republican,"" he said.Why North Carolina is so important in 2016Julia Henry Wilson, 62, said she was looking to the candidates' character in a way she wasn't in previous elections.""I think it's a combination of the economy and the character of the individual,"" said Wilson, an educator and career development specialist. ""I see Hillary as a positive individual who can deal with a clown.""Four years ago, each uptick or downtick in the unemployment rate seen as a major storyline in an election largely centered on the nation's economy. There was a minor controversy when Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric, accused the federal government of altering the jobs figures to benefit Obama's reelection. The reports this year have garnered less attention. That's partly because Obama himself isn't on the ballot, though he and Clinton have said over and over the policies he enacted in the White House are.But it's also because while the jobs situation in the country appears on solid footing, the broader shifts in the economy has left many Americans anxious and angry -- whether or not the country's jobs prospects have improved.Jobs reports, with myriad statistics and breakdowns, have always provided fodder for both sides to tout their viewpoints. Under Obama, Democrats have been able to cite lower unemployment rates as evidence of effective policy, while Republicans cited slow wage growth and workforce participation as evidence of a soft recovery.The races that could flip the SenateDonald Trump has painted to his supporters a picture of a country pocked with blighted communities, ravaged by entire industries shipped overseas. During the final debate with Clinton, Trump lambasted the September jobs report, even though most economists said it reflected a steadily improving economy.""Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report,"" Trump said. ""A terrible jobs report. In fact, I said, 'Is that the last jobs report before the election?' Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.""Speaking in Jacksonville on Thursday, Obama returned again to gas prices, using the statistic in a long litany of administration accomplishments.""I just want to point out $2 ain't bad,"" he said, before returning to another takedown of Trump."

""And when I think about keeping America safe, obviously I think about defeating terrorism,"" she said. ""I know what happened not far from here at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. I was in New York City on 9/11 as one of two senators. I will defeat ISIS. I will protect America.""That's just not true. In her book, Hard Choices she says she arrived in the city the day after the terrorist attacks.""After a long, sleepless night in Washington, I flew to New York with Chuck Schumer, my partner in the Senate, on a special plane operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,"" she wrote.

Six people, including one student, were arrested for obstructing traffic, the spokesman said. Outside, protesters carried signs decorated with swastikas declaring ""No hate,"" and ""We have not forgotten.""Dillard student group, Socially Engaged Dillard University Students, had vowed to protest the debate after the school denied its request to exclude Duke.""His presence on our campus is not welcome, and overtly subjects the entire student body to safety risks and social ridicule,"" SEDUS representatives wrote in an open letter, according to CNN affiliate WGNO.While spectators were banned from the debate, outside students chanted: ""No Duke. No K-K-K, no fascist USA,"" and tried to force their way into the auditorium, the Times-Picayune reported.   Raycom released a statement before the debate saying that the contest would be ""conducted on a closed set,"" per their rules. Journalists were allowed to watch from a separate room and it was broadcast live locally. Inside the debate hall, Duke, who has supported Donald Trump's campaign for president, was calling the demonstrators ""Black Lives Matter radicals."" Trump has disavowed Duke's support.In his closing argument, Duke said: ""The Black Lives Matter movement calls for the murder of police officers and calls for the death of police."" He offered himself as a counter to this sentiment: a candidate who would ""defend the police"" and fight for white people, who ""also deserve human rights."" Duke also took aim at Jews, when he was asked by moderator John Snell why he referred to those reporting on the tape of Donald Trump boasting about sexual assault as ""CNN Jews."" ""I'm curious what in world that has to do -- that fact that they were Jewish -- with Donald Trump and an open microphone?"" Snell asked. Duke said there needed to be more of an open discussion about ""any subject,"" even sensitive ones. ""There is a problem in America with a very strong powerful tribal group that dominates our media and dominates our international banking,"" he said. ""I'm not opposed to all Jews. I think there's a lot of great Jews."" Duke qualified for the debate by scoring 5.1% in the poll commissioned by the debate sponsor, Raycom, just making the cutoff of 5%. While he is running as a Republican, none of the other five candidates on stage had nice words to say about the former Klan member. ""Somehow, this snake slithered out of the swamp,"" said Democratic Candidate Caroline Frayard about Duke's presence.As the race stands, Duke's chances seem non-existent.

Republican Congressman Michael McCaul specifically mentioned the possibility of impeachment proceedings.Issa, who is facing a tough reelection battle, has said Clinton should be indicted for her use of a private server as secretary of state. In the interview on Wednesday, Issa said that throwing executives out of office is something that ""happens in third-world countries.""""But the idea that there's some sort of a quick fix and you throw somebody out of office, it happens in third-world countries,"" Issa said. ""It mostly doesn't happen in the US. You know, that's not to say that it can't be a tool that's available.

Do that first.""Issa, who is a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, added that impeachment should be used a last resort.""I always push back and tell people that's something you want to reserve that for long after the American people are demanding it before you even begin to look at it,"" he said.

Turmoil in the FBICrisscrossing the country to win over undecided voters in battleground states over the past few days, Clinton has been warning voters about what a Trump presidency would look like, casting the Republican nominee as a sexist bully who is temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be commander in chief.On Monday, Clinton was introduced in Kent, Ohio, by a former ballistic missiles officer, who said he would ""live in constant fear of his making a bad call"" under a President Trump. ""Imagine him plunging us into a war because someone got under his very thin skin,"" Clinton said about Trump. ""I know there are some who would that any discussion of this topic (nuclear weapons) could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so.""The next day, she went after Trump's past offensive comments about women, bringing to the stage in Dade City, Florida, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump criticized years ago when she gained weight.""I mean, really,"" Clinton said incredulously, ""can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?"" Hours later, in Fort Lauderdale, Clinton expressed exasperation when a man in the audience heckled her in the middle of her speech. ""I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous visions and behaviors from people who support Donald Trump,"" Clinton said, gesturing at the man.And in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Clinton asked the audience to imagine Trump sitting in the Oval Office on January 20 -- an exercise that prompted one audience member to yell out, ""Scary!"" ""What would it be like to have a president who pits people against each other, who doesn't try to pull America together? What would your life be like?"" Clinton asked.""Horrible!"" someone in the audience shouted.Throughout the general election, campaign aides have acknowledged that running against a theatrical and controversy-prone candidate like Trump has made it difficult for Clinton to stay focused on her own affirmative message.To share the candidate's personal story more forcefully, Clinton recently delivered a series of ""Stronger Together"" speeches centered around her views on issues like public service and faith. She has struck a notably upbeat tone when discussing her own biography and vision, presenting herself as the positive alternative to Trump.New CNN / ORC polls suggest new strength for Trump in Nevada, Clinton rise in Florida""I am proud that from the beginning that our campaign was about ideas, not insults,"" Clinton said in San Francisco in October.

Their attorneys and federal prosecutors in the case have convened inside a Newark, New Jersey, courtroom throughout the morning.Jurors wrapped Thursday on the fourth day of deliberations without reaching a verdict.Kelly, the former deputy chief of staff for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Baroni, the former Port Authority deputy executive director, are facing charges for their alleged involvement in a scandal that came to be known as ""Bridgegate."" Prosecutors allege that the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge were part of a deliberate effort to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, who did not endorse the Republican incumbent Christie in his 2013 re-election bid.Emails and text messages released in January of 2014 form the basis of the charges. In one particularly damning email, Kelly told former Port Authority official David Wildstein, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" Kelly later said her messages contained ""sarcasm and humor,"" and she claims that she had told Christie about traffic problems resulting from a study a day prior to sending the email.Baroni testified that he believed the closures were a part of a legitimate traffic study, an explanation that had been relayed to him by Wildstein, the professed mastermind of the incident who eschewed the trial by pleading guilty to once charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation. Kelly and Baroni each face a maximum sentence of 86 years, according to Paul Fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case.
