Photos of Clinton, who was preparing her Senate run, were slammed as brazen political pandering.One Yankees fan in particular -- former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- knocked Clinton for her 1999 Yankees allegiance. In an ironic twist, however, Giuliani pledged his support for Yankee arch rivals the Boston Red Sox during the 2007 World Series. Why? It might have been that Giuliani was running for president and all-important New Hampshire is in the heart of Red Sox nation. Or, perhaps it was as Giuliani said at the time, he just wanted to support the American League team. Maybe.Clinton has explained her dual allegiance as the result of loving baseball, but needing to pull for a winner.In a 1996 op-ed, Clinton wrote that her Cubs support was a ""family affair,"" where her father and bothers would ""act out plays that had just happened and yell and scream and imitate announcer Jack Brickhouse.""In 2003, Clinton wrote: ""In our neighborhood, it was nearly sacrilegious to cheer for the rival White Sox of the American League, so I adopted the Yankees as my AL team, in part because I loved Mickey Mantle,"" Clinton said in her memoir ""Living History."" ""My explanations of Chicago sports rivalries fell on deaf ears during my Senate campaign years later, when skeptical New Yorkers were incredulous that a Chicago native could claim youthful allegiance to a team from the Bronx.""But it was during a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago on October 8, 2014, where Clinton explained most clearly her dual fandom: A Cubs fan by birth and a Yankees fan because she likes winning.""I am Cubs fan,"" Clinton said, arguing that being a fan of the often losing baseball team prepared her for life. ""And when I was a little girl, I quickly caught on that being a Cubs fan was being more of a tenant of religious faith than any kind of passing fancy.""But she later in the question and answer, Clinton spoke about becoming a Yankees fan. ""I couldn't stay hitched with a losing team ... I had to search for a team that would counterbalance the experience of losing every single year, so -- I hate to say this, and I know you'll boo me -- I became a Yankees fan,"" she had said. ""I alternated my affections because it was just too hard being a Cubs fan, only being a Cubs fan.""""Someday,"" Clinton said wistfully, ""someday, it will happen.""But this time around, something finally clicked for the Cubs -- and Clinton has heard about it on the campaign trail. Even before the season began, she was signing Cubs jerseys, joking about this (finally) being ""the year."" She even headlined a fundraiser hosted by a co-owner of the team.""Wouldn't it be wonderful? Unbelievable, but wonderful,"" Clinton said of the prospect of a World Series run a year ago in Iowa, after a Cubs fan asked her to sign his jersey. Rooting for the Cubs makes you a ""very patient person"" and shows you ""can't expect things to turn out as you wish them to be,"" she told the man.""Thanks for wearing that,"" she said. ""It gets my blood going.""A few weeks later a man wore a custom Cubs jersey that had Clinton and the Number 45 on the back, in honor of the prospect she would become the 45th president.Clinton signed the jersey and told the supporter that 2016 was the year both she and the Cubs would win.So when Connolly Keigher, Clinton's trip director presented her boss with her phone to stream the post-game celebrations from Wrigley field on Saturday night, the former Illinois native looked elated. Photos of her reaction show Clinton making a face of astonishment and reporters saw Clinton laughing and joking with aides as she watched.Brian Fallon, Clinton spokesman, said Sunday that Clinton has already asked her staff to make time to watch the World Series. As for if she will go, Fallon only offered a ""We'll see."""	Hillary Clinton and the Chicago Cubs: It's complicated
1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/23/politics/michelle-obama-hillary-clinton-campaign/index.html	"Hillary Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday will campaign together for the first time, in North Carolina, a state that Clinton's top aides view as a must-win for Donald Trump.The two first ladies -- one former, one current -- will campaign together in Winston-Salem, Brian Fallon, Clinton's spokesman said Sunday.Clinton's strategy in North Carolina, a state that voted for then-Sen. Barack Obama on 2008 but flipped back to Republicans in 2012, relies heavily on high turnout from African American and Latino voters and a strong showing with college-educated whites, all groups that have grown in the state since four years ago.Michelle Obama's appearances for Clinton have garnered as much -- if not more -- attention than any other campaign surrogate.""I think she has emerged as our not so secret weapon out on the trail. She has exceeded our expectations in terms of how many events she has been able to do and been willing to do,"" Fallon said. ""Her team keeps surprising us with additional availability and we can't, from our vantage point, get her out there enough.""He added, ""She has been an absolute rock star.""Clinton also campaigned in North Carolina on Sunday, attending church at a predominantly black congregation in Durham, and then headlining a rally at St. Augustine's University in Raleigh.Clinton slammed Trump at the church service, saying that Republican nominee paints a ""bleak picture of inner cities and the African American community"" while arguing that systemic racism could be fixed with more law-and-order.Later in the day, at an outdoor rally in Raleigh, Clinton looked beyond Trump and began arguing in favor of key down-ballot Democrats, casting them as the kind of people she needs to be able to get things done if she wins the presidency.Clinton singled out Roy Cooper and Deborah Ross, the North Carolina Democratic gubernatorial and Senate nominees, respectively.""He knows that discrimination is not only wrong -- guess what, it is bad for business,"" Clinton said of Cooper and House Bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill, that GOP Gov. Pat McCory signed earlier this year. The law, in the eyes of its critics, discriminates against LGBT Americans and has caused a number of sports leagues and companies to pull business from the state.""North Carolina deserves a governor who puts the people of this state first, not some kind of ideological agenda,"" Clinton said.Clinton heralded Ross as the ""kind of partner I need in the United States Senate.""""Unlike her opponent, Deborah has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump,"" Clinton said. ""She knows that he is wrong for America, she knows that people of courage and principles need to come together to reject his dangerous and divisive agenda.""Clinton has looked to punish Republicans who are refusing to disavow Trump for the last two days, hammering Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania while she campaigned in the state on Saturday.Her aides say these comments are part of a strategy that they hope will help Clinton both win the White House and possibly secure a Democratic Senate in the process."	Michelle Obama to campaign with Hillary Clinton for the first time
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/23/politics/obama-endorsements-down-ballot/index.html	The outgoing Democratic president is set to endorse 150 state legislative candidates -- part of an effort to flip Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country ahead of the 2020 redistricting battle. The endorsements will come in the form of TV and radio ads, mailers, recorded calls and statements. Obama's plans were first reported by Politico and confirmed to CNN by Democratic officials. His down-ballot involvement comes as both the president and first lady Michelle Obama have taken on high-profile roles as surrogates for Hillary Clinton. New poll shows Clinton over Trump by double-digitsObama's late endorsements could help Democrats seize on what they hope will be a wave fueled by opposition to Donald Trump that could undo some of the losses in Congress and at the state legislative level that have occurred under Obama. Already, Obama has cut TV ads for five Senate Democratic candidates: Patrick Murphy of Florida, Kamala Harris of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Deborah Ross of North Carolina and Katie McGinty of Pennsylvania. He also appears in a TV spot for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and House contenders Bryan Caforio in California, Charlie Crist in Florida, Brad Schneider in Illinois, Terri Bonoff in Minnesota and Colleen Deacon in New York. Obama has done several radio ads, as well. That list so far includes four Senate hopefuls: Ross, McGinty, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. It also includes gubernatorial candidates Sue Minter of Vermont and Roy Cooper of North Carolina. And House Democratic contenders Tom O'Halleran of Arizona, Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky and Ruben Kihuen of Nevada also got radio ads. 	Obama plans 150 down-ballot endorsements
3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/23/politics/hillary-clinton-merrick-garland-supreme-court/index.html	"Federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland, whom President Barack Obama nominated to succeed the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. That has left the nation's highest court shorthanded, prone to ideological deadlocks and plainly wary about taking up some contentious disputes.Even as the Democratic nominee has decried the Senate's failure to act, she has declined to refer to Garland and intimated she might favor a different nominee if she becomes president. Several scenarios are possible, hinging not just on the results of the presidential election but also on Senate races and which political party controls the chamber. But if Clinton wins, here are key factors that ultimately could lead her to name Garland to the high court:Bipartisan support in a fractured CongressHe would have ready-made bipartisan support as Clinton tries for some semblance of political cooperation in the wake of this turbulent campaign. He is more moderate than her liberal base would desire, but no alternative name is now galvanizing the left. And in the orbit of Democratic insiders, many of her people are his people.Garland, who is white and turning 64 in November, would not give Clinton a way to make history, say, with the first African-American woman or first Asian American on the bench. But he could give her a way to make peace.President Obama is pushing for Senate action on Garland in the ""lame duck"" period before a new president takes office in January. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, has not flinched in his insistence that Scalia's seat should be filled by Obama's successor. It is difficult to see how pressure could build in the few remaining weeks the Senate is in session this year to induce Republican leaders to hold hearings and vote on Garland, a former federal prosecutor and now chief judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Some Democrats believe if Clinton is elected on November 8, she would continue to signal interest in a new crop of diverse Supreme Court candidates, possibly to pressure Republicans who would prefer Garland over a robust liberal nominee.Such Clinton moves would align with her earlier assertion that she would look ""broadly and widely"" for diverse candidates to fill a vacancy. In the recent debate she suggested she would seek individuals who would stand up to corporate and other powerful interests. Her campaign has not released any names of judges or lawyers who would be under consideration.Among those who could be in the mix, based on the Obama team's short-list and their continued regard among Democrats, are Sri Srinivasan, an Indian-American who is also on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals; Paul Watford, an African-American on the California-based US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit; and Ketanji Brown Jackson, a trial judge on the federal district court in Washington, DC. She would be the first African-American woman justice, as would be California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, another name raised as a possibility based on her background and credentials.Other judges and lawyers were under review when Obama made his choice last March and would be with a President Clinton. For his part, Donald Trump has put out lists of 21 court candidates, deeming them ""highly respected ... beautifully reviewed"" possibilities. Garland did not make Trump's lists.A chance to preserve political capitalA new president's strategy would necessarily depend on the political composition of the Senate, which has the power to confirm or reject a lifetime appointment to the nine-member court.If the Senate is still dominated by Republicans, Clinton would have incentive to nominate a person the GOP would be readier to accept. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican and former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman who is the most senior GOP senator, has praised Garland (and was crucial to his 1997 appointment to the DC Circuit), but Hatch has endorsed McConnell's decision to block action before the election.A Democratic-run Senate would offer Clinton more latitude in her choice, but a Republican minority could still mount a filibuster and force the president to use precious early-term capital to move a controversial nominee. Even before a nomination becomes ensnarled in Senate politics, intra-administration clashes often arise over which way a president should turn, for example, toward a historic ""first"" -- to the ideological interests of the party's base, or, perhaps, to a safe selection that avoids distraction from legislative priorities. The ongoing Garland situation would add a new wrinkle to such usual rivalries, because here the nation's top Democratic leader already has singled out Garland above others in the field.Close ties to Clinton's orbitGarland also came from the Clinton world. He was a deputy assistant attorney general in Bill Clinton's administration before the president appointed him to the DC Circuit.One of Garland's strongest boosters is Jamie Gorelick, a Washington lawyer who was deputy attorney general in the 1990s and is still tight with the Clintons. A connection of more recent vintage is Karen Dunn, a former law clerk to Garland who took a leading role in preparing Hillary Clinton for the debates.Garland is also a personal friend of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom Bill Clinton chose for his first high court appointment, in 1993, and who at 83 is now the eldest justice.In a wide-ranging interview in July, Ginsburg lamented the stalled Garland nomination. I asked if she would ever try to help his prospects by passing word to Clinton of her own possible retirement in the near future, which would ensure subsequent opportunities to appoint younger, perhaps more liberal or groundbreaking justices.Ginsburg said she did not believe any overt signal was necessary, declining to be explicit about her own plans yet observing that two justices are not far behind her in age, Anthony Kennedy, 80, and Stephen Breyer, 78.""I think she has figured it out,"" Ginsburg said of Clinton. ""She's bound to have a few appointments in her term."""	Why Merrick Garland should keep hoping
4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/23/politics/reality-check-week-in-whoppers/index.html	"Russian gains in SyriaDuring an exchange over what to do about the deteriorating situation in Aleppo in this week's debate, Donald Trump made a point about how the Russians were outmaneuvering the United States in Syria.""They had a ceasefire three weeks ago,"" he said. ""A ceasefire, the United States, Russia and Syria. And during the ceasefire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the ceasefire anymore.""They did?While the ceasefire seemed to hold for several days, there were more than 200 Russian and Syrian airstrikes during the weekend of September 23-25, with one witness telling CNN that it was a level of bombing that had never been seen before. On October 3, the US announced it was suspending talks with Russia and accused Moscow and Syria of violating the ceasefire through ""intensified attacks against civilian area, targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need.""There was no mention of Russians seizing any territory.Shading the truth on HellerEarly on in the debate, Hillary Clinton sought to defend herself from the charge that she was anti-gun and why she disagreed with the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which affirmed an individual's right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment.Clinton said that she ""disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.""In a 5-4 decision, the justices struck down parts of a DC law that made it a crime for anyone to carry an unregistered firearm and prohibited the registration of handguns. In effect, the district had imposed a virtual ban on the possession of any handgun within city limits. And yes, the law also required any legally owned firearms, such as rifles and shotguns, kept in a person's home be unloaded, disassembled or fitted with trigger locks.Now it could be argued that latter provisions were designed to protect toddlers from accidentally shooting themselves or others if they were to get their hands on a loaded rifle without a trigger lock. But the question before the Supreme Court really boiled down to whether DC could ban handguns for self-defense and whether the firearm safety requirements made it too difficult for homeowners to defend themselves.Indeed, after the Heller decision, DC passed a law making a person liable if he or she knowingly stored a firearm in a way that a child under the age of 18 could gain access to it. A similar law in San Francisco was challenged after the Heller decision. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that law and, so far, the Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal of that decision.The murder rate in the US 'is the highest it's been in 45 years'When Trump said this at a Colorado rally earlier this week, we cut him some slack, figuring it might have been a slip of the tongue. After all, he had been saying that last year saw the largest increase in the homicide rate in the country's largest cities in 45 years. Given the fact that the murder rate in 2014 was one of the lowest ever recorded, it is plausible the increase in percentage terms in 2015 was dramatic.But then he said it again on Friday at a rally in Fletcher, North Carolina.  Is it true? Not even close.According to FBI figures for murder and non-negligent homicides, the rate per 100,000 residents for 2015 was 4.9 -- sure, that's an 11% jump from the 4.4 rate in 2014. But it's far less that what it was 45 years ago (7.9) and what it was 25 years ago (9.8).We don't make anything?A bedrock idea of Trump's campaign is that the country's manufacturing sector has been hollowed out, mainly as a result of what he sees are bad trade deals. But at times Trump's dystopian vision of the country's manufacturing landscape goes way too far, as it did during Wednesday's debate.""We don't make our product anymore,"" he said. ""It's very sad, but I am going to create a ... the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We've given it up.""Given the loss of manufacturing jobs, it is tempting to moan, as Trump does, that the US doesn't make things anymore. But as CNNMoney's Chris Isidore and Jon Ostrower reported this week, US factories are producing three to five times more output than in the early 1950s to mid-1960s, and that manufacturing output set a record last year in inflation-adjusted terms. For example, according to Isidore and Ostrower, Boeing, the country's largest exporter, ""delivered 768 airliners in 2015, up 163% in 10 years. Archrival Airbus delivered its first US-assembled airliner from its new Alabama factory in April, and Brazilian plane maker Embraer recently moved assembly of its smallest private jets to Florida.""At the same time, U.S. auto production is ""within 7% of record levels, making 12 million cars and trucks a year. Not only have GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler all been hiring and investing in US plants, but foreign automakers are expanding operations here as well. The largest BMW plant in the world is now in South Carolina, and the plant exports most of the cars it builds there.""And the CNNMoney writers say ""the boom isn't just about big-ticket items. Chemical production hit a record $797 billion last year, up 30% in the last 10 years. The chemical boom has been fueled by the record US energy boom, which has made oil and natural gas particularly cheap. Petroleum is a key raw material for many chemicals, most of which are produced using energy from natural gas."" Sure jobs have been lost in manufacturing due to automation, greater efficiency and, of course, globalization. But to say that the country has given up making things is just plain wrong.It's rigged!Amid the accusations of a rigged election, of dead people voting and people casting ballots many, many times, Trump read this excerpt from a 2012 Washington Post blog post at a rally in Wisconsin.""Non-citizen votes could have given Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform ... and other Obama administration priorities,"" he read. ""It is possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina.""Trump is basing his claim on research published in 2014 by academics at Old Dominion University. Using the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, the researchers drew samples of non-citizens, and asked them if they were registered to vote and if they cast ballots in the 2008 and 2010 elections. In the paper, which was excerpted in The Washington Post, Jesse Richman and David Earnest concluded that their ""best guess"" was that 6.4% of their sample voted in 2008 and 2.2% did so in 2010.Given the fact there were nearly 20 million non-citizens of voting age living in the country at that time, the two claimed that is was possible that these percentages could have made the difference in some close elections.Since non-citizens tend to favor Democratic candidates, the academics postulate that the votes of non-citizens could account for Al Franken's razor thin, 312-vote win in the Minnesota Senate race in 2008. Franken went on to provide the Democrats the 60th vote to overcome a filibuster and pass the Affordable Care Act. The professors also said it was possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Barack Obama's close victory in North Carolina during the 2008 presidential contest.The Old Dominion academic came under sharp criticism, including a peer reviewed study in The Washington Post that stated, ""there is absolutely no evidence from the data that non-citizens voted in recent presidential elections.""In the face of some criticism of their methodology and with Trump using their work to bolster his point of a ""rigged"" election, the academics have clarified their point. Writing on his website this week, Richman noted that the number of non-citizens voting is so low that it can only change the outcome of extremely close elections. ""But one should keep in mind that such elections can be swayed by any number of factors that arguably bias election results toward or against particular parties or candidates.""In an interview, Richman was more succinct. ""Frankly, Al Franken's race was so close you could tell all kinds of stories about what tipped the balance,"" he said.Debunked?In the debate, Trump was asked about the allegations that he has sexually assaulted women.""Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked,"" he replied.Have they?Here is what we know about these allegations, spanning more than 35 years and involving at least 10 women who have come forward with sexual assault claims against Trump.Trump has challenged the allegations by calling the women liars and threatening litigation.""Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,"" Trump said during remarks in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. ""Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.""There is no question that these charges against Trump are being disputed. But to say they have been largely debunked goes too far."	Reality Check: The week in whoppers
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/23/politics/donald-trump-house-senate-republican-candidates/index.html	"The Republican nominee, who spends more time bashing establishment politicians than touting party unity, tied his agenda to ""a Republican House and Senate"" three times during his rally here on Sunday evening and urged voters to help him ""reelect Republicans all over the place.""""If you elect me along with a Republican House and Senate, we will immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military,"" Trump said, adding later that Republican majorities would help him ""immediately"" repeal Obamacare and ""swiftly enact"" the items in his agenda.The comments come two weeks after a slew of Republican senators and congressmen up for reelection withdrew their endorsements of Trump's candidacy in an unprecedented fracturing of party unity. That came just a month before the general election, after a tape of Trump bragging in 2005 about being able to grope and kiss women surfaced.Those defections prompted Trump to launch attacks against specific Republican senators who unendorsed him and complain that Republicans are less loyal than Democrats. He then unleashed a more sustained attack on establishment politicians in Washington whom he has accused of conspiring to sink his campaign.Even as he laid out his agenda for his first 100 days in office on Saturday, Trump warned that ""the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign"" and vowed to ""drain the swamp in Washington.""But as he is looking to sell voters in the final stretch of his campaign on his policy priorities -- from job creation to border security -- rather than on the personal controversies that have been sinking his campaign, Trump appears to be recognizing that he will only be able to enact some of those signature policies with the support of a Republican Congress.Despite urging voters to support him because ""I will fix it,"" Trump knows he cannot realistically pass his agenda without a GOP majority in Congress backing him up.But even as he issued a rare call for party unity on Sunday stumping in the key battleground state of Florida where his former GOP rival Sen. Marco Rubio (who is supporting Trump) is up for reelection, Trump couldn't avoid one brief complaint just minutes before wrapping up his speech.""Go out and vote and that includes helping me reelect Republicans all over the place,"" Trump said.And then he added: ""I hope they help me too! It'd be nice if they help us too, right?"""	Trump urges supporters to vote in GOP Congress

Now you know, a lot of Republicans have. They have had the grit and the guts to stand up and say he does not represent me,"" Clinton said. ""But Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq. He heard Donald call Mexican immigrants rapists. He heard him say terrible things about women, he heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasn't really born in America. Now how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear?""Clinton added, ""If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all of this, then can you be sure that he will stand up for you when it counts?""Polling shows Toomey is in a tight race with Katie McGinty, the Democratic Senate candidate in Pennsylvania and environmental activist.Clinton called McGinty ""exactly that kind of partner we need in the Senate, but more importantly, she is exactly that kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs.""Trump's campaign has sputtered since a 2005 video showed the businessman talking casually about actions that amount to sexual assault. A series of women have come forward and accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances and his poll numbers, particularly in key battleground states, have suffered.Because of this, Democrats are hopeful that they will be able to turn Trump's struggles into losses for Republicans in tight Senate races, like Toomey's.Clinton's comments come days after her top dollar super PAC, Priorities USA, announced that they would begin airing ads against Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and Toomey in Pennsylvania.Ted Kwong, Toomey's communications director, responded to Clinton's comments by arguing they prove ""Katie McGinty will be a rubber stamp for everything Hillary Clinton wants to do in Washington."" ""Pat Toomey has been, and will continue to be be, an independent leader in the Senate on issues ranging from gun safety to ending Wall Street bailouts,"" Kwong added.Introducing his running mate, Kaine reminded the crowd of the historic nature of the election, speaking about the possibility of Clinton becoming the first female president more so than usual.Kaine talked about watching his wife Anne, mother Kathy, and daughter Annella on stage during the Democratic National Convention, and what that meant to both him and the women in his family to see a female presidential nominee. He noted the ""strong women"" staff, volunteers and donors that have stood with him throughout his career. When Clinton asked him to be her running mate, he said, ""I was honored to have the chance to play the role for her that so many strong women have played for me."" ""Just think about this: Hillary's mom was born before women had the right to vote. And Hillary's daughter, Chelsea, will now get to vote for her mom to be president. Now is the claim of generational progress that this country holds for all of us when we do our best work,"" the Virginia senator said. ""In just 17 short days, we can forever -- and I mean forever -- change the way little girls and little boys look at their future in this country, because if you can be president of the United States, you can do anything,"" Kaine added."

Thomas has said as much, once comparing his job to a calling.""I never thought that I would treasure doing my job, and I have reached that point,"" the conservative justice told an audience in 2013 during a talk with federal appeals court Judge Diane S. Sykes. ""I've gotten to a point where it's like the priesthood, this is what I was called to do."" Thomas was only 43 when he was chosen as the second African-American nominee to the court and he faced immediate and scathing resistance from the civil rights community for some of his legal positions. That was immediately followed by the bombshell sexual harassment allegations against Thomas from Anita Hill that turned both into household names.He's gone gray on the bench and has cemented a reputation as the court's most consistent adherent to the conservative judicial philosophy of ""originalism."" ""More so than any of the justices he's served with during his 25 years on the Court, there's a coherent theory behind almost every one of the opinions he writes,"" said Steve Vladeck, a CNN contributor and law professor at the University of Texas School of Law.From his earliest days on the bench Thomas has stuck with a rare discipline to his view that the Constitution should be interpreted based on its original public meaning.""He has exceeded all of our expectations about the magnitude of his talent,"" C. Boyden Gray, who worked in the White House Counsel's office on the Thomas nomination, said recently.Although he largely stays out of public view, Thomas still attracts plenty of controversy and much of it concerns his opinions on race. The coming term will be no exception. He confounds his critics who seek something different  from the man who replaced Justice Thurgood Marshall, a famed civil rights lawyer, on the court but delights his supporters for looking at the Constitution through what they believe is a color-blind lens.His supporters were stunned when the Smithsonian opened a major museum meant to promote and highlight the contributions of African-Americans last month and almost entirely ignored the achievements of a black man who rose up from poverty to reach the highest pinnacle of the federal judiciary. His name came up only in reference to Hill's Senate testimony. They question why there is so little attention to Thomas' overall jurisprudence and so much time spent analyzing why he chooses to remain largely silent during oral arguments.Filling the void left by ScaliaAfter the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February and the possibility of more liberal justices joining the Supreme Court, Thomas's importance now and historical role could only grow as the most consistent and active conservative on the bench.Court watchers went into a frenzy in February, soon after Scalia's death, when Thomas asked a series of questions from the bench for the first time in a decade. His questions -- concerning the Second Amendment implications of a state law -- surprised even his colleagues.""Justice Thomas, after a 10-year silence, astonished all in attendance by asking nine questions, all in the same case,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg later remarked.There was a scramble to divine why Thomas had changed course.Was he spurred to ask a question because Scalia -- who wrote a landmark opinion concerning the Second Amendment -- was no longer alive to do so? Was this a turning point? Was Thomas taking on a new role at the court? Was it a sign of more to come?To supporters of Thomas, those are all the wrong questions. The answer was simple: he had a question that no one else had asked, and he wanted an answer.The notion that Thomas might be seeking to fill the void left by Scalia underestimates the work that Thomas is doing in his own sphere, court watchers say.""It's long been a mistake to view Justice Thomas as operating in Justice Scalia's shadow,"" said Vladeck. ""Behind the fact that they often (albeit not always) ended up on the same side of disputes lurked some fairly significant differences in methodology, interpretative commitments and style.""'I think you have to say certain things'It's not likely that Thomas is going to suddenly fill Scalia's vociferous role during oral arguments, or lurch to the center to attract more meaty assignments or even land a landmark opinion.Instead, he will continue down a path of slow and steady commitment to his judicial approach no matter how the court changes in the next few years.In the areas of deference to administrative agencies, federalism, the scope of the Commerce Clause, the reach of the Second Amendment and racial preferences among other areas, Thomas is laying the ground work for opinions that may be outliers now, but could plant seeds for the future.""I think that I may lose,"" he told Sykes, ""but I think I'm obligated, in fact encouraged by my colleagues -- that if you believe that, you write it.""He referenced the fact that back in 1896, when a 7-1 court approved the principle of ""separate but equal"" only one justice -- Justice John Marshall Harlan -- dissented.""I think someone should have kept writing that segregation was wrong,"" Thomas said. ""Regardless of what the precedent was, I think you have to say certain things.""Last term, Thomas made good on that promise. According to Vladeck, he wrote an opinion in 38 of 62 Supreme Court cases with signed decisions -- twice as many as the next busiest justice, Samuel Alito, a conservative appointed by George W. Bush.Carrie Severino, who clerked for Thomas, knows how he approaches his job. ""He looks at the actual text of the Constitution and studies the history and what it meant to those who ratified it -- not just what the conventional wisdom might be today,"" said Severino, now the policy director for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network.""Justice Thomas is writing for history,"" Ken Blackwell of the Family Research Council and Ken Klukowski, a senior counsel at First Liberty Institute wrote for the Washington Times last summer. ""Be right on the law, ignore politics  and the passions of the moment, and have faith that one day America -- through its president and Senate -- may appoint a Supreme Court majority that agrees, and makes it official.""Thomas on raceIt is the issue of race that most triggers outrage from the African-American community, especially his opposition to race-based affirmative action plans in public universities.William S. Consovoy clerked for Thomas in 2008 and also represented Abigail Fisher, a white woman from Texas who challenged the race conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas. Last spring, the court upheld the program.Thomas wrote separately in dissent saying that the majority opinion rests on ""pernicious assumptions about race."" He referenced a dissent he wrote in 2003 after a 5-4 court upheld a similar program at the University of Michigan Law School in a case called Grutter v. Bollinger.""The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all,"" Thomas wrote in 2003.""Justice Thomas believes that any discrimination on the basis of race violates the Constitution,"" said Consovoy. ""He therefore has taken the position that the use of race by universities to favor people of one race over another is illegitimate.""The roots of Thomas' beliefs are outlined in his 2008 autobiography that tracks his journey from Pinpoint, Georgia, to the highest court in the land. In the book, he says that after he graduated from Yale Law School he was unable to find a job. ""Now I knew what a law degree from Yale was worth when it bore the taint of racial preference,"" he wrote.In a controversial 1998 speech to the National Bar Association, the nation's oldest and largest association of predominately African-American lawyers, judges, educators and law students, Thomas took on his critics.""Any effort, policy or program that has as a prerequisite the acceptance of the notion that blacks are inferior is a non-starter with me,"" he said.He added that while it pained him deeply ""to be perceived by so many members of my race as doing them harm,"" he was addressing the audience ""not in anger"" but to ""assert my right to think for myself, to refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as though I was an intellectual slave because I'm black.""Legacy of MarshallThomas' critics lament that he took the seat of the legendary Thurgood Marshall, who as a young lawyer for the NAACP, travelled the country to argue against laws that discriminated on the basis of race. It was Marshall who was the architect of Brown v. Board of Education the landmark opinion that dismantled the idea that government could segregate races.Unlike Thomas, Marshall was not an originalist, said Guy-Uriel Charles the director of the Duke Law Center on Law, Race and Politics.""Justice Marshall believed in the living Constitution,"" said Charles, ""the idea that the meaning of the Constitution can change.""Charles believes that after his confirmation, ""many African-Americans held out hope that even though Justice Thomas was conservative, that as a black person from Georgia and someone who invoked his racial identity in his confirmation hearings, he would be sympathetic on racial issues.""Instead, he says, ""The civil rights community by and large have expressed deep disappointment with Justice Thomas on race"" because they ""believe that a colorblind Constitution means that black people and people of color will always be at a disadvantage, the playing field will never be leveled.""Charles points to an instance, when Thomas wrote a stirring opinion in a cross-burning case, when the civil rights community felt ""hope"" that he may shift course.""In our culture, cross burning has almost invariably meant lawlessness and understandably instills in its victims well-grounded fear of physical violence,"" Thomas wrote.Charles said ""this is a dissent that could have been written by Justice Marshall were he still on the Court"" but he added the case, Virginia v. Black, was decided in the same year as Grutter.""After 25 years on the court, he has an established record on race issues and no one is surprised by his racial conservative opinions and there is no expectation that he will decide cases differently,"" Charles said.He points to last term when the court ruled in favor of a death row inmate in a case concerning race discrimination in jury selection. Thomas was the sole dissenter.The case concerned Timothy Tyrone Foster, an African-American, on death row in Georgia for the 1987 murder of an elderly white woman, Queen Madge White. The jury that convicted him was all white. Twenty years after his sentence, his attorneys obtained notes the prosecution team took while it was engaged in picking a jury, including marking potential jurors who were black with a ""b"" written by their name.""The focus on race in the prosecution's file plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.In his dissent, Thomas said he believed the Supreme Court owed more deference to the lower court's ruling that prosecutors had race-neutral reasons for striking specific jurors.In his view, ""The court today invites state prisoners to go searching for new 'evidence' by demanding the files of the prosecutors who long ago convicted them . ...I cannot go along with that 'sort of sandbagging of state courts'"" wrote said.To Ian Millhiser of the progressive Center for American Progress, the vote was unfathomable.""A note on one of the prosecution's internal documents suggested that the office did not want a particular juror to be seated because of the juror's membership in a 'Black Church',"" Millhiser wrote at the time. ""And yet, even with all of this evidence and more at his fingertips, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the Court should not rule that unconstitutional jury discrimination took place in this case.""Confirmation controversyThomas may still best be remembered for his conformation hearings when Anita Hill, an attorney worked for Thomas in the 1980s, came forward and accused him of sexual harassment. The nature of the allegations shook the country -- but also for the first time brought the issue to the forefront of a national discussion. A quarter century later Thomas has stuck to his testimony.""I deny each and every single allegation against me today that suggested in any way that I had conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with Anita Hill,"" he told the senators, and later famously referred to coverage of the scandal as a ""high-tech lynching.""Indeed, Thomas' connection to Hill is the only mention of him in the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture. In a gallery dedicated to ""A Changing America: 1968 and Beyond"" one display labeled the ""1990's"" prominently features a picture of Anita Hill, and a video that excerpts her testimony at his confirmation hearing. Other items in the display feature Nelson Mandela's election to the African National Congress, Colin Powell's tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Magic Johnson announcing his contraction of the HIV virus, and Toni Morrison accepting the Nobel Prize. There is no direct mention of Thomas' nomination to the highest court in the land.The museum is arranged in most part by theme and doesn't have a display dedicated to Justice Thurgood Marshall either, but there is a large picture of Marshall near the entrance and a copy of the Brown v. Board of Education opinion as well as a wall dedicated to one of his quotes. For Severino, leaving Thomas out is a missed opportunity. ""The museum was either playing politics,"" she said, ""or is blissfully ignorant of one of the most significant jurists in the country, perhaps because his commitment to a colorblind Constitution doesn't fit into their narrative."""
