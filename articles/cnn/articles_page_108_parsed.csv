The states with the highest rates of search are not battlegrounds, but Republican and Democratic strongholds.Trump's most enthusiastic supporters stand by their manAs of Wednesday evening, three of the top market searches for ""write-in"" came in solidly Democratic states: Vermont, Delaware and New Jersey. Utah, a reliably red state that no Democrat has won since Lyndon B. Johnson; and Indiana, home to Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, round out the top five. Related searches to ""write-in,"" according to Google Trends, largely focus on two politicians, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Pence, the Indiana Republican. Searches for ""is Bernie Sanders a write in candidate"" spiked 2,750% in the last week while searches for ""write in Mike Pence"" spiked 2,400% in the last week.List: Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking by him?Results though are different in the states. In Utah, for example, where a recent poll found Clinton and Trump tied with independent candidate Evan McMullin only four points back, the volume of searches for ""Mitt Romney write in"" grew by 4,000% in the last week.Google Trends data don't show what caused this trend, but the campaign trail was rocked on Friday after a 2005 video tape surfaced featuring Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a vulgar and sexually aggressive conversation about women. Trump later apologized for the remarks -- first in a video and later during during Sunday night's debate with Clinton -- but since then has been rebuked and abandoned by members of his own party. Some called for Pence, Trump's running mate, to lead the ticket instead.Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign has it's own set of problems; WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of hacked emails from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Some of the emails, including one that suggested a senior campaign aide had communicated with government officials about the release of her State Department emails, led to accusations of collusion from Trump and other Republicans.John Podesta emails: Latest Wikileaks release With less than a month to go until Election Day, it's not clear whether there will be continued high interest in write-in candidates or if searches will translate into action at the ballot box. According to data from the Federal Election Commission, write-in votes accounted for 0.11% of the vote in 2012, which doesn't sound like much, but was in fact the largest share in the last four presidential elections."

If it works for someone who is making the news, it's certainly worth trying for those of us who are simply over it. Let's take a look at some cat gifs that make the story of the election season more tolerable. The GOP was taken by storm when Donald Trump bowled over more than a dozen other candidates.Meanwhile, over on the Democratic side, the race was largely just between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders.The media and Republicans in Congress dogged Clinton to release emails she had sent from a personal server during her time as secretary of state.And Donald Trump refused to release his tax returns, which has been standard operating procedure for candidates since the 1970s.Clinton and Trump finally faced off in presidential debates. Make sure to catch the third debate Wednesday on CNN. Television audiences were treated to circular logic from the campaigns' surrogates.Everyone waited eagerly for this season's ""October Surprise.""This is what newsrooms across America have looked like for the past week. Our families don't remember us.America is collectively over it.But don't worry, America, we only have 26 days left. "	10 cat gifs that purrrrfectly describe 2016	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Her fundraisers, taken together, have raised more than $90 million for the campaign, according to CNN's estimate based on average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the campaign.With the size and price of Clinton's fundraiser, that number will likely come close to topping $100 million by the end of the week.Thursday and Friday's events, which come less than a month before Election Day, are being branded as Clinton's last on the West Coast, a tactic the campaign is using to raise as much as possible before Clinton spends more time exclusively focused on battleground states.On Thursday, Clinton will headline an afternoon ""California Celebrates Hillary"" mid-afternoon event that will cost $50,000 to chair. Tickets start at $500. Clinton will be joined by singer Andra Day.Clinton was scheduled to sweep through California for fundraisers last month, but had to cancel the events due to her pneumonia diagnosis, which sidelined her for the better part of a week. Clinton ended up calling into the fundraiser, but donors who paid to attend last month's event have been given tickets to the Day concert, as well.Later that evening, Clinton will travel to a dinner concert with Elton John in Los Angeles. This will be the icons second event for Clinton. He also headlined a March fundraiser in New York City.Tickets for the event, which is expected to be her biggest earner of the week, go from $33,400 to $100,000 for premium seats.On October 14, Clinton will headline an afternoon event in Seattle featuring performances by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. The event will likely be large: It is being held at Seattle's Paramount Theater, which holds around 2,800. It is unusual that a candidate break away from the campaign trail for days at a time to fundraise this late in the campaign. But the decision to do so is a sign that while Clinton's fundraising has been record breaking this cycle, much of her top-dollar fundraising stems from events she has to headline.Clinton's campaign raised a record $154 million in September, breaking the record set by then-Sen. Barack Obama's campaign in August of 2008.To date, Clinton has raised close to $6 million at three fundraisers in October, according to CNN's estimates."

""She wants to knock the hell out of your Social Security. She wants to knock the hell out of your Medicare and Medicaid. And I am going to save them.""The hacked emails do have excerpts of speeches Clinton gave in which she spoke approvingly of the approach taken by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles who co-chaired a commission to come up with ways to reduce the federal debt. ""So, you know, the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,"" she told a gathering sponsored by Morgan Stanley. ""The specifics can be negotiated and argued over. But you've got to do all three. You have to restrain spending, you have to have adequate revenues and you have to have growth. And I think we are smart enough to figure out how to do that.""Among the recommendations that Simpson and Bowles made was a plan to shore up the Social Security Trust Fund. The plan included gradually increasing payroll taxes on high earners, a restructuring of benefits to increase the amount of retirement payments for lower income workers while decreasing the amount for upper income ones. The plan also called for gradually increasing the age a person could draw full Social Security benefits from 66 which it was in 2010 when the recommendations were made to 69 in 2075.Whether one agrees that raising taxes on high earners and raising the retirement age by three years over a 65-year-period is ""knocking the hell out of Social Security,"" the fact is the excerpts released by WikiLeaks so far do not show Clinton specifically calling for cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Indeed, she said the specifics of Simpson-Bowles approach ""can be negotiated.""Who knows how a President Hillary Clinton would approach the issue of entitlement programs. But to say that she wants to drastically cut these programs based on the excerpts of her speeches, as we know them right now, is false."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/donald-trump-moment-of-reckoning-election-2016/index.html	"Presidential campaigns always fear the October surprise. In Trump's case it was a pattern of demeaning behavior toward women that took on new significance after a weekend bracketed by two explosive reports. Trump's most enthusiastic supporters stand by their manThe first was The Washington Post release of a 2005 hot mic conversation in which Trump was recorded boasting about his license to grope women as ""a star."" Over the weekend, CNN's Kfile revealed Trump's crude and demeaning conversations about women over a 17-year period with radio shock-jock Howard Stern.And on Wednesday, The New York Times published an account of two women who described unwanted sexual advances by Trump, followed by a third account published in People Magazine. CNN has not yet independently confirmed either The New York Times or People Magazine accounts. The Trump campaign described the entire Times article as a ""fiction"" that amounted to ""character assassination."" A Trump attorney also issued an open letter to The Times demanding an immediate retraction and apology. The Trump campaign told People magazine: ""This never happened. There is no merit or veracity to this fabricated story."" Trump aggressively defended himself during a rally Thursday, saying they were ""pure fiction,"" ""outright lies"" and promised to provide evidence to prove they were false.""These claims are all fabricated. They're pure fiction and outright lies. These events never, ever happened,"" Trump said in West Palm Beach, Florida.But at a time when voters are already casting their ballots and Trump's path to 270 electoral votes has dramatically narrowed, the campaign is engulfed in a swirl of allegations about Trump's conduct toward women that has crippled its ability to sway undecided voters.Trump's assertion to CNN's Anderson Cooper in Sunday night's debate that his boasts on the ""Access Hollywood"" tape about grabbing women were ""just words"" -- seemed to inflame controversy.Several women said his denial of those kinds of actions infuriated them and prompted them to come forward. As the floodgates opened on the conduct of a powerful and litigious figure, several beauty pageant contestants said they felt emboldened to describe Trump's leering, lewd behavior when he owned the Miss USA pageant. Tasha Dixon, a 2001 contestant, told a Los Angeles TV station, Trump entered rooms where ""some were topless ... some were naked"" as he allegedly inspected and appraised as the owner of the pageant.First lady Michelle Obama said the comments in the 2005 video had left her ""shaken.""""I can't stop thinking about this,"" she said at a rally for Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire. ""It has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted.""Trump has retained his core support despite hits on his credibility. But this time the question is whether his loyal backers will believe that the wave of allegations are a calculated attempt by his enemies to destroy his campaign in the final weeks.The problem he faces is that the conduct described by several women aligns exactly with the kind of behavior he bragged about in his own voice to ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush in 2005.A trio of state polls released this week -- taken after the 2005 recording was published -- show Clinton's northern ""blue wall"" holding, as she carries commanding leads across a series of key states: She leads Trump by 9 points in Pennsylvania, 11 points in Michigan and 7 points in Wisconsin.Additionally, a Republican National Committee source told CNN's Sara Murray Thursday that the Trump campaign decided to pull resources from the swing state of Virginia, essentially conceding the state to Clinton.""We remain absolutely committed to winning in Virginia. While we're reallocating some of our staff strategically to accommodate early voting in nearby priority states such as North Carolina, our campaign leadership and staffing remains strong in Virginia,"" said  John Ullyot, a Trump spokesman, in response to the reports the campaign was pulling out of Virginia.Trump is now in the foxhole, lashing out at Republican lawmakers like House Speaker Paul Ryan, who refuse to defend him, questioning the credibility of his accusers, and excoriating what he views as a biased press corps that he believes is aiding Clinton.""You're a disgusting human being,"" Trump reportedly told New York Times reporter Megan Twohey when she asked him about the allegations that he touched women inappropriately before publishing the story. ""None of this ever took place,"" he told the newspaper.The Trump campaign's strategy as each accusation surfaced has been to shift the conversation back to the allegations of sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton (who is not on the ballot), and his charge that Hillary Clinton served as an enabler who tried to damage the credibility of women he was involved with. Speaking in Orefield, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, called the women's accounts ""unsubstantiated allegations"" and said the Trump campaign is ""not going to allow the Clinton campaign and the national media to turn this campaign into a discussion of slander and lies.""But Trump's stunt of trotting out several of Bill Clinton's accusers at the debate made many Republicans cringe.Throughout this campaign, Trump has laid out a clear, populist message and set of goals. Nearly any voter, on the other hand, will tell you they aren't sure what Clinton's core message is or what her agenda would be in the White House.Swing-state polls show Trump path to WH narrowingBut in these final weeks, when Trump should be making his closing argument, the deluge of scandals surrounding his campaign have swallowed his message. As the polls make clear, Clinton has benefited -- that effect has elevated her flawed candidacy to something close to a sure bet.""You know, if I were running against any Republican, I would be working hard and I would be asking for your help,"" Clinton said at a campaign event Thursday. ""But this is an election between two very different visions, views, and sets of values. And that's why the stakes are so high, because we know, we've already learned who Donald Trump is, what we have to prove in this election is who we are, and what we stand for, and what we believe in."" Losing campaigns often try to pinpoint the definitive moment when they knew the race was over.For John McCain, it was the day the markets collapsed and he insisted the fundamentals of the economy were strong. For Mitt Romney, it was the emergence of a taped fundraiser speech where he said 47% of American voters would never vote for him because they are dependent on government.It will not be quite as simple to pinpoint one single moment for Trump if he loses on Election Day, because his polls numbers have been sliding ever since his defensive and unpolished performance in the first debate.""For many voters still struggling with how to vote, all the bad news about Trump -- combined with the questionable things he has personally said over the last 16 months -- have finally created a tipping point that many thought would have come much earlier,"" said Republican strategist Mike DuHaime, who has advised New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former president George W. Bush.DuHaime called the Trump campaign's decision to attack Bill Clinton as their response ""ludicrous and amateurish,"" an illustration that ""they only understand how to talk to the people already voting for Trump."" ""With all of the places where Republicans could legitimately question Hillary Clinton's policy choices"" such as her approach to Russia, Syria, tax policy and her US Senate votes, as well as ""her overall judgment"" in creating her own private email server and the questionable fundraising practices of Clinton Global Initiative, ""our nominee has decided to attack her husband instead,"" he said.""Maybe it feels good for them to vent 20 years of anti-Bill frustrations but it doesn't help Trump and likely helps Secretary Clinton,"" he said."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/republicans-congress-control-donald-trump/index.html	"Ryan, who has not withdrawn his endorsement of Trump, told donors on a private call Wednesday that he doesn't want to go to war with the Republican presidential nominee. But the concern now, the speaker said, is that Trump's poll numbers are worse than 2008 Republican nominee Sen. John McCain's were during the Democratic wave that year when the GOP lost seats. They need to stem their House losses now, he warned. A Ryan aide told CNN the call was positive and donors backed the strategy to focus on keeping GOP seats. But the collateral damage from Trump's sliding stand in the polls and combative posture has turned what most thought unthinkable -- a Democratic House -- into a real possibility.""Because of Donald Trump, we will absolutely pick up more seats that originally expected,"" Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, of New Mexico, the campaign chairman for House Democrats, told CNN Thursday in a phone interview.A key reason why the GOP is panicking: They are worried Trump's scorched-earth strategy will depress GOP turnout by convincing many college-educated, suburban white voters -- a key constituency for Republicans -- to stay home.Since the news of Trump's tape surfaced last week and a flood of stories came out late Wednesday, Ryan has avoided any opportunity to have to address the bombshell that is tearing his party apart. The speaker quickly jetted off Thursday after giving a speech to Wisconsin business leaders, not taking any questions despite advertising that the event would allow 30 minutes for questions.For his part, Trump has lashed out at the speaker for telling his members Monday morning that he's done defending the real estate mogul, criticizing him at his rallies and suggesting in an interview on Fox News he won't be speaker next year.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi predicted on a call with House Democrats that if the election were held today, Democrats would regain control of the House. A day later, she reiterated to reporters in Texas that a large victory for Hillary Clinton means a Democratic sweep both in Washington and around the country.""I think we'll have a very strong election of Secretary Hillary Clinton and her success,"" Pelosi said Tuesday in Texas, reiterating her forecast that ""If she wins by seven points, I think we can win state houses, state legislators, the Congress, House and Senate.""Republicans pressured to denounce TrumpMcConnell has publicly stressed for months that math to keep a GOP Senate worked against the party, telling reporters recently it was a ""knock-down, drag-out, sort of like a knife fight in a phone booth."" McConnell continues to back Trump, but repeatedly refuses to engage in any questions about allegations about Trump. He and other GOP leaders have instructed those in tough races across the country to do what they need to separate from the businessman to carve out their own brand.The numbers don't look good for Republicans.Polling in states with marquee Senate races show Clinton's lead over Trump growing, and these don't take into account the dynamic of women publicly giving personal accounts of Trump assaulting them that have only this week come to light. In Pennsylvania, a Bloomberg poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 9 percentage points, 48% to 39%. GOP Sen. Pat Toomey has avoided answering whether he would vote for Trump. After the video emerged last Friday of Trump using lewd and sexually aggressive language about women, the Pennsylvania Republican told reporters Monday he had ""serious concerns.""  That wasn't good enough for his Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, who, after new reports about Trump came out, slammed the incumbent in a conference call with reporters for not coming out against the GOP nominee.  ""How can Pat Toomey still be standing by Donald Trump as he is? When by Donald Trump's own bragging and the corroborating stories of women -- the women that Donald Trump attacked -- these women are describing actions that the senator has said amount to sexual assault and a very, very serious crime,"" McGinty said. Toomey, along with other Republican candidates in swing states, are in a politically perilous situation because many of the Republican base's supporters -- who are needed on Election Day -- support Trump and might turned off by congressional candidates who openly oppose the GOP nominee.Nevada GOP Rep. Joe Heck, who is running to fill the Senate seat of retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, is learning that denouncing Trump has its downsides to publicly criticizing Trump. He had expressed support over recent months, but withdrew his backing last weekend.  Since then he has been berated by conservatives who back Trump and are now threatening to vote against him next month.Ryan has spent time campaigning in his home state for Sen. Ron Johnson, who is in a neck-and-neck race with former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold. The latest Marquette University poll shows Johnson doing better that Trump -- he trails his Democratic opponent by two points, 46%-48%, while Trump is behind Clinton 37-44%.In North Carolina -- another key battleground for the White House and Senate -- a new Suffolk poll has GOP Sen. Richard Burr with a lead against Democratic challenger Deborah Ross by 4 percentage points, and has Clinton leading Trump with a slim 45%-43% margin.A Gallup poll of Republicans indicated that Trump's approval rating within his own party is dropping. Earlier this month, 69% of Republicans said they approved of Trump, but after the release of the 2005 video showing him making sexually aggressive remarks about women and Sunday's debate, that number fell to 65%.Among Democrats, Clinton's favorable ratings rose slightly in that Gallup poll from 81% to 84%.The key question now is who turns out on Election Day and will those Republicans who are helping keep these Senate and House GOP candidates in a position to win actually show up after hearing more about reports about Trump's treatment of women.Can Republicans separate from Trump?It's unclear whether House Republicans efforts to separate themselves from Trump will withstand the final three weeks of a unpredictable campaign. Their game plan for months has been to emphasize individual records and discuss local issues. In some cases, members have withdrawn support, denounced the GOP nominee or ignored the top of the ticket. In recent weeks, Republican members and strategists have touted their own polling in competitive races across the country showing GOP candidates outperforming Trump. Katie Martin, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, insists that they are not seeing any real shift in races around the country.""While TV presidential pundits want to look into their crystal balls to tell America what will happen in 26 days, our data is painting a very different picture on the landscape of House races,"" Martin said. And the NRCC spokeswoman also name-checked the current top House Democrat, whom many GOP candidates are incorporating into their campaign ads.""If Democrats think the winning message this year is to make Nancy Pelosi speaker again, they are once again proving just how out of touch they are,"" Martin added.Two senior House GOP strategists told CNN Thursday they aren't making major adjustments in how they approach their races -- leaders are saying they support each member's assessment about how their latest polls aren't ""showing a change from weeks prior."" But the strategists added that it might be too early to see results yet about whether what was on the tapes is resonating.But House Democrats, who have been working hard to tie GOP candidate to Trump say the latest allegations against him are filtering the advantage down-ballot to their candidates across the country. One senior House Democratic strategist admitted that while some polls do show Republicans in decent shape, they are feeling good that Clinton could win with a large enough margin that it would be very difficult for GOP candidates in House districts and would obliterate those who may now have 4- to 5-point leads. These Democrats say getting the 30 seats they need to retake the House is still a high hurdle, and admit the limiting factor is not having enough money to help amplify their national message of running against Trump.Parties relying on super PACsBoth parties are relying on outside super PACs to help boost their candidates, and earlier this fall, the Congressional Leadership Fund, the GOP group affiliated with Ryan, announced it doubled donations this cycle.  This week CLF, announced it was branching out from its focus on buying television ads and would be deploying significant resources to help several House Republicans target their messages and support ground game plans.The House Majority PAC, the counterpart helping House Democrats, has also broken their past fundraising goals and is releasing a flood of new ads linking GOP candidates to Trump.  Jeb Fain, the spokesman for the group, said as GOP members try to make this about other issues in their specific districts, ""ultimately this is going to be a national election and Trump is a major factor. House Republicans created this monster."" In a sign of the expanded playing field, House Democrats are now putting money into a normally red district in Kansas, where GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder is in a tightening race with Democratic challenger Jay Sidie. Lujan also pointed to California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa and Florida Rep. John Mica as two incumbents who are facing stronger than expected re-election contests.Lujan encouraged the continuation of Trump's strategy to keep up blistering attacks, saying the Democratic base was"" getting more and more fired up and independents are getting more disgusted with Trump's candidacy.""  The New Mexico Democrat hoped Trump wouldn't listen to Republicans who want him to turn his focus on Clinton's emails and other vulnerabilities, saying, ""if Donald Trump has another week like he just had, that will mean more seats for Democrats.""

Founded in 1800, the Library of Congress now houses more than 150 million items ranging from books to photographs to musical instruments and ancient Mesoamerican jade pieces -- all of which Hayden hopes to make available to the curious across the globe.""I'm going to be tweeting out my discoveries and inviting people to join me on that,"" Hayden said. Hayden said she also plans to work with the staff on digitizing what she calls the library's ""treasures.""""Hopefully in a decade, we'll all be able to reach the Library of Congress at our fingertips,"" Hayden said. In her first few days on the job, Hayden toured the library's map collection, where she saw the equipment needed to digitize larger paper materials. She also took the chance to see how the library's virtual visitors are able to manipulate 3-D scans of some of the library's non-text collection. The idea of libraries as ""opportunity centers"" is something that Hayden has repeatedly stressed.Before coming to Washington, Hayden served as the head of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore. During the unrest following the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, Hayden made the decision to keep the library open, even though one of the branches was across the street from the CVS that burned on national television after being looted. It was a decision Hayden made because she believed Baltimore needed the communal space during that time.""The library was still that safe place, that place for opportunity,"" Hayden said. ""My decision to make sure it was open and available, right in the middle of all of the unrest, the next day, in fact, was really based on what I knew what the community needed and what they expected. And there they were, lined up, the next day to get into that library.""  To mark Constitution Day on September 16, Hayden partnered with Discovery Education, a subsidiary of the Discovery media conglomerate, and some of the library's experts to participate in a Twitter chat with students in classrooms across the country. It was one more way for Hayden to connect with the people who inspired her career from the beginning.Hayden began her career as a children's librarian at what she described as a ""small, store-front library"" in Chicago. ""It's just exciting to think about, even now, of 'Wow, there's a profession that allows you to marry your love of books and reading with sharing it with others,"" Hayden told CNN hours after leading story time at the library's Young Readers Center.""As a history major, to be part of making history was humbling, exciting and it also made me think, if I can make history, anybody can make history,"" Hayden said.

As the staff was on a conference call ticking off campaign items about door knocks and phone calls, a Trump staffer interrupted by saying, ""You haven't heard the news that we are leaving Virginia?"" according to the operative, who summarized the staffer's comments.""It was absolutely a broadside,"" the operative said.The campaign is not admitting that Virginia is no longer in play. However, on Thursday, it did release a statement acknowledging that they are pulling staff and resources.""We remain absolutely committed to winning in Virginia. While we're reallocating some of our staff strategically to accommodate early voting in nearby priority states such as North Carolina, our campaign leadership and staffing remains strong in Virginia,"" wrote John Ullyot, the deputy political director for communications for the Trump campaign.He confidently continued: ""Together with the RNC and the state party, we will have all the resources we need to re-take the commonwealth at the presidential level in November, as historically early voting in Virginia is much less of a focus for both parties than in some other states such as North Carolina.""Despite the campaign's assurances, Trump's allies in Virginia remain aggravated by the way the Trump Team has handled the news. According to the GOP operative, John Whitbeck, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, was ""furious"" with the way Trump staffers dumped the news on their Virginia colleagues Wednesday evening. David D'Onofrio, the communications director for the Virginia state party, declined to comment on the Trump campaign's decision-making. He said that the state party will continue its work.""We're full steam ahead with our Team Virginia efforts that are working up and down the ticket to make sure that Republicans are getting elected in Virginia,"" D'Onofrio said. The stoppage in Virginia looks to have been a quick decision. Just one day before this announcement, Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, made two stops in Virginia: one in Salem and another in Lynchburg at Liberty University, an evangelical college led by Jerry Falwell Jr., a steadfast Trump supporter.On Monday, the Trump campaign fired its Virginia chair, Corey Stewart, a candidate for governor next year and a Trump loyalist, after he staged a controversial protest in front of the RNC to convince GOP members and RNC staff to not give up on Trump despite falling poll numbers and the release of a 2005 videotape with Trump making lewd comments.But the Trump campaign has been under pressure for months to give up on Virginia and focus on states like North Carolina, where polls show a tighter race. As far back as August, the RNC was urging Trump aides to allocated their resources elsewhere, but Trump's son, Eric, vetoed the idea. ""Eric was one of the driving forces to quash the effort to reallocate out of Virginia back in August,"" the source said."	Trump campaign pulls resources out of Virginia	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism, they're a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or financial entity with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you, it's for themselves. And their agenda is to elect Crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.""Trump also included an apparent insult to Natasha Stoynoff, the woman from People Magazine in which she alleged that she had been physically attacked by Trump at Mar-A-Lago while she was on assignment in December 2005 writing a profile of his first anniversary with his wife, Melania.""Take a look, you take a look, look at her, look at her words -- you tell me what you think. I don't think so,"" Trump said at his rally.The GOP nominee said he was willing to take vicious ""slings and arrows"" for his loyal supporters and said the new claims against him were ""preposterous, ludicrous and defy logic"" and said that the stories about him had already been discredited.Trump said that the new allegations against him were proof that he was being punished for leaving the ""special club"" of establishment insiders.He said that the election had become an ""absolute horror show of lies, deceptions, malicious attacks.""""Many of my friends and many political experts warned me that this campaign would be a journey to Hell, but they are wrong. It will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people that are so desperately in need of help.""Trump said that it was ""hurtful"" to be slandered and publicly smeared in front of his family.""What is going on is egregious,"" Trump said. ""But I also know it is not about me. It is about all of you and it is about our country. It is about all of us together as a country."""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/ivanka-trump-donald-trump-groping-defense-allegations/index.html	"In a campaign ad released in May, the 34-year-old Trump was the face of the campaign's most overt appeal to women, saying that her father ""understands the needs of a modern workforce"" and is committed to changing ""outdated labor laws"" to support women and children.And, confronted about her father's past treatment of women, she was steadfast and defiant, even telling CBS This Morning that her father was ""not a groper.""Now with 26 days until Election Day, her father's campaign has been rocked with allegations that he groped, touched or acted inappropriately toward women, Donald Trump's chief character witness has been publicly silent.She has not commented about the tapes of Trump's conversation with Billy Bush of ""Access Hollywood"" in which Trump spoke in vulgar and crude terms about women, nor has she commented on her father's own words against her which include condoning the radio host Howard Stern referring to her as a ""piece of ass.Ivanka Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday for a series of small events, described as coffees, in the suburbs of Philadelphia. A recent Bloomberg poll showed that voters from that area favor Hillary Clinton by a wide 28-point margin.In Trump's first event in Malvern, Pennsylvania, she didn't mount a full-throated defense of her father. Instead, as she took questions from Erin Elmore, a Trump supporter who appeared on ""The Apprentice,"" the allegations of groping went unnoticed. Trump fielded a series of short, largely personal questions and praised her father as a ""great dad"" and as someone who has big visions for America.""What I can uniquely talk to all of you about is my father as a personal mentor and a role model to me as a great dad growing up,"" she said.Until Thursday, her only recent public appearance had been at Sunday's presidential debate after which she did not publicly weigh in on her father's performance. Public statements have largely been relegated to social media; Ivanka Trump's Instagram is full of her promoting her #WomenWhoWork campaign, the title of her forthcoming book. There is one photo of the Gateway Arch, the iconic structure synonymous with St. Louis. There are none of her father or with members of her family from the debate.Since the Republican National Convention, her public involvement with the campaign has primarily been to push the paid family leave proposal that runs counter to GOP orthodoxy and which she convinced her father to add to his platform. She pitched that plan to conservative congressional leaders in late September. Ivanka Trump mounted a defense of those policies in an interview with Cosmopolitan that appears to be her most recent public comments on behalf of the campaign. Met with questions about her father's past statement that ""pregnancy is an inconvenience,"" Trump accused the interviewer of having ""a lot of negativity"" and ultimately cut that interview short. Ivanka Trump's long history of softening her father From the early days of the campaign, Ivanka Trump has done effectively what few other campaign surrogates have: showing voters the best version of her father. She's stepped, seemingly easily, into the role played by a campaign spouse, one that her stepmother Melania Trump has eschewed.It was Ivanka, not Melania Trump, who who introduced Donald Trump when he announced his long-shot bid for the Republican nomination in June and it was Ivanka who has risen time and again to her father's defense and is a key part of the Republican nominee's inner circle.During an April town hall event with CNN, Ivanka spoke at length about her father's record of championing women in business, saying that Donald Trump ""believes in inspiring women, empowering women.""In July, she told the Sunday Times of London that her father is a feminist and a ""big reason I am the woman I am today.""Perhaps Ivanka's most prominent role as her father's most redeeming surrogate was during the Republican convention when she introduced her father to would-be supporters as a fighter who will fight for you.""The speech was a departure from much of the harsh rhetoric that filled the preceding days of the convention. Gone were the chants of ""lock her up"" aimed at Trump's rival. Instead, Ivanka Trump channeled her own growing celebrity and sought to bridge the divide with the female voters her father has struggled with during the entirety of his campaign.""At our family's company, there are more female than male executives,"" Ivanka Trump said to applause. ""Women are paid equally for the work that we do, and when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported -- not shut out.""She is also the face of the Trump campaign's most overt effort to woo women voters, speaking directly into the camera in a television ad titled ""Motherhood.""""The most important job any woman could have is being a mother -- and it shouldn't mean taking a paycut,"" Trump said in the ad which includes pictures of Ivanka Trump with her children and video of Trump playing with his grandchildren.It includes details of the affordable childcare policies Donald Trump rolled out with Ivanka by his side and was a blatant attempt to increase Trump's standing with women. Donald Trump has repeatedly commented on his daughter's appearanceDonald Trump's comments about the appearances and sexuality of women also extend to comments about his daughter.In 2006, he suggested that if she weren't his daughter, ""perhaps I'd be dating her."" And a review of hours of audio from the Republican nominee's appearances on the Howard Stern show spanning nearly two decades, found Trump commenting on Ivanka Trump's body more than once, including an exchange about her breast size.In an October 2006 interview, Stern asked Trump whether his daughter had ever gotten breast implants and Trump responded by saying that his daughter had ""always been very voluptuous"" and was an ""amazing beauty.""In an earlier interview, recorded in September 2004, Stern asked Donald Trump whether he could refer to Ivanka Trump as a ""piece of ass.""Donald Trump, responded affirmatively, saying that he could.Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper why these comments were acceptable. Conway responded that Ivanka Trump and her father have a ""beautiful relationship.""""I don't know if you're trying to drive a wedge between those two, but good luck,"" Conway told Cooper. ""They're very close and have a beautiful relationship.""Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, did not respond to requests for comment and has not responded to her father's claims or addressed the 2005 video.The comments put Ivanka Trump in an increasingly difficult position. As a mother and an executive who has built her brand on empowering women, will she defend the comments her father has made about her and the behavior he has purportedly displayed toward other women?She has, at least once.After allegations that her father had groped a woman in a business meeting surfaced in May, Ivanka Trump told CBS This Morning that her father was ""not a groper"" and denied that he frequently commented on women's bodies and appearances.""That's not who he is. I've known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women,"" she told CBS.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified the person interviewing Ivanka Trump in Malvern."
