Trump on Russian President Vladimir Putin: ""If he says great things about me, I'm gonna say great things about him. I've already said he is really very much of a leader. I mean, the man has very strong control over a country. And that's a very different system and I don't happen to like the system. But certainly in that system he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.""ISIS2. Trump on his plans for ISIS: ""And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals' plan or the generals' plan ... if I like their plan, Matt, I'm not gonna call you up and say, 'Matt, we have a great plan.' This is what Obama does.""Emails3. Clinton trying to explain away her email troubles: ""And for all the viewers watching here tonight, I have a lot of experience dealing with classified materials, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, going into the four years as secretary of State. Classified material has a header which says, 'Top Secret,' 'Secret,' 'Confidential.' Nothing -- and I will repeat this and this is verified in the reports by the Department of Justice -- none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.""Military sexual assault4. Trump defends an old tweet on military sexual assault:Clinton on Iraq War vote5. Clinton on her vote: ""Look, I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake, and I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake. I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after action reports are supposed to do. And so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again.

He remained free pending appeal, and this spring, the Supreme Court unanimously threw out his conviction, although the justices left open the possibility of a retrial.In a motion filed with a federal appeals court, US Attorney Dana Boente said the United States planned to file a ""motion to dismiss the indictment.""""Today is a great day in which my family and I rejoice. More than 3 1/2 years after learning of an investigation, the final day of vindication has arrived,"" McDonnell said in a statement. ""Throughout this ordeal I have strongly proclaimed my innocence. I would never do, nor consider doing, anything that would violate the trust of the citizens of Virginia I served during 22 years in state elected office. These wrongful convictions were based on a false narrative and incorrect law.""McDonnell's case centered around the question of what constitutes the scope of an ""official action"" under federal corruption law. He received gifts, money and loans from Jonnie R. Williams, the CEO of a Virginia-based company, the government said, in exchange for official acts seen as favorable to Williams and his business.But his lawyers responded that his actions were limited to routine political courtesies and he never put his thumb on the scale by exercising government power on William's behalf.Writing for the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts set a clear definition of the term ""official action"" and how it can be used in corruption convictions.""In sum, an 'official act' is a decision or action on a 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,"" Roberts wrote. ""Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so) -- without more -- does not fit that definition of an official act.""Roberts also said that political corruption can still be prosecuted by the government, and noted that McDonnell's actions were ""distasteful.""""There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that,"" Roberts wrote. ""But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the government's boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute. A more limited interpretation of the term 'official act' leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption, while comporting with the text of the statute and the precedent of this court.""Impact on future corruption casesWhite collar criminal defense attorney Barry Pollack was not surprised that the government dropped the case after the Supreme Court ruling. ""I think the Supreme Court case made it pretty clear that the government would have an uphill battle if it attempted to retry the case,"" he said. He noted that at trial, the government's case was that McDonnell set up the meetings, but that he left it to the appropriate government decision makers to decide whether or not to provide Williams with the business opportunities he was seeking.""Now the government is going to be held to a higher standard in pursuing public corruption charges against public officials,"" Pollack said.Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the decision allows corrupt conduct go unpunished. ""Even with the court's unfortunate decision, the Justice Department had a chance to show it was not deterred and to build on aggressive precedent set by the conviction of then-Congressman (Chaka) Fattah and other recent prosecutions,"" Bookbinder said. ""Instead, the department sent a clear signal that they it would not aggressively enforce corruption laws to hold public officials accountable when they abuse their office. It is our hope that they do not pass on prosecution next time, because rest assured, there will be a next time.""Next for McDonnellsMcDonnell said he didn't know what would be next for him.""I have begun to consider how I might repurpose my life for further service to my fellow man outside of elected office. Polls and politics no longer seem that important. People and policies are,"" he said. ""I know not fully what the future holds as I enter the 'fourth quarter' of life. I do know it will be a wonderful adventure, beginning with 4 blessed new grandchildren, a new small business, countless new friends, and multiple new ministry opportunities.""Lawyers for Maureen McDonnell said they were pleased with Thursday's action.""You can imagine, Maureen couldn't be more thrilled or thankful that this is all over and she is very happy that the DOJ took such a careful look at the case and came to a decision that we of course agree with,"" said William Burck from Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.

In a four-paragraph email response from Powell, he told Clinton he didn't use a BlackBerry, but detailed how he got around having his communications with both employees and people outside the State Department becoming part of the agency's official record.""What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient). So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels,"" Powell wrote.Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state has loomed over her presidential campaign and spurred intense criticism from Republicans. The email exchange between Clinton and Powell was released Wednesday by the State Department after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee pressed for it. They complained the full exchange was not part of earlier email document releases from the department that Republicans in Congress have asked for as part of their probe into Clinton's email use. First on CNN: FBI director defends Clinton email probe, document releasesIn a statement, Powell said he ""was not trying to influence her but just to explain what I had done eight years earlier to begin the transformation of the State Department's information system."" ""I have been interviewed by the State Department IG and the FBI about my actions and decisions. I stand by my decisions and I am fully accountable,"" Powell said. He has repeatedly pushed back against reports suggesting that he might have given Hillary Clinton the idea to use a private email account as Secretary of State, telling media outlets last month that ""her people are trying to pin it on me.""In February, the State Department inspector general released a memo after its own review of private email practices by others, reporting it found two emails on Powell's private email and some on accounts of aides to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that included classified information.Powell also told Clinton in 2009 ""the real issue had to do with PDAs, as we called them a few years ago before Blackberry became a noun.""  He said officials at the State Department refused to allow them in secure spaces and when he resisted ""they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc.""  Powell says officials had concerns about mobile phones, too, but tells Clinton: ""I had numerous meetings with them.""  He also revealed that he had ""an ancient version of a PDA and used it.""The FBI's report on Clinton's email use includes information about Powell's warning to Clinton that using a government email meant her messages would become public.In the email exchange Powell wrote ""there is a real danger."" ""Government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law,"" he said.  He added: ""Be very careful ... I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.""Powell's spokesperson recently told CNN that he wrote a memo about his own use of an AOL account to Clinton and said the account was for ""unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department.""  Only one new Benghazi email in 15,000 docs recovered from Clinton server, State Department saysStressing the major differences in technology between his tenure at the department and Clinton's, the spokesperson said: ""At the time there was no equivalent system within the department. He used a secure State computer on his desk to manage classified information."" Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee who released the full email exchange, said that it ""shows that Secretary Powell advised Secretary Clinton with a detailed blueprint on how to skirt security rules and bypass requirements to preserve federal records, although Secretary Clinton has made clear that she did not rely on this advice.""The Maryland Democrat also argued Republicans who have been pressing for documents from the State Department had a double standard for their concern about use of private email, saying if they were worried about the issue, ""they would be attempting to recover Secretary Powell's emails from AOL, but they have taken no steps to do so despite the fact that this period-including the run-up to the Iraq War-was critical to our nation's history.""In addition to advising Clinton about government communications, Powell gave his assessment about the security protocols, not just for email, but for movements. He bristled at the restrictions they wanted on him, and recommendations that he be accompanied by agents.""You will find DS driving you crazy if you let them,"" he said. And in what may be a reference to Madeleine Albright, he says: ""They had Maddy tied up in knots.""  Powell said he wouldn't let security agents live inside his house so they had to find a garage nearby. He also revealed ""on weekends, I drove my beloved cars around town without them following me,"" which he said they ""hated"" and made him sign a letter ""relieving them of responsibility if I got whacked while doing that. I gladly did."" He closed his email, saying about the department officials ""their job is to keep you hermetically sealed up. Love, Colin."""	Hillary Clinton's emails with Colin Powell released
4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/obama-asia-trip/index.html	"The whiplash of trading Hangzhou's Gucci-filled malls and glass skyscrapers for the colonial facades of this sleepy riverside capital was yet another reminder of the complexities of Asia that Obama hands off to his successor in January.At the end of a six-day trip that saw a dispute over airplane stairs escalate into a foreign policy metaphor and an expletive-laden rant from a US ally prompt questions about a key regional partner, the challenge of asserting American influence in Asia seemed in sharper relief than ever. The pervasive influence of China was nearly omnipresent during Obama's final Asia tour, from the dust-up over stairs for Air Force One the minute he landed in Hangzhou to the speculation that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's demeaning comments about him reflected a drift toward Beijing. Even as Obama detailed his own commitment to the region -- which he's visited more regularly as president than his predecessors, and where he's vowed to return as an ex-president -- representatives of Beijing were also in town trying to nurture ties and pull Vientiane into its orbit.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was also visiting, heralding billions of investment dollars in Laos as the country works to transform itself from a subsistence agrarian economy. Among the offerings: an $868 million hydropower project on the Nam Ngiep River, a $480 million rail line connecting Yunnan province in China to the Lao capital, and a new special economic zone on the outskirts of Vientiane costing $1.6 billion.The sums not only dwarfed the US pledge, but they reflected a look toward the future of the country and not its painful past.Part of the US commitment has been a dutiful recognition of past US wrongs, including acknowledging this week the devastating toll of secret US bombardments during the Vietnam War. On Tuesday, Obama announced a new $90 million US effort to clear unexploded bombs in Laos that are ruining lives and stalling economic development.Personal ties have largely become the driver for Obama when he's explaining the importance of his Asia policy, never more so than in Laos this week.Touring the mountain outpost Luang Prabang, Obama fell easily into conversation with Buddhist monks and coconut saleswomen.""This part of the world means a lot to me because I lived in Indonesia as a boy,"" he later told 200 young leaders from six different Southeast Asian nations gathered for a town hall. ""As I drive around here, it's very familiar to me. It reminds me of my childhood. And my commitment to deepening America's ties to Southeast Asia is very real.""While that personal outreach has boosted his popularity in the places he's visited, it also points to a potential weakness in his pivot strategy: What happens after he leaves.During Obama's concluding news conference on Thursday -- his final public remarks in Asia as president -- he insisted his long-running pivot strategy was working. But he also acknowledged that the next occupant of the White House may abandon it.""If you look at the remarks of leaders, if you look at the remarks of ordinary people ... the concern that I've heard is not that what we've done hasn't been important and successful,"" Obama said. ""The concern that I've heard is: Will it continue?""Implied was that few in Asia can imagine either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton maintaining the same level of commitment to the region as Obama.Neither candidate supports the linchpin trade agreement -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- that was meant to be the crowning achievement of the pivot, or ""rebalance,"" policy. And while Clinton has praised the President's approach toward the continent, there's little expectation she would instill the same type of personal stake that Obama has put at the center of his approach here.But he offered few specific assurances that his successor would approach the continent with nearly as much gusto as he's attempted during his tenure. ""My hope and expectation is, is that my successor will, in fact, sustain this kind of engagement,"" Obama said. ""Because there is a lot happening here.""And he shrugged off suggestions his trip -- and by extension, his entire Asia pivot -- was somehow marred by the week's hiccups. ""If this theory about my reception and my rebalance policy is based on me going down the short stairs in China, yes, I think that is overblown,"" Obama said. ""I think that any reasonable person, certainly any person in the region, would be puzzled as to how this became somehow indicative of the work that we've done here."""	China loomed over Obama's final pivot to Asia
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/trump-clinton-policy-free-2016-election/index.html	"The final stretch of the campaign is opening this week with a torrent of insults and name calling that make clear the election will be more about the candidates and their personalities than their policy prescriptions for the nation's ills.The rhetorical warfare was on display Wednesday when Trump dismissed Clinton's foreign policy record by accusing her of being ""trigger happy and very unstable."" Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, shot back at Trump in a statement that likened him to a ""schoolyard bully who can't rely on facts or issues.""Presidential campaigns are always rough and tumble affairs but the 2016 race is emerging as a particularly personal -- and nasty -- race. Candidates in previous cycles traded plenty of tough barbs but also sparred over policy surrounding health care, financial regulation and taxes. But in a year in which both candidates are deeply unpopular, strategists say their only choice is to make the election a referendum on the other person.Poll: Most oppose Trump's wall""Hillary with her serial dishonesty and corruption allegations, and Trump, just with everything -- people are still trying to make that determination about both of them: Are either of these people qualified to do the job?"" said Republican pollster Dan Judy of North Star Opinion Research. ""It's harder to get to the policy stuff when you're hung up on that."" Policy successPresidential hopefuls have found success before by casting the entire election as a make-or-break decision on one important issue. Bill Clinton's middle-class economic appeal defined the 1992 election, and Barack Obama's vision of 2008 as a fundamental transformation of the economy helped him defeat John McCain. In 2016, though, ""we're not finding that there are policy issues that are being framed. What they're framing is the other candidates,"" said Richard Perloff, a political science and communications professor at Cleveland State University. ""Trump is going to make it about Clinton because he lives in a world of verbal aggression. Much of what he's doing is framing it as 'Crooked Hillary,' untrustworthy Hillary -- and she's doing the same to him,"" he said. ""What we're seeing is framing of image, framing of personality.""Jeff Weaver, the campaign manager for Bernie Sanders, bemoaned the tenor of the Clinton-Trump race in an interview on CNN's ""New Day"" Wednesday. ""Unfortunately, this campaign has devolved into a who lies more or who is the worst candidate,"" he said. ""I think we have to get back to a discussion of who is the better candidate?"" The candidates delved into some national security policy issues Wednesday night at the ""Commander in Chief"" forum hosted by NBC NEWS. The event exposed the gulf between Trump and Clinton on issues such as combating ISIS and managing the military.Clinton's backers say the candidate herself craves a policy-focused race -- noting that she has rolled out detailed proposals on subjects ranging from national security and ISIS to mental health. Pence says he believes Obama born in USThey say that in attacking Trump, she is simply playing the hand she was dealt. Many point fingers at the news media, saying Trump's personal attacks and outbursts have received too much attention. ""The fact is that there is so much titillation from and about Donald Trump that there's very little bandwidth left for much of a focus on policy,"" said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin of Hart Research Associates, who works with the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA. ""You are much more likely to get covered when you call the other person a name than when you make a substantive speech about public policy."" The focus on Trump's foibles has at times helped Clinton. In the weeks after Trump's assertion that an Indiana-born judge couldn't rule fairly because of his Mexican heritage and his fight with the Gold Star Khan family, Trump tumbled in the polls as Clinton built a double-digit lead. But that lead has narrowed amid a steady string of reports about the Clinton Foundation's ties to the State Department, and Clinton's use of a private email server -- all amplified by Republicans. Her allies say the campaign about personality, not policy, might help her defeat Trump -- but at a long-term cost. ""This has been harmful to Hillary Clinton in that I am absolutely certain that people would feel more positively toward her if they were able to hear more clearly what it is she wants to do to make their lives better,"" Garin said. ""But given the tone and tenor of the campaign, it has been very hard to communicate much of that,"" he said, pointing to news media. ""And, look, the reality is that unlike any other election, at the presidential level, what people hear and see on the news is at least as important a driver -- and probably a more important driver -- of their attitudes than what they see on advertisements.""Not shying awayOf course, Clinton isn't shying away from the fight. With less than three weeks before the first presidential debate, she has shown an eagerness in recent days to attack Trump more directly. Speaking with reporters aboard her campaign plane Tuesday, she blasted Trump's refusal to release his tax returns. ""He clearly has something to hide. We don't know exactly what it is but we are getting better guesses about what it probably is,"" she said. At a rally in North Carolina on Tuesday night, Trump -- who in the GOP primary attached nicknames like ""Lyin' Ted"" and ""Little Marco"" to his opponents -- claimed that Clinton ""never"" talks about policy. ""All she does is a total hit job on Donald Trump,"" he said. He mocked Clinton's interview with the FBI over her private email server, and said her destruction of old phones was an effort to cover up ""very, very -- and I mean very -- shady activity."" For Bill Clinton, hitting Trump's foundation is 'personal'Trump, though, is particularly difficult to engage on policy. He's abandoned positions he's taken in previous years -- asserting now that he's always opposed military interventions that he's publicly supported in the past -- and has reversed himself within days on issues like the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Trump called Wednesday for a major increase in military funding, but didn't offer any details on how he'd fund that increase. ""I feel like people are making this more complicated than it is. It's not that he's changing positions -- it's that he doesn't have positions,"" said Judy, the GOP pollster. He said Americans consistently assert that they want to hear more about issues and policy. But for Clinton and Trump, there's a different standard. ""Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are two of the most well-known, well-defined candidates for president, for better or for worse, we've had running at the same time for maybe 100 years,"" Judy said. ""People know both of these candidates really well, and have sort of set opinions on them that don't really fluctuate with any particular policy or ideology."""

""If (Putin) says great things about me, I'm gonna say great things about him.

It is like he is living in his own celebrity reality TV program,"" Clinton said at a campaign rally in Charlotte Thursday afternoon. ""You know what Donald, this is real reality, this is real people, these are real decisions that have to be made for our country.""Clinton had begun the day on the offensive, by convening a press conference with reporters on the tarmac of Westchester County Airport before she and her traveling press corps were set to take off to North Carolina. ""Last night was yet another test and Donald Trump failed yet again. We saw more evidence that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be commander in chief. He trash talked American generals,"" she said.At the NBC ""Commander in Chief"" forum Wednesday night, Clinton and Trump were separately questioned by anchor Matt Lauer on various national security and foreign policy topics.Among Trump's comments was his extensive praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin -- Trump even went as far as to say he was a better leader than Barack Obama.""He's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader,"" Trump said. ""If (Putin) says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him. I've already said he is really very much of a leader.""Clinton characterized these comments as ""unpatriotic"" Thursday morning. ""Bizarrely once again, he praised Russia's strongman, Vladimir Putin, even taking the astonishing step of suggesting that he preferred the Russian president to our American president. Now, that is not just unpatriotic and insulting, to the people of our country as well as to our commander in chief, it is scary,"" Clinton said. ""Because it suggests he will let Putin do whatever Putin wants to do and then make excuses for him.""Trump responded Thursday during an event in Cleveland.""I just watched her on the tarmac,"" he said. ""She tried to make up for her horrible performance last night so she went on the tarmac and told more lies.""During the forum, Trump also insisted on repeating a claim that has been previously debunked -- that the businessman was ""totally against the war in Iraq."" There is no evidence to date that shows Trump came out against the Iraq War early on, and in fact, he initially said he supported the conflict.Another moment that stirred up controversy was when Trump stood by a 2013 tweet in which he seemed to suggest military sexual assault is simply expected if women choose to serve.""What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?"" Trump tweeted. Clinton, meanwhile, demonstrated her fluency on foreign policy at Wednesday night's forum, but still found herself defending her record. She said her vote to authorize the Iraq War was a ""mistake,"" then vowed: ""We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again and we are not putting ground troops into Syria.""Clinton elaborated on those remarks at the Thursday press conference, saying putting a significant number of US troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria would ""fulfill one of (ISIS') dearest wishes which is to drag the United States back into a ground war in that region.""And asked Thursday whether she believes she is being held to a different standard than Trump, Clinton -- who on Wednesday asked that she be ""judged on the totality of my record"" -- responded that it was a ""fair question.""""I have been somewhat heartened by the number of articles recently pointed out the quite disparate treatment of Trump and his campaign compared to ours,"" Clinton said. ""I don't understand the reasons for it. I find it frustrating, but it is just part of the landscape that we live in and we just keep forging ahead."""	Clinton on Trump: 'Everything is a game' to him

The gulf between them was especially apparent when the discussion centered on Russia and combating ISIS.Clinton has repeatedly slammed Trump on the campaign trail for his embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But at the ""Commander in Chief"" forum hosted by NBC News, Trump once again praised the Russian leader in comparison to President Barack Obama. ""Certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader,"" Trump said. ""If (Putin) says great things about me, I'm gonna say great things about him.

But he also said he would confer with US generals on his ISIS plan, although he criticized Pentagon brass, alleging generals have not stood up to Obama.""I think under the leadership Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble.""With less than three weeks until the debate, Trump seemed at ease with the freewheeling style he has often demonstrated on the campaign trail. He caused a stir by defending a tweet that implied military sexual assault is a result of women serving in the military. Meanwhile, Clinton pivoted from questions about her email server to focus on her vision of a robust national security policy.Asked about what critics call her hawkish foreign policy record, Clinton said: ""We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again and we are not putting ground troops into Syria.""She added: ""I view force as a last resort, not a first choice. I will do everything in my power to make sure our men and women in the military are fully prepared for any challenge they may have to face on our behalf, but I will also be as careful as I can in making the most significant decisions any president and commander and chief can make about sending our men and women into harm's way.""Clinton, who said defeating ISIS would be her ""highest terrorism goal,""  spoke of using air power and regional alliances to defeat the group.""We've gotta do it with much more support from the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against ISIS,"" she said. ""We have to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military. They've taken back Ramadi, Fallujah. They've gotta hold them.

He praised the military campaign in Iraq in the first months after the invasion.Trump has repeatedly attacked Clinton over her support for the war, saying it showed poor judgment. Clinton, when asked about her vote to authorize the war, said: ""I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake,"" she said. ""I am asking to be judged on the totality of my record.""Undocumented soldiersTrump said at the forum that he'd be open to ""working"" on a way for undocumented immigrants to serve in the US military -- a sharp contrast to his tone during a speech in Arizona last week where he said he would focus on deporting undocumented immigrants from the country.""I think that when you serve in the armed forces, that's a very special situation,"" Trump said. ""I could see myself working that. Absolutely. Now we have to vet very carefully, everybody would agree with that.""Veterans' healthA woman in the audience asked Trump during the forum what he'll do to stop the ""20 veterans"" from committing suicide daily.""Actually it's 22. It's almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in this country,"" he said. ""We're going to speed up the process, we're going to create a great mental health division. They need help.""Clinton, also asked about the issue, pointed to her recently rolled out mental health policy agenda.""I have a whole section devoted to veterans' mental health. And we've gotta remove the stigma. We've gotta help people currently serving not to feel that if they report their sense of unease, their depression, that somehow it's gonna be a mark against them. We have to do more about addiction. Not only drugs but also alcohol,"" Clinton said.The disturbing statistic behind the '22 Pushup Challenge'Clinton on emailsClinton, meanwhile, repeated ""it was a mistake"" to have used a personal email account and server while leading the department, and that she would ""certainly not do it again.""""I make no excuses for it,"" she said.But Clinton defended certain emails, including those that contained information about the country's covert drone program, as not revealing classified information.""There were no discussions about any of the covert actions in process being determined about whether or not to go forward,"" she said. ""But every part of our government had to deal with questions, secretary of state's office was first and foremost, so there are ways of talking about the drone program."""

Olsen noted a number of public sources, including in August when one ISIS spokesman wrote, ""I ask Allah to deliver America to Trump.""Clinton hit Trump on Thursday as ""someone who has insulted Muslims, insulted a gold star family ... someone who has said he doesn't want to let Muslims from around the world come to our country.""Because of that, Clinton said, his presidency would be ""a gift to ISIS.""The Clinton-Trump back and forth come as the 2016 presidential campaign focuses particularly on national security this week. Clinton has spent recent days knocking Trump's ability to serve as commander in chief, and the two candidates headlined an NBC veterans forum Wednesday.Clinton's campaign is hoping to disqualify Trump with some military voters, aiming to cut into Trump's support among lean-Republican voters who prioritize national security.RELATED: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Trump"	Hillary Clinton: ISIS is 'rooting for Donald Trump'
