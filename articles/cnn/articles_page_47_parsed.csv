Her odds stood at 95% on October 20, but on October 26 dipped to 90%, and then continued to decline daily until October 31. On Halloween they reached 78%, right after FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress saying the FBI had discovered emails related to the closed investigation of her private email server and wanted to review them. The email controversy has plagued Clinton's bid for the White House since she announced her run in April 2015.On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers the agency hasn't changed its opinion that Hillary Clinton should not face criminal charges after a review of new emails.Now, Clinton's odds stand at 91% while Trump's fall to 9%, a steep decline from the 23% he had one week ago on October 31.CNN's Political Prediction Market is an online game administered by the company Pivit, which functions like an online market and allows Internet users to predict the outcome of the 2016 election. It is not to be confused with polls from real voters.With one day to go before Election Day, CNN's Poll of Polls shows Clinton leading Trump by a narrow 4-point margin: 46% to 42%.View latest election exit polls 	Clinton's chances for the White House on the rise	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/presidential-polls-new-hampshire-pennsylvania/index.html	"New HampshireThe CNN polling average in New Hampshire now has Clinton with a 3-point edge (44% to 41%) over Republican opponent Donald Trump following a new poll's released Sunday showing the Democratic presidential nominee with an 11-point lead. The poll from the University of New Hampshire, released Monday, found Clinton ahead of Trump 49% to 38%. Libertarian Gary Johnson registered 6% in the poll, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein drew 1%. Four percent said they remain undecided.Other polls have shown a far closer race in New Hampshire -- a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of the state last week found the race tied at 42%.  The UNH poll found that 85% of likely voters in New Hampshire have their minds made up with hours to go before the presidential election, with Clinton drawing more support from Democrats (95%) than Trump does from Republicans (86%). Clinton is also powered by her edge among women and college-educated voters, while men and voters with a high school degree or less form the base of Trump's support. According to the poll, Trump and Clinton ""will end the election cycle historically unpopular among New Hampshire voters,"" with both candidates registering negative favorability ratings: -14% for Clinton, and -36% for Trump. The UNH poll also surveyed New Hampshire voters on down-ballot races, and found Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan leading incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte 48% to 43% in the state's tight senate battle. The UNH poll of New Hampshire was conducted between November 3-6, and surveyed 707 New Hampshire likely voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 percent. Pennsylvania Clinton also has a lead in another crucial battleground state -- Pennsylvania -- according to the CNN polling average updated to show a new survey out over the weekend from Muhlenberg College/Allentown Morning Call.The CNN polling average of Pennsylvania, reflecting five recently released state surveys, has Clinton at 47% to Trump's 42%. The Muhlenberg College poll found Clinton with a 4-point lead over Trump, 44% to 40%, in a four-way race. Johnson measured 7% support and Stein drew 2%. Similar to New Hampshire, Clinton draws support from women, college-educated voters and nonwhite voters while Trump's advantage lies with men, voters with no college education, and white voters. Trump narrowly edges Clinton among the state's independents (41% to 38%). And Trump and Clinton are both widely unpopular among Pennsylvania's likely voters -- each candidate registers an unfavorable rating of about 60%. Clinton is also helped by a huge advantage in the vote-rich southeast portion of the state, which includes Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. The poll found Clinton leading 61% to 29% in that region. Trump, meanwhile, has an edge (47% to 41%) in the southwest corner of the state, which includes Pittsburgh's Allegheny County. Trump leads in the remainder of the state, 52% to 36%, according to the poll.Pennsylvania also has close senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Toomey and Democratic challenger Katie McGinty. The poll found Toomey leading McGinty by one point, 42% to 41%, within the poll's margin of error.The Muhlenberg College/Allentown Morning Call poll was conducted between October 30 and November 4, and surveyed 405 likely Pennsylvania voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 points. North CarolinaCNN's latest Poll of polls in North Carolina shows Clinton with 45% support, while Trump is close behind with 43% support. The CNN polling average includes the five most recent publicly released polling results in the state. The most recent New York Times Upshot and Sienna College poll shows an even tighter race with Clinton and Trump both with 44% support. The New York Times/Sienna College poll also shows a close gubernatorial race in North Carolina. Republican Sen. Richard Burr holds a 1-point lead over Democratic Deborah Ross. While the GOP has carried North Carolina in 10 of the last 12 presidential elections, the state's geography and diversity could change that. Clinton holds a 23-point lead among the state's 18-34 year-old's, and polls with 86% support among the African-American community, while Trump carries just 6% of African-American support. The Poll of Polls includes: The New York Times Upshot/Siena College Poll conducted November 4-6; The Quinnipiac University Poll conducted November 3-6; The Elon University Poll conducted October 23-27; The NBC/WSJ/Marist Poll conducted October 25-26 and the Monmouth University Poll conducted October 20-23. The poll of polls does not have a margin of sampling error.Florida The latest CNN Poll of polls taken in Florida shows a dead locked race with Trump and Clinton both holding 45% support. That average includes a Quinnipiac University poll taken November 3-6 shows Clinton with a 1-point lead in the Sunshine state. The poll also finds incumbent Republican Sen. Marco Rubio with a 7-point lead over Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy. The Quinnipiac University Poll conducted November 3-6; The CNN/ORC Poll conducted October 27-November 1; The New York Times Upshot/Siena College Poll conducted October 25-27; the NBC/WSJ/Marist Poll conducted October 25-26 and the Bloomberg Politics/Selzer & Co. Poll conducted October 21-24. The poll of polls does not have a margin of sampling error."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/fbi-review-hillary-clinton-emails-comey/index.html	"Key to the effort was software that was refined from its previous uses for the review of emails found on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. ""A lot of this was a matter of technology,"" one official said. ""Without the technology, this would have taken a lot longer.""The news that the FBI was confident in its July conclusion that there was not enough evidence to support criminal charges related to the server came in a letter from Comey to Congress on Sunday. That was the same way that Comey had initially thrown the presidential race into flux late last month, when he sent a letter to Congress saying newly discovered emails on Weiner's device, which came up in a separate investigation, were being looked at in relation to the Clinton investigation.Now, the probe is considered over with regard to Clinton. FBI clears Clinton, againBut with not all the emails deleted by her attorneys for being personal in nature recovered and not all the devices used to transmit the emails in the FBI's possession, it is possible something else could turn up that would require more review. There were some classified emails found in the Abedin review, but the officials stressed the issue is not the classified information so much as proving intent. The sources would not specify how many of the classified emails were new or duplicates of ones already reviewed. Nor would officials say how many there were and what levels of classification they were at.Another source told CNN that none of the newly recovered emails were referred to other intelligence agencies to conduct a classification review. That suggests that none of them were considered a ""close call"" in terms of classification, the source said.  ""Keep in mind we are focused on intent,"" one official said. ""We know there are classified materials, but that doesn't change the conclusion reached back in July.""The FBI team that conducted the email probe was reconstituted to handle the review of the new emails, which included some they hadn't previously seen in the yearlong probe of the server. As for others who were part of the probe, including Abedin, the FBI is still working on some remaining aspects of the review, including determining how the emails ended up on the laptop in the first place. Abedin's attorneys have said she doesn't know why these emails were there because this wasn't a computer she used.The expectation remains that investigators will have to talk to Abedin again. It is not uncommon to come across new evidence after concluding a probe -- which is what happened in October. Normally, investigators take a look to see if anything changes in their conclusions and it's not a controversial issue. This case isn't a normal case, given the election and the stakes. Comey sent Sunday's letter to Congress as soon as possible, a senior law enforcement official said. The bureau chief was ""very careful"" about how the letter was crafted given the sensitivities.Attorney General Loretta Lynch was informed ahead of time that the FBI director was sending the updated letter to Congress, a Justice official told CNN on Sunday.Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates disagreed with Comey's earlier decision to notify Congress last month. The attorney general backed Comey's move Sunday. ""Everyone is on the same page,"" the senior law enforcement official said.Since there is no change to the original findings, the Justice Department has no need to weigh in further, the official added.""The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously,"" the Justice Department said in a brief statement released Sunday afternoon."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/barack-obama-frantic-final-campaign/index.html	"Standing at his last rally as a political headliner during the last day of his last campaign, Obama recalled the first time he heard the rallying cry ""Fired Up, Ready to Go"" from a South Carolina supporter named Edith Childs. Obama paused amid his urgent advocacy for Hillary Clinton to reflect upon his own political trajectory, which after more than a decade is coming to a close. ""When I ran for the presidency in '08, the truth is not many people gave me a chance,"" Obama said, resting his elbows on the podium that now bears a presidential seal. ""I was a skinny guy with a funny name. When I look at pictures of me speaking, I look really young.""It wasn't the first time Obama recalled the Edith Childs story; his eyes welled up with tears in Iowa during the final stop of his 2012 reelection bid when he thought back to his earlier days, when he rolled his own bags through the airport and drove an hour and half through pouring rain to meet a handful of potential supporters. In 12 years he's gone from a US Senate candidate, riding shotgun in an aide's sedan through small-town Illinois, to a president landing on Air Force One in three states in one day to campaign for someone else.Unprecedented in its rigor, Obama's final week on the trail is a final act for a President whose vision of hope and change has always been best administered in front of rapt and rowdy crowds gathered in America's electoral battlegrounds.""I'm feeling a little sentimental,"" Obama admitted during a rally in Michigan Monday -- the first stop on a frantic one day, three-state swing. ""This will probably be my last day of campaigning for a while.""With his sleeves rolled up, his jacket removed, and his square Oliver Peoples sunglasses in place, Obama has jogged on and off Air Force One 17 times since Tuesday, usually destined for a college campus where crowds can easily be mustered.His itinerary (Ohio, North Carolina, Florida -- then North Carolina and Florida again) has effectively become a map of states Democrats think they can win, but aren't convinced they will. He's been dispatched last-minute to areas where Clinton's edge seems to be slipping. His stop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Monday was announced only 36 hours ahead of time. A tightening race in New Hampshire prompted the Clinton campaign to schedule an election-eve appearance there in an attempt to shore up support among white, college-educated voters. He'll close the day with Michelle Obama and the Clintons in Philadelphia.Despite the tightening contest, aides say Obama has maintained his regular calm. He's expressed some anxiety about lagging early vote numbers for African-Americans, but has been buoyed by surging statistics for Latinos. Any worry about a fresh probe into Hillary Clinton's emails was muted, even before FBI Director James Comey said Sunday the bureau's new look yielded nothing.Some things have remained consistent.  Obama has always most effectively argued his case for a progressive agenda when the election stakes are high and the odds not entirely in his favor. In 2008, he was the underdog who drew massive crowds to hear his vision of a different kind of Washington. In 2012, he was an incumbent who stumbled in his first re-election debate, only to emerge more determined to argue for another four years. And this year, he's making the case for a candidate far less popular than himself.Frenetic schedule, punctuated by radio callsOn most days last week Obama woke up at the White House with his schedule virtually cleared. Leaving around midday and returning late in the evening, he spent his downtime tossing a baseball around the Rose Garden with aides and tweaking his stump speech in the Oval Office. To unwind on his one night away from home, Obama stayed up late in his hotel room watching his hometown Chicago Cubs win the World Series, tweeting his congrats at 2 a.m.In seemingly every spare moment, he's dialed African-American radio hosts across the swing states, chatting loosely backstage at his rallies and aboard Air Force One about his favorite hip-hop artists (Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper) and his paternal dating anxieties (not high, his kids have Secret Service protection) as a prelude for urgent entreaties to vote.""Do it for me,"" he told listeners to Artie Goins' drive-time show in Charlotte. ""If you meet somebody who says I'm thinking about not voting, you can go ahead and say, the President asked me personally."" For Obama, the stakes in this election are uniquely personal. His own speeches have cast the vote as a referendum on his record, and a Clinton victory could cement his progressive mantra of change. A loss, however, has become a nightmare scenario. Obama's vision of the US is so at odds with Donald Trump's he told a crowd of 16,000 college students in Chapel Hill the ""fate of the world is teetering.""Unless Michelle Obama decides to grant the Democratic Party its most elusive wish and run for office -- something both she and her husband say isn't happening -- President Obama won't appear again at the type of loud and loose arena rallies that fueled his rise and could help elect a Democratic successor.Taunting TrumpIn 2012, during the final days of his reelection bid, Obama grew nostalgic about running his final campaign. There was little expectation then that his activity now would so closely resemble an urgent referendum for his own vision of America. For Obama, it's not an entirely unwelcome development. ""The President is having a heck of a good time being on the campaign trail,"" his press secretary Josh Earnest said as Obama jetted toward Columbus on Tuesday. ""The President is not just having a good time, he looks like he's having a good time.""Hopscotching from swing state to swing state, Obama has skipped the retail campaigning that he delighted in during his own contests. Instead of finding the local barbecue joint or pizza parlor to glad hand and pick up a meal for the ride home, he sped from airport tarmacs directly to packed arenas and back, stopping only briefly to address overflow rooms packed with supporters who couldn't fit into his main venue.His only detour from the campaign trail: a stop Wednesday night at a house across the street from Gloria Estefan's sprawling waterfront mansion in Miami to plot his post-White House plans. Looking out over Biscayne Bay, discussing his presidential library and foundation amid South Florida's upper echelons, the Iowa State Fair never seemed so distant.""He's mindful of the fact that over the course of this week, this will essentially be the last big campaign swing of his political career,"" said Earnest, who has worked for Obama since 2007 before the primaries.Deeply conscious of his impending exit, Obama has sought to extend the moment. His stump speech has grown longer, expanding to include new hits on Trump and new barbs against Republicans he says fueled the billionaire's ascent. Even as his supporters begin to stream out early -- ""it's too hot,"" said one in Fayetteville on Thursday -- Obama keeps going, riling himself and the crowd over the dire state of the political discourse.""Anybody who is upset about a 'Saturday Night Live' skit, you don't want in charge of nuclear weapons,"" Obama taunted in Miami on Thursday, only to pierce the anger with yet another exasperated ""C'mon man!""He's used the sarcastic meme meant to jokingly blame the President for any minor inconvenience to sternly demand credit for what Republicans claimed he could never achieve. Gas, he said in Charlotte Friday, ""is two bucks a gallon.""""Thanks, Obama,"" he pronounced, his face glowering as he paused to turn and accept applause and cheers from the crowd.Re-creating the Obama coalitionStatistics showing key facets of his coalition turning out in smaller early vote numbers this year have driven the President to almost fatalistic language. His pitch for Clinton has evolved into a pleading call for participation by the groups whose support for him is strongest.He took the get-out-the-vote mandate literally, listing off the closest precinct location down its street address during a rally in Jacksonville. Even his recitation of ""10599 Deerwood Park Boulevard"" was accompanied by cheers, applause, and a pep band.That type of booming adoration won't be available for Obama much longer, at least in that way. This week, he's basked in it.Stepping away from his podium in Charlotte Friday, Obama slapped the wooden sides three times -- a new custom as he works to punctuate his political legacy.Listening to an arena explode after his closing cries of ""choose hope,"" the President grew still. And then he pumped his arms. ""Let's go!"" he mouthed to no one in particular. ""Let's go!""""Grab your ticket and your suitcase,"" Bruce Springsteen blared on the sound system for the thousandth time, as Obama dove into another sea of hands to shake."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/wikileaks-dnc-emails-surprise/index.html	"The release of more than 8,000 emails came after WikiLeaks has, on a daily basis over four weeks, released more than 50,000 emails stolen from the private email account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. The emails from the Democratic National Committee were the first to have surfaced in some time, but not the first time stolen DNC email communications had the potential to disrupt the election. In July, just before the Democratic National Convention kicked off, WikiLeaks posted roughly 20,000 emails from the DNC that showed favor for Clinton and distaste for her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, within the DNC, bolstering his supporters' claims the DNC worked against his candidacy.That release resulted in the resignation of party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz just as she was supposed to convene the convention. Like the Podesta emails, the DNC emails released Sunday were presented out of order and not always in context, and included mass mailings as well as internal correspondence.A message left with the DNC seeking comment Sunday night was not immediately returned.The DNC was hacked by two groups in the past year that have been linked by private sector experts and US intelligence to senior levels of the Russian government. The DNC discovered the two groups in their networks this spring.The US government has accused Russia of attempting to interfere in the US election, and has said that the releases on WikiLeaks and other outlets are ""consistent"" with Russian tactics. WikiLeaks and Moscow have denied the claims. The timing of the release, days before the election, could suggest an attempt to deliver a ""November surprise,"" a jolt in the race that could harm Democrats' chances on Tuesday.

But his remarks amounted to his first public response to the decision, and the Republican nominee argued that Clinton is ""guilty"" of federal crimes and said a ""rigged"" system was protecting Clinton.""Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it, and now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8,"" Trump said. ""Unbelievable. Unbelievable how she gets away with it.""Trump also cast doubt on Comey's conclusions, just over a week after the Republican nominee praised the FBI director for announcing the review of the emails, which were discovered as part of the bureau's investigation into Anthony Weiner's sexting.""Right now, she is being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system. You can't review 650,000 emails in eight days. You can't do it folks,"" Trump said, mischaracterizing the number of emails the FBI was reviewing for connections into the private server Clinton used as secretary of state.The FBI took custody of electronic devices containing 650,000 emails in its investigation into Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, but identified a smaller subset of those emails as linked to Clinton.The FBI announced Sunday that its review of those emails had not changed the conclusions it reached over the summer, when Comey recommended no charges be filed after a year-long investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server, even though he called her handling of classified information ""extremely careless.""Still, even as the FBI cleared Clinton for the second time, Trump argued that ""the investigations into her crimes will go on for a long time.""""The rank-and-file special agents at the FBI won't let her get away with her terrible crimes,"" Trump said.Trump served up his first response to the FBI's announcement on Sunday before a packed and rowdy crowd of supporters at an amphitheater in this Detroit suburb, where supporters cheered loudly and belted a raucous cry of ""Lock her up! Lock her up!"" as Trump addressed his rival's email controversy.Trump will return to Michigan -- which hasn't voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988 -- once more before voters head to the polls on Tuesday, holding his final campaign rally in the state on Monday night.Trump is trailing in the polls here, but advisers to the billionaire's campaign have argued that they see an opening to make inroads.Former President Bill Clinton stumped in the state on Sunday as Democrats look to protect the state from falling in the Republican column, and the Democratic nominee herself will also hold a rally in Michigan on Monday."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/democrats-republican-poll-watching-lawsuits/index.html	"The ruling is a win for the Trump campaign and the GOP state parties, which have successfully fended off several pre-emptive lawsuits filed by Democrats across the country that accuse Trump and Republicans of ""conspiring to threaten and intimidate minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election.""Democrats are seeking temporary restraining orders against the Trump campaign and Republicans, as they raise the alarm of possible voter intimidation due to comments from the GOP nominee and others.But while judges have at times been sympathetic, Democrats have now faltered in each case where a hearing has been held: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Arizona. Monday, a federal judge rejected a request for a restraining order in Pennsylvania. A hearing was also held in a separate lawsuit in North Carolina.   Steve Vladeck, a CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas Law School, said the lawsuits show how concerns about what happens at polling places are changing, but that could mean courts aren't ready to jump in quite yet.""Last-minute litigation isn't unusual in election years, but those cases are invariably about the mechanics of voting,"" Vladeck said.""These cases, in contrast, present questions about ballot suppression by private actors that are, at least in contemporary times, novel. So I think some of what we're seeing from the courts is reluctance to move too quickly on these claims, as opposed to more conventional election-related litigation,"" Vladeck added.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who had been under fire for comments last summer criticizing Trump, was the only justice to write separately. She made a point of saying that she voted to deny the Democrats' request because the laws in Ohio already forbid voter intimidation. After her comments last summer, there were some who argued that if the Supreme Court were to ever hear Trump v. Clinton type case after the election  she would have to recuse herself. Although the final vote count may never be known, Ginsburg's statement also highlights that the eight-member court was not deadlocked in a case presented to it a day before the election.By and large the rulings have been victories for the Trump campaign but experts say that the Democrats have managed to bring the issue to the forefront -- and put it before judges in case something changes on Election Day.""Although the Democrats did not prevail in these cases, they did at least force the Republican Party to state, for the record, that they will not engage in voter intimidation,"" said Joshua A. Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky College of Law. ""That by itself is important, as it means that the Republican Party is on record saying they will comply with all state voting laws.""The challenges from the Democrats share much of the same language, charging that Republican state parties, the Trump campaign and Roger Stone, who runs an organization called ""Stop the Steal,"" are in violation of the Voting Rights Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.In Arizona and Nevada, the judges declined to issue injunctions against the Republicans.Unhappy judge in PennsylvaniaOf the various opinions from judges, the one issued Monday by US District Judge Paul S. Diamond, a George W. Bush appointee, was the most critical of the Democrats' argument.Diamond said the Democrats' ""belated, inflammatory allegations appear intended to generate only heat, not light. Presumably, that is why identical  efforts have so far been rejected by the Arizona and Nevada District Courts and the 6th Circuit.""Diamond called the Democrats' late filing a ""mad scramble"" and said their ""heated suggestion"" of voter intimidation ""does not even rise to the level of speculation."" ""Plaintiff has not shown that any Defendant has engaged or will engage in voter intimidation in this District,"" he wrote.Path of the Ohio caseA district court judge in Ohio ruled against the Trump campaign and issued an injunction on Friday. In a broad ruling, Judge James Gwin of the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio mostly sided with Democrats against Trump. He issued an order restricting both campaigns of ""interrogating, admonishing, interfering with, or verbally harassing voters"" and also banned parties from ""gathering or loitering"" at polling places and ""taking photos"" of voters in and around the voting place.""Chad A. Readler, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, filed an emergency motion with the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals lambasting the lower court's order charging that if left to stand it would ""irreparably"" harm the campaign ""as well as any unsuspecting citizen who falls in the district court's cross-hairs.""  ""Intimidating voters is illegal, and the campaign does not remotely condone such conduct,"" Readler wrote.On Sunday, a three-judge panel of appellate judges lifted the order, giving another victory to the Trump campaign. The court said the Democrats had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success. A full panel of judges on the court declined to hear an appeal. Sunday night, Democrats filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court asking justices to vacate the order from the 6th Circuit.""Over the past several months, Donald J. Trump has warned that the 2016 election will be stolen from him unless supporters in Ohio and elsewhere swarm urban communities and ""watch,"" ""(a)nd when (I) say 'watch,' you know what I'm talking about, right?"" Marc Elias, a lawyer for the Democrats argued in briefs with the high court. ""Trump has said ""(t)he only way we can lose . . . and I really mean this . . . is if cheating goes on."" Elias, also argued that a three judge panel of the federal appeals court ruled even before the Democrats were through filing their briefs. ""The 6th Circuit ordered the stay notwithstanding that it did not call for or receive a substantive response brief from Applicant and, by its own admission, had not yet reviewed the critical evidence on which the District Court relied,"" he wrote.

Donald Trump, would my son have a place in your America?"" asked Khan, a Muslim. ""Would Muslims have a place in your America? Would Latinos have a place in your America?

Well, thankfully, Mr. Trump, this isn't your America.""Khan's son, Army Capt.

The race was a defining moment in the campaign.Last month, Khan cut an emotional ad for the Clinton campaign, in which he also asked Trump if his son would ""have a place in your America.""Along with making controversial public comments about a variety of groups during his campaign, Trump also called for a ""Muslim ban"" in December. He has since amended the plan to bar entry for people from countries with heavy terrorist activity, though he has never specified which states he's referring to.Clinton, hours before polls open across the country, described the race in dramatic terms throughout her final event in New Hampshire.""Our core values are being tested in this election,"" Clinton said. ""This election is a moment of reckoning. It is a choice between division and unity. Between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything else at risk.""She added, ""This is one of these elections that really is a crossroads election in our country.""Clinton said that Khan and his family ""exemplify the values that make America great"" and that all Americans would be ""grateful that this remarkable family decided to make American their home.""Clinton's late visit to New Hampshire, while somewhat unexpected by some Democrats in the state, is part of the campaign's strategy to focus on ""gameday voting states"" -- places where most voting happens on Election Day -- now that early voting has stopped.""Don't leave it to chance. Don't leave it to others. Use your voice and your vote,"" Clinton said.In addition to New Hampshire, Clinton will visit Michigan and Pennsylvania on Monday to close out her presidential campaign, two states where almost all voting happens on Tuesday.New Hampshire was not friendly to Clinton during the primary. Bernie Sanders trounced the former secretary of state by 22% in February, a fact Clinton noted on Sunday.""I have to say,"" Clinton said with a smile, ""you all cleaned my clock in this primary."""
