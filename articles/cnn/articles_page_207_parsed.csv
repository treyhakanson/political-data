Mr. Obama called the discussion on Syria ""productive"" about what a real cessation of hostilities would actually look like. ""We have had some productive conversations about what a real cessation of hostilities would look like that would allow us both... to focus our attention on common enemies.""Obama added that currently the gaps have not been closed in negotiations between Russia and the US in a way that they think would ""actually work."" Obama urged Kerry and Lavrov to work together in the coming days to get aid to those in need. Obama and his Russian counterpart Putin met Monday as talks between their governments on ending violence in Syria ended without an agreement.Meanwhile, Putin told reporters that a deal with the US to ""ease tensions in Syria"" may come ""within a few days,"" according to Russia's state news agency TASS.""Against all odds we have a certain rapprochement and understanding of what we might do to ease tensions in Syria and achieve mutually acceptable solutions,"" TASS quoted Putin as saying.As for further details on the agreement, Putin said, ""It is early now to speak of any parameters of our agreements, but I hope very much that the agreements will be reached, and I have the grounds to believe that this may happen within a few days,"" according to TASS.The two leaders conversed on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit here for ninety minutes, a senior US official said, and worked to clarify gaps in negotiations over on the Syrian crisis. The pair also discussed Ukraine and Russia's cyber intrusions, the official said.The exchange came after talks between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov failed to result in a Syria ceasefire agreement. They had been working to negotiate a plan that would have boosted military cooperation between the two nations in an effort to better target terrorists and prevent civilian deaths.Negotiators failed to work through differences, and the talks have ended for now. Following Obama's meeting with Putin, an official said the leaders indicated a desire for Kerry and Lavrov to reconvene deliberations in the coming days.""It was constructive,"" a US official said after the meeting, noting that all differences were not resolved. The official spoke anonymously to discuss a private conversation.""It's clear now what our respective positions are,"" the official said. ""And we'll see in coming days whether on Syria we can reach a near-term agreement. If we cannot get the type of agreement we want, we will walk away from that effort.""Differences between the two sides are technical, the official indicated, suggesting the divide was at a level that Obama and Putin wouldn't negotiate themselves.""President Obama and President Putin were not going to get down into the weeds of the language of an agreement and the implementation associated with the agreement,"" the official said.Photos of the session distributed by the Kremlin show the two leaders and aides, including Kerry and US National Security Adviser Susan Rice, seated around a table. The presidents appeared in congenial moods, with one photo showing Putin smiling broadly.Both Russian and US officials said the meeting -- which was held in a conference room at the G20 summit site here -- lasted longer than planned, and that leaders spent the bulk of their meeting discussing Syria. Turkey says ISIS cleared from Turkish-Syrian borderCautious optimismOn Sunday, cautious optimism prevailed that a deal could be struck between Washington and Moscow, long at odds over policy in Syria. Kerry and Lavrov had been working ""around the clock"" to come to an agreement, Obama told reporters.Russian forces have aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to target US-backed opposition fighters that Moscow and Damascus claim are terrorists. The campaign has spurred a humanitarian crisis and caused millions of Syrians to flee for Europe.The US hopes to align with Russia to identify terrorist targets, including ISIS and the Nusra Front, a group formerly tied to al-Qaeda. Officials hope a ceasefire will help advance talks on a political transition that would lead to the resignation of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.Any deal to end widespread suffering in Syria was likely to be met with doubt after past settlements, including a ceasefire agreed to in February, failed -- a fact Obama acknowledged on Sunday.      Why Obama shouldn't expect much from the G20""Given the failure of previous cessations of hostilities to hold, we approach it with some skepticism,"" Obama said.     But he insisted any work toward easing the deeply troubling humanitarian crisis was valuable.    ""It is worth trying,"" he said. ""To the extent that there are children and women and innocent civilians who can get food and medical supplies and, you know, get some relief from the constant terror of bombings, that's worth the effort.""   Russia and the USA deal on Syria could place US-Russia ties in a firmer position as Obama prepares to leave office. Deep divides over Syria have marred Obama's relationship with Putin, adding to a litany of discord between the US and Russia that's driven relations to their lowest level since the Cold War.     This week's interaction between the two men could be a final attempt to salvage what's become one of the most acrimonious relationships on the global stage. Putin's persistent support for the Syrian regime, Moscow's moves in Ukraine and the charge that Russia may be meddling in the US presidential contest have built a deeply antagonistic dynamic between the two leaders.     Obama said on Sunday that Russian participation was essential.    ""Our conversations with the Russians are key because, if it were not for the Russians, then Assad and the regime would not be able to sustain its offensive,"" he said."

1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/05/politics/isis-suspects-terrorism-europe-documents/index.html	" CNN has obtained thousands of pages of documents and photos from internal European investigations and gathered information from sources close to the Paris investigation that together provide new details about the highly organized terror group intent on attacking overseas targets. These documents reveal new information about two captured operatives who investigators believe intended to attack France. They also point, chillingly, to the existence of another suspected terrorist -- never before named publicly -- who authorities claim is linked to the Paris terror cell and was on the loose in Europe for months after that attack. That man, identified by authorities as Abid Tabaouni, was only arrested in July. And the documents shed new light on the highly organized branch of ISIS devoted to plotting attacks inside Europe where, even now, sources told CNN, operatives await instructions from senior handlers in Syria. ""ISIS is increasing its international attack planning,"" said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst who contributed to CNN's investigation and editor of CTC Sentinel, a publication issued by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. ""It's increasingly sophisticated in the way it does this. It's set up an intricate, logistical support system for these terrorists ... to launch these terrorist attacks."" A CNN team spent months going through 90,000 pages of documents, most of them in French, that included a trove of interrogations, investigative findings and data pulled from cell phones offering insight into the external operations wing of ISIS known as the Amn al-Kharji. The documents show: a fuller portrait of the suspected terrorists' extensive use of social media platforms such as Viber, Telegram and WhatsApp, many encrypted for secure communication. One app let them pick their own phone number, allowing them to disguise who was calling them and from where. how ISIS handlers protect their missions by: giving operatives only as much information and money as they need to reach the next phase; contacting them on each leg of their journey; and insisting on pseudonyms, even within teams. how the suspected terrorists constantly exchanged logistical advice with others in their network, including whether or not to use real names at border crossings and how to sneak across those borders illegally. One tip was to hide in train restrooms. A senior European counter-terrorism official who spoke to CNN said that according to investigations into the network that carried out the Paris attacks, they were a slimmed-down version of an even more ambitious plan to hit Europe. After interrogating suspects and gathering intelligence, European investigators now believe that ISIS initially planned for the operatives it sent last year to also attack the Netherlands, as well as other targets in France including shopping areas and possibly a supermarket in Paris, the official said. In addition, recently obtained intelligence indicates that ISIS has stepped up efforts to infiltrate operatives into the UK to launch attacks there, an official told CNN.The senior European counter-terrorism official told CNN that security services were ""uncovering more and more ISIS operatives"" on continental European soil. ISIS operatives dispatched back to Europe have taken advantage of encryption, especially the Telegram messenger app, to communicate securely, the official told CNN, frustrating European security services.""Encrypted messaging groups have the potential to revolutionize terror plot planning by allowing entire cells to coordinate in real time without compromising themselves,"" said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Europe's security agencies have had important successes, though. One major breakthrough was the capture of two men who authorities believe intended to travel to France alongside the two suicide bombers who eventually blew themselves up outside a Paris stadium.  Investigators: Two ISIS attackers who never reached France Those two suspected ISIS operatives are identified in the documents as Algerian-born Adel Haddadi and his Pakistani travel partner, Muhammad Usman.  Documents that detail their capture and extensive interrogations, particularly with Haddadi, show how ISIS supported the attackers throughout their journey from Syria through Europe -- and how future attacks might be organized. The following account of their journey to Europe is based on those documents, which include evidence gathered by investigators, and their conclusions. Haddadi and Usman, who was identified by investigators as a suspected bombmaker for the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, set out from the capital of the self-declared ISIS caliphate in Raqqa, Syria, six weeks before the Paris attacks. They were part of a team, investigators concluded. The two others, Ahmad al-Mohammad and Mohamad al-Mahmod, would later blow themselves up outside the national stadium in Paris. The team crossed the border from Syria into Turkey in early October and headed for the Turkish coast. The four men didn't seem to know each other's real names, or what their final mission would be. All Haddadi knew, he later told interrogators, was that they were being sent to France to do ""something for the good of God."" The documents show that their journey was directed by a shadowy ISIS leader in Syria, known only as Abu Ahmad. Operating like a puppet-master from afar, Abu Ahmad handled their logistics: connecting them with smugglers and cars for transport, providing pre-programmed cell phones and getting them fake Syrian passports. He wired them money as they moved, using intermediaries who couldn't be traced, and communicated using encrypted apps. ""Abu Ahmad ... is key in sending those individuals, at least the foreigners, into the Paris attacks,"" said Jean-Charles Brisard, president and chairman of the French Center for the Analysis of Terrorism, who reviewed the documents for CNN. ""He is the one who recruited them, who funds them, who trained them,"" said Brisard. ""He was always in contact with them."" eThroughout their journey, Abu Ahmad gave the men only enough money and information to get to the next stop, rarely if ever telling them what would happen next, the documents show. Posing as Syrian refugees The documents reveal fresh details about their journey and the way they posed as Syrian refugees, blending in with thousands fleeing the war-torn country. They made the treacherous crossing from Izmir, Turkey, into Greece in a boat filled with dozens of refugees. But they were then intercepted by the Greek Navy. The two who would go on to strike the Paris stadium passed through Greece and started moving across Europe toward their target in France. Greek officials declined to explain how the two got through. But Greek authorities discovered Haddadi and Usman's fake Syrian passports. The pair were arrested, their money was taken, and they were held for nearly a month. Sources told CNN that investigators believe that delay was significant; as a result, they would not have a chance to become part of the Paris attacks. The Greeks released Haddadi and Usman in late October. They immediately contacted their ISIS handler, Abu Ahmad, who arranged for someone to wire them 2,000 euros. Flush with cash, the pair continued along the refugee route. It was likely a quiet journey. The documents show that Usman spoke only Urdu, while Haddadi spoke mostly Arabic. And as they travelled north, Usman was preoccupied with a strikingly un-Islamic hobby -- using his phone to peruse almost two dozen X-rated sites, including ""sexxx lahur"" and ""Pakistani Lahore college girls ... ImakeSex.""  Both men's phones have given European officials rich investigative veins to mine, revealing dozens of contacts across Europe and the Middle East. One of the people Haddadi reached out to for help was a technician at one of the most important nuclear research centers in Europe. That man was placed under immediate observation by French authorities, the documents show. Data pulled from the phones also revealed how the operatives functioned both with extreme care and sometimes, seemingly, by the seat of their pants. In one exchange, Haddadi asks a contact for advice about what to do at a border crossing and whether a friend should use his real name. The friend is so worried about this, Haddadi gripes that he's ""driving me crazy."" Other online conversations, notably with Abu Ahmad, are clearly in code. One message investigators pulled from Haddadi's phone shows the ISIS handler counseling patience, though the exact meaning of his message isn't clear. ""Yes, but not yet,"" it reads, ""the drugs are not good."" On November 14, the day after the Paris attacks, Haddadi and Usman arrived in Salzburg, Austria, applied for asylum and settled into one of the city's refugee centers, where they waited for weeks.  Investigators: Planning for another strike They were waiting with a purpose, according to the documents.   European investigators concluded that Haddadi and Usman were part of the same terror cell as the Paris bombers and, having failed to participate in that bloody day, were planning another strike. Investigators found that in the days before their arrest, Haddadi and Usman were researching trains to Paris and making a flurry of phone calls overseas, including to contacts in Belgium and France. The documents also reveal that investigators believe that Haddadi and Usman were waiting for a third man to join them -- Abid Tabaouni. Tabaouni's name and his alleged role have never before been made public. As investigators grilled Haddadi and pored through data they collected from cell phones, they asked European police to issue a continent-wide warrant for Tabaouni's arrest. Like Usman and Haddadi, Tabaouni traveled from Syria along the refugee route, arriving in Salzburg on December 10. He headed to the refugee center where Haddadi and Usman were staying. The documents outline what happened next: The very day that Tabaouni arrived, Austrian security officials thundered into the center, arresting Haddadi, Usman and a few others suspected of being connected to the Paris attackers. Tabaouni was nowhere to be seen. But investigators found his cell phone charging right beside Haddadi's bed. The documents show that Tabaouni had programmed into his phone a number linked to the terror cell of the ringleader of the Paris attacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud. He had also saved a photo of ISIS fighters standing before their black-and-white flag.   Haddadi denied knowing Tabaouni, but investigators found Tabaouni had saved Haddadi's phone number in his contacts. The phone also contained a photo taken just 30 minutes before security officials stormed the refugee center. It shows Tabaouni sitting on a bed in between where Haddadi and Usman slept. The investigators lay out in the documents their belief that Tabaouni was coming to join Haddadi and Usman and that the three men were working on ISIS operations and planning possible attacks. CNN sources and analysts agree about Tabaouni's likely role. ""We can assume that Tabaouni was also part of the same plot,"" said Brisard, the French terror expert. ""And (that he) was instructed to carry out an attack."" From the moment he slipped away in December, Tabaouni was a wanted man, according to several CNN sources. An arrest is made The Belgian prosecutor's office told CNN that Tabaouni, who is Moroccan, was only arrested in Brussels in July. He was taken into custody as soon as he was located, according to a senior European terrorism official. Following the publication of an earlier version of this story, Austrian media, citing prosecutors, have reported that Tabaouni has been extradited to Austria.Haddadi and Usman were extradited to France, where they face terrorism charges, according to senior European counterterrorism sources, who also say they will be trying to tie Tabaouni to Haddadi and Usman and the Paris attackers. While he was on the loose, Tabaouni was openly using a Facebook account that is identified in the documents by its unique ID number and was publicly posting updates from Belgium, where he was arrested. None of his postings indicate any apparent terrorist leanings or affiliations. Investigators are now analyzing more than 1,600 pages of data from Tabaouni's phone in hopes of learning more about his movements and contacts. Several sources told CNN there are probably more sleeper cells and ISIS operatives coming into Europe using the same crowded, chaotic refugee route exploited by Haddadi, Usman and Tabaouni. ""We've seen that in the recent weeks, several of them, individuals who carry out individual attacks, inspired attacks, were coming back from Syria using the same route,"" Brisard said. ""In addition to that, several jihadists have been arrested all around in France ... in Belgium and Germany using the same route, for the same purpose,"" Brisard said. The treasure trove of information that investigators gained from the interrogations and the data extracted from the phones may help authorities better identify future plotters. Even after the arrests in Austria, Haddadi's phone was still active. On December 15, five days after the refugee center raid, the documents show that the team's ISIS handler, Abu Ahmad, reached out to his operatives. He messaged Haddadi, perhaps wondering about their silence. ""How are you,"" he wrote. ""What has become of you?"" There was no reply.

""Frankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity.""Obama, who had just come from a 90-minute session with Putin on the sidelines of the summit, also pointedly noted, ""We've had problems with cyber intrusions from Russia and other countries in the past.""Obama said, however, that he wouldn't comment about ""specific investigations that are still live and active,"" an apparent reference to the hack of the Democratic National Committee. While the White House has not yet named a culprit, US officials have pinned the breach on Russia.His words on cyber weren't the only ones that pointed to areas of tension with the Russian leader.On Syria, the topic that occupied most of their conversation, Obama said that he and Putin have had ""productive conversations"" about negotiating a ""real cessation of hostilities"" in Syria but that ""gaps of trust"" have prevented reaching an agreement.""Given the gaps of trust that exist, that's a tough negotiation, and we haven't yet closed the gaps in a way where we think it would actually work,"" Obama said.But he noted that he'd tasked Secretary of State John Kerry with resuming talks about a ceasefire.Putin, Obama said, is ""less colorful"" than another confrontational leader, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who earlier Monday warned Obama against raising his controversial record combating drug crime in an anticipated meeting.Obama and Duterte were set to meeting in Laos this week, where Obama is traveling next to attend a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders.Obama suggested Monday his planned meeting Duterte may not go forward.""I always want to make sure if I'm having a meeting that it's productive and we're getting something done,"" Obama said during his news conference.""If and when we have a meeting, this is something that is going to be brought up,"" Obama said, referring to a spate of extrajudicial killings of purported drug dealers that have transpired since Duterte took officer earlier this year.White House officials said last week that Obama would confront Duterte about the killings.But Duterte did not take kindly to that notion.""I am a president of a sovereign state. And we have long ceased to be a colony. I do not have any master except the Filipino people. Nobody, but nobody. You must be respectful.

Many leaders are already looking ahead to January, when either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump assumes the business of state.During his news conference, Obama faced questions about both candidates' opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a centerpiece of his Asia policy, which he's urgently trying to promote on his final trip to the continent as its fate hangs in the balance.""I've yet to hear a persuasive argument from the left or the right"" against the TPP, Obama argued during the news conference.""Back home, we'll have to cut through the noise once the election season is over,"" he said when probed about the prospects of passing the deal this year through a Congress largely antagonistic to the pact.Obama also addressed a domestic controversy over NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand during the playing of the national anthem in protest of the treatment of minorities in the United States.""He's exercising his constitutional right to make a statement,"" Obama said.

She recognized America as the greatest political embodiment of those values,"" the statement read. ""From military superiority and defense to immigration and trade; from unborn life to the nuclear family and parenthood, Phyllis Schlafly was a courageous and articulate voice for common sense and traditional values.""Schlafly was most well-known for her work fighting the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970's, emerging as one of the leading female critics of the feminist movement.Schlafly, until her death, remained in the political arena and recently made the case for electing Donald Trump president. On Monday night the Republican nominee eulogized Schlafly in a statement.""Phyllis Schlafly is a conservative icon who led millions to action, reshaped the conservative movement, and fearlessly battled globalism and the 'kingmakers' on behalf of America's workers and families,"" Trump said. ""I was honored to spend time with her during this campaign as she waged one more great battle for national sovereignty.""The new women's movement: Reviving the ERA fightIn her final days, Schlafly caused consternation among some conservatives by backing Trump.She endorsed the billionaire at a rally in her home city of St. Louis, Missouri in March, despite the fact many of her fellow travelers in the movement don't see the Republican candidate as a true ideological conservative, likening him to Ronald Reagan.""I can remember 1980 when a lot of us didn't think Reagan was an authentic conservative,"" Schlafly told CNN in an interview in May.""Reagan turned out to be best president of the century,"" she said. She backed Trump partly because he was the only candidate talking about illegal immigration, which she said was ""the most important issue in the country.""In a statement Monday night Reagan biographer Craig Shirley called Schlafly the ""First Lady"" of the American conservative movement. ""Her legacy helped conservatives understand they had a choice and were not simply an echo,"" Shirley said. ""She battled, she won, she confounded the radical left-wing feminists time and again. Frankly, she was smarter and tougher than the liberals she fought and conquered so joyously. The defeat of the so-called Equal Rights Amendment stands as but one of many monuments to her legacy.""Funeral arrangements are still being finalized, according to the Eagle Forum."
