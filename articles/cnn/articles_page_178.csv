But the candidate's daughter bristled when interviewer Prachi Gupta asked, ""In 2004, Donald Trump said that pregnancy is an inconvenient thing for a business. It's surprising to see this policy from him today. Can you talk a little about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?"" ""So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions,"" Ivanka Trump said, according to Cosmopolitan's transcript. ""So I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this, if you're going to make a comment like that."" She said the question was ""an unfair characterization of his track record and his support of professional women.""Gupta pressed on: ""I would like to say that I'm sorry the questions -- you're finding them negative, but it is relevant that a presidential candidate made those comments. So I'm just following up.""""Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,"" Trump said. Presented with the source of her father's quote -- an NBC interview in 2004 -- Trump shot back that ""there's plenty of time for you to editorialize around this,"" and again pitched the campaign's new childcare policy. ""I hope that regardless of what your political viewpoint is, this should be celebrated,"" she added.Trump also clashed with Gupta when asked why the campaign's paid leave proposal didn't apply to gay couples or include paternity leave. She said that the reason the proposal wouldn't include to those groups is that ""the original intention of the plan is to help mothers in recovery in the immediate aftermath of childbirth.""""So I just want to be clear that, for same-sex adoption, where the two parents are both men, they would not be receiving special leave for that because they don't need to recover or anything?"" Gupta asked.Trump said: ""Well, those are your words, not mine. Those are your words. The plan, right now, is focusing on mothers, whether they be in same-sex marriages or not.""She said child-bearing mothers in lesbian couples would be eligible under the plan.When Gupta pivoted to asking Trump about how Donald Trump proposed to pay for some of his most expensive policy proposals -- such as the border wall with Mexico, infrastructure investment, and increased defense spending -- Trump said that the policies would all be paid for as a result of the Trump campaign's forthcoming tax reform plan. Shortly thereafter, she cut the interview off.""I'm going to jump off -- I have to run. I apologize,"" Trump said.Around 12:30 p.m. ET, Cosmopolitan's link to the story appeared to be down and gave a 404 error, but it returned online shortly thereafter.  She later tweeted, ""@Cosmopolitan, your readers do & should care about issues impacting women & children. Keep the focus where it belongs—advocating change.""Trump's efforts to help roll out her father's maternity leave policy proposal and to make his candidacy more palatable to young women were also complicated Wednesday when The Huffington Post reported that she misstated the Trump Organization's own maternity leave policy. Trump told reporters and ""Good Morning America"" that the Trump Organization offers employees eight weeks of paid leave. But The Huffington Post found hotels and casinos run by subsidiaries of the Trump Organization offer no paid family leave, but rather adhere to federal law that requires only businesses allow women to take sick leave and vacation.Hillary Clinton's campaign has criticized Trump's maternity proposal for focusing only on women and not fathers. That issue was also raised during the Cosmopolitan interview.""The original intention of the plan is to help mothers in recovery in the immediate aftermath of childbirth,"" said Ivanka Trump."

(There are no laws barring Trump from disclosing his tax returns while he is being audited).The comment reflects the political potency of Trump's tax returns. There are growing questions about what's in the documents, including details of investments in foreign countries. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was the GOP's vice presidential nominee in 2012, said Thursday that presidential candidates should release their tax returns.""I released mine,"" Ryan said. ""I think we should release our returns. I'll leave it to him when to do it.""Former Rep. Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican, sought to connect Trump Jr.'s comments with the campaign's longtime audit explanation. In a Thursday interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room,"" Kingston said releasing the tax returns could influence the IRS audit process.""If you put it on the table, you're going to have 300 million Americans second-guessing what is this, what is that?"" Kingston said. ""That actually, I think, would influence the IRS because they would say, 'Oh, wait, somebody out in Idaho said this. Somebody in Chicago said that. Somebody in New York said this.' Then they're off chasing things.""Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday that putting out the returns would lead to misinterpretations.""With a $10 billion business, if Donald Trump dumped his taxes out today, there would be all kinds of misinterpretations of that and maybe some real interpretations of that between now and November. That would be the only discussion we'd have,"" King, a Trump supporter, said on ""New Day."" ""So I'd say the window is closed on that but I wish he had done so last March or April.""Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has released nearly four decades of tax returns."

Clinton said she was ""so sad"" that ""The Good Wife"" is over, but cited the CBS drama ""Madam Secretary"" as a possible replacement.""'Madam Secretary' however, is coming back, so that's something to look forward to,"" Clinton said. ""I actually get a big kick out of it."" ""Madam Secretary"" is a fictional television series starring Téa Leoni as the secretary of state. ""I watched it with, you know, a little bit of skepticism at first, but then I got so into it. And (I) really liked the story lines,"" Clinton raved.  Clinton has discussed her binge-watching habits in the past -- in an October appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" she said she watched ""House of Cards,"" ""Madam Secretary"" and ""The Good Wife.""She also told Jamie Harison, the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, during an August interview on his YouTube channel that she enjoys watching ""Madam Secretary,"" ""The Good Wife"" and ""Downton Abbey.""""But what I relax by,"" she said, is HGTV, specifically mentioning ""Love it or List it"" and ""Beachfront Bargain Hunt.""

""This was back in 1980, and I thought back to a previous election where I voted, and I voted for the Communist Party candidate,""Brennan was responding to a question about barriers to recruiting diverse candidates for the intelligence fields, including whether past records of activism could hurt someone applying for a clearance later in life.The CIA director said the agency's mission is to protect the values of the Constitution -- which include free speech.""We've all had indiscretions in our past,"" he said, adding neither some drug experimentation nor activism was a non-starter. ""I would not be up here if that was disqualifying.""He proceeded to tell the story of his test.""I froze, because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said, 'OK, here's the choice, John. You can deny that, and the machine is probably going to go, you know, wacko, or I can acknowledge it and see what happens,'"" Brennan said.He said he chose to be forthcoming.""I said I was neither Democratic or Republican, but it was my way, as I was going to college, of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change. I said I'm not a member of the Communist Party, so the polygrapher looked at me and said, 'OK,' and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said, 'Well, I'm screwed.'""But he soon got his admission notice to the CIA and was relieved, he said, saying that though the agency still had long strides to make in accepting gay recruits and minorities, even then it recognized the importance of freedom.""So if back in 1980, John Brennan was allowed to say, 'I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall' ... and still got through, rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that's not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government."""

Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson garnered 8%, comparable to where he has been polling nationally. Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin has 3% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein has 1%.Trump has slashed the once-sizable leads that Clinton enjoyed following the national conventions, but it might be too early to say whether the tightening has extended to Virginia. Clinton led Trump in virtually every poll there in the summer and many forecastors believed she had a firm grip on the state's 13 electoral votes following her selection of Tim Kaine, Virginia's junior senator, as her running mate.But Clinton's post-convention edge has evaporated this month, both nationally and in crucial battleground states. A CNN/ORC poll this week found Trump leading by five in Ohio and basically tied with Clinton in Florida. The University of Mary Washington poll was conducted September 6-12 using phone interviews with 685 likely Virginia voters. It has a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-health/index.html	"Misjudge a moment or say the wrong thing and a US candidate can quickly find him or herself out of the race -- or at least on the wrong track.But it's not just a slip of the tongue that can derail a campaign -- there are a number of other issues, peculiar to the US, that weigh on the minds of the American voter when they walk into the ballot box. That's not to say that politicians haven't tried to buck the trend. But this is where the wheels have started to come off. How you feeling?Hillary Clinton's 9/11 wobble and pneumonia diagnosis may have put the spotlight on the issue of health and the presidency in the US, but it's hardly a new phenomenon.Clinton, who returned to the campaign trail on Thursday, claimed she ""didn't think it was going to be that big of deal.""But that will do little to assuage voters in a country with a history of less than healthy commanders-in-chief.""The ramifications of someone being in poor health and potentially dying mid-term are enormous,"" says Timothy Stanley, a US historian and columnist for CNN and Britain's Daily Telegraph.""In the past, you had people like John McCain running for president, who was in his 70s when he did so. You had a controversial vice president -- Sarah Palin. George H. W. Bush had the same issue -- he had Dan Quayle.""The possibility that a president could die or require serious medical assistance while in office isn't as far-fetched as one may think. William Henry Harrison died of pneumonia a month after taking office in 1841. Woodrow Wilson suffered a massive stroke while in office in 1919, and his medical condition became a closely-guarded secret from the public, with his wife assuming affairs in his absence. Franklin D. Roosevelt died of a massive cerebral hemorrhage while still in office.The issue of health may be more pertinent in America -- where the vice president assumes the top job in the event the president is incapacitated -- than in countries with other systems of government.Case in point: Great Britain, which runs on a cabinet government system that places less importance on a leader than on her political party.British Prime Minister Theresa May has diabetes, but this barely came up during the race to lead the UK government. And even if she did become ill, it wouldn't immediately impact her cabinet, which collectively oversees government legislation.Related: When presidents and candidates kept their medical maladies secret 'Show us the money' Another odd quirk of US presidential campaigns is the expectation that candidates should release their tax returns.Clinton has released her most recent federal tax return for 2015, in addition to those from previous years. Donald Trump hasn't, despite a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll finding that 64% of Americans think he should -- including 41% of registered Republicans.Stanley says the reason US voters fixate on financial disclosure is two-fold: To ensure candidates do not carry any conflicts of interest, and to gain an insight into their character.  ""That Barack Obama relies on royalties tells us he's intellectual, he's not obsessed with business, he's not looking out to make a fast buck,"" he says.""That Hillary Clinton relies so much on her income from speeches implies this is a woman who really is a professional politician -- she makes money out of it. So there is a transparency issue. It's also an interesting way to gauge the character.""All US candidates must privately submit their full financial history to the Office for Government Ethics. But a candidate's failure to publicly disclose tax returns can plant seeds of doubt in voters' minds -- like it did when Walter Mondale's running mate refused to reveal her family's financial dealings in 1984.""There was the famous case of Geraldine Ferraro, running as the Democratic vice president. There were issues with her husband,"" Stanley recalls. ""Unfairly that created the impression she was covering something up.""The all-American dreamOnly in America does the vetting for political office also extend so conspicuously to the politician's spouse.""'First lady' is a made-up title. It means nothing legally or constitutionally ... It is a reflection of the celebrity nature of American politics and it's deeply unhealthy,"" says Stanley.He believes that America's obsession with who will become the next ""first family"" speaks to a ""desire to see a president who reflects older values of monogamy and fidelity.""And the average US voter is serious on this issue. Previously, entire campaigns in America have been derailed by infidelity.John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina, ran for the White House in 2008, and was even considered as a potential running mate for Barack Obama's ticket. But details of an extra-marital affair -- including a child produced from the relationship and reports of a sex tape -- ended that presidential dream.Gary Hart made several bids for commander-in-chief in the '80s and very nearly made it. But a 1987 investigation by the Miami Herald had revealed an affair with a young campaign aide. The ensuing media speculation proved to be too much for the then-front-runner, who was never able to recover momentum and withdrew from the race in March the following year. Overseas the perfect family ideal is less important. French President Francois Hollande faced a media firestorm in 2014 over allegations of an affair with an actress, and his relationship with long-time partner Valerie Trierweiler broke down. Hollande's personal life made headlines for months, but it hasn't unseated him from office.That same year in India, Narendra Modi, who at the time was the then-favorite to become the country's next prime minister, was forced to disclose for the first time in his political career that he was, in fact, married.Modi's family arranged the marriage when he was in his late teens and the pair separated after three years but never divorced. It didn't stop him from declaring that his single status made him the perfect candidate -- and although his opponents tried to use this information against him, Modi's coalition won handily on election day. Back in the US, Clinton regularly campaigns with her husband Bill and daughter Chelsea by her side. Even thrice-married Trump understands US voters need to see a strong family unit, with his wife and children often joining him on the trail and at the national party convention last summer.Want to crack open a beer?American voters also want a president they can relate to. They want to see candidates interact with them on a personal level, to understand their struggles and -- perhaps most importantly -- to show a sense of humor. It's a regular occurrence to see politicians popping up on the American late-night circuit.""They are a test on your ability to speak to ordinary people. It's very important to Americans that their president can make them laugh,"" says Stanley.""You have to appear on Saturday Night Live... That tradition of appearing on it has been around since the '80s but it's really taken off in recent years. Palin went on it. McCain went on it. Obama went on it. Everyone gets on Saturday Night Live. You've got to be prepared to be laughed at and show that you get the joke."""	The peculiar pitfalls of a US presidential election

CNN has not been able to review the Facebook post in question.""She was so nervous, she was shaking. And I said, 'wow, this was kind of strange.' And then she came up. So she had that in mind, no question about it,"" Trump said, adding that he suspected that he might face an unfriendly reception at the church.Clinton responded to Trump's characterization during a news conference Thursday afternoon, taking issue with Trump calling her ""nervous.""""That's not only insulting, that's dead wrong. ... She's a rock for her community in trying times, she deserves better than that. And Flint deserves better,"" Clinton said in Greensboro, North Carolina.  In a statement distributed before Trump's appearance, Timmons said: ""This public event is open to all and today Donald Trump came to observe.

Trump had begun criticizing Clinton's record as secretary of state during his remarks to the congregation when Timmons interjected. ""Mr. Trump, I invited you here to thank us for what we've done in Flint, not give a political speech."" Trump replied, ""Ok, that's good. Then I'm going back onto Flint, OK?

""Look, to be honest with you, I'm starting to get a whiff of desperation from the other side. It seems like the attacks are getting a little more intense.""On 'curious' Fed policiesPence defended Trump's recent comments about Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, whom Trump accused of keeping interest rates low and creating a ""false stock market"" in order to help President Barack Obama. The Indiana governor declined to accuse Yellen of political gamesmanship, but said he had a hard time figuring out the Fed's policies.Donald Trump's unfulfilled promises""I think it's hard to understand why the Fed continues to advance policies that really work for hedge fund managers on Wall Street, here in New York City, but really aren't working for working families on Main Street,"" Pence said. ""I think Donald Trump is saying that it's time that we brought forward the kind of economic policies that will allow interest rates to return to a rational point.""He added, ""I just think it's very curious to see the Federal Reserve continue to resist efforts to respond in the marketplace in a way that puts the interest of middle class families first.""Trump's tax returnsAsked about Trump's tax returns -- which the GOP nominee has refused to release -- Pence reiterated the campaign's stance that voters won't see them until the conclusion of what Trump has said is an ongoing IRS audit.""I don't hear a lot of people talking about tax returns,"" he said. ""I think he's been very forthcoming about saying that he'll reveal those tax returns when a routine audit is done.""Pence maintained that voters curious about learning more about Trump's financial dealings already have that information available.""What your viewers ought to know is that both Donald Trump and I, and frankly the other two major party candidates in this race, have all filed the full financial disclosure that federal law requires,"" Pence said. ""And people that want to learn about Donald Trump's financial interests can read over 100 pages of disclosure online right now at the Federal Election Commission.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/putin-trump-obama-clinton-russia/index.html	"But Russia is commanding center stage in a presidential election for the first time in decades and President Vladimir Putin is being portrayed as a sinister puppeteer looming over the bitter contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.Democrats have blamed him for orchestrating a huge cyberespionage operation using stolen and leaked emails to sow chaos and distrust in America's democratic process ahead of November's election. Putin's even been accused of cultivating one of the candidates in the election -- Trump -- as an unwitting agent to further his quest to strangle US global power.A decision by Putin to further foreign policy goals by intervening directly in a US election would cross a line rarely approached in Soviet times. And it begs the question of why Russia would take this perilous extra step.The Soviet Union, though possessing the intelligence capacity to meddle in a US election, had always feared such a move could backfire and hurt a preferred candidate, said William Courtney, a former US ambassador to Kazakhstan and Georgia.""(The current Russian leadership) may think there is a low-cost/high-payoff way to increase the perception that the system over here is chaotic and is not reliable,"" said Courtney, now with the Rand Corporation.Former CIA covert operations officer Mike Baker told CNN's Brooke Baldwin, ""The long game here is not so much they are trying to influence who actually wins this particular election but the long game is more of a traditional psy ops battle where they are trying to erode trust in the electoral process.""Trump: Putin has been a leaderThough Russia might feel it gains with its meddling regardless of who wins, it might not hurt that Trump has been so effusive toward Putin and so critical of current US policy toward Moscow that treats him as a threat. Indeed, in an unprecedented move for a major party nominee, Trump has lined himself up squarely with a foreign leader who sees himself as a US adversary.Trump appeared to indicate at a forum televised by NBC last week that Putin's flattery had prompted him to look on the Russian leader favorably.""If he says great things about me, I'm gonna say great things about him. I mean, the man has very strong control over a country,"" Trump said, while stressing he did not like the Russian political system.""But certainly in that system he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.""Comments like those are one reason that some Trump critics have accused the billionaire of being duped by the cunning former KGB operative in the Kremlin.""In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation,"" wrote former deputy CIA director Michael Morrell, who now supports Clinton, in a New York Times article in August.Other Trump comments appearing to call into question US security guarantees towards NATO nations and apparent openness to Putin's views on the sovereignty of Crimea are also factors that helped convince 50 Republican national security officials to sign a letter last month denouncing Trump.Obama takes swipe at RepublicansClinton has seized on the issue to attack her presidential opponent. She charged recently that Trump's praise for Putin marked him out as unpatriotic and reckless, as she tried to bolster her case that her surging rival was unfit to sit in the Oval Office.""It's beyond one's imagination to have a candidate for president praising a Russian autocrat like Vladimir Putin,"" Clinton told reporters.President Barack Obama, fresh from his own latest confrontation with the Russian leader at the G20, also weighed in on Monday.""Think about what's happened to the Republican Party. They used to be opposed to Russia and authoritarianism, fighting for freedom and fighting for democracy,"" Obama said, campaigning for Clinton in Philadelphia on Tuesday.""And now their nominee is out there praising a guy, saying, 'He's a strong leader because he invades smaller countries, jails his opponents, controls the press and drives his economy into a long recession.'""Obama's intervention sparked an angry response by Moscow -- which Democrats will likely welcome, since it plays into their claim that the Kremlin would prefer a friendly Trump rather than a hostile Clinton as president.US computer systems infiltrated?""Unfortunately, (when) we see the continuing manifestation of such a blatant Russophobia, we can only express regret here,"" Putin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday in comments carried by the TASS news agency.Peskov bemoaned the ""Russian card and the card of our president"" being used as ""an almost decisive one in the US electoral process.""The US government has provided no concrete evidence that the Russian government is targeting the US elections. The Kremlin has vehemently denied involvement.But it is accepted wisdom in Washington that entities probably linked to the Russian state but with plausible distance from official channels have infiltrated US computer systems and facilitated the leak of embarrassing emailsRecent reports of email infiltration include former secretary of state Colin Powell. And the World Anti-Doping Agency accused Russia of being behind an alleged breach of US Olympic athlete's medical files.The Democratic National Committee has also been a target, and many party stalwarts fear that more embarrassing revelations, perhaps directly targeting the Democratic nominee are on the way.Fiona Hill of the Brookings Institution, who co-authored a book on Putin, said that the motivation behind the hacks was to show the outside world, including Russians, that the US political system was hardly a paragon of democracy and good governance in order to undermine the moral authority of Washington overseas.Putin wants to restore Russia's statusParaphrasing the argument that Russia could make after a chaotic election, Hill said: ""Look at what is happening in the United States -- do you really think this, this picture that we are seeing here, is any better than any of the other systems around the word? What gives these people, who are engaged in this kind of dirty politics, the right to make pronouncements?""The Russian president has also made no secret that his core political project is undermining Western political, diplomatic and military institutions in order to restore what he sees as Russia's rightful place as a global great power. He's also made clear his belief that the US and its European allies have conspired against Russian interests in Georgia, Ukraine, Libya and Syria.Putin also harbors personal animosity towards Clinton in particular, after accusing her of intervening directly against his party in parliamentary elections in Russia in 2011 while she was secretary of state.But the election intrigue is not just a reflection of the estranged nature of Russia-US relations, and of the fact that Putin has many political, foreign policy and personal reasons to see an intervention in US democracy as a winning strategy.Putin has 'narrowed the gap'It is also likely a sign of increasing Russian confidence and influence on the world stage, as Putin confounds the efforts of Western nations to isolate and ostracize him after the annexation of Crimea.Russia, after inserting itself back in the Middle East, has become a crucial and often obstructive partner in US efforts to broker a Syria ceasefire.In Beijing earlier this month, Putin was ubiquitous at the G20 summit in Beijing after once being scorned by the group for his actions in Ukraine.And despite its hobbled economy, over reliance on energy sources and claims that Putin has established a brutal, authoritarian state, Russia still appears to be confounding Western predictions that it would become no more than a decaying regional super power.""(Putin) has narrowed the gap or maybe even exceeded expectations between Russian's power potential, its latent capability as it recovered economically and what the world system and certainly the Western system --- the political, societal and economic system -- had relegated it to,"" said Matthew Rojansky, a Russia scholar at the Wilson Center."

Johnson and Stein garnered 8% and 4% respectively, according to the poll, with Clinton losing slightly more supporters to the pair than Trump. Clinton narrowly edged Trump among likely voters, 46%-44% in a head-to-head without either Johnson or Stein included, the CBS/NYT poll found. But most Americans will have the option to vote for either of the two third-party candidates. Johnson will be on the ballot in all 50 states, while Stein will be on the ballot in 45 states, as well as the District of Columbia. The findings provide a snapshot of a race that suddenly looks tighter than it did a month ago, when Clinton emerged from her party's convention with leads nationally and in swing states. About 64% of the Democratic Party's registered voters are either very or somewhat enthusiastic about voting this year, according to the CBS/NYT poll, down from 77% in August. Enthusiasm among Republicans, meanwhile, has remained about the same.And 45% of Trump voters said they are ""very enthusiastic"" about voting, while just 36% of Clinton supporters say the same.That enthusiasm gap has eroded Clinton's electoral firewall. After holding consistent leads in Ohio and Florida for much of the summer, Clinton's edge in those crucial battlegrounds has evaporated. A CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday showed Trump up by five points in Ohio, with the two virtually tied in Florida. The CBS/NYT poll surveyed 1,433 likely voters nationwide between September 9-13 and has a margin of error of plus or minus three points. "	Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton tied in new poll
