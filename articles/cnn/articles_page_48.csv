But Tuesday's election is the first presidential election in more than 50 years without federal power to mandate observers inside polling stations. That's a result of the 2013 Supreme Court ruling, known as the Shelby decision, which struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act. The federal government lost its mandate to place observers inside polling stations. The monitors being deployed this year can't enter polling places without the authorization from local election officials. Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, says the monitors will be able to accomplish most of what was done by observers before the Supreme Court ruling. ""In most cases, voters on the ground will see very little practical difference between monitors and observers,"" Gupta said. ""We work closely and cooperatively with jurisdictions around the country to ensure that trained personnel are able to keep an eye on the proceedings from an immediate vantage point.""Staffers from the Justice civil rights division will handle voting rights complaints by phone. Complaints about violence or intimidation are handled by local authorities, but complaints should also be called in to federal authorities after local officials are contacted. US attorneys offices and the FBI also are involved in helping to enforce federal voting laws. Attorney General Loretta Lynch described the right to vote as a ""bedrock of our democracy,"" a right her department works ""tirelessly to uphold."" ""As always, our personnel will perform these duties impartially, with one goal in mind: to see to it that every eligible voter can participate in our elections to the full extent that federal law provides,"" Lynch said in a statement. ""The department is deeply committed to the fair and unbiased application of our voting rights laws and we will work tirelessly to ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot."""

During the race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, 5,963,110 votes were recorded in total, according to the Florida secretary of state's office.That's a sign both of possible excitement about the presidential election, but also due to the state's booming growth. The population has increased by about 3 million over the past 16 years.It is also possible that expanded early-voting laws have been embraced by voters. There are some signs that individuals who would typically vote on Election Day instead decided to vote early this year.The race in Florida in 2000 captivated the nation for weeks after Bush and Gore essentially tied in Florida and had to bring their case to the Supreme Court. Polls in 2016 reflect another tight race, with CNN's most recent Poll of Polls showing Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tied at 45%.Exit Polls 2016Democrats currently lead Republicans in early voting, 40% to 38%, with 22% not belonging to either party.

But everywhere I go, people are refusing to be defined by fear and division,"" Clinton says. ""I believe in our people. I love this country. And I'm convinced that our best days are ahead of us if we reach for them together. I want to be a president for all Americans. Not just those who support me in this election. For everyone.""The rhetoric in the spot mimics much of what Clinton has said throughout her campaign, with a particular focus on acknowledging the unpredictability of the 2016 election.""I think we can all agree it's been a long campaign,"" Clinton says in the spot. ""But tomorrow, you get to pick our next president.""Clinton has not been entirely positive on the stump in the weeks before Election Day, focusing as much on her policies as she did on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. At events across the country, Clinton called the election a ""moment of reckoning"" where American values are being tested. She also cast Trump as a racist candidate who can't handle the power of the Oval Office.Clinton also argues in the ad that people on Election Day will reject a campaign ""defined by fear and division"" -- a  clear reference to Trump -- and choose one that is ""hopeful and inclusive.""""Our core values are being tested in this election. But everywhere I go, people are refusing to be defined by fear and division,"" she says.Clinton closes the ad by saying that she approves this message for ""one last time.""""So tonight, I'm asking for your vote. And tomorrow, let's make history together,"" the Democratic nominee says to close the spot."	Clinton closes campaign with straight to camera 2-minute ad

""Tomorrow night, this election will end,"" Clinton said, prompting her supporters yell out: ""Today!"" ""But our work together will be just beginning,"" she said.Clinton, Trump in final sprint to finish lineTo Clinton's left, supporters held up letters to spell out: ""MAKE HISTORY."" Behind her, her husband and former president looked on with obvious pride, more than once clasping his hands in front of his face as though he were in awe of the woman before him.  ""I want you to know and I want you to spread he word: I want to be president for all Americans. Not just some,"" Clinton said. ""None of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more.""A grandmother to Chelsea's two young kids, Clinton concluded her final campaign speech by describing what is at stake on Election Day for parents and grandparents. ""When your kids or grandkids ask what you did in 2016,"" she said, ""you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America. An America where we build bridges, not walls. Where we prove, conclusively, that yes: Love trumps hate.""With those words, Clinton concluded her second presidential campaign. Her day had begun with a first rally in Pittsburgh, where Clinton pleaded with Americans to reject Donald Trump's ""pessimistic"" worldview. She also asked the country to look ahead to the work that needs to be done after Election Day. ""Tomorrow is the election, but that is just the beginning,"" Clinton said. ""We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, to listen and respect each other.""The former secretary of state and her campaign have been intently focused on get-out-the-vote and early voting efforts over the last few weeks, urging Americans to resist the temptation to stay home and vote before November 8 if they can. All day Monday, Clinton stressed the importance of heading to the ballot box Tuesday for those who have not yet voted. With a renewed sense of urgency, Clinton said in Pittsburgh that voting on Tuesday is a ""vote for yourself, vote for your family, vote for your futures.""And as she has been doing throughout the general election, Clinton sought to paint a stark contrast between her candidacy and Trump's. Donald Trump reflects on his bid: 'It's been some campaign'""We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America,"" she said. ""Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. Our core values are being tested in this election.""Clinton even urged voters that confront long lines on Election Day: ""Please wait.""""In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours,"" she said. ""And there have been reporters and others going up and down the line asking people, all kinds of Americans, not one type, all types, 'Why are you here?' 'Because my future depends on it,' they say.""Several hours later, campaigning in Allendale, Michigan, just outside of Grand Rapids, Clinton stressed that the support she has received from Republicans across the aisle signals ""why this election is so different.""""It's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me,"" Clinton said, adding that some Republicans ""have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party.""""Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party,"" she said. Once again painting Trump's vision as ""pessimistic"" and dark, the Democratic nominee said she simply doesn't see the country through her opponent's lens. ""People look at us with yearning,"" Clinton said. ""We are already great, but we can be greater. And we will be greater.""At her final rally, Clinton evoked Bon Jovi's famous single, ""Livin' On a Prayer,"" to concede that there was not much more she could do. ""Between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be livin' on a prayer!"" she said. "	Hillary Clinton's last campaign speech: 'Love trumps hate'

So this is really a reflection of the voting calendar,"" he added.But Mook said Saturday that the campaign is taking tightening polls in the Midwest ""seriously.""Clinton will campaign in Grand Rapids, while President Barack Obama will rally supporters in Ann Arbor on Monday, as a recently released Detroit Free Press poll found that Clinton is up 4 percentage points in Michigan, 42% to Trump's 38%.The Republican presidential nominee is also spending time in Michigan Monday, where he is set to hold a late-night rally in Grand Rapids.Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway predicted Monday that Trump will win Michigan, and told, ""Good Morning America"" that that campaign feels ""really good"" about the latest polling in upper Midwest states.On Monday Clinton is set to campaign in Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina, while vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine will hold events in North Carolina and Virginia.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will rally supporters in Las Vegas Monday afternoon and Al Gore will campaign in Colorado, where the latest polls show that the Democratic nominee is running neck-and-neck with Trump."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/democrats-republican-poll-watching-lawsuits/index.html	"The ruling is a win for the Trump campaign and the GOP state parties, which have successfully fended off several pre-emptive lawsuits filed by Democrats across the country that accuse Trump and Republicans of ""conspiring to threaten and intimidate minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election.""Democrats are seeking temporary restraining orders against the Trump campaign and Republicans, as they raise the alarm of possible voter intimidation due to comments from the GOP nominee and others.But while judges have at times been sympathetic, Democrats have now faltered in each case where a hearing has been held: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Arizona. Monday, a federal judge rejected a request for a restraining order in Pennsylvania. A hearing was also held in a separate lawsuit in North Carolina.   Steve Vladeck, a CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas Law School, said the lawsuits show how concerns about what happens at polling places are changing, but that could mean courts aren't ready to jump in quite yet.""Last-minute litigation isn't unusual in election years, but those cases are invariably about the mechanics of voting,"" Vladeck said.""These cases, in contrast, present questions about ballot suppression by private actors that are, at least in contemporary times, novel. So I think some of what we're seeing from the courts is reluctance to move too quickly on these claims, as opposed to more conventional election-related litigation,"" Vladeck added.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who had been under fire for comments last summer criticizing Trump, was the only justice to write separately. She made a point of saying that she voted to deny the Democrats' request because the laws in Ohio already forbid voter intimidation. After her comments last summer, there were some who argued that if the Supreme Court were to ever hear Trump v. Clinton type case after the election  she would have to recuse herself. Although the final vote count may never be known, Ginsburg's statement also highlights that the eight-member court was not deadlocked in a case presented to it a day before the election.By and large the rulings have been victories for the Trump campaign but experts say that the Democrats have managed to bring the issue to the forefront -- and put it before judges in case something changes on Election Day.""Although the Democrats did not prevail in these cases, they did at least force the Republican Party to state, for the record, that they will not engage in voter intimidation,"" said Joshua A. Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky College of Law. ""That by itself is important, as it means that the Republican Party is on record saying they will comply with all state voting laws.""The challenges from the Democrats share much of the same language, charging that Republican state parties, the Trump campaign and Roger Stone, who runs an organization called ""Stop the Steal,"" are in violation of the Voting Rights Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.In Arizona and Nevada, the judges declined to issue injunctions against the Republicans.Unhappy judge in PennsylvaniaOf the various opinions from judges, the one issued Monday by US District Judge Paul S. Diamond, a George W. Bush appointee, was the most critical of the Democrats' argument.Diamond said the Democrats' ""belated, inflammatory allegations appear intended to generate only heat, not light. Presumably, that is why identical  efforts have so far been rejected by the Arizona and Nevada District Courts and the 6th Circuit.""Diamond called the Democrats' late filing a ""mad scramble"" and said their ""heated suggestion"" of voter intimidation ""does not even rise to the level of speculation."" ""Plaintiff has not shown that any Defendant has engaged or will engage in voter intimidation in this District,"" he wrote.Path of the Ohio caseA district court judge in Ohio ruled against the Trump campaign and issued an injunction on Friday. In a broad ruling, Judge James Gwin of the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio mostly sided with Democrats against Trump. He issued an order restricting both campaigns of ""interrogating, admonishing, interfering with, or verbally harassing voters"" and also banned parties from ""gathering or loitering"" at polling places and ""taking photos"" of voters in and around the voting place.""Chad A. Readler, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, filed an emergency motion with the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals lambasting the lower court's order charging that if left to stand it would ""irreparably"" harm the campaign ""as well as any unsuspecting citizen who falls in the district court's cross-hairs.""  ""Intimidating voters is illegal, and the campaign does not remotely condone such conduct,"" Readler wrote.On Sunday, a three-judge panel of appellate judges lifted the order, giving another victory to the Trump campaign. The court said the Democrats had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success. A full panel of judges on the court declined to hear an appeal. Sunday night, Democrats filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court asking justices to vacate the order from the 6th Circuit.""Over the past several months, Donald J. Trump has warned that the 2016 election will be stolen from him unless supporters in Ohio and elsewhere swarm urban communities and ""watch,"" ""(a)nd when (I) say 'watch,' you know what I'm talking about, right?"" Marc Elias, a lawyer for the Democrats argued in briefs with the high court. ""Trump has said ""(t)he only way we can lose . . . and I really mean this . . . is if cheating goes on."" Elias, also argued that a three judge panel of the federal appeals court ruled even before the Democrats were through filing their briefs. ""The 6th Circuit ordered the stay notwithstanding that it did not call for or receive a substantive response brief from Applicant and, by its own admission, had not yet reviewed the critical evidence on which the District Court relied,"" he wrote.

But the language was so bad,"" Trump said Monday during his first of five rallies the day before Election Day.Trump's apparent criticism of rap and hip-hop comes in spite of the GOP nominee's repeated attempts to appeal to African-American voters during the final months of his campaign. It also comes as Clinton has ramped up get out the vote efforts in recent days by targeting young and African-American voters in particular.Still, Trump insisted that African-American voters are turning out in droves for him, an assessment contradicted by polls that show Trump with low single-digit support among black voters. And Trump also sought to once again undercut Clinton's support among the demographic by raising the former first lady's use of the term ""super predators"" to describe criminals in the inner city.""African-Americans are turning out -- and when they do a lot of them are voting for Trump,"" he said. ""She's got not a lot of inspiration. She used the term called 'super predator' to define black youth. 'Super predator.'""Trump's criticism of hip-hop follows his repeated and awkward appeals to African-Americans that many have criticized as tone deaf and offensive as he has described the lives of African Americans in starkly bleak and broad-brushed terms.""African-Americans are living in hell and are living -- in, in the inner cities, I mean, they're living in hell. You walk to the store for a loaf of bread, you get shot,"" Trump said during a rally in Sanford, Florida, last month, repeating a line he has frequently used to describe crime rates in black communities.Trump has also described inner cities as worse than war zones and equated the lives of minorities living in inner cities with members of those communities at large, even though a majority of African-Americans do not live in poverty."

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/nato-cyber-centre-international-law/index.html	"Inside, the building is cutting-edge high-tech. These military officers, lawyers and cyber techies are part of NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, carrying out research, training and exercises. One of their biggest challenges: When it comes to cyber -- so far -- there is no agreed-upon international law of war.""The international community is extraordinarily interested in this,"" said Michael N. Schmitt, chairman of the US Naval War College's international law department. ""They're struggling with questions like, when the Russians hack into the DNC database and then release it, is that a violation of international law? What doors does that open with respect to our responses?""Three years ago, Schmitt and his team at the NATO Cyber Centre wrote the book -- literally -- on international law and the use of cyber in warfare, the ""Tallinn Manual."" Applying principles of the international law of war, they provided answers to questions like: ""In war, how can you use cyber and how can you not use it? If you operate against civilians, is that prohibited?""They're now completing the ""Tallinn Manual 2.0,"" examining how international law applies to cyber attacks that don't cross the line into armed conflict by one state against another or by a terrorist group that kills civilians -- what's called ""below the threshold"" operations. RELATED: No, the presidential election can't be hacked The DNC hacks and the release of emails are ""below the threshold"" operations and, although Russia denies it did the hacking, the US government has been extraordinarily clear in accusing Moscow, citing 17 US government agencies that have concluded Russia was behind it.  ""This, in my opinion, has reached a specific threshold in the audacity and impact of the attack,"" said the Cyber Defence Centre's Strategy Branch Chief Matthijs Veenendaal, a Dutch citizen. ""This is still very much an attack on civilian infrastructure and government infrastructures and not an armed attack.""If that's the case, did Russia violate international law?Schmitt has no doubt. ""In my mind, it is crystal clear that the Russians have violated international law in this particular case.""But here is where it gets less clear: Schmitt and other experts say Russia and cyber-savvy countries like China are ""playing the margins.""""They're operating within the space where there is some degree of uncertainty,"" he explained. If Russia had destroyed America's cyber infrastructure, that would be a use of force and hence a violation. If Russia is simply engaging in low-level espionage, that's a violation of domestic US law, but probably not a violation of international law. Schmitt, however, called the DNC hack a ""prohibited intervention into the internal affairs of the United States,"" affairs that include running elections, and that means it is a violation of international law.It may also be a violation of US sovereignty, he said. If Russia is simply ""exfiltrating"" data, or stealing it but not doing anything with it, that's not a violation, but if there is proof it is using data and manipulating election results, that would be a violation. As Schmitt sees it, the DNC hacks are not a game-changer, but a major disruption of the US economy would be. ""My personal view is that would constitute moving over the threshold and allow us to take off the gloves."" ""But,"" he added, ""that view is not universally held."" Vice President Joe Biden has indicated the US will retaliate against the hack of the DNC and other Democratic Party entities, warning that the administration will be ""sending a message"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin, he said, ""will know it, and it will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact."" But under international law, does President Barack Obama have the legal right to retaliate?Schmitt of the Naval War College maintains that Obama ""unambiguously"" does have the right to respond, but Schmitt would not use the term ""retaliate."" ""In international law, we don't do tit for tat,"" he said. ""What we may do is engage in what is called -- and this is a legal term -- 'counter measures.' ""Counter-measures are operations that would otherwise be unlawful but can be used if the purpose is to stop another state from violating the law.So the US could hack back against the Russians? The answer is yes, Schmitt said, as long as Washington reasonably believes Moscow is going to continue to hack it. Counter-measures don't have to be cyber-related. The US, for example, could prevent Russian ships from transiting its territorial waters until Russia stops its cyber breaches. The response, however, must be ""proportionate."" Shutting down a Russian electric grid would only be permissible if it didn't cause more harm to Russia than its hacking caused the US -- a tricky thing to measure. RELATED: Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable conflict As the US considers itself a law-abiding country, it most often tries to follow accepted international law of war principles. It could, however, ignore those internationally accepted principles or interpret them in its favor.""I know some in America have called for that (retaliation), and I can see where the urge comes from, because you want Russia to stop it,"" said the Cyber Defence Centre's Veenendaal, but going on a path of escalation with the Russians is a ""recipe for disaster.""""Responding to an escalation with your own escalation will lead to further escalation, which -- in cyber space -- is extremely hard to contain and monitor, especially for Western democracies,"" he warned.The cyber world presents unique challenges, like the ability for actors to maintain ""plausible deniability,"" which makes it devilishly hard to define who is behind an attack. ""You can always just plausibly state that this was just a 19-year-old hacker working in someone's basement in Belarus,"" said Kadri Kaska, an Estonian researcher at the NATO center. Pointing the finger at the perpetrators -- ""attribution"" -- also is not that simple. If an intelligence agency says it knows who did it, it could be challenged to reveal sources and methods of how it collects intelligence data.""Probably in the (US) National Security Agency there are a lot of discussions ongoing, like, 'How far should we go in publicly attributing these attacks to these guys in St. Petersburg? We know who their girlfriends are, we know who they talk to. We're deep in their systems, we're deep in any Russian system you can think of. And we want to stay there,' "" according to Veenendaal.The US has responded to hacks by China by ""naming and shaming"" specific officials in the Chinese military whom it holds responsible for attacks, then entering discussions with Beijing to deter further economic espionage. ""But against the Russians,"" he said, ""no, we haven't been effective."" Veenendaal and other cyber experts say the Chinese, in an effort not to jeopardize their economic relations with the US, have quietly pulled back some of their hacking. With Russia, however, there is little economic incentive.In July, NATO included cyber as a domain of its military operations, along with land, sea, air and space. That means if there is an armed attack through cyberspace, NATO members can call on their allies for collective defense.But intrusions, like the DNC hacks, that fall short of armed attacks still lie in a gray zone, exploited by nations clever enough not to cross the line that would trigger an armed response. They are the cyber equivalent of the ""little green men"" that Russia used in Crimea: Russian armed forces without insignia whose existence Putin, at first, denied.The West, so far, has no common strategy to deter ""little green hackers."" The DNC hacks may be their first major operation against the US, but they almost surely won't be their last. "	NATO cyberwar challenge: Establish rules of engagement

In each dinner party or get-together, US politics is the only subject we talk about,'' he told CNN by email.His students, aged between 13 and 15, are no exception.''No matter who the next president is, I hope they have good plans for the future of our country and the world,'' 14-year-old Hasan Latch told CNN in a video filmed on his classmate's phone.Echoing the regime catchall designation of the rebels as terrorists, Hassiba Nizameddin, 14, told CNN in a video message that Syria has been ""suffering from terrorism for almost six years.''I would support the candidate that gives us hope in ending this war.''Ashley Youssef, also 14, said she's following the campaign because she has relatives in the US.''I wouldn't like to see anything bad happen to them or their country,'' she said in a video filmed by her classmate Asma Sukkar.""I'm also afraid that Syrians will have more difficulties traveling to America. The elections are very important to me, because they could affect my country as well, especially its security. The way we live in Syria depends on the new US president.''Debates Asma, who recently returned to Damascus after four years in Canada and Lebanon, says she enjoys learning about politics and listening to the candidates' answers in the debates.Her 72-year-old teacher watched all the presidential debates, which started at 4 a.m. in Damascus, and has already cast his absentee ballot in the battleground state of Ohio where he is legally resident.""So many people said it was the lesser of two evils. I didn't feel that was the case,'' Webber told CNN in a video message.""I looked at the candidate that gave us the most experience, and especially the experience on an international basis. And that was definitely Hillary Clinton.''Trump saying he would contest a Clinton win is ""anti-American,"" Webber adds. Trump support Some of his students, however, admire the Republican candidate.Speaking in a class discussion filmed and shared with CNN, 14-year old Carmen Nahat said that if she had a vote, she'd choose Donald Trump.''I like the way he speaks, he speaks with enthusiasm,'' she said, while another classmate thought Trump would be better for Syria.A non-American's guide to US electionTeddy Batal, 13, and 14-year old Jude Dirawi told the class Clinton would get their vote because of her experience. They felt the election of the first female American president would show that there is ''no difference between men and women.'' ''But it doesn't mean we don't like Trump,'' they added. ''We just think Clinton is better.''Dirawi told CNN he hopes whoever wins will ''bring back security all over the world, and especially in America.''But not everyone was so enthusiastic.Referencing Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the US, 14-year-old Dani Abouharb felt ''any candidate who has a lot of racism against Muslims and Arabs is not a good choice for Syria.''Being Muslim American in the year of Donald TrumpThe teenagers at the private Lycee Charles de Gaulle are the children of the Syrian capital's professional classes and high earners.Webber says most parents are successful business people, while others are part of the cultural elite.Elsewhere in Syria ...The students' expensive, uninterrupted education highlights the deep division in Syria after a grinding war that has left more than 250,000 people dead and millions more displaced inside and outside Syria's borders.Millions of children and teenagers are experiencing the war very differently depending on which part of the country they live in.The United Nations and other international organizations speak of a ''lost generation'' of young Syrians growing up under the constant threat of regime airstrikes, in refugee camps or working instead of going to school.But those growing up in the relatively stable government-controlled parts of Syria are experiencing some semblance of a normal childhood, although many also have to contend with regular rebel attacks.Little boy in Aleppo a vivid reminder of war's horrorThe United Nations estimates that 60% of the population in Syria live in areas controlled by the government.''We're just like everyone else,'' Asma Sukkar and her classmate Hassiba Nizameddin told CNN by video.''We don't live in ashes like people think. We have houses, we have roofs. We eat, study, sleep. We listen to music, watch TV, just like the rest of the world. Syrians are not different.''For Webber, there is no contradiction between living and working in government-held Damascus and voting for a candidate who has been very critical of Syrian President Bashar al Assad and who advocates a no-fly zone in parts of the country.''She's talking hawkish but she's a dove inside,'' he told CNN, speaking by phone from Damascus.''It's not going to be her decision alone to do anything major in Syria, her activities will be controlled and influenced by the House, the Senate, her Secretary of State.'''I'm very proud that I made my vote in this very important election.

He added: ""And they're far greater than what you have been told. You have been told numbers because they didn't want to do it before the election. I worked very hard to force those numbers out.""Seriously?Trump is, no doubt, basing this assertion on statements he made at campaign events in which he, correctly, predicted that Obamacare premiums would show a dramatic increase.""On November 1, just before the election on November 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60% increases,"" he said at a September 16 campaign rally in Miami. ""They want to delay it until after the election because it's ... a disaster.""""The big increase is now going to come on November 1st,"" he told a crowd in Ft. Lauderdale on August 10. ""And they're trying to delay it 'till after the election because it is catastrophic.""The premium rates were released just before open enrollment started, just like they were last year. And this year they were, indeed, jaw-dropping in many states. But the date for their release was published in the Federal Register on March 8, 2016. There was a 30-day comment period, meaning the rules governing the date went into effect in early April.In order for the Obama administration to change the date, it would have had to propose new regulations, a complex process that stakeholders such as state regulators, insurance companies, investors and interest groups probably would have gotten wind of  -- and leaked to the news media.Trump has produced no evidence that the administration was moving in this direction, and therefore, has produced no evidence that he stopped it."
