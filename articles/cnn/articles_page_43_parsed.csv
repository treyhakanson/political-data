We'll keep you updated as results come in:GunsThe gun debate usually focuses on the federal government, where Congress has rejected any and all measures related to gun control and where President Barack Obama has issued a series of controversial executive orders. But there was plenty of movement on the issue at the state level. California's Proposition 63 would put in place a raft of gun control rules, including a background check system for purchasing ammunition. CNN projects voters have approved Proposition 63, which also bans the possession of large-capacity magazines. Maine's Question 3 addresses background checks for purchasing or transferring firearms. CNN projects Maine voted against requiring background checks for sales by non-licensed dealers.Nevada's Question 1 would make it so people can't sell or transfer firearms to one another without a licensed dealer conducting a federal background check. Voters narrowly approved the proposal, according to unofficial tallies from the Nevada secretary of state. Washington's Initiative No. 1491 would allow courts to issue temporary orders at the request of police, family or household members to prevent people ""exhibiting mental illness, violent or other behavior indicating they may harm themselves or others"" from having access to guns. CNN projects Washington supported court-ordered temporary bans on firearms.Minimum WageRaising the minimum wage has become a focal point for progressives in the United States. The ""fight for 15"" has taken hold. Although these states don't have $15 minimum wages on their ballots, voters supported raising rates by the year 2020.Arizona's Proposition 206: The minimum hourly wage will go from its current $8.05 to $12 by 2020, and employees will get paid sick time. CNN projects voters have approved the proposition.Colorado's Amendment 70: This would raise Colorado's minimum wage to $9.30 as of January 1, 2017, and gradually raise it to $12 per hour as of January 2020. CNN projects the amendment has passed. Maine's Question 4: Proposes raising the minimum wage from $7.50 to $12 by 2020 and ties it to the cost of living from then on. CNN projects voters have backed raising the minimum wage.Washington's Initiative 1433: The minimum wage increases to $13.50 by 2020. The initiative has been passed, according to CNN projections.Read more: 4 states will vote on raising minimum wagePotFollowing in the footsteps of Colorado, Oregon and Washington, more states are looking to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Other states are looking to approve it for medical purposes. Read more: Marijuana on the ballotArizona's Proposition 205 would create the Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control and allow for the recreational use of marijuana for people 21 and older.Arkansas' Ballot Issues 6 and 7: Both of these issues would allow for medical marijuana in the state. Issue 6 is an amendment to the state's constitution and Issue 7 is the passage of an act. An amendment is far more difficult to reverse, whereas the state Legislature could dismantle the Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act should it choose to do so. The Arkansas secretary of state released a notice saying votes for Issue 7 will not be counted or certified because of a court order, while voters approved Issue 6California's Proposition 64 would make recreational marijuana legal for those 21 and older. House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi backed the measure, which voters approved, according to CNN projections. Florida's Proposed Constitutional Amendment No. 2 allows the use of medical marijuana for ""debilitating"" conditions. Voters approved the measure, according to unofficial Florida secretary of state counts. Maine's Question 1 makes marijuana legal for people 21 and older, with the product subject to state regulation.Massachusetts' Question 4 allows for recreational use of pot for people 21 and older. CNN projects voters approved the measure, which would also legalize the distribution and cultivation of marijuana for those 21 and older. Montana's Initiative 182 legalizes marijuana for medical purposes as prescribed by a physician. Voters approved the measure, according to unofficial Montana secretary of state counts. Nevada's Question 2 allows for the recreational use of pot for people 21 and older. It would also establish a 15% excise tax on wholesale marijuana sales and apply the existing sales tax to retail marijuana sales. Net revenue would go towards education. CNN projects voters approved the measure.North Dakota's Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5 legalizes the use of medical marijuana. Voters passed this measure, according to unofficial results on the North Dakota secretary of state's office website. Death penaltyOnce banned, then brought back, the death penalty now exists in a piecemeal fashion with executions a reality or a thing of the past, depending on the state. More recently, states have had difficulty imposing the penalty simply because they cannot obtain the drugs required to kill a person by lethal injection. Here's the action on this issue:California's Proposition 62 repeals the death penalty, while Proposition 66 changes rules around the legal system regarding the death penalty, with the intent of speeding up the time line from conviction to execution. The ""no"" votes had a significant lead on the issue of repealing the death penalty with all but a handful of votes left to count, according to unofficial tallies on the secretary of state website. Nebraska's Referendum No. 426 allows voters decide whether to ""retain"" or ""repeal"" an act passed by the Nebraska Legislature last year eliminating the death penalty. A vote to ""retain"" is a vote against the death penalty; a vote to ""repeal"" is a vote for the death penalty. Gov. Pete Ricketts personally invested money in the ""repeal"" campaign, and voters sided with him. Unofficial results from the Nebraska secretary of state's office showed 60% support for repeal and 39% for retain.Oklahoma's State Question No. 776 increases the state's options for execution to potentially any method ""not prohibited"" by the US Constitution. Given the difficulty states are having securing lethal drugs, Oklahoma is trying to expand its options for execution. According to the state's election board, vote totals show the measure to increase execution options passed. Health careProgressives are spearheading major initiatives in health care, pitting their organizing power against, principally, the pharmaceutical industry.California's Proposition 61 would require that state agencies, when purchasing prescription drugs, pay no more than ""the lowest price paid for the same drug by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs."" There's a lot going on with this proposition, but one thing to keep in mind is that it could represent the extent to which Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' ""political revolution"" has influence. Sanders personally supports this measure and has gone to California on its behalf. If it passes, it is a loss for the pharmaceutical industry. Unofficials totals from the secretary of state's officeColorado's Amendment 69 establishes a state-run health care system, dubbed ""Coloradocare."" Approval of Coloradocare would amount to a major transformation for Colorado state government. Voters opted against the measure in a landslide, according to the Colorado secretary of state's office's unofficial results. Additionally, Colorado's Proposition 106 would allow ""any mentally capable adult Colorado resident"" who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness to gain access to drugs to end his or her life. CNN projects Colorado has voted to allow physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill.Campaign financeLegal challenges at all levels, new machinations from lawyers and the composition of the Federal Election Commission have all combined to allow more money in our political process. With this being seen as increased free speech to some and in-kind corruption to others, a few states are looking at creating their own campaign finance rules.Missouri's Constitutional Amendment 2 would, among other things, ""establish limits on campaign contributions"" for state and judicial candidates. Should this pass, Missouri would be offering a wholly different model from federal campaigns. On the federal level, the US Supreme Court has repeatedly thrown out limits on campaign contributions. Voters passed this amendment, according to unofficial results posted by the Missouri secretary of state's office. South Dakota's Initiated Measure 22 would create the option for a publicly funded campaign finance program. This measure passed, according to unofficial results from the South Dakota secretary of state's office.Washington's Initiatives 735 and 1464 are both campaign finance measures. 735 tells the legislature to propose an amendment to the US Constitution declaring that corporations do not have constitutional rights and that free speech ""excludes the spending of money."" 1464 would create a public financing system for campaigns. Initiative 735 passed while 1464 did not pass, according to results posted by the Washington secretary of state office. CigarettesThe price per pack could go up a bit in several states should ballot measures pass. The tax increases on tobacco products could discourage people from smoking and increase state revenues by taxing those who do light up.California's Proposition 56 would raise taxes on cigarettes by $2 a pack. The measure says the revenues would exceed $1 billion in 2017-2018 and go to health care and tobacco control programs. With the majority of the votes counted, yes votes had a lead of more than 20 percent, according to the secretary of state's unofficial tally. Colorado's Proposed Initiative 143, aka Amendment 72, would raise taxes on cigarettes by $1.75 a pack. The measure says the revenues would go to health care and tobacco control programs. Voters said no thank you to the new tax, according to unofficial results on the secretary of state's website. Missouri's Constitutional Amendment No. 3 would raise taxes on cigarettes by 2020 by 60 cents per pack and on tobacco wholesalers by 67 cents per pack. The revenues would go into a fund for child education and health. The proposed amendment was not approved, according to the unofficial results from the Missouri secretary of state's office. North Dakota's Initiated Statutory Measure No. 4 would raise taxes on cigarettes to $2.20 a pack. The money would go to the state, a veterans' fund and a community health fund. Voters did not approve the measure, the North Dakota secretary of state's website reports, citing unofficial tallies. Other ballot measures of noteAlabama budget: Amendment 14 is an attempt to avoid a potentially huge issue for Alabama at all levels of government. The gist of it is that voters passed an amendment decades ago that requires the Legislature to vote on its budget before everything else. The Legislature has gotten around that by first voting on a resolution to bypass the rule and vote on other things before the budget. Many of these votes have passed with only a handful of legislators agreeing to bypass the budget rule. This has gone on for a long time and potentially hundreds of laws have been passed this way. Jump to current-day Alabama, where a judge ruled one of these laws was invalid. Passing the amendment would mean the judge's ruling no longer stands, things continue as they are and all of the local rules stay in place. Failure to pass the amendment could bring about the end of all these rules built over decades and force the Legislature to focus first on its budget. Alabamans overwhelmingly approved the amendment, however, according to the secretary of state's unofficial results. Leaving Arkansas: Currently, when the governor of Arkansas goes to another state or country, he or she is no longer effectively the governor, and the lieutenant governor assumes authority. If Arkansas' Ballot Issue No. 2 passes, the governor stays fully in power even when he or she is outside the state. The existing rule was written well before modern communications technology. Voters OK'd the ballot issue, according to the secretary of state's website. Criminal justice in California and Oklahoma: California's Proposition 57 could make it easier for ""nonviolent"" offenders to get out early on parole. Oklahoma's State Question No. 780 would lessen some property and drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. California's proposition seems destined for passage, according to near-complete unofficial results from the secretary of state, and Oklahoma's measure passed, according to the state elections board's unofficial resultsDC statehood: The nation's capital has long pushed to become its own state, and 2016 will be no different. Advisory Referendum B expresses the will of voters of DC for the city council to petition Congress to make DC its own state, called ""the State of New Columbia."" Unofficial results from the DC Board of Elections show DC voted in favor of the statehood measure. Georgia's failing schools: Amendment 1 would allow the state's General Assembly to take over a failing school district via the creation of an ""Opportunity School District."" The proposal, backed by Gov. Nathan Deal, has been the subject of much debate following years of clashes between failing local schools and state and county governments. Deal managed to make matters harder for his side when he said Amendment 1 would help ""colored people,"" a comment he later called a misstatement. Voters did not pass the amendment, according to unofficial results from the Georgia secretary of state's officeRight to hunt in Indiana and Kansas: The only public question on the ballot in both Indiana and Kansas would amend each state's constitution to provide a constitutional right to ""hunt, fish and harvest wildlife."" Both constitutional amendments enjoyed robust support, according to unofficial tallies from the Indiana and KansasVoting reform in Maine: Maine's Question 5 establishes a new voting system allowing people to ""rank their choices."" This state has a large number of independent political candidates, and this rule could make things easier for those who wish to vote outside of the Democratic and Republican parties.Big business in Oregon: Oregon's Measure 97 increases taxes on businesses when ""sales exceed $25 million.""Organize (or not) in South Dakota and Virginia: South Dakota's Initiated Measure 23 allows unions to charge nonmembers fees. South Dakota is currently a right-to-work state, and this rule would strengthen labor unions there. Virginia's Question 1 would create a constitutional amendment banning union-only workplaces. Virginia is already a right-to-work state, so this measure would codify right-to-work into the state constitution, making it harder to repeal in the future. South Dakota voters overwhelmingly shot down the measure, according to unofficial results from the South Dakota secretary of state's office. Virginia voters also rejected the measure, with more than 99% of the vote counted, according to the Virginia Department of Elections'Green Washington: Washington state's Initiated Measure No. 732 creates a carbon emission tax, while its Advisory Vote No. 15 allows voters to repeal or maintain a tax exemption for alternative-fuel vehicles. Voters nixed the proposal for a carbon emissions tax, and they voted to repeal the tax exemptionSoda taxes: Beyond the states, voters in four cities -- San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, California, along with Boulder, Colorado -- approved a so-called ""soda tax"" on sugar-sweetened drinks.The three Northern California cities approved the soda tax by wide margins, according to unofficial results on their city"	Ballot measures 2016: California votes to legalize pot	['Ricketts', 'Obama', 'Pelosi', 'Deal', 'Sanders']	['creation', 'guns']

This time, he directed throngs of attendees from the free concert he headlined in Grant Park to an early voting center nearby. Participants shared pictures and videos of the effort on Twitter: Several hundred people attended the free concert in Grant Part's Petrillo Music Shell, ABC 7 reported, after which organizers from the Black Youth Project led crowds to the early voting sites in the Chicago Loop, the city's downtown. According to CNN affiliate ABC 7 Chicago, Cook County officials reported that early voting numbers so far had broken 2008 records, registering a 24 percent increase from that year.

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/2016-election-demographics-white-voters/index.html	 Thirty-one percent of eligible voters will be racial or ethnic minorities, up from 29% in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center. And the share of non-Hispanic white voters eligible to vote will be the lowest in history, the continuation of a steady decline in white voters over the past three decades. It's a stark reminder of the shifting demographics of the country: The Census Bureau projects that no one racial group will be a majority of the country by the year 2044. Republicans and Democrats looking to chart an electoral future as the country continues to grow browner and younger will have to take heed of these shifts.CNN partnered with the Kaiser Family Foundation this year to look more specifically at the view of white, working class Americans. The Republican presidential nominee has carried white voters in every presidential election since 1968 by shifting margins. In the 1980 presidential election, white voters made up 88% of the electorate. That year, Ronald Reagan won 56% of non-Hispanic whites and captured the presidential election in a landslide. Four years later, against Walter Mondale, Reagan won them by 30 points, 66% to 34%. Since Reagan's time though, the white share of the electorate has declined by a few percentage points each presidential year. Fast forward to 2012. Mitt Romney won a slightly larger share of non-Hispanic white voters --59%-- than Reagan did in his first term -- but lost the presidential race. Why? The share of the white vote was smaller -- 72% -- and Obama crushed Romney with non-white voters.If trends hold, the 2016 share of the white vote will hit an all-time low Most estimates suggest the white vote this year will be around 69%, an all-time low and a three percentage point decline in four years. That difference is more pronounced in a number of states that both candidates are targeting, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and North Carolina. All have eligible voting populations that are slightly less white than four years ago.Why the white vote's shrinking One reason is because overall, the white population in the United States is growing older and the younger generations of Americans are increasingly diverse, fueled largely by the growth of the Latino population in the US. The pool of eligible voters follows along the same lines: According to an analysis by the Pew Research Center, non-Hispanic whites account for 76% of all eligible voters who died between 2012 and 2016. Racial and ethnic minorities account for 43% of the new eligible voters born in the US that turned 18. Will non-white voters turn out in 2016? As recently as 1996, white voters turned out at a higher rate than any other racial or ethnic group. But in 2012, the black voter turnout rate exceeded the white voter turnout rate, 66.2% to 64.1%. But not all ethnic groups vote at such levels. While white voter turnout has decreased, Latinos and Asians have historically lagged behind both black voters and white voters. In 2012, 48% of eligible Latinos and 48% of eligible Asian voters cast ballots.	Election 2016: The decline of the white voter	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]

""It's like predicting your wife's mood. You have no idea what you're going to get until you get home."" It was perhaps an unfortunate turn of phrase for an aide representing a candidate who has faced charges of sexism throughout the campaign. A host of liberal blogs and left-leaning journalists ridiculed the comment Monday. ""In fitting fashion, Donald Trump's campaign is ending on one last sexist note,"" wrote the liberal, millennial-focused website Mic.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/2016-election-viewers-guide/index.html	"The two candidates are making a last-minute dash across swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina as the 2016 presidential race enters its final hours. They've also gone north to Michigan and New Hampshire to states Democrats have won in recent cycles but could flip this year.Exit polls: Live updatesHere are the key states and signs to study as the night unfolds: Trump's must-winsMost plausible paths to victory for Trump start with holding onto two battlegrounds that Mitt Romney won four years ago -- North Carolina and Arizona -- and flipping three states President Barack Obama carried: Florida, Ohio and Iowa. A loss in any of the states would severely complicate Trump's already precarious path to 270 electoral votes. Though if Trump clawed back Pennsylvania or Michigan from the Democrats, who have won both electoral-rich states six times in a row, North Carolina would be more expendable. A win in a state like Pennsylvania or Michigan would allow Trump to offset a loss in North Carolina and still have a shot at reaching 270.If that doesn't happen, holding North Carolina and Arizona, while reclaiming Florida, Ohio and Iowa from the Democrats -- plus Maine's 2nd District -- would only get him to 260. Trump would need to tack on 10 more electoral votes somehow. New Hampshire's four and Nevada's six would get him there. Colorado, with nine electoral votes, Michigan with 15 and Pennsylvania with 20 are also possibilities. In his last 48 hours before Election Day, Trump has been pretty much everywhere, including Colorado, Michigan -- even Minnesota -- searching for the extra votes he needs.Clinton's must-winsThe key question for Clinton is whether her ""blue wall"" of Democratic-leaning states on the Great Lakes -- Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- will hold. Trump has targeted all three, but Clinton has consistently led polls in all three states. However, most voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania cast their ballots on Election Day -- which means her campaign hasn't built the early voting advantage already in place elsewhere. If Clinton can do that and pick up just one of North Carolina, Florida or Ohio, she's all but guaranteed to win. If she can't win one of those three states, she'll need to hold Virginia, vote-by-mail Colorado, New Hampshire and Nevada -- where Democrats have already built a hefty early voting edge. Does Latino turnout surge? If Clinton wins, her coalition will consist of women, college-educated voters and a swell of new Latino voters. In early voting in states like Nevada, and Florida, there's already evidence of burgeoning Latino turnout. This is best witnessed by the over 57,000 people who voted in Nevada Friday, with pictures of long lines and extended hours at a Latino grocery store in Clark County.Many first-time voters, polls show, are turning out to oppose Trump. And Democrats are bullish that Latinos have been under-polled through the entire 2016 election cycle. For Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, this is a ghost of elections past. After the 2012 race, the RNC warned that the party needed to do more to court Latino voters. A nominee who roundly rejected that advice could be the reason the party loses a third consecutive presidential race. Just as Trump's attacks on Mexican immigrants have alienated Latino voters, his attacks on women and allegations of sexual assault have helped Clinton to a large lead among female voters. Clinton's campaign has highlighted Trump's most derogatory remarks in TV ads aimed at moderate, suburban women -- a constituency that has helped Republican nominees in years past. If she succeeds, it would limit Trump's strengths to rural areas. Does Trump have a ""silent majority""? Trump's biggest strength is his overwhelming support from disaffected white voters -- particularly men, and especially those without college degrees. His campaign has long argued that those voters -- many of them independent or Democrats who buy into Trump's protectionist stance on trade -- will carry him on Election Day. For this to happen, Trump will also need core Democratic voters to stay at home, as well. Already, Trump appears poised to win Iowa, and has polled ahead of Clinton in Ohio. He's hoping to win enough blue-collar Democrats in Pennsylvania or Michigan to win at least one of those states. Michigan, in particular, emerged as a tempting target in the campaign's closing days -- a state hard-hit by the trade deals Trump bemoans. Clinton's campaign raced to play defense, dispatching the former secretary of state there, as well as President Barack Obama, for last-minute rallies. Do African-American voters show up? Among Democrats' biggest concerns has been whether African-American voters -- a reliably left-leaning constituency -- will turn out in numbers anywhere close to their support for Obama in 2008 and 2012. If the answer is no, it could hobble Clinton in key states -- particularly Florida and North Carolina. Obama is helping carry Clinton's load with black voters. In a call to Tom Joyner's radio show, he argued that participating in this election is just as much about him as it is about Clinton. ""And I know that there are a lot of people in barbershops and beauty salons, you know, in the neighborhoods who are saying to themselves 'We love Barack, we love -- we especially love Michelle -- and so, you know, it was exciting and now we're not excited as much,'"" he said. ""You know what? I need everybody to understand that everything we've done is dependent on me being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in.""The post-Trump GOP starts nowSince Trump clinched the GOP nomination in May, Republican Senate and House candidates have been forced to answer for everything he has said -- from his attacks on a Gold Star family and an Indiana-born judge's heritage to his rejection of conservative orthodoxy. As soon as the election ends, Capitol Hill Republicans -- especially if they retain control of both the House and Senate -- will regain power. The party will have to decide just what to do with Trump's rejection of free trade, his calls for a decreased US role overseas and his criticism of GOP congressional leaders -- whether he wins or loses. But adopting some of Trump's policy planks while rejecting his political style might not help much after an election driven by the candidates' personalities. How the loser handles losingFor a nation divided by a long, bitter contest, this could be the most important question of all: Will the loser concede -- and how will he or she do it? Trump and Clinton are both historically unpopular presidential nominees. Half the country thinks Clinton is a crook, and the other half thinks Trump is a racist and misogynist. And Trump, in particular, has cast the election as rigged -- calling into question whether ballots that are mailed in will be counted, playing up inaccurate reports of voter irregularities and claiming that voter fraud is pervasive.The loser will play a crucial role in legitimizing the victor -- or delegitimizing the winner from the outset.
