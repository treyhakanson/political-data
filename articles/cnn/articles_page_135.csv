Not at all.""What Pence did and why he won this debate was he refused to be distracted,"" Sessions said Wednesday morning on CNN's ""New Day."" ""He stayed on the key issues of the debate."" RELATED: 5 takeaways from the vice presidential debateSome observers suggested Pence, the Indiana governor, could have defended Trump more than he did at Tuesday night's debate. Time and time again, Pence was challenged by both his sparring partner, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, and the moderator, Elaine Quijano, to defend the real estate mogul's controversial comments and proposals. ""I can't imagine how Gov. Pence can defend the insult-driven, selfish 'me first' style of Donald Trump,"" Kaine said, after rattling off a host of Trump's controversies, including his past claims that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States.Pence responded by accusing the Democratic ticket of engaging in ""an insult-driven campaign"" before turning his focus to what he said were Clinton and Obama's foreign policy failures.RELATED: Pence goes further than Trump on Syria military actionSessions, the first US senator to endorse Trump, said on CNN that Pence and others are often asked to defend too much.""You have a question from the media or from Tim Kaine with 10 different charges in it,"" Sessions said, ""and there's no way the respondent can actually address each one.""

Kaine was referencing past remarks made by Trump last July when during his campaign announcement speech, Trump said some Mexicans are criminals and are ""rapists.""""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you,"" Trump said last June. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Trump also faced extensive criticism for his accusations that federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel was biased against him because he is ""Mexican"" -- even though Curiel was born in Indiana. The internet reaction to Pence's remark was swift: Soon after he made it, someone created a website, www.thatmexicanthing.org, and redirected it to the nonprofit Voto Latino Action Network, which promotes Latino voices in politics.Actress Kerry Washington tweeted after the presidential debate, ""THIS! #ThatMexicanThing YES!!!!!!!!!!!!"" in response to the website redirect.Other Latinos expressed disappointment with Pence's quip, firing back on Twitter about his comment during the debate.""Latino Twitter not happy w/ Pence. Pissed as hell w/ 'You whipped out that Mexican thing' comment. Metio la pata.

I said he's been stronger on the world stage.""In fact, Pence told CNN's Dana Bash in September: ""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country."" Trump has repeatedly praised Putin as well, saying at NBC's ""Commander-in-Chief Forum"" last month, Putin ""has very strong control over a country,"" even if he does not agree with the way the country is governed.""Now, it's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system,"" Trump said.

""I think the 70-plus interruptions from Sen. Kaine went to that and Sen. Kaine had a very tough time standing up and defending their ideas.""Collins also blamed Kaine for interrupting Pence repeatedly throughout the debate. ""When he kept yapping about Trump's taxes and then making up things that he took Donald Trump's words out of context, saying even at the end there that he wants to deport 16 million immigrants in the first 100 days,"" Collins said.Collins said Trump altered his ""rhetoric"" and he does not want a deportation force but wants to focus on deporting undocumented immigrants who break the law first. That is a specification that Trump had not originally made throughout much of the campaign.""His rhetoric has changed,"" Collins said. ""We never were going to deport 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants. We can process them in a way of making them legal.""""Donald Trump's going to deport the criminal element that Hillary and Tim Kaine and Barack Obama has not,"" he added.Camerota pointed out that Collins' accusation that Clinton wants open border is not true. ""When it comes to securing the borders Hillary and Tim Kaine are not going to change the fact that we have porous borders today. People surging in.

Tim Kaine dug in to defend their candidates -- often falling over each other to deliver a series of canned zingers and wild jabs.Here are 11 of their most cringe-inducing, flat one-liners:1. Pence flubs name of university ""Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates."" (The debate took place at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia).2. Pence on 'insult-driven' campaign""He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign?"" said Pence, running mate of Donald Trump, who during the debate retweeted insults of Kaine.3. Kaine struggles with predictable jab""You are Donald Trump's apprentice,"" Kaine said clumsily, referencing the television show Trump once starred in.4. He tried again""Do you want a 'you're hired' president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a 'you're fired' president in Donald Trump?"" he asked.5. Pence on Trump's taxesPence defended his running mate's reported tax return showing $916 million loss in 1995, saying: ""His tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly.""6. Pence's recycled line""There they go again,"" he said, ripping off a famous debate line from Ronald Reagan in 1980.7. Pence's very specific number of economistsPence: ""305 economists said your plan is bad for the economy.""8. Kaine muddles his Miss Universe line ""Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot,"" he said.9. Pence's topographical assessment of Clinton economic plan""We're going to be in a mountain range of debt (if Clinton wins),"" he said.10. Kaine's canned line on Trump's 'Mount Rushmore' of dictators""He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi ... (Pence interrupts) ... and Saddam Hussein,"" he said.11. Pence responds to a question about homegrown terror ... by talking about immigration""Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people,"" he said"	Tim Kaine vs. Mike Pence: The most memorable lines

He's getting tremendous reviews from me and everybody,"" Trump said.Trump's praise follows reports that Trump was upset about Pence repeatedly dodging opportunities to defend him during the debate.""The media is saying Pence won, but didn't really defend Trump. That isn't sitting well with the boss,"" a senior Trump campaign aide told CNN late Tuesday.Pence repeatedly denied that Trump had made certain controversial comments or simply shrugged them off when vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine raised direct quotes Trump has made.And a longtime friend of Trump's who spoke with the billionaire after his widely criticized debate performance last week said ""what I worry about is him hearing Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence are better debaters than him. That isn't what he likes to hear.""Pence, for his part, dismissed reports that he had overshadowed Trump with his strong showing at the debate in an interview Wednesday with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.""Donald Trump called me right after the debate to congratulate me and we actually talked a couple times last night,"" Pence said. ""I'm very encouraged that some people think I won, but really I'm just telling you ... from where I sat Donald Trump won. He really did.""The Republican presidential nominee on Wednesday used Pence's strong showing in the vice presidential debate as an opportunity to slam Clinton's record -- which Trump said Pence effectively criticized during Tuesday night's VP showdown.Trump argued that Clinton's policies have ""unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria, Libya and put Iran onto the path of nuclear weapons."" ""In less than 10 years now they will have nuclear weapons,"" Trump said of Iran, despite the fact that Iran's nuclear enrichment program is effectively frozen for the next 10 to 15 years, with additional restrictions remaining after that period of time.Trump also slammed President Barack Obama's signature health care law and argued that the President should apologize for enacting the controversial legislation, which Republicans have repeatedly sought to repeal and which even the White House has conceded needs additional reforms to improve.""I think that President Obama should apologize for Obamacare. And I think that Hillary Clinton should apologize for pursuing Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse than it is right now,"" Trump said.5 takeaways from the vice presidential debateAnd stumping in Nevada, which is home to the highest number of undocumented immigrants per capita, Trump also hammered his hardline immigration policies, vowing to build a wall on the US's southern border and tackle crime committed by those who have entered the country illegally.To drive home that message, Trump invited members of the Remembrance Project to join him on stage, a group that represents the families of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants which argues for draconian immigration policies. Trump has frequently associated himself with the group as he has sought to link all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US with the small subset of those who have committed crimes, even though undocumented immigrants don't commit crimes at a higher rate than legal US residents."

Once gambling was legalized in the late 1970's, a sleepy New Jersey shore town transformed into a gaming hot spot. That's when Trump bet big on Atlantic City by amassing property along the boardwalk.  ""When casino gaming came into Atlantic City, it was a monopoly,"" says Marvin Roffman, a former gaming analyst for a prominent financial services firm. ""They had basically the whole eastern market to themselves and everyone was looking for land to build a casino."" Trump, basking in the success of building the Trump Tower in New York City, liked those odds. In 1984, he opened Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and the following year he opened Trump's Castle. It was all part of Trump's spending spree in the late 1980s that included the iconic Plaza Hotel in New York, the famed Palm Beach Estate Mar-A-Lago, the Eastern Air shuttle which he renamed the Trump Shuttle, the 282-foot Trump Princess yacht and the largest tract of undeveloped land on the west side of Manhattan.RELATED: The Atlantic City summer that nearly ruined Donald TrumpStill, there was one more thing Trump wanted: One of the biggest casinos in the world. After months of complex negotiations, he bought The Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Once the deal was made, a triumphant Trump called then-analyst Marvin Roffman. ""My telephone rang and he said, 'Marvin, didn't I do a terrific deal?' and I said, 'I think you did a great deal, but I think you made a mistake.' He said, 'What do you mean?' and I said, 'Why own three casinos in Atlantic City?  How are you going to differentiate the marketing?' and here was his comment, 'Marvin, you have no vision. This is going to be a monster property.'""Trump was right. It was a monster property that needed monster financing. Trump assured New Jersey gaming regulators that it wouldn't be an issue. Roffman remembers Trump telling the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, ""The bankers were waiting in line to lend him the money. And that, under no circumstances would he resort to junk bond financing."" But the banks weren't standing in line to lend Trump money. So, he resorted to the very junk bonds he had said he didn't need. Roffman knew it was an enormous risk. ""To be able to make this project successful, to break even, you'd have to generate a casino win of somewhere over a million dollars a day.  And no casino in the world had -- at that time, had ever even come close to anything like that.""The Taj Mahal casino became the biggest bet of Trump's career, but soon his luck would run out. The hotel had huge operating problems. Simply put, Trump had over-extended himself. RELATED: Trump: 'I'm smart' for not paying taxesWhen the economy and the real estate market plummeted in 1990, real estate attorney Alan Pomerantz said Trump owed $4 billion to his debtors, including almost a billion for which he was personally responsible.  ""I think he borrowed more than most other prudent real estate people,"" Pomerantz told CNN. ""Because he personally guaranteed so much debt, the leverage shifted dramatically over to the banks. Because it was no longer an issue of a bank and a piece of real estate. It was a bank and Trump's actual survival.""Trump owed money to 72 banks. Pomerantz, who represented them as a group, says Trump was very close to going personally bankrupt. While Trump makes a point of saying he never went personally bankrupt, Pomerantz points out that there's a reason why the banks decided to keep Trump whole. ""We made the decision that he would be worth more alive to us than dead. Dead meaning in bankruptcy. We don't want him to be in bankruptcy. We want him out in the world selling these assets for us. ... We kept him alive to help us."" So the irony of Trump's personal brush with bankruptcy is this: The banks decided that Trump should not be allowed to go bust because he was the best salesman to sell off his own properties and hammered out a five-year plan to allow him to repay his personal debts. As Trump negotiated with bankers in 1990, two of his Atlantic City casinos were on the brink of failure.  Steve Perskie became chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in October 1990. He remembers when Trump's father, Fred Trump, tried to rescue his son by buying more than $3 million in chips at Trump's Castle. ""Fred Trump's lawyer was handed that value in chips and took the chips out of the casino. You could call it a three-million-dollar loan.""But the loan wasn't nearly enough. In July 1991, under crushing debt, the Taj Mahal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which stiffed investors and forced small business to accept pennies on the dollar for their work. By March 1992, Trump's Castle and Trump Plaza followed suit. RELATED: The small business owners Trump never paid in full"	Donald Trump's Atlantic City finances tell story of business losses
