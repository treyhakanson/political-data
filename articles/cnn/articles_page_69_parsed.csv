Outside one of them, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, activists have set up camp opposing the project. Members of the tribe argue the pipeline could displace burial ground and other sacred land. Obama, speaking to NowThisNews after a campaign rally in Ohio, said his inclination was to respect the tribe's concerns. ""As a general rule, my view is that there is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans, and I think that right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline,"" Obama said, explaining he was planning to ""let it play out for several more weeks"" before coming to a final conclusion. Proponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline argue the project would safely transport crude from oil-rich North Dakota to other states. But worries over ground water safety and spills, along with the tribal concerns, have led to outcry from an array of environmental and Native American groups. Not all the Standing Rock Sioux are protesting the pipelineObama has personal ties to the affected tribe; he visited the Standing Rock reservation in 2014 with First Lady Michelle Obama and spoke with young people there about working to expand opportunities after decades of neglect by the federal government. He also took in a colorful display of traditional dancing and music meant to honor dignitaries. He was the second sitting US president to visit after Bill Clinton stopped there in 1999. Despite those ties, Obama had largely avoided weighing in prior to Tuesday's interview. During a Tribal Nations conference in September, he praised Native Americans for their unity on the issue, but didn't expand on his position. ""I know that many of you have come together across tribes and across the country to support the community at Standing Rock. And together, you're making your voices heard,"" Obama said then. Dakota Access Pipeline: What's at stake?Speaking Tuesday, Obama pressed for restraint by protesters and police, who have been clashing as law enforcement works toward clearing the camp of activists. ""It's a challenging situation,"" Obama said. ""There is an obligation for protesters to be peaceful. There's an obligation for authorities to show restraint. And I want to makes sure that as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard that both sides are refraining from situations that result in people being hurt."""

In the past, a recruit who tested positive for pot or admitted past habitual use of the drug could be rejected, according a report in the Military Times. But Carter noted that there are some ""things we'll never be able to compromise on.""The Pentagon's revamp of recruiting and advertising approaches will be revamped to put an emphasis on evolving technology, science and cyber, the defense secretary said.  The new recruiting campaign will be ""disseminated through separate, but integrated print, TV, digital and social media information,"" Carter said.""In terms of where and how we recruit, we'll be missing an opportunity if we kept fishing in only the same geographic ponds we are now,"" Carter added. ""We need to seize that opportunity by fishing in more ponds, new ponds, ponds we haven't been in, in a long time. We have to draw talent from our country's entire pool of population for our all-volunteer force.""Carter also said he wanted to improve recruiting by offering more graduate school scholarships and grants, especially for law and medical school and sponsoring students in high school who are ""interested in science, technology, engineering and math.""  ""No matter who you are, who you love, who you look like, or where your parents came from, if you're able and willing to serve, and meet our high standards, we give you a full and equal opportunity to do so,"" Carter said.

""I've been wearing these since I've been 15 years old,"" Biden said at the rally before returning to speaking about Clinton.

""Republicans need to vote."" Ryan confirmed this week that he cast an early vote for Trump in Wisconsin, warning that a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring a torrent of scandals and investigations.But Ryan's recent expressions of support for the real estate mogul mark something of a change. It was only three weeks ago when Ryan informed his GOP colleagues that he would no longer defend the party's presidential nominee after a video emerged in which Trump could be heard making lewd and sexually aggressive comments about women.A spokeswoman for Ryan said at the time that he would instead spend the rest of the campaign ""focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities."" The declaration outraged Trump, who publicly castigated Ryan for undermining the party's efforts.Ryan more recently has been pushing for a ""unified Republican government"" while calling on GOP voters to support the party's entire ticket. In his interview with Hewitt, Ryan blamed the media for playing up the differences among Republicans, saying the party's leaders are ""all on the same page."" ""This is an agenda that we are all unified around, which is what we are trying to offer the country,"" Ryan said. A central part of that agenda, Ryan said, will be to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the struggling health care law better known as Obamacare. Ryan told Hewitt that Republicans in Congress once again passed repeal legislation earlier this year, which was promptly vetoed by President Barack Obama.""Imagine if we had a Republican president,"" he said."

I want to speak to Republicans here in North Carolina as well. I am obviously a partisan Democrat. I understand that,"" Obama said. ""But we're not Democrats or Republicans first, we're Americans first, and there's a standard of behavior that we ought to expect of our leaders.""Obama's final mission: Help Clinton close the dealObama told a crowd of more than 16,000 people gathered on a sticky afternoon on the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill he wanted to talk ""bidness,"" framing the contest between Clinton and Donald Trump using his most urgent language to date.""All the progress we hope to make over the next eight years, all of that goes out of the window if we don't win this election. And we don't win this election, potentially, if we don't win North Carolina,"" Obama said. ""So I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders. The fate of the world is teetering and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.""Obama hopes to turn North Carolina for Clinton using his sway among the state's key voting blocs, including college-educated whites and African-Americans. He won there in 2008 but lost to Mitt Romney in 2012, both by slim margins. A CNN poll of polls in North Carolina shows Clinton edging Trump 46%-42%.Obama returns to North Carolina on Friday for rallies in Fayetteville and Charlotte, hoping to convince the same voters who went for him in 2008 to back Clinton this time.He cast the race in historic terms on Wednesday, telling the crowd not to pass up their chance to affect the country's course.""It's not often that you can move the arc of history. Don't let that chance slip away,"" Obama said. ""Young people here, it's not often that you know your voice will have an impact. Don't give away your power. Don't fall for the easy cynicism that says my vote doesn't matter. That's what Hillary's opponent wants you to think because they don't want you to vote.""He angrily lambasted Republicans who he said were attempting to suppress the African-American vote using restrictive laws. declaring the practice a dark vestige of America's violent past.""How are we going to betray folks that have worked so hard so that we can pull the lever and we're not going to vote?

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/obama-hillary-clinton-election/index.html	"In the pews, the audience nodded along, showing their approval by muttering ""Amen"" and raising their hands up in the air. But it wasn't until Clinton delivered this line that the worshippers rose to their feet.""I am going to defend President Obama's legacy,"" Clinton said. ""Especially the Affordable Care Act.""It was the third time in October that Clinton spent her Sunday morning at a black church in the final stretch of the 2016 campaign, hoping to capture President Barack Obama's powerful coalition, which will be key to whether she can win states like North Carolina and Florida -- and capture the White House.For Obama, whose final mission as president is the election of a Democratic successor and the preservation of his eight-year legacy, next Tuesday will serve as a testament to whether he was able to help his one-time opponent close the deal in a historic election.Obama laid out a strong pitch Wednesday to black voters with radio host Tom Joyner, imagining what it would be like to prepare for a transition to a Donald Trump presidency and calling on African-Americans to come out and vote to make sure his legacy is not reversed.Obamacare, Medicaid, support for historically black colleges and universities, the work done on civil rights, voting rights and criminal justice reform -- even the first lady's vegetable garden -- would be at risk under Trump, the President said in the interview taped Tuesday and aired Wednesday morning.And Obama called out his supporters who aren't jumping in to help out Clinton.""I need you and everybody who is listening to make it their sole focus over the next seven days that every single person is out there voting. And I'm gonna be honest with you right now, because we track, we've got early voting, we've got all kinds of metrics to see what's going on and right now, the Latino vote is up, overall vote is up, but the African-American vote right now is not as solid as it needs to be,"" Obama said.""And I know that there are a lot of people in barbershops and beauty salons, you know, in the neighborhoods who are saying to themselves 'We love Barack, we love -- we especially love Michelle -- and so, you know, it was exciting and now we're not excited as much,'"" he added. ""You know what? I need everybody to understand that everything we've done is dependent on me being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in same things I believe in.""Obama heads into the final months of his presidency with the highest approval rating of his second term. A CNN/ORC poll last month showed 55% of Americans have a favorable view of the president, and his approval rating has stayed at 50% or higher in that survey since February. But those numbers won't make Obama feel good next year if he's watching President Trump and Republicans dismantle eight years of hard work.In recent months, Obama has embraced, and at times even appeared to relish, using his powerful bully pulpit to give weight to Clinton's main attack line against her opponent -- that Trump is simply unqualified and unfit to be president.Since Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination this summer, the president has campaigned twice in North Carolina as well as Florida, and stumped in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Nevada. Wednesday, he'll appear at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and will be in Florida later in the week.""There's not a battleground state that he's not effective in,"" one senior Clinton adviser said. The adviser did not rule out the possibility of a joint Clinton-Obama event in the final days of the election.And Democrats believe there is no surrogate more capable of helping bring home two critical demographic groups for Clinton: African-Americans and young people.At the same time, Obama has his limitations, especially when it comes to Clinton's recent troubles with FBI Director James Comey. Obama has steered clear of criticizing the agency, and the recently revived email investigation -- where Clinton needs the most validation -- is an area where the president is unable to offer her a full-throated defense.  Obama conducted 13 interviews on black radio shows in the months of September and October, five of which were broadcast during drive time. Of the local interviews, four were hosts in Florida, where African-American turnout for in-person early voting has been lower than expectations.But Clinton aides insist that Obama's outreach is working there, where their analysis says 500,000 African Americans have already cast their ballots in Florida through both in-person voting and through mail-in ballots. That number is up 74% compared to the same time in 2012, aides said, and represents a 30% higher rate of mail-in ballot requests from African-Americans than in 2012.In North Carolina, the Clinton campaign is tracking higher than expected in-person early voting among African-Americans. Turnout in Mecklenberg, Orange, Wake and Durham counties, where one in three people are black, is up 17% on average, according to the campaign's data.And as a part of his outreach to young voters -- a group that Clinton struggled to excite during the Democratic primaries -- Obama has lit up social media and late night TV. He has given interviews to wide-reach platforms like Snapchat and YouTube, and sat down with popular comedians like Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel.In an interview with comedian Samantha Bee this week, Obama called on young people to vote, pointing out that his daughter, Malia, voted for the first time in this election.""The pride that she took, I think, in casting her ballot, is a pride that I think a lot of young people feel, but, you got to talk to them about the things that they care about,"" he said.Clinton keeping Obama closeClinton's embrace of Obama was prominent during the Democratic primaries. During the grueling 14-month race against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton touted herself as the rightful heir to the president's legacy and painted Sanders as someone who both lacked a full appreciation for and wanted to re-write Obama's accomplishments.This was an especially important selling point for Clinton with black voters, a bloc that proved to be critical to Clinton's ability to overcome Sanders' unexpectedly strong challenge from the left.At a February debate in South Carolina, Clinton slammed Sanders for calling Obama ""weak"" and a ""disappointment.""""The kind of criticism that we heard from Sen. Sanders about our president, I expect from Republicans,"" Clinton said. ""I do not expect (it) from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.""""Madam Secretary, that is a low blow,"" Sanders shot back, clearly understanding the power of the attack.In addition to using Obama as a validator (she has often reminded Democrats that the president thought highly enough of her to ask her to be his secretary of state), Clinton has also cast herself as the true defender of Obama's policies on issues ranging from Obamacare to gun control.""It is time to pick a side,"" Clinton said in an ad released in January. ""Either we stand with the gun lobby or we join the President and stand up to them I am with him.""Campaigning for Clinton in Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday, Obama implored men who are not supporting Clinton to think hard about their opposition, and whether it has to do with the nominee's gender.""I know that my wife is not just my equal but my superior,"" Obama said. ""When a guy's ambitious out in the public arena and working hard, well, that's OK. But when a woman does it, suddenly we're like, why's she doing that?""""I want you to think about that,"" Obama continued, adding about Clinton: ""She is so much better qualified than the other guy."""

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-advertising/index.html	"Donald Trump's campaign said Tuesday it would spend $25 million on advertising during the final week, but he is still scheduled to be outspent by Hillary Clinton thanks to her more-organized and better-funded network of outside groups.Trump's campaign has so far reserved $17.4 million this week, but announced on Tuesday morning last-minute plans to buy additional airtime in new terrain like Michigan and New Mexico. Allied groups are throwing in another $1.1 million.  Bracing for the final stretchClinton's campaign is spending just shy of $14 million in the final week. Priorities USA Action, the primary super PAC supporting her bid, is putting up another $9.7 million. All told, after the long and expensive struggle, the closing arguments between will play out as a $44 million bout, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising. Voters in the three largest battleground states will see upwards of $20 million in television ads.Both campaigns have focused the largest slice of their spending on Florida, which will see nearly $10 million in ads this week. They've also put upwards of $5 million in each Pennsylvania and Ohio. Clinton, with a tremendous cash advantage over her Republican rival in the homestretch, in recent days has begun advertising in some states already thought to be in her column, including Wisconsin.And on Tuesday, the campaign said it would also begin spots in the blue states of Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado and Michigan -- and credited an $11.3 million online fundraising haul over the last three days for making it possible. ""The Trump campaign claims their path to White House is through states like these but we're going to make sure those doors remain shut,"" said Jesse Ferguson, a Clinton spokesman.Clinton ad grills Trump on women, characterAnd those totals doesn't include any new investments from the Trump campaign, which at one point pledged to spend $100 million total in fall television. It was not immediately clear whether the $25 million buy announced Tuesday reflected a total media plan for the final seven days, or an additional buy on top of the reservations already in place. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.To match the spending, both campaigns in recent days have been rushing to craft and place new television ads to make the case in the final days.Part of Clinton's final push is an attempt to convince Republicans who are weary of Trump to fully commit to Clinton. To do that, the Clinton campaign will launch a series of ads that profile self-identified Republicans who broke with Trump over the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape that showed the businessman casually talking about sexual assault.The ads profile Tiffany Lewey of Texas, Terry Daniel from Arizona and Don McVaugh of Virginia, all of whom decided to break with Trump after the video was released.""The values that Donald Trump has shown, they don't represent me, they don't represent what I want to teach my children or my family,"" Daniel says in his ad. ""When I first heard the tape, I immediately thought of my daughter. I wouldn't feel good as a father  voting for someone like that.""All of the ads feature the voter saying while they don't agree with Clinton on everything, they do plan to support her.The ads will air in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, especially in conservative areas of each state.  Another Clinton spot, released Tuesday morning, is what the campaign sees as 60 seconds of Trump's greatest hits against women, like criticism of a beauty contestant, allegations of sexual assault and the vulgar comments about grabbing women he made on an ""Access Hollywood"" microphone. ""Anyone who believes, says, does what he does is unfit to be president,"" the ad concludes. On Monday, Trump quietly began airing two new ads -- both of which offer a more positive intonation than seen in previous Trump spots. One casts the campaign as a movement ""to decades of broken politics with a new leader who is not part of the system"" and does not mention Clinton at all.  The other paints different pictures of America as led by the two candidates.  ""Hillary Clinton will keep us on the road to stagnation -- fewer jobs, rising crime, America diminished at home and abroad,"" the narrator explains. ""Donald Trump will bring the change we're waiting for."" These spots have not been announced by the Trump campaign but were spotted airing on television stations by Kantar Media/CMAG."

The ceremony came amid a political controversy roiling the department and the FBI over the handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation. It would be times like this that Margolis, a fierce defender of the Justice Department, would play key roles to help lead efforts to protect the department from political tempests. Tuesday was the first time Comey was in the same room as some of his critics, including former Attorneys General Eric Holder and Michael Mukasey, and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, who sat across the aisle far opposite from Comey. Several of the former prosecutors who, along with Holder and Gorelick, recently signed a letter criticizing Comey were also in the room. There was no mention of the current controversies, and Comey didn't respond to reporters' questions after the ceremony.But Comey, Lynch and several of the other speakers mentioned the department's ideals of pursuing the rule of law no matter which political party is in power. ""We feel his absence in these hallways every day,"" Lynch told the audience in speaking about Margolis.Before and after the ceremony, the current controversy was discussed only on oblique terms. Many in the room were veterans of the Bush administration, including some who helped manage the department's most serious and damaging crisis in recent years: the controversy over the firings of US attorneys. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who was forced to resign in that scandal, didn't attend. "	Comey sits with critics at ceremony for late colleague	['Clinton', 'Lynch']	[]
