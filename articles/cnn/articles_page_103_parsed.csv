The protester briefly escaped the man's grasp, but the Trump supporter quickly put the protester in a headlock.As the two men scrapped, a police officer intervened to break up the scuffle and escorted the protester out of the venue.As the Trump supporter who put the protester in a headlock ventured back into the crowd, high-fiving other Trump supporters along the way, police returned into the crowd to escort the man and another who had shoved the protester out of the venue.Asked by CNN why he hit the protester, the Trump supporter simply said ""I didn't hit him"" as police pushed him toward the exit, arms behind his back.No arrests were made in connection with the altercation, Greensboro Police Department spokeswoman Susan Danielsen told CNN.""There was a minor altercation associated with the Trump rally. Officers escorted both parties involved outside of the venue. Neither one wanted to press charges, so no arrests were made,"" Danielsen said.""That's what's happening to our country, that's what happening. That is total disrespect for our flag, that's what's happening to our country,"" Trump said as one of the supporters who grabbed the protester returned to the crowd. ""We're going to turn it around, folks. We're going to turn it around.""Meanwhile, supporters close by chanted, ""Let him stay.""Several of Trump's North Carolina rallies have been marked by violence against protesters, most recently last month in Asheville, when a Trump supporter grabbed a protester by the neck and appeared to hit him in the face. The Asheville Police Department issued a warrant for that man's arrest, calling the incident an ""assault.""At the same rally, a 69-year-old protester was allegedly punched in the face by a Trump supporter outside the venue.In March, a Trump supporter in Fayetteveille, North Carolina, was charged with assault after he punched a protester who was being escorted from the venue."

The underdog has staked his campaign on being a Washington outsider -- painting his opponent, incumbent Roy Blunt, as a lobbyist-beholden insider.Kander's surprising success has caught the attention of national groups. Friday morning, Senate Leadership Fund released a new add, first on CNN, attempting to tie Kander to other Democrats. The ad from the Republican group linked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies features Kander's face morphing into that of Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Bernie Sanders. The ad will run in Missouri's major cities on broadcast and cable as part of an $8 million ad buy.""Kander is a very talented politician and all of his ads portray him as someone who's beyond ideology and beyond and party, and in fact it's somewhat reminiscent of the way that Barack Obama first presented himself in 2008,"" said Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law. ""The challenge here is to overcome that fresh-face image and drive home the fact that this is someone who has a long track record and very strong ideological views.""A Monmouth poll released this week has Blunt leading Kander by only 2 points, 46% to 44%, essentially tied within the 4.9 percentage point margin of error. CNN has ranked it a toss-up. Trump led Clinton by 5 points, 46% to 41%, just outside the margin of error, in the same poll.But you won't find joint Clinton-Kander yard signs anywhere driving around blue St. Louis, and Clinton has spent no money on ads in Missouri, focusing on a path to 270 electoral votes that doesn't need Missouri's 10. Trump's campaign has followed suit, also spending no money on advertising and letting a mostly grass-roots campaign maintain his natural lead. Kander, a 35-year-old Afghanistan veteran and former state legislator, may not mind Clinton's absence in the state. He maintains that he has not tailored his ""new generation"" message to Trump. His announcement video in February 2015, before Trump had announced his candidacy, already included his pitch about Washington needing new blood less beholden to partisan politics. But the Trump effect has played into Kander's hands. While Kander calls Trump ""not qualified to be President,"" he told CNN in an interview that he understands and can speak to the Trump voter.  ""I understand why in this gridlock that exists in our national conversation, people would in their search for shaking up that conversation be interested in considering someone who is in my opinion not qualified,"" he said when asked about the Trump-Kander voter. ""So people do want change, and they want authenticity.""In an hour-long debate between Blunt, Kander and the three other third-party candidates for the seat here in Branson two weeks ago, the presidential race barely registered. Blunt attacked Kander using Clinton only once, to say Clinton supported a compromise Blunt negotiated with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington on Zika funding. Trump never came up at all, and Blunt specifically avoided saying Trump's name when he said the ""next president"" will reshape the court.  Asked about whether Trump's outsider message is a drag on his campaign in a very brief Q&A with reporters after the debate, Blunt tried to make the case that their campaigns were complementary before ending the availability. ""I think it's really in line with the things I've been talking about,"" Blunt said, citing burdensome regulations on Missouri. ""If you're going to do something about Obamacare ... I think you're going to need something more than the third term of Barack Obama.""He only mentioned Trump once, to say, ""I think Donald Trump is a guy who would return more responsibility back to the Congress,"" citing his own push for legislation that would require congressional votes on certain regulations.  After a tape of explosive sexually aggressive and lewd comments from Trump was leaked last week, Blunt condemned the comments without revoking support of the Republican.""Donald Trump's statements were disrespectful and inappropriate, and he was right to apologize,"" Blunt tweeted.  National interestBlunt is getting plenty of help from outside Missouri, as is Kander. Between outside groups, the campaigns and party committees, more than $16 million is scheduled to be spent on the race already, roughly $5 million for Kander and $11 million for Blunt, according to ad tracking firm CMAG/Kantar Media. That doesn't include spending from groups like the Koch brothers linked Americans for Prosperity, who can run issue-based advertising attacking or benefiting candidates. Blunt called Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser last week to raise more money, and the PAC for the conservative anti-abortion group is planning to spend $500,000 in the state on in-person, digital and mail outreach.   Both candidates have been the beneficiary of the races in Florida and Ohio slipping away from Democrats. With those battlegrounds less winnable, Senate hopes have caused an influx of money into the Show Me State. Attack ads have saturated Missouri airwaves. Blunt has been attacked as a Washington insider, including a Kander ad that notes Blunt's wife and adult children are all lobbyists and accuses him of conflicts of interest. Kander, meanwhile, has been attacked for his F rating by the National Rifle Association and ads that try to paint him as an extreme liberal politician.Kander has fought back with one of the most memorable ads of the election cycle, in which he assembles an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle blindfolded while talking about his military record and support for background checks, saying ""I would like to see Roy Blunt do this.""The lack of a strong focus on the state by the Clinton campaign is a benefit, not a drag, to Dems' hopes of the Statehouse and Senate seat, ""It's in Kander's interest to have as much separation as possible, particularly outside of St. Louis and Kansas City,"" said University of Missouri-St. Louis politics professor Terrence Jones. ""Kander is trying to run an outsider campaign against Blunt, and Hillary is another insider as Blunt is, so he'd just as soon be seen as separate from her.""The Kander, Clinton and gubernatorial campaigns have mostly run independently of each other while strategizing on how to boost all of them, according to state Democratic volunteers. Kander's campaign has been focused on voter registration drives. The campaign of Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Chris Koster, a former Republican state lawmaker, has been working on canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts. And the Clinton campaign has been recruiting volunteers, phone banking to encourage identified Democrats to come join the efforts. Former Missouri Democratic Chairman Mike Kelley was bullish that Kander could pull off an underdog win with the strategy. ""This should be a layup for Roy Blunt in Missouri,"" Kelley said. ""He's not had some major scandal that has harmed his campaign or his ability to get re-elected, and the fact that it's so close, I do believe that this Senate seat is in play. And with the resources coming in from out of state, with the solid gubernatorial candidate that we have, with the excitement, with the nominees by Republicans, this could be the perfect storm for Jason Kander to pull this off.""A split-ticket electorateKey to Kander's chances will be whether he can find split-ticket voters. Clinton's supporters are likely to vote for him, but a winning coalition will require peeling off some Republican support from Blunt. While Missouri has been reliable for Republican presidential candidates in recent cycles, the governor's seat has been held by a Democrat and the other incumbent senator, Claire McCaskill, is also a Democrat. Conversations with voters in the state also reveal a possibility of split tickets this fall.The Trump office in St. Louis is run by volunteers unaffiliated with the party or the campaign, who raised money because they wanted a Trump-specific office. When the state GOP told them they could share space in existing offices, they turned elsewhere. ""They suggested we go to various existing offices for certain statewide or federal candidates. And we knew that the demographics didn't necessarily support that,"" said director Annette Read. ""(The volunteers) weren't revolting, they just wanted a strictly Trump office.""Read said she wouldn't speak about Blunt's race, but noted one of the things she likes about Trump is his independence. ""I am not a fan of party politics, I'd rather we have no affiliation whatsoever,"" Read said. ""I have always mainly supported Republican candidates because that's probably closest to my ideology, but I don't like the direction the Republican Party has gone. ... I see a lot of things behind the scenes, and (Blunt's) probably having a tougher year than most, but I'm not here to speak about those candidates.""Another volunteer in the office, Brinda Johnson, said she and her family are life-long Democrats, and she even went to the convention for Clinton in 2008. But she said after she read a book that attacks the Clinton Foundation and family, she switched her allegiance -- but only at the top. ""I know I won't vote a straight Republican ticket,"" she said.Near that office in Fenton, Missouri, at the local Fenton Days Festival, wellness company marketer Jenny Lutterman said she is committed to voting for Trump and sees a need for a Republican president. But she also had doubts about Blunt -- reminiscent of Kander's attack lines. ""I wish there was more of that, that people didn't vote straight tickets, because that's what's happened, we've gotten so divided,"" Lutterman said. ""I'm not too fond of Roy Blunt. I just feel like he's really not for the people as much as he could be."""

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/michelle-obama-speech/index.html	"The man whose political career was born in the racially-tinged conspiracy about her husband's birth was describing in vile terms a penchant for sexual aggression. This was beyond the standard campaign trail rancor, the first lady would say later. It was something more.With a campaign speech scheduled for the following week in New Hampshire, Democratic sources said the first lady set to work refining and updating a message she'd been seeking to deliver for a long time about Donald Trump's cruel language toward women.""This is a speech that the first lady has wanted to personally deliver for a long time,"" said an aide. ""It came directly from the first lady.""That address, delivered at a campaign inflection point as woman after woman emerged to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct, evolved into what could be one of the most effective political speeches of the year.""I have to tell you that I can't stop thinking about this,"" the first lady said, who before this summer had rarely offered her insights into the emotional turbulence that comes with being a political spouse.""It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted,"" Obama said. ""So while I'd love nothing more than to pretend like this isn't happening and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.""The first lady has carefully honed her public image since she entered the national spotlight more than eight years ago, in part through her direct style of speaking. And while she's advocated passionately for her chosen causes, like combating childhood obesity and supporting military families, she's largely kept her innermost thoughts on the country's political life private.""In any position, you mature over time,"" said Desiree Rogers, the Obamas' first White House social secretary, who worked closely with the first lady at the beginning of her tenure in the East Wing. ""You start to get your sea legs, you make decisions about what's going to be important to you.""""She's been graceful throughout this whole process and you get better and better at it, and I think that's what we see,"" Rogers added. ""We see a very mature woman -- a woman who knows what she wants, knows what's important her. And most importantly, not afraid to speak about it.""Unlike the rhetorical gymnastics her husband has employed, Michelle Obama aims to get her message across by forging an emotional connection to her audience. Responsibility for much of what the first lady says in public rests in her speechwriter Sarah Hurwitz, who's described in interviews an ability to channel the first lady's voice as she's drafting her remarks. ""As I write for her now, I'm sort of editing the speech with her voice in my head because she's given me so much feedback over the years and been so clear about what she wants,"" Hurwitz told The Washington Post in June.Through the first lady's office, Hurwitz declined to detail the preparation that went into Thursday's remarks. But those familiar with the speech's development described an address that sprung directly from the speaker herself.Clinton's campaign hopes Trump's lewd remarks will disqualify the candidate in the eyes of women voters, and has jumped on every opportunity to deploy Trump's words against him. Michelle Obama, however, didn't need convincing, approaching the campaign already determined to voice her scathing rebuke.""Of course the campaign was supportive,"" the aide said.Unlike the President, Michelle Obama isn't prone to revising her speeches until the last minute, according to people who have worked for her in the past. A lawyer and executive before she became first lady, she is more comfortable with carefully executed drafts and at least one practice session.For a speech with the deeply personal bent of Thursday's address, her former aides say there's little doubt the first lady spent many hours over the past days writing and perfecting her address.  And while aides describe a healthy competition between husband and wife over political influence, there's little question the first lady consulted the President on her message.Occupied with work on Air Force One when the speech aired live Thursday, President Barack Obama later watched a video of his wife's remarks on a long limo ride in Pittsburgh.""I could not be prouder of her,"" the President said Friday."

""I would say to any one of my kids Donald Trump and I are committed to a safer and more prosperous future for their family,"" Pence responded. ""The weak and feckless foreign policy that Hillary Clinton promises to continue has literally caused areas of the world to spin apart.

He argued that a Hillary Clinton presidency would make America a place of ""gloom"" and ""grayness"" and would produce an out-of-control government that twists the law and Constitution and extinguishes liberty.""That is the America Hillary Clinton wants. And if given control of Washington — if given control of Congress — it is the kind of America she will stop at nothing to have,"" Ryan said.For two straight days, Ryan has avoided questions on Trump. He canceled a scheduled 30-minute meeting with business leaders Thursday. And Ryan's  office pre-screened the questions and selected ones submitted by College Republicans that spotlighted the House GOP's election-year agenda, according to a source involved with organizing the event.His actions and comments reflect the dilemma faced by many top Republican leaders in this volatile and unusual election cycle. While they abhor much of what Trump says and fear the long-term damage his rhetoric on women and Hispanics could inflict on their party, they cannot afford to alienate the millions of voters who flocked to Trump in the primary campaign, especially with control of Congress on the line.In effect, Ryan delivered the kind of detailed ideological argument and rebuttal to liberalism that has been a staple of past Republican presidential election campaigns but which has been almost entirely missing in from the 2016 race.Ryan, who has endorsed Trump but has said he won't defend him going forward, was not asked directly about the nominee's ""unshackled"" romp across the campaign trail, fierce repudiations of Ryan himself or multiple allegations that the Republican nominee has a past history of sexual assault.But he told one student to fight elections based on issues and not personalities, in remarks that appeared to be a reference to Trump.""You can't beat something with nothing. Don't get into a personality contest, don't talk about the latest Twitter storm from somebody. Talk about what you believe and why you believe it,"" Ryan said.He continued: ""The kind of election we really want to have -- it's not the one we are necessarily having right now — the one we really want to have is saying we have got ideas and solutions, 'let's win this so we have got the right to do it.'"" ""Don't walk yourself into some bizarre personality contest but get into a ideas contest.""Ryan's remarks came a day after Trump made a passionate case that a flurry of allegations against him were evidence that the media, the Clinton campaign and the entire political establishment in Washington was threatened by his rise and were in cahoots to prevent him becoming President.Earlier this week, Ryan provoked Trump's rage by giving GOP House members license to to run away from the GOP nominee if if would help their re-election races. He has said he will not defend Trump's most controversial comments but also made known he will not withdraw his endorsement for the GOP nominee.Trump has denied all the allegations against him carried in media outlets like the New York Times and People magazine and said he will provide substantial evidence to prove they are false.CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the allegations.Ryan argued that ""Clintonomics"" would result in a crackdown against entrepreneurial companies like Uber and Airbnb and would involve new stimulus America could not afford and a ""continual stream of massive tax increases.""He said ""liberal progressivism"" represented government by elites and repeatedly touted his own six part ""Better Way"" agenda that includes repealing Obamacare, simplifying the tax code and constraining executive power.

I take absolutely no satisfaction in what is happening on the other side, with my opponent,"" Clinton said. ""I am not at all happy about that because it hurts our country. It hurts our democracy.""

""Where's his wife? Where are they standing side by side, hand in hand?""With less than four weeks until the election, a Trump campaign spokesperson would not comment on whether Melania Trump will appear on her husband's behalf. Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump's daughter with his first wife and someone who had often vouched for her father's relationship with women, returned to the campaign trail on Thursday, though she was not asked about the current controversies embroiling his campaign.Melania Trump issued a statement the day after the release of a 2005 tape that showed him bragging about being able to grope women and get away with it, condemning her husband's words but saying she had forgiven him.""The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know,"" she said. ""I hope people will accept his apology, as I have.""But according to Levick, that statement fell short.""She doesn't talk about her love of the man, she just talks about 'the man that I know,'"" said Levick. ""As Americans, we may be willing to forgive, but first we have to see that the spouse forgives.""The statement was issued before women publicly accused Trump of groping them. Trump has vehemently denied the claims, which CNN has been unable to corroborate.Through her lawyers, Melania Trump pushed back against one of the new accusations, leveled by Natasha Stoynoff, a writer for People magazine. But the only part of the story she challenged was the reporter's assertion that she once ran into Melania Trump on the street and exchanged pleasantries.""Mrs. Trump did not encounter Ms. Stoynoff on the street, nor have any conversation with her,"" said a letter from Melania Trump's lawyers to People.In July, Melania Trump gave a speech praising her husband that was watched by millions, during the Republican National Convention.""He will never, ever, let you down,"" she said. ""He is tough when he has to be, but he is also kind and fair and caring.""But the speech contained several instances of plagiarism, and her message became buried under the controversy.Melania Trump did a few interviews earlier this year, including with CNN and MSNBC. In August, Donald Trump said Melania Trump would soon hold a press conference, in part to clarify the timeline of her immigration history, but so far no such press conference has taken place.Defending their husbandsA number of political spouses have publicly stood by their husbands when they were accused of sexual impropriety, from Silda Spitzer to Huma Abedin to Jenny Sanford to Hillary Clinton. In 1992, with Bill Clinton's primary campaign rocked by allegations of infidelity, Hillary Clinton sat with him for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" and vouched for him.In an appearance that revived her husband's political chances, Hillary Clinton told CBS, ""I'm not sitting here, as some little woman, standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him. And I respect him. And I honor what he's been through and we've been through together. And you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him.""But for Melania Trump, there could also be a downside to speaking now, according to Trump supporter Ben Ferguson.""If you do that, you're continuing to feed the beast of a story,"" said Ferguson, a CNN political commentator. ""You're in a tough situation.""Donald Trump denied that there is any rift between him and his wife after this week's allegations.""We're stronger today than we ever were before, which is good,"" he said Thursday in West Palm Beach."
