Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson nabbed 7% support in the poll, while 2% said they will vote for none of the candidates, an option unique to the Nevada ballot.Monmouth's findings showed Clinton with a wider lead in the state than most other surveys, including this week's CNN/ORC poll, which showed the former secretary of state leading Trump by just 2 points. But each poll showed roughly the same level of support for Clinton, though CNN's survey showed Trump with a higher percentage.The difference in the margins can be traced to each poll's sample of non-white voters and voters under the age of 50. Clinton held a wide lead among non-whites in Nevada, 61%-29%, according to CNN/ORC's survey. But the Monmouth poll showed Clinton's lead among the group to be even bigger, 67%-18%.Monmouth also showed Clinton with a massive lead among Nevada's voters under 50, 55%-28%. That's larger than Clinton's 47%-39% edge among the group in the CNN/ORC poll.Last month's Monmouth survey showed Clinton trailing Trump by 2 points in the state.The latest survey from Monmouth was conducted October 14-17 using live phone interviews with 413 likely Nevada voters. It has a margin of error of 4.8 percent.	Nevada poll: Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 7	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Trump has called the election ""one big fix"" and warned of ""large scale voter fraud,"" though there is no evidence to support his claims.Asked if he was confident that the election in Maine would be clean, LePage replied, ""No. I am not confident we're going to have a clean election in Maine and I'll tell you why. The left, the Democratic party, insists on not having IDs. And will people from the cemetery be voting? Yes. All around the country. The media and the Democratic party want everybody to vote whether they're citizens or not.""LePage went on to say that states should provide photo IDs to residents and added that it wasn't ""a big issue."" He added that there are counties in the US where more votes are cast than there are citizens in the county. ""You gotta have photo IDs when you cash checks, you gotta have photo IDs every place you go,"" LePage said. ""In fact, I don't know how many times you gotta take your license out of your wallet to show it to people. And so until we do that, I don't think that elections in the state of Maine or in the United States are legitimate. I mean, we know that there are counties in this country that get more votes than there are citizens in their county, so what's that tell you?""The governor did not cite any specific counties to support his point.Other Republicans, like Sens. Marco Rubio and Pat Toomey have publicly refuted Trump's claims. ""Our elections may not always be completely perfect, but they are legitimate, they have integrity and everyone needs to respect the outcome,"" Toomey said Monday night. A spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that Ryan was ""fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity."""	Maine Gov.

Obama said during a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, adding that Trump's claim is ""not based on facts.""Trump and his surrogates have increasingly claimed the US election system is ""rigged,"" coming after two lackluster debate performances and a drop in poll numbers nationally and in key swing states. He's urged his supporters to monitor polling sites for potentially ineligible voters attempting to cast ballots.The rhetoric has been brushed off even by Republican governors, who say there are no signs of corruption in their states' voting systems.Obama echoed those sentiments Tuesday, saying there's ""no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections.""Reality Check: Trump's claims of 'large scale' voter fraudAnd he claimed Trump's warnings could abrade faith in the US political system.""One way of weakening America and making it less great is if you start betraying those basic American traditions that have been bipartisan and have helped to hold together this Democracy now for well over two centuries,"" Obama said.He derided Trump's remarks as reflective of an unpresidential attitude, declaring again that the Republican nominee's temperament was disqualifying.Why Trump's talk of a rigged vote is so dangerous""It doesn't really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you'd want out of a president. You start whining before the game's even over? If whenever things are going badly for you and you lose you start blaming somebody else? Then you don't have what it takes to be in this job,"" Obama said.And he said the warnings of a ""rigged election"" are entirely unprecedented in modern American political history.""I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It's unprecedented,"" Obama said alongside Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.Trump has at times embraced the label of ""whiner,"" telling CNN in an interview last year, he is ""the most fabulous whiner.""""I do whine because I want to win and I'm not happy about not winning and I am a whiner and I keep whining and whining until I win,"" Trump told CNN's Chris Cuomo in August 2015. Long feud with TrumpIt was Obama's latest salvo in what's become a bitterly negative campaign against Trump. At the beginning of Tuesday's news conference, Obama said he planned to be ""a little more subdued"" in his discussion of Trump, given the diplomatic setting just outside the Oval Office.And while he didn't slip into his campaign cadences, he unleashed a harsh rebuke of the Republican candidate, describing his behavior as ""unprecedented"" on multiple fronts.Obama called Trump's ""flattery"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin ""out of step"" with US norms, and called out Republicans who support their nominee as hypocritical.""You'll have to explain to me how it is that some of the same leaders in the Republican Party who were constantly haranguing us for even talking to the Russians and who consistently took the most hawkish approaches to Russia, including Mr. Trump's selection for vice president, now reconcile their endorsement of Mr. Trump with their previous views,"" he said.Trump: 'I could see myself' meeting with Putin before I'm presidentBut he reserved his harshest rhetoric for Trump's assertions about the upcoming election.""I'd advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes,"" Obama said. ""And if he got the most votes, then it would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in order to make sure that the American people benefit from an effective government, and it would be my job to welcome Mr. Trump, regardless of what he said about me, or my differences with him on my opinions, and escort him over to the Capitol, in which there would about peaceful transfer of power.""""That's what Americans do,"" Obama said."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/donald-trump-ethics-reform-2016-election/index.html	"The proposals came after Trump began his speech here by accusing officials at the FBI and State Department of engaging in a ""criminal conspiracy,"" seizing on FBI documents released Monday that revealed that at least two officials at those departments allegedly bargained over reconsidering the classification of an email on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's private email server.Patrick Kennedy, an undersecretary at the State Department, urged FBI officials to reconsider classifying an email found on Clinton's server, prompting an FBI official to respond with a request for the State Department to approve the deployment of more FBI officials overseas, according to FBI files released Monday. The FBI did not declassify the email in question and there is no evidence that the purported ""quid pro quo"" amounted to a federal crime.The proposals Trump unveiled on Monday would not have prevented the alleged collusion between the two departments, but appear to be instead aimed at undercutting the influence of special interests in Washington.Trump called for enacting through legislation a five-year ban ""on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for five years after they leave government service"" and slammed former President Bill Clinton for nixing that ban at the end of his tenure, which he had himself enacted at the start of his administration via executive order.""He rigged the system on his way out,"" Trump said.Trump also called for a similar five-year ban that would prevent members of Congress and their staff from becoming lobbyists and called for closing loopholes that would allow former government officials to skirt such a ban ""by labeling themselves consultants, advisers and all of these different things.""Trump called for an even stricter lifetime ban preventing ""senior executive branch officials"" from ever lobbying on behalf of a foreign government and called for Congress to pass legislation preventing registered foreign lobbyists from raising money for US elections. The real estate mogul's calls come even though his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort was a longtime Washington lobbyist. Manafort, who resigned in August, also worked to further the interests of foreign governments as a consultant -- despite never officially registering as a foreign agent.Trump offered up his ethics reform proposals as he pressed forward with his claim that he is competing ""in a rigged election,"" arguing once again -- without evidence -- that the media and Clinton's campaign are colluding to destroy his candidacy.""They want to poison the minds of voters,"" Trump said of media outlets reporting on allegations of sexual assault and other unwanted contact that women have lodged against Trump in the last week. ""It's all false stuff, it's all false stuff.""""The media is an extension of the Clinton campaign,"" he added.Trump also again warned his supporters that ""voter fraud is all too common,"" even though instances of voter fraud are extremely rare.Even supporters of the Republican nominee have sought to tamp down such suggestions, including Ohio's secretary of state, a Trump supporter who is in charge of overseeing the elections in that key battleground state.""I can assure Donald Trump I am in charge of election in Ohio, and they're not going to be rigged,"" Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said earlier Monday on CNN, adding that Trump's comments suggesting the election is rigged are ""irresponsible.""""Are there cases of voter fraud? Absolutely. There are cases of voter fraud. But it's rare and we catch these people. Most times we catch them before their vote is even counted,"" Husted added."

Rendell said that, despite her lead in the polls, which has widened since the release of a 2005 audiotape of Donald Trump describing how sexually aggressive behavior toward women, Clinton should take care not to appear too sure of her chances of victory.""I think it's also important for Hillary Clinton to be presidential, to hang in there, even if he does get personal, but not to be smug or self-confident or over-confident because elections can turn,"" he said. ""I don't think that the lead is big enough that there's any reason for us to be over-confident and she should not portray any idea that she thinks this is in the bag and that she thinks she doesn't have to contend.""Later in the interview, Rendell said that the election was not over and that one potential cause for concern for the Clinton campaign could be a ""hidden vote"" for Trump.""Some people may not have been telling the truth to the pollsters. How big a hidden vote that is, I don't know."" Rendell said, noting that growing enthusiasm among Clinton's supporters and that Clinton's campaign organization were reasons for optimism."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/donald-trump-outspends-hillary-clinton-ads/index.html	Trump's campaign is slated to spend $14 million on television ads compared to Clinton's $10 million, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising.  But when factoring in spending from outside groups like super PACs, Clinton comes out on top. Pro-Clinton forces will spend a total of about $19.7 million on ads this week, including an $8.7 million buy from Priorities USA, the main super PAC supporting her.  Trump's allies are throwing in only $2.5 million for a total of $16.6 million in pro-Trump ads this week. Most of that comes from a National Rifle Association political group.  Both campaigns are heavily focusing their buys on the hotly contested state of Florida, as well as Pennsylvania, which is currently leaning in Clinton's direction, as well as the battlegrounds of Ohio and North Carolina.  Trump's advantage this week is an anomaly. He has been heavily outspent by Clinton since the general election began early this past summer.  Three-quarters of the $342 million so far spent on television ads in the general election comes from Clinton's campaign, super PAC, and allies, according to a CNN analysis of the Kantar Media data.    Clinton's campaign itself is responsible for nearly half -- 46% -- of television advertising spending, or $158 million.  Trump's campaign, in contrast, is responsible for only 13% of ad spending. His campaign has spent only $44 million and a handful of groups supporting him has spent another $40 million, according to the data.  There are a few reasons for the disparity. While Clinton was running general election ads -- seeking to define both herself and her opponent -- in June and July, Trump sat on the sidelines. His ad campaign began in mid-August with modest buys in only four states.  When Trump did finally start buying TV ad time, he has typically been outspent by Clinton. The greatest disparity came in mid-September, when Clinton bought $12 million in airtime to Trump's $622,000.  In addition, the super PACs supporting Trump are significantly less funded and less organized than the groups supporting Clinton. Some deep-pocketed Republican contributors have also steered clear of the presidential race out of discomfort with the nominee.   Not surprisingly, both campaigns have spent more on Florida, the largest up-for-grabs state on the electoral map, than in any other state, according to the Kantar Media/CMAG data.  At about $43 million, Clinton's spend in Florida is nearly twice what she spent on the next-closest state, Ohio. She has also spent $57 million on national cable, ensuring voters around the country -- not just in swing states -- see her messages.  Trump has also poured a large portion of his ad budget into Florida, but overall has spent far less than Clinton. His ad spending in the Sunshine State comes to about $12 million.

She goes around to other countries and other nations, negotiates with their leaders, comes back and nothing ever happens.""Deadspin first resurfaced the New York Daily News story on Tuesday. When asked if she had any response to the New York Daily News report of Trump's remarks, Rice simply wrote back, ""Exactly. Can't wait until November 9!""Video from CNN's archives located after initial publication of this story shows Trump saying the following: ""I wish she was a bitch. I don't care if she's a lovely woman. I want somebody that can go and make deals. She goes to countries, nothing ever happens. Except sound bytes."" The archived video only shows a small part of Trump's speech.Rice took aim at Trump earlier this month on her Facebook page following the revelation of his 2005 hot mic comments where he said he could force himself on women.""Enough! Donald Trump should not be president. He should withdraw,"" she wrote on her page on October 8.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his 2006 comments.Steve Felt, an attendee at the event who was quoted in the New York Daily News report, told CNN's KFile on Tuesday before the new video had surface that he remembered Trump calling Rice a bitch.""He went on a tirade about politics, probably 15 minutes into his talk about real estate,"" Felt said. ""Most people weren't there to hear about politics and most people left. I left after about 45 minutes.""Trump made numerous speeches in the mid-2000s for the Learning Annex, a company which provides continuing education courses for adults.A partial video, from a March 2007 speech in Toronto, starts with Trump mid-sentence, saying, ""bitch, do you believe this? So I took heat,"" before he goes onto explain what he had said about Rice.""But what I said was this, she gets out an airplane cameras all over the place and she waves, 'hi.' She then goes and sits down with some dictator, they put the chairs at 45 degree angle and they have a photo shoot and she waves, 'hi, hi everybody.' She then gets back on the plane and she waves again and nothing happens,"" he said. ""Has she made any deals? Honestly, has this woman made one deal that anybody knows, even if it was a bad deal. I'd even take a bad deal. She doesn't make any deals.""Representatives for the Learning Annex and the Javits Center did not respond to requests for comment from CNN's KFile on this story.Trump was more diplomatic speaking to CNN's Wolf Blitzer in 2007 on the former secretary of state.""And Condoleezza Rice, who's a lovely woman, but she never makes a deal,"" Trump said. She doesn't make deals. She waves. She gets off the plane. She waves. She sits down with some dictator, 45-degree angle. They do the camera shot. She waves again. Gets back on the plane. She waves.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/donald-trump-rigged-election/index.html	"The Republican presidential nominee's claim that the election is being rigged against him represents the most outlandish moment yet in a campaign devoted to dismantling political norms.Trump might not be the first candidate to feel nefarious forces are moving to keep him from the White House -- presidential elections have occasionally been disputed after votes are counted and have often been marred by accusations of dark instruments of fraud, such as the dead casting votes.Reality Check: Trump's claims of 'large scale' voter fraudBut Trump's claim three weeks before Election Day -- as many voters are already going to the polls -- that the race is being being deliberately stacked against him by a fearful political establishment flies in the face of historical precedent. And should he lose, it threatens the legitimacy of those left to govern after the most anarchic election in modern history. ""Remember, we are competing in a rigged election,"" Trump said at a Wisconsin rally Monday night. ""They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.""His accusations alone, experts say, could inflict long-standing damage on the US political system itself by eroding trust in the probity of the electoral process.Ever since a weary George Washington rode home to Mount Vernon in 1797, American democracy has rested on a cherished principle: the transfer of power from an outgoing president to a successor widely seen as legitimate.""The most important thing in the system is that the winners win and the losers lose,"" said Mark Braden, former chief counsel of the Republican National Committee. ""Almost as important as that is that the rational people that support the loser believes that the winner won.""One of Trump's GOP primary rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, rejected Trump's claims that the election is being ""rigged.""""This election is not being rigged,"" Rubio, who is now seeking re-election to his Senate seat, said in a debate Monday against Democratic challenger Rep. Patrick Murphy. ""There is no evidence behind any of this, so this should not continue to be said.""Trump's accusations come as his campaign slips further behind Democrat Hillary Clinton three weeks from Election Day, prompting him to deal in ever more conspiratorial claims that shield him from culpability in his own fate. And there is every sign that his most loyal supporters accept his warnings that a ""horror show"" is taking place and that the election could be ""stolen.""Tight races remain in three battlegrounds: Nevada, North Carolina and OhioHistory has seen accusations of election-swaying before, from John F. Kennedy's henchmen allegedly cheating Richard Nixon out of the presidency in 1960 to the infamous hanging chads of the Florida recount in 2000. But Trump's repeated claims that the election is already being rigged are the electoral equivalent of the nuclear option. Essentially, he is saying in advance that the election is illegitimate rather than challenging the results after signs of wrongdoing once the votes are counted.""History is replete with illegal things going on during elections, but at this point in the 21st Century, to make the grandiose statement like Trump is -- that the election is rigged is bogus -- it is anti-democratic spirit, it is anti-American at its core,"" said CNN historian Douglas Brinkley from Rice University on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday.And election officials are pushing back.Ohio's Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted told CNN's Carol Costello on Monday that his state makes it easy to vote but hard to cheat.""I can assure Donald Trump that I am in charge of elections in Ohio, and they're not going to be rigged. I'll make sure of that,"" Husted said.But Trump has been long been warning that the election could be stacked against him.He claimed that the Republican primary race could be rigged against him, and used the idea that he and his followers were being persecuted by the political establishment as a device to motivate his political base.Sound familiar? Trump called 2012 vote a 'total sham'He has returned to the theme of a venomous Washington political establishment rigging the vote on and off for weeks. He claimed in West Palm Beach on Thursday that the media was in lock-step with Clinton's campaign as part of a global conspiracy by fearful elites to make her president.But his accusations hit a new intensity late last week and over the weekend.""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD"" Trump tweeted on Sunday.""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" Trump added on Monday.Trump has also raised doubts about the integrity of the election in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, and has several times urged supporters to show up at polling places to ensure no fraud is perpetrated -- an order that appears to risk voter intimidation.But Trump ally Rudolph Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that he would have to be a ""moron"" to assume that there would be no electoral fraud in Democratic-run cities like Philadelphia and Chicago.Yet there's no actual evidence that Trump's claims about 2016 are true, and the billionaire has certainly not provided any suggesting a massive fraud -- unknown in US history -- is under way.""We have had corruption in the 19th century ... there have been controversies when elections were contested and decided in Congress, such as in 1824,"" said Princeton University history professor Julian Zelizer, referring to a vote ultimately decided by the House of Representatives. The presidency was awarded to John Quincy Adams after none of the four candidates won a majority of the electoral votes.""But it is virtually impossible in 2016 to rig an entire election,"" Zelizer said. ""It is decentralized, it's fragmented, and there is very little evidence that this could happen.""RELATED: Rep. Peter King: The election isn't rigged against TrumpSeveral recent academic and government studies have also shown infinitesimal levels of electoral fraud, despite claims by Republicans that it is widespread -- an effort liberals say is part of a widespread campaign to restrict poll access that could disproportionately disqualify minority voters who tend to back Democrats.Meanwhile, pressure is rising on key Republicans to repudiate Trump's claims.House Speaker Paul Ryan released a statement through a spokeswoman on Saturday saying that he is fully confident ""the states will carry out this election with integrity.""But neither Ryan, nor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have spoken out in person.For fraud to take place, Republican officials who are in charge of the voting systems in swing states like Ohio, Florida, Iowa and North Carolina would have to turn a blind eye towards conduct designed to keep their own party nominee from the presidency -- or participate in doing so.Trump's own running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, appeared to split with his partner on Sunday. ""We will absolutely accept the results of the election,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""On Monday, however, he suggested that irregularities were a real problem and embraced Trump's notion that the media elite are an extension of the Clinton campaign and therefore also part of the hoodwinking.RELATED: Giuliani on rigged election: 'Dead people generally vote for Democrats'Given that Trump has branded himself in politics, business and life as the ultimate winner, the prospect of a crushing defeat in November on the grandest stage must be a bitter one. So pre-spinning a possible defeat may represent a face-saving way out.""He is hedging himself against a loss: If he does lose, he can say that is a fraud,"" said Jessica Lavariega-Monforti, chair of the Department of Politics at Pace University, New York.He might also think a close election is likely and is laying the groundwork for a legal challenge.Much now depends on whether Trump pulls off a come-from-behind victory, in which case he will presumably withdraw his accusations of fraud, or claims that a loss is the product of widespread electoral fraud -- charges that could prompt many Americans to view a Clinton presidency as illegitimate.But should he have second thoughts and choose to fall into line with historical precedent in the dying moments of his campaign, he has plenty of examples to look to.In 1960, Nixon chose not to challenge the result even though some advisors wanted him to, reasoning that he could damage his own political future and that the fate of the nation was on the line.""I want Senator Kennedy to know ... and I want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend does continue, and he does become our next president, that he will have my wholehearted support,"" Nixon told supporters on election night.In 2000, after the Supreme Court closed off his last hope of claiming Florida and a majority of Electoral College votes after a bitter, weeks-long fight, Vice President Al Gore conceded to George W. Bush with grace.""Almost a century and a half ago, Sen. Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, 'Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.' "" Gore said.""Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country,"" Gore said.The question now, after a deeply rancorous election that has cleaved partisan divides ever deeper, is whether either Trump or Clinton could summon those words about each other three weeks from Tuesday."
