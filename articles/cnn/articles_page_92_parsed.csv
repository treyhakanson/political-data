CNN Politics will host a live blog offering instant analysis and reaction as the debate unfolds at the top of the page, and CNN's Reality Check Team will also conduct live fact-checking.The Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan organization that manages the official contests, will host the 90-minute, commercial-free event at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas.Fox News' Chris Wallace is slated to moderate the debate. He announced his intended topics for the debate last week. They are debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, Supreme Court, foreign hot spots and fitness to be president. This final debate will be a return to the format from the first presidential debate. Clinton and Trump will each face direct questions from the moderator for six, 15-minute periods, each corresponding to one of Wallace's six announced topics, although those are subject to changes. Both candidates will have two minutes to answer, and then the discussion will move forward as the moderator allows. Third-party candidates like Gary Johnson, Jill Stein and Evan McMullin failed to qualify for this event due to low polling, meaning they will ultimately not join Clinton and Trump on stage for any of the official events. Less than a month away from Election Day, this will be the last chance voters get to see Clinton and Trump face off, side-by-side.	Third presidential debate format and topics	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,"" the statement added. ""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow -- the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.""The announcement was referring to the breach of Democratic National Committee emails and the sites of other Democratic Party-linked organizations disclosed over the summer."

""This was an act of political terrorism and I have to tell you how inspired I am to see the way this community has come together and people have come together to continue to move forward undeterred, unintimidated by this senseless act of violence and we are truly inspired.""The Indiana governor, who is campaigning in North Carolina for the day, made the unannounced stop at the offices of the Orange County Republican Party outside of Raleigh to bring attention to the incident and show solidarity, he told reporters.Hillsborough police said they are still processing evidence from the scene and they are receiving assistance from the FBI, North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.A bottle of flammable liquid was thrown through the Orange County Republican headquarters, police said.Pence went inside the charred office while the Orange County GOP chairman Daniel Ashley explained to the candidate what they knew so far about the incident and the layout of the office, pointing to a spot where he used to sleep on a couch. The furniture had gone up in flames.""An attack on our political system is an attack on us all,"" Pence said.During a news conference, Pence was asked about running mate Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the election will be ""rigged.""""I believe in local participation. There is no question whether it be in the state of Indiana, or in states around the country that in recent years we have had instances, proven instances of voter fraud,"" Pence said. ""That is why Donald Trump and I are encouraging all of our supporters around the country, and frankly every American whatever their politics, to take the opportunity to be involved in a respectful way in providing accountability at our polling places."" He added: ""The one person, one vote principle is the very bedrock of our democracy and insuring through participation in the process of assembling the vote between now and November 8 is a certain way that the American people can ensure the integrity of this election and I'm confident that we will do that."""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/indiana-voter-registration-investigation/index.html	"The investigation was prompted after Indiana voters contacted the Indiana secretary of state's office to report that their date of birth or first name was incorrect on their voter registration forms. Officials do not believe the database was hacked.""These records were changed on paper forms, at the (Bureau of Motor Vehicles) and online. At this time, my office is not sure why these records were changed, but we have evaluated the Statewide Voter Registration System and have found no indication it has been compromised. We believe this may be a case of voter fraud and have turned our findings over to the state police, who are currently conducting an investigation into alleged voter fraud,"" Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson said in a statement.  Lawson's office turned their findings over to the Indiana State Police late Monday.Earlier this month, the Indiana State Police investigated other allegations of voter fraud in 56 counties in the state. As part of that investigation, police raided the offices the Indiana Voter Registration Project, a subsidiary operation of the Patriot Majority US, a nonprofit advocacy organization.While the secretary of state's office did not indicate if officials believe the two investigations of possible voter fraud are related, the police said they will seek to see if there is a ""specific connection.""Federal lawsuit filed in Virginia on voter registration system crash""(T)he changing of a first name and/or date of birth is consistent with what we are seeing on a number of voter registration applications submitted by (the Indiana Voter Registration Project),"" Indiana State Police said in a statement to CNN.Patriot Majority USA responded to accusations of possible voter fraud earlier this month, saying they are completely false. The group says they are instead the target of a ""partisan agenda"" to suppress thousands of African-American voters in Indiana, and they have referred the situation to the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.  ""This Republican effort to suppress the vote is a violation of civil rights, but it is also a dangerous and cynical move that undermines law-enforcement's relations with its own citizens. We are going to shine a light on this intimidation and misconduct,"" the group said in a statement.For Indiana voters who may have been affected by the registration confusion, the secretary of state's office said they may still be eligible to vote on November 8 but can only do so through the county election offices or the state voting website."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/georgia-voter-lawsuit-aclu-matthew/index.html	"Some Southern states extended their deadlines to accommodate residents who may have been prevented from registering to vote because of the storm. Georgia, where state officials called upon more than half a million residents to evacuate coastal areas, did not extend the voter registration deadline.  The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit late Monday against Georgia officials for failing to extend the state's voter registration period.""Thousands of Georgians will be prevented from participating in the November election,"" Kathleen Burch, interim counsel for the ACLU of Georgia, said in a statement. ""This is unethical and illegal."" The lawsuit accuses Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal and Secretary of State Brian Kemp of acting in violation of the Constitution, the Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act. It also claims the state's refusal to extend the deadline discriminates against African Americans, who tend to vote for Democrats. Both Deal and Kemp are Republicans.Deal's office declined to comment and referred CNN to Kemp's office. ""These liberal groups need to stop trying to change the rules so late in the game and let county officials move forward with early voting and issuing absentee ballots, both of which are already ongoing,"" Kemp spokeswoman Candice Broce said in an email.'Affront to the democratic process'Brunswick, Georgia resident J'Mari Bethea, 18, had planned to register to vote in Glynn County on October 6.According to the ACLU's lawsuit, Deal ordered an evacuation six days before the end of the voter registration period. Bethea, one of the roughly 500,000 people affected by the mandatory order, returned home five days later -- on the day of the deadline.Bethea tried to register, but there was a problem: The power was out, so he couldn't access the Secretary of State's website. Likewise, the US Post Office and local government offices had suspended services in Glynn County, the lawsuit said.Despite the fact that thousands were in Bethea's position, state officials did not grant an extension following the storm, according to the lawsuit.Julie Ebenstein, a staff attorney with the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said Deal's opposition was an ""affront to the democratic process and to voter participation in this critical election."" Some states extend, Georgia digs inLast week, the Florida Democratic Party and several other groups filed a lawsuit against Florida officials over their refusal to extend the deadline. The legal challenge followed registration extensions in North Carolina and South Carolina after Matthew came through.Ultimately, a federal judge ordered Florida officials to extend its deadline. Given those extensions, the ACLU now wants a judge to order Georgia to take similar action.""The fact that registration activity is particularly high during this period is well-known to state and local election officials,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Nevertheless, without any legitimate justification, the state simply refused to follow examples of neighboring states and extend the voter registration deadline in response to this natural disaster.""Ahead of the 2012 election, more than 77,000 Georgians registered to vote during the final days before the deadline, the ACLU said. Nearly half of those signing up to vote near the deadline were black, the lawsuit said.""Tens of thousands of voters -- who relied on the state's published October 11, 2016, registration deadline, but then found themselves unable to register during the last few days of the registration period -- likely lost their opportunity to register to vote as a consequence,"" the lawsuit said.Kemp's office pointed out that South Carolina moved its deadline for mailed applications only, and they moved it to the same day as Georgia's existing deadline. ""Georgia voters in affected areas actually had more opportunities to register than their counterparts in South Carolina,"" Broce said.""We were paying close attention to the situation on the coast with Hurricane Matthew, but changing deadlines so close to the election is a bad idea and makes an orderly election more difficult.""Six more daysOn October 14, three days after the deadline, a federal judge ordered Georgia to extend the voter registration deadline in Chatham County. Chatham, where Savannah is located, is the most populous of the state's six coastal counties.""[It was] the right thing to do,"" U.S. District Judge William Moore Jr. said But Deal's and Kemp's offices have refused to extend the deadline for the other five coastal counties -- Bryan, Camden, Glynn, Liberty and McIntosh -- despite several letters from voter rights groups.The ACLU's lawsuit asks a judge to give residents of those five counties an additional six days to register. If the deadline is extended, WickFORCE, a Glynn County voter registration group and a plaintiff in the ACLU lawsuit, would be able to get back precious days of canvassing that it lost during Matthew. With fallen trees and downed power lines, WickFORCE had to suspend canvassing efforts for four days. The group operates in areas with high percentages of minorities.""There is a long history of official discrimination in voting in Georgia against African Americans, who also suffer from the effects of discrimination in many other areas of socio-economic life, including disparities in employment, health, education, and access to transportation,"" the lawsuit said. ""These disparities make the costs of voter registration more burdensome for African Americans."""	ACLU sues Georgia over voter registration deadline	['Moore', 'Deal']	[]

""I think he's going to make as big a mess as he can.""Without evidence, Trump has been making the claim on the campaign trail that the general election will be ""rigged"" to favor Hillary Clinton -- a claim Trump also made in 2012, when he called Mitt Romney's loss to President Barack Obama a ""sham.""The rock icon slammed Trump's talk of a ""rigged"" election and said that Trump is making those comments because he knows he is going to lose the election.""He's going to lose and he knows that.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/donald-trump-presidential-polls/index.html	"""Even though we're doing pretty well in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore,"" Trump said Tuesday during a rally here.The comment was a head-spinning reversal for a candidate who has cited polls on the campaign trail more than any other presidential candidate this cycle, and perhaps more than any other presidential candidate in modern political history.But the reversal comes as a slew of recent polls have shown Trump sinking in the presidential race, trailing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in nearly every major national and battleground state poll.Trump's tumbling stock in the presidential race comes on the heels of a series of damaging revelations, which started with a 2005 audio recording in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without their consent and continued with nearly a dozen women alleging that Trump did those very things to them.A poll on Tuesday from the University of Houston even showed Clinton within just 3 points of Trump in Texas, a state that has not elected a Democrat to major statewide office in decades.Trump's dismissal of polling on Tuesday comes as he has ramped up his rhetoric in the last week in decrying -- without evidence -- what he deems to be a ""rigged system.""Trump has complained about individual polls throughout his campaign for president and last week declared at a rally that ""even the polls are crooked,"" but Trump went further Tuesday saying he doesn't ""believe the polls anymore.""And the polls Trump is decrying now are run by the same news organizations and academic groups as those Trump has frequently cited at his rallies and blasted out to his millions of followers on Twitter since he kicked off his campaign in June 2015.During the primary, Trump frequently opened his rally by boasting about his lead over his Republican primary rivals by citing one new poll or another. That continued in recent months as some polling showed Trump leading or in a tight race with Clinton.But by Trump's own admission earlier month, you don't talk about the polls when you're losing.""When we do badly, I don't talk about the polls,"" he said. ""When we're doing well, I talk about the polls."""	Donald Trump declares: 'I don't believe the polls anymore'elieve the polls anymore'	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/unanswered-questions-2016-election/index.html	"But even with the end in sight, many of the questions animating this election season's seamiest subplots are no closer to being answered.Hacks and leaks, unknown sources and unseen footage -- the search for answers has taken us down some unlikely roads and helped to introduce a new generation of unsavory characters to the mainstream political scene. Donald Trump, waylaid by a single ""Access Hollywood"" outtake, has embraced and peddled a series of (debunked) conspiracy theories about his opponent. For Hillary Clinton, emails -- her own and those of her top campaign officials -- have been her bête noire, a seemingly endless stream of curious and occasionally damaging revelations.But for all the confusion, sleights and distractions, fundamental and serious mysteries remain. Here are seven of them:1. How will Donald Trump react on the morning after -- win or lose?In the event of a loss: If his behavior in 2012 is any indication, he can be expected to tweet a call for the overthrow of the federal government by around 11:30 p.m. ET. In the event of a win: Generally speaking, there are two paths to go. The first, as envisioned by top Republican allies, would have a newly empowered Trump reverse course, moderate his tone, and become a rubber stamp for House Speaker Paul Ryan's long-desired budget reform package. The other would involve efforts to construct a massive wall on the border with Mexico and the implementations of some kind of ban on the immigration of Muslims into the United States. To start.  But really, it's anyone's guess.  2. Who leaked the 'Access Hollywood' video?If the first option wins out and Trump loses his bid, the leaked tape of his 2005 chat with former ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush could be regarded as the fatal blow.Clinton led in the polls when the video, in which Trump is heard telling Bush that he can get away with sexually assaulting women because of his ""star"" status, was obtained and published by the Washington Post. But the blowback, fueled by a rash of accusations suggesting Trump's comments weren't just ""locker room talk,"" seems to have cut off any realistic path to an electoral majority.So how did this damning document land in the public domain? (Popular theory: a frustrated NBC employee -- the company had the goods, but were slow to break the news -- losing patience and making the fateful delivery.)3. Who leaked Trump's tax returns -- and what's in the rest of them?Another flashpoint in the campaign: Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, an American political tradition going back decades, has invited to skepticism over his declared riches, claims to charitable giving, federal tax payments and business ties.  So when The New York Times confirmed an anonymous tip revealing that Trump reported a nearly $1 billion loss in 1995, a hard enough hit to get him off the federal tax hook for two decades, two new questions sprung up in a hurry:1) Who had access to the returns and the desire to see them made public? (Popular theory: Someone very close to Trump.)2) If the packages mailed out to the Times and at at least one other outlet contained three pages of returns from one year, what else remains hidden? (Popular theory: More of the same.)4. Who hacked John Podesta's Gmail account and the DNC's internal email?Top government officials -- straight up to the White House -- have pointed the finger at Moscow. ""The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said in a joint statement earlier this month. ""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process."" But even as Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's personal and professional emails continue drip, drip, dripping out, consensus over the source of the hack remains elusive.""I mean, it could be Russia,"" Trump allowed during the first presidential debate, before suggesting China and ""somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds"" as alternative options.In the second debate, Trump presented another theory: ""Maybe there is no hacking.""5. What's on 'The Apprentice' outtake videos?Again, there are a lot of theories and speculation. One former producer from Trump's reality series, ""The Apprentice,"" tweeted after the ""Access Hollywood"" video that there were ""far worse"" clips in the vault. But even with WikiLeaks on the case, the potential for another disclosure seems to be diminishing. In a joint statement, producer Mark Burnett and MGM, which owns his production company, cited ""various contractual and legal requirements"" as their reason for sealing the vault.6. How many unread Clinton emails are out there -- and will they ever be made public?Read one way, we actually have an answer! There are about 5,600 emails, all from Clinton's private server, that the State Department has said are likely work-related and will be released in the weeks before the election. But when you factor in the batch Clinton's lawyers deemed personal and had destroyed -- the material you are never, in all likelihood, going to see -- the figure soars to more than 30,000. Short answer: The world may never know.7. Who emerges victorious from the Republican Party cage fight?With Trump currently in freefall, openly attacking House Speaker Paul Ryan and comparing ""disloyal R's"" unfavorably to ""Crooked Hillary"" herself, it's hard to predict where the GOP's coming (ongoing?) civil war will lead.Assuming Trump loses, the first question will be whether he tries to keep his movement together, creating (for example) an ""America First"" party and perhaps splitting the GOP in a historically damaging way.Or he might just band together with Breitbart media execs and start ""Trump TV.""The conventional wisdom here says Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse could emerge as potential post-Trump leader. He's been #NeverTrump since before it was cool while maintaining his deep red conservative cred. But more trials -- maybe even ""show trials"" -- await.   "	Mysteries of 2016: 7 unanswered questions	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Sasse']	[]
8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/west-york-pennsylvania-mayor-charles-wasko/index.html	"The West York council called Charles Wasko's social media posts ""divisive and deplorable"" in an official press release. Wasko had posted a picture of a monkey and likened it to First Lady Michelle Obama, as well as a wagon of orangutans, captioned ""moving day at the White House.""After accepting Wasko's resignation, the council voted for Shawn Mauck to succeed him through the end of 2017.Mauck declined to provide Wasko's resignation letter due to what he said was personal information it contained. Wasko did not respond Tuesday to a CNN request for comment.The calls for Wasko's resignation began in late September after various posts of his came to light. One called Obama and Hillary Clinton the leaders of ISIS and another depicted Clinton behind bars. Another image showed a picture of Clint Eastwood holding a noose with the text ""Barry, this rope is for you. Wanna bring that empty chair over here?"" a reference to the actor's 2012 Republican convention stunt.But last month, Wasko was defiant in an interview when asked about the Facebook posts.""I'm not going to deny I did that, and, in fact, I'm proud of that,"" he told CNN. ""I'm an anti-Obama and I'm an anti-Hillary fan. And I'm proud of that.""""Colin Kaepernick has the right to say what he wants to say and so do I,"" Wasko added, referring to the San Francisco 49ers quarterback who has drawn controversy by not standing for the national anthem.At the time, Wasko vowed that he would not resign and and would seek re-election."

""If not, I think we begin from ground zero and with lots of different factions and lots of different candidates.""Rollins said he assumed a 2020 Republican primary would have many of the same candidates, naming Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.While he serves as chair the super PAC backing Trump, Rollins has been candid in his assessments of the race. In August, when Trump was under fire for comments he made attacking the Khan family and Republican leaders, he said Trump would likely ""lose badly"" if the election was held then."
