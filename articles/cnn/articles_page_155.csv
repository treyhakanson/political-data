""It just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing,"" he said. ""You are seeing it, I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte, a great place, and you just see it. There's somewhat -- and I see it even going out. There's such a lack of spirit. There's a lack of something, something that's going on that's bad, and what's going on between police and others is getting worse.""Trump had also discussed the tension between police and the communities they serve in a pre-taped town hall that was set to air on Fox News Wednesday night, but which was preempted by coverage of the Charlotte protests. During the town hall, Trump proposed expanding the use of the controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" program by police. ""I think you have to,"" the Republican nominee said at the town hall. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""Trump elaborated on his call for ""stop-and-frisk"" in the interview on ""Fox and Friends"" Thursday morning, saying he was only referring to expanding its use to Chicago, where he said gun violence was particularly severe.  ""(Former NYPD Commissioner) Ray Kelly did a great job, and New York was not in a Chicago situation, but it was really in trouble,"" Trump said. ""But stop-and-frisk worked. We had tremendous shootings, numbers of shootings. Now Chicago is out of control. I was really referring to Chicago stop-and-frisk. They asked me about Chicago.""Under stop and frisk, police stop people on the street who they deem suspicious and then search them on the spot for guns and drugs, among other things. New York City's stop-and-frisk program was mired in controversy, leading to numerous complaints that the practice led to racial profiling. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the program was unconstitutional because it unlawfully targeted blacks and Latinos, although stop and frisk was not banned.Trump also expressed doubts about the ability of cities like Charlotte to build trust in divided communities.""If you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue,"" Trump said, referencing the murder of five Dallas police officers by a sniper over the summer after videos showing two African-American men shot by police in Louisiana and Minnesota spurred protests and debate over police use of force across the country.""They prided themselves on dialogue, and they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups. And that was a pretty tough situation, to put it mildly."""	Donald Trump: 'There's a lack of spirit between the white and the black'

And a lot of people were asking me the questions,"" Trump said in an interview with local Columbus, Ohio station WSYX, when asked what had changed his position. ""And we want to talk about jobs. We want to talk about the military. We want to talk about ISIS and how to get rid of ISIS.""The Republican presidential nominee questioned whether Obama had been born in the US -- which he was -- for years, including for years after Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011.In the two weeks before he asserted that Obama ""was born in the United States,"" Trump was asked on four separate occasions about his birther views and whether he stood by them -- and declined to disavow those views each time, saying simply that he doesn't ""talk about that anymore.""A spokesman for Hillary Clinton's campaign said Trump's years-long held position undermined the country's first African-American president.""He only gave his 36-second press statement last week to try to change the subject -- and it didn't work,"" said Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson.Trump was also asked in the interview Wednesday about his use of Trump foundation funds -- which come largely from outside donors -- to resolve personal legal matters. Asked about the practice, which The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, Trump said simply that the foundation ""gives money to vets and it's really been doing a good job.""""And I think we put that to sleep just by putting out the last report,"" Trump said, apparently pointing to a campaign statement Tuesday night in which his spokesman deflected questions about the Trump Foundation and accused the Post reporter of bias."

A long-serving Republican senator, he was among the first members of the so-called GOP ""establishment"" to throw his support behind the eventual nominee during the primary, and has been a fixture of the Trump campaign since.  ""They should objectively analyze who is likely to advance best the agenda they favor and the agenda the Republicans who supported them favored. And that's clearly Donald Trump,"" Sessions said. The Alabama Republican also noted that ""millions of Americans, including this one, worked their hearts out for the Bushes in 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2004. And it wasn't Bill Clinton that helped the Bushes get elected. It was the same voters, in large part, that elected Ronald Reagan and stand to elect Donald Trump.""The elder Bush is the only member of the family whose support for Clinton has become public. Jeb Bush, whom Trump defeated during the primary, has said he won't support the nominee, and former President George W. Bush has declined to reveal his presidential preference.For Sessions, though, the choice is simple, and he expressed puzzlement about the Bush family. RELATED: Ivanka Trump huddles with female Republican members of Congress in Washington""I think they're not thinking clearly enough about this,"" Sessions told the Washington Examiner. ""They're not ... appreciating half the American people, virtually, that have been supportive of Republicans. A lot of them preferred somebody other than Bush candidates, but they rallied around them when it came to November. So I would hope that we see more rallying.""And to other Republicans, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who have argued Trump isn't conservative enough to lead the party, Sessions says ""that's ridiculous."" ""At this point in history, it's the William F. Buckley test -- who is the most conservative candidate that can win the presidency? Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? On taxes, on regulations, on judges, on law enforcement â€” all these are conservative positions. What is the problem here? I just feel on issue after issue he's been firmly in the conservative, classical Republican conservative view.""RELATED: The GOP's next civil war is brewing"	Sessions says Bushes 'should remember the loyalty they were given'

And just like the polls in Ohio, the booths are pretty close -- maybe too close.""We had a life size cut out of Hillary Clinton but somebody took it,"" said a Democratic volunteer.The volunteer wasn't pointing any fingers but this year the political shenanigans aren't limited to the fair grounds. In this key battleground state, both campaigns are reaching out to some very unlikely voters.For the Trump campaign, that would be Jeff Hill. ""Yeah, Donald Trump""s who I'm voting for,"" Hill said. 2016: Last call for working class whites?He is a disaffected Democrat, drawn by Trump's promise to ""make America great again."" Hill is exactly the demographic Trump appeals to -- older, white and blue collar. Census numbers show Ohio has more voters like him than any other battleground state.It explains why Trump is in Ohio almost every week, showing up on traditional Democratic turf like factory towns, coal fields even Union halls. The Republican nominee recently appeared at the Canfield Fair, Ohio's largest county fair, where he drew a huge crowd in a county where Republicans rarely get more than 35% of the vote.Bob Paduchik, Trump's Ohio campaign director, credits Trump's message of security and fairer trade deals.""I think that resonates not just with Republicans but also Independents and Democrats,"" he said.Trump isn't the only one after non typical voters.Donald Trump: 'There's a lack of spirit between the white and the black'The Clinton campaign has set its sights on suburban neighborhoods like Powell just north of Columbus, which is predominantly white, upper middle class and rich in Republicans. The Clinton campaign believes some voters here might side with the Democratic nominee if they're unable to stomach the idea of voting for Trump.Some Republicans don't need much selling.Sherrie Scarton has been a long time conservative voting for Ronald Reagan, John McCain and Mitt Romney. She even voted for Ohio Governor John Kasich in the primary. But she is not voting for Trump. ""Hillary's a smart woman and Trump is just, I hate to say it, he's a maniac,"" she said.But Paul Beck, a political science professor at The Ohio State University, isn't so sure this kind of political sniping is enough to win an election. He thinks many Ohio voters haven't made up their minds how they will vote or even if they will vote at all. ""What events occur between now and November 8th, what the debates look like what kind of terrorism activity -- there are all these kind of things that are out there in the firmament that can have an impact on what people end up doing in Election 2016,"" Beck said.

Success of 'moderation'But the Iranian President, who faces an election in May and has been sharply criticized by hardliners for making concessions the US to accomplish the nuclear pact, did offer some positive words about the agreement.The ability of Iran and world powers to negotiate the deal indicates ""the success we can achieve through moderation, constructive interaction, dialogue -- the policy that brought an end to a long, complicated and unnecessary crisis by adopting a win-win approach,"" he told the gathered international luminaries.He added that ""it was a political deal that also represents a creative method ... to resolving international challenges.""But Rouhani still lit into the US at one point for its ""lack of compliance"" with the terms, saying that ""represents a flawed approach that should be rectified forthwith.""And he warned Washington that any failure to implement it ""will further erode the credibility of the US in the world.""US rejects accusationsThe US rejected the accusation that it is failing to keep up its end of the bargain. ""The United States has and will continue to implement its commitments under the deal with good faith and without exception,"" said a US State Department official, who added America has ""unequivocally met"" its terms and has ""made absolutely clear that we are committed to full and effective implementation of our sanctions-related commitments.""After Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities, years of tough economic sanctions were lifted under the deal, allowing Tehran's oil to be sold internationally. Iran has been frustrated that it has not seen more of an economic benefit stemming from the deal, with many countries still wary of doing business with the country.Spread of terrorRouhani's critique didn't stop there, blaming global powers' post 9/11 security strategies for ""the genesis of borderless violence and terrorism"" in the world.Speaking in New York 15 years after the mass terror attack, he said that ""no one imagined that this occurrence would lead to larger disasters resulting in a devastating war in the Middle East and the spread of insecurity across the globe.""Inside 9/11: The day that never endsHe pointed to the plight of the Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Afghan and Palestinian people, while calling on neighbors to ""stop bombing each other and accept responsibility for past mistakes"".Saudi ArabiaIran's President also pointed his finger at regional rival Saudi Arabia, warning that the country must ""cease and desist from divisive policies"" if peace is to be found in the Middle East.""If the Saudi government is serious about its vision for development and regional security, it must cease and desist from divisive policies, spread of hate ideology, and trampling upon the rights of neighbors,"" Rouhani told world leaders.Senate rejects bid to block US-Saudi Arabia arms dealShi'ite-led Iran and the Saudi Arabian Sunni monarchy are on opposing sides of the Syrian conflict, with Iran sending forces and advisers to back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while its rival supports Syrian rebel groups.They are also divided over Yemen. The Saudis have accused Iran of backing the Houthi rebels, who seized power from the government in March. At least 30 Yemeni civilians were killed Wednesday in Saudi-led airstrikes in the port region of Hodieda. "	Iran's Rouhani slams US 'lack of compliance' with nuclear deal

Multiple members of the group, which includes dozens of African-American members of Congress, have spoken out following the death of Terence Crutcher, who was shot and killed last week in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.""He posed no threat. He had no weapon. And yet he was confronted by the Tulsa Police Department and he was both tasered and shot to death,"" said New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman in a video posted on the caucus' page.

Yet Clinton still has an easier path to 270 electoral votes, due in no small part to Virginia and Colorado, two states expected to be battlegrounds that Clinton had been thought to have put away early in the race. Trump would have more paths to the White House should those states become more competitive.Quinnipiac surveyed likely voters from September 13 to September 21, and the margin of error is 3.9 percentage points in Colorado and Georgia, 3.8 points in Virginia and 4 points in Iowa.
