Ronald Lewis was fired last year as the senior military assistant to Carter after the Defense Department began a probe into allegations of misconduct.In a report by the Pentagon Inspector General, investigators said Lewis misused his government charge card for personal expenses, made false statements about his use of the card, drank in excess in public and had improper interactions with female subordinates.""I expect the highest possible standards of conduct from the men and women in this department particularly from those serving in the most senior positions. There is no exception,"" Carter said in a written statement.In his role at the time, Lewis had power to control the flow of people and issues into Carter's office, as well as handling the defense chief's schedule.The investigation revealed an April 2015 incident when Lewis, who was accompanying Carter on official travel, visited a strip club in Seoul, South Korea, where he charged $1,121.25 on his government credit card and left an 81% tip, according to the report.The ""Candy Bar"" club was in a part of Seoul known as ""Hooker Hill"" where many establishments have been declared off limits to military personnel because of their ties to illicit activities such as prostitution.According to the report, Lewis subsequently denied using the card at the establishment and disputed the charges to the bank.Lewis, a married father and highly decorated officer who graduated West Point, acknowledged in a statement that he ""made some of the mistakes"" outlined in the report, but he ""strongly"" disputed many of the report's findings, although he did not specify which ones.""From the onset, this process was unfairly influenced by statements made and actions taken at the highest levels of the Department of Defense,"" Lewis said in the statement issued by his lawyer. On a trip with Carter to Rome in October 2015, the report said Lewis used his government credit card to cover a $1,755.98 tab at another adult establishment known as the ""Cica Cica Boom"" club, which advertised ""sexy show"" and ""lap dance"" on a sign outside, after the charge on his personal debit card was declined.Lewis was accompanied by a ""female foreign national"" employee of the strip club back to his hotel to retrieve his government credit card from a subordinate who was holding it for him. The subordinate, who was staying on the same floor as Carter, ""felt like something very wrong was about to happen, but I wasn't in a place to tell him,"" the report said. The investigation also found that on trips to Malaysia and Hawaii, Lewis ""engaged in physical contact with female subordinates observed by witnesses where the contact was not incidental or innocuous.""It cites an incident in which Lewis ""drank to the point of not being sober"" while in Hawaii and noted his attempted kiss of a female enlisted service member required her to ""reject and physically block his inappropriate and unwanted advance.""The Inspector General has referred its report to the Army. Disciplinary action could range from a letter of reprimand that would end Lewis's future promotion opportunities or assignments, effectively ending his military career,to a decrease in retirement pay from the military upon his separation from the services."

The author works for David Axelrod.""The reason I think it's plausible is, Putin really dislikes Hillary Clinton. It's personal,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria told David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.Zakaria said that Putin feels ""a certain kind of disdain for Hillary personally"" that he says may stem in part from Clinton's gender. But what Zakaria is certain of is that Putin believes Clinton encouraged political opposition to his reelection efforts in 2012, which he viewed as attempted regime change.Zakaria also said that given Russia's surreptitious political activities in other parts of the world, particularly Europe, ""It's not so far-fetched to imagine that there's some efforts along the same lines"" happening in America.Turning to the Middle East, Zakaria argued that the United States cannot establish more security at home and abroad by attempting to police longstanding sectarian conflicts in foreign countries.""It's a ruinously expensive task (to) get involved in adjudicating the disputes between Sunnis and Shia and creating political order,"" Zakaria said.""We want some kind of clean, satisfying solution here. There isn't,"" he said.Zakaria, who hosts Fareed Zakaria GPS on CNN and writes a column for The Washington Post, said the US has a limited ability to control the ongoing turmoil in Iraq and Syria, which stems from decades of sectarian repression.""These are huge, historical transformations taking place in these societies. Maybe these countries will not exist 15 years from now,"" Zakaria said in a conversation that took place before the debate. ""The idea that we could put a finger on that dike seems very unlikely.""Zakaria touched on a number of issues with Axelrod, including his searing and honest self-examination of what caused his initial support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq (""I probably look at it as the single biggest mistake I made in my life""); the impact our presidential candidates will have on NATO's future (""Broad continuity with the foreign policy of America from Truman through Reagan"" or ""a complete upending of the world order the United States has created since 1945""); and how the vitally important Asia-Pacific region will view the United States' reliability as a global ally if Congress fails to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.To listen to the whole conversation with Zakaria, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/politics/reid-trump-taxes-nevada-atlantic-city/index.html	"""I think Donald Trump is a first class prevaricator,"" said Reid who has become a leading Democratic agitator for Trump to release his tax records. ""He doesn't tell the truth. He's afraid to show his income tax returns. He raped and pillaged Atlantic City. Who knows what his tax records would show there."" Reid, in a conference call with reporters sponsored by the Nevada Democratic Party, said Trump was refused a permanent gaming license in Nevada following his business problems in New Jersey.  ""With what he did in Atlantic City, what his conduct has been the last 15 to 20 years. It's outrageous. He has no business ethics,"" Reid said. ""I don't know why Donald Trump thinks he's above the requirement of being candid with the American people."" Trump has said he won't release his tax records until an IRS audit of his taxes is complete. Reid said at a minimum, Trump should release a letter proving the audit is happening. ""If he is really being audited, which some people doubt his truth and veracity, he could give us a copy of his audit letter. The audit letter doesn't say anything other than that he's being audited,"" Reid insisted. Reid said Trump's inattention to the proper pronunciation of Nevada -- Trump said Ne-VAH- da instead of Nev-AD-a -- would be reflected in how he would treat the state if he were elected to the White House. In particular, Reid said he was stunned Trump was unaware of the decades' long fight over nuclear waste storage in Yucca Mountain, a program Reid fought hard to kill.  ""If you want nuclear waste in Nevada, the suggestion I would have is vote for the Trump/Heck ticket,"" Reid said in reference to Rep. Joe Heck, R-Nevada who is vying against Catherine Cortez Masto for the Senate seat Reid is leaving. Reid said despite polls showing Democrats Cortez Masto and Hillary Clinton in tight races, he expects both to win, in part because of the support of Hispanic voters who have been turned off by the anti-immigration messages of Trump and Heck.   ""We're doing well with Hispanics. We're going to do better the next 32 days,"" he said. ""Clinton is going to win Nevada, Cortez Masto is going to win Nevada and one of the main reasons is because we'll have a very, very strong Hispanic vote."" Slams RealClearPoliticsReid, who like many elected officials insists he does not rely on polling, slammed RealClearPolitics, the website know for averaging public polls to provide a snapshot of where races stand, after a reporter for the site asked why Cortez Masto was struggling in the polls.""I don't want to let any of the air out of your balloon buddy, but RealClearPolitics is the worst because all you do is average the polls that have been taken. All of them are wrong. So rather than doing your own stuff, you average out all these bad polls,"" Reid said.""So let me tell you, six years ago, I never led in a poll. Never,"" he added of his 2010 comeback win. ""But I ended winning by six points. And Catherine is going to win by a nice margin so RealClearPolitics is totally unimpressive to me."""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/politics/afghan-trainees-awol-us/index.html	"One of those eight who vanished in September was detained by Canadian police while attempting to cross the US-Canada border, Cmdr. Patrick Evans told CNN Thursday.A total of 45 members of Afghanistan's security forces have been reported absent without leave (AWOL) while in the US since the start of 2015. Of those, the whereabouts of 13 remain unknown, Evans said.The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for tracking them down once they are reported missing, according to the military.The 32 that have been located, Evans said, have either been deported, arrested and jailed, crossed an international border, or applied for immigration benefits.The number of missing students was first reported by Reuters.The training is part of an international effort to boost Afghanistan's ability to defeat the Taliban and the AWOL students were undergoing instruction in a variety of topics, including leadership, language, infantry, aircrew, intelligence, engineering, military police, ordnance, transportation and Army Ranger training, US officials said.  A large number of Afghan soldiers and police have undergone training in the US since the international effort to build-up Afghanistan's security forces began. Since 2007, US facilities have hosted 2,207 Afghan trainees, the Department of Defense said in a statement. ""It is important to note that the majority -- well over 90% -- of Afghans who train in the US successfully complete their training and return to their country,"" Evans told CNN.But Pentagon officials also said that the US is looking at ways to curtail these type of incidents. ""DoD is assessing ways to strengthen eligibility criteria for training in ways that will reduce the likelihood of an individual Afghan willingly absconding from training in the US and going AWOL,"" Evans added.US officials also stressed that there is currently a vetting process in place as part of the requirements of the ""Leahy Law,"" which governs rules for the training of foreign military and security personnel.The vetting is to insure the students have no links to terrorist or insurgent groups and have not committed any human rights violations. The trainees are also required to go through the regular US visa application process. ""If at any time they fail one of these steps, they are ineligible to go to this training or any future US-funded training,"" Defense Department spokesman Adam Stump told CNN. Afghan security personnel are also screened for such ties by the Afghanistan government upon enlistment.The eight trainees that went missing in September were not acting as a group when they vanished, Stump said.The September uptick in disappearances could be related to the summer season in Afghanistan which tends to witness an increase in fighting as the Taliban typically launch their offensives during that time. One such attack brought Taliban fighters close to the center of the provincial capital city of Kunduz, a push that was recently beaten back by Afghan troops backed by airstrikes and US special operations forces.But most experts believe the disappearances are likely more tied to economic concerns as many of the Afghan trainees have received extensive English language training and therefore think they would be better able to find work in the US or Canada.  Back in 2014 three trainees went AWOL from a facility in Massachusetts. The eight that absconded in September did so from military facilities in Fort Benning, Georgia, Fort Gordon, Georgia, Fort Lee, Virginia, Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and Monterey, California."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/congress-balance-of-power-2016-election/index.html	"Democrats need four pick-ups to win the Senate if Hillary Clinton wins the White House -- five seats if Donald Trump wins since the vice president breaks the tie. There are three GOP seats that Democrats now have a clear edge in winning, while five seats are still toss-ups.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump remains the biggest wild card affecting control of the next Senate majority. If he can keep his margin close with Hillary Clinton, within two to four points, it will help Republicans down-ticket immensely, according to party leaders. But if he continues to slide, the GOP chances of losing the majority grow remarkably.GOP distances itself from Trump -- againThat's one reason why Republicans are struggling to deal with the Trump factor: They want to distance themselves from his inflammatory comments, but they need him to do well in their states.But at the same time, Clinton's lingering unpopularity limits how long her coattails will be down-ticket.Five weeks out from Election Day, here is CNN's list of the seats in order of most likely to switch hands -- based on public polling and interviews with top officials in both parties.Seats most likely to flipRepublican-held seat in WisconsinThis is a peculiar race in which the challenger, former Sen. Russ Feingold, is better known than its incumbent, first-term Republican Sen. Ron Johnson. Polls have consistently shown Johnson down between six to 10 points, and his challenge is made even harder because the difficulties Republicans have in the state during a presidential election year. The Johnson campaign believes the race is much tighter than public polling shows. LIKELY DEMOCRATIC WIN.Republican-held seat in IllinoisThis deep blue state makes it very difficult for Republican Sen. Mark Kirk to hold, facing off against Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran. But even as Kirk has been written off for much of the year, he is only down between two and five points, depending on the poll. And with presidential candidates not competing in Illinois, it gives Kirk an outside chance, especially as he separates himself from Trump. But a new poll out this week from Southern Illinois University shows Duckworth holding a commanding 14-point lead, something Kirk hopes is an outlier. LIKELY DEMOCRATIC WIN.Republican-held seat in IndianaFormer Sen. Evan Bayh's late entrance into the race gave the Democrats a candidate with a well-known family name and a load of campaign cash to compete against a little-known GOP congressman, Todd Young. But Bayh has struggled to overcome questions about his post-Senate life and whether he abandoned the state to enjoy the luxuries of Washington. His lead, which was double digits initially, has now narrowed between four and seven points. Democrats have the advantage, but Republicans are still bullish here. LEANS DEMOCRATIC.Republican-held seat in North CarolinaRepublicans are panicking about North Carolina, worrying that Trump's controversial candidacy, passions in the state over the so-called ""bathroom bill"" pushed by conservative state lawmakers and an unpopular Republican governor will amount to a perfect storm -- and cause Sen. Richard Burr to lose against a little-known opponent, Deborah Ross. Republican money is beginning to flood into the state to help save Burr, who has been criticized for not aggressively campaigning.But Ross has been raising millions of dollars and has the full backing of the party establishment. And both candidates are aligning themselves with their party's nominee. Recent polls show Ross winning the race, putting a scare into the GOP, and a Quinnipac University poll released Wednesday says the race is tied. TOSS UP.Democratic-held seat in NevadaSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid's legacy is on the line in this state. Yet his hand-picked successor, Catherine Cortez Masto, has had trouble overcoming the lead of Rep. Joe Heck, a congressman from a populous district in Southern Nevada who has gone to war with Reid for years. Heck has made the calculation to mostly align himself with Trump, distancing himself sparingly from the GOP nominee, and it appears to be paying off for now, as Trump is neck-and-neck with Clinton in the polls there. Reid is going all-out to defeat Heck and is unleashing his political machine in the state to defeat him. TOSS UP.Republican seat in PennsylvaniaPat Toomey, the GOP incumbent, is in a bind when it comes to Donald Trump. The Republican nominee, who won the state big in the primary, is competing aggressively to win in the general election. Toomey, who hasn't hidden his disdain for Trump and hasn't fully endorsed him, is in a tough spot. He needs Trump's voters but at the same time is seeking to win over voters in the Philadelphia suburbs -- including women who have been put off by the GOP nominee's rhetoric. He's battling Democrat Katie McGinty, who is narrowly leading in most polls but within the margin of error. The new Quinnipiac poll shows Toomey up 50-42 in the state, but officials in both parties believe it's a neck-and-neck race based on other public polling. TOSS UP.Republican seat in MissouriSen. Roy Blunt, the veteran Republican, was supposed to skate to reelection. But he has found himself suddenly in a race that's too close too call because an attractive young Democrat, Jason Kander, has used Blunt's incumbency and long-standing ties to Washington against him. Kander's insurgent candidacy has put Blunt and the GOP on the defensive, as both sides are now dropping millions into this red state.  TOSS UP.  Republican seat in New HampshireRepublican Kelly Ayotte, the New Hampshire senator, has had to navigate the Trump terrain, saying awkwardly that she supports him but doesn't endorse him. At a Monday night debate, Ayotte was forced to clean up her remarks that she ""absolutely"" sees Trump as a role model. But her opponent, Gov. Maggie Hassan, has been attacked for being too scripted, and also has to contend with a Democratic standard-bearer who is distrusted in the state, something she has struggled with answering in the past. The national dynamics will play in heavily here, something that could put Ayotte in a bind if Trump's numbers continue to fall. TOSS UP.The rest of the seats are being monitored by both sides but unlikely to flip -- as of nowOhio seat held by Sen. Rob Portman (R)Florida seat held by Sen. Marco Rubio (R) (Wednesday's Quinnipiac poll showed Rubio up by just 4 points against Rep. Patrick Murphy, a tighter margin than other surveys.)Arizona seat held by Sen.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/04/politics/eric-trump-donald-trump-income-taxes/index.html	"""There's a lot of talk tonight about federal income taxes. Can you just put this to rest? Has your father paid federal income taxes?"" CNN's Dana Bash asked Trump.""We pay a tremendous amount of taxes,"" Eric Trump responded. ""Federal income taxes?"" Bash asked.""Yes --"" Trump said.Later, Trump was asked to clarify whether he is denying past reports that his father might not have paid income taxes. A report from the New York Times published Saturday based on 1995 state tax documents showed a $916 million loss by Trump that year, which might have allowed him to avoid paying income taxes for up to 18 years.The Times obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax returns as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns. The Times did not look at Trump's federal return. CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by The Times.On Tuesday night Trump's so faced further questions about the returns.""Eric, my question though is, has he paid federal income taxes over the last 18 years -- yes or no?"" Bash asked.""Of course, yes, absolutely. My father has paid a tremendous amount of tax. We as a company pay a tremendous amount of tax,"" Trump responded.""So if we ever see your father's income taxes, it will show that he has paid federal income taxes?"" Bash asked.""There's no question about it. We pay tremendous taxes -- "" Trump said.""Will we see it?"" Bash asked.""Listen, when the audit is over, my father will release it,"" he said, later adding, ""Of course I've seen my father's tax returns. My father pays a tremendous amount of tax. As a company we pay a tremendous amount of tax.""Later, CNN's John King asked Trump whether the Trump family has business dealings in Russia.""We have no assets in Russia,"" he said. ""If you know if we have assets in Russia, go and see if our name is on a building.""According to CNN/ORC Poll released Monday, the vast majority of registered voters view paying taxes as a ""civic duty,"" including 79% of Trump's supporters.Nearly all registered voters surveyed in the poll -- 86% -- say they see paying taxes as every American's civic duty, while 12% say that they see taxes as an unnecessary burden to be avoided."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/04/politics/fact-check-vice-presidential-debate/index.html	"The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate and selected key statements from both candidates, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated. ISISReality Check: Pence claims ISIS has overrun IraqBy Sonam Vashi, CNNPence argued that ""Iraq has been overrun by ISIS.""Really?In June, a top State department official said that ISIS had lost 47% of the territory it had previously controlled in Iraq, and its ranks had been nearly halved from the members it had in 2014. ""Whereas it once promised lavish pay for recruits, and free services in its 'caliphate,' it is now slashing pay, cannot provide services, and is facing internal resistance,"" Special Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk said in congressional testimony.In the first half of this year, the IHS Conflict Monitor found that ISIS's territory had shrunk by 12%.And Iraqi forces are about to launch a crucial offensive to retake ISIS's prize: Mosul. ISIS engulfed Iraq's second largest city in June 2014, but a long, bloody struggle for control of the city is expected to begin in the coming weeks.While parts of Iraq have been ravaged by ISIS, Pence drastically inflates the group's control over the country. Verdict: False.Reality Check: Clinton failed to negotiate plan to leave troops in IraqBy Kevin Liptak, CNN White House producerPence accused Hillary Clinton of failing to negotiate an agreement with the Iraqi government allowing US forces to remain in the country past 2011.""Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a 'Status of Forces' agreement,"" Pence said. ""We removed all our troops from Iraq and ISIS was available to be conjured up in that vacuum and overrun vast areas of Iraq.""Reality Check Quick Takes: Did Pence praise Putin?When President Barack Obama entered office in 2009, he inherited a Status of Forces agreement signed in 2008 by his predecessor, President George W. Bush. That agreement stipulated American troops would leave Iraq by 2011.Obama ran on a pledge to end the Iraq War and vowed to reduce the number of US forces there during his first term. When the agreement neared its expiration, the Obama administration worked to secure a new plan that would have left a residual force of 5,000-10,000 troops in the country (down from more than 150,000 troops when Obama took office).In negotiations with then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, the US insisted that its troops would be shielded from prosecution in Iraq. Iraqi lawmakers balked, and the two sides couldn't agree on a pact that would allow US troops to remain. Obama announced in October 2011 that he would withdraw all US troops from the country. (Since then, 5,000-6,000 US troops have returned to the country in what the administration describes as a mission to ""train and assist"" Iraqi forces).Pence's claim that Clinton failed to renegotiate a plan to leave US troops in Iraq is accurate, but he failed to provide the context that the original plan to remove all troops from the country was signed by Obama's Republican predecessor. He also didn't note that the agreement failed because of the Iraqi parliament's unwillingness to provide immunity to US troops.Verdict: True, but misleading.'Deplorables'Reality Check: Pence claims Clinton called Trump supporters ""not American""Kevin Liptak, CNN White House producerPence lashed out at Clinton for her description of a segment of Donald Trump's supporters.""She said that half of our supporters were a 'basket of deplorables,'"" Pence claimed. ""She said they were irredeemable. They were not American. I mean, it's extraordinary.""Pence is quoting Clinton's remarks from a fundraiser last month, when she told supporters you can ""put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables"" and added: ""Some of those folks -- they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.""Pence largely quoted Clinton accurately. But his claim she called some of Trump's supporters are ""not American"" doesn't accurately reflect her sentiment that racism, xenophobia, and Islamaphobia don't reflect US ideals. Verdict: True, but misleading.RussiaReality Check: Kaine claims Trump and Pence praised PutinBy Kate Grise, CNNKaine attacked both Trump and Pence for their praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin.""You guys love Russia,"" Kaine said. ""You both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the President. These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.""At NBC's ""Commander-in-Chief Forum"" last month, Trump said Putin ""has very strong control over a country,"" even if he does not agree with the way the country is governed.""Now, it's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system,"" Trump said. ""Certainly, in that system, he's a been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.""Pence has made similar comments about Putin's leadership in Russia when backing up his running mate's comments.""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,"" Pence told CNN's Dana Bash in September.While it is certainly impossible to quantify how much, or even if, Trump or Kaine ""love"" Russia, we rate Kaine's claim that they have praised Putin as a strong leader as true.Verdict: True.Reality Check: Pence says Russia 'reset' led to invasion of UkraineBy Kevin Liptak, CNN White House producerPence hit Clinton's record on Russia during Tuesday's debate.""Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian 'reset.' The Russian reset,"" he said. ""After she reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.""When Obama took office in 2009, he embarked upon an attempt to repair US relations around the globe, including in Russia. Clinton attempted to capture that ""reset"" in March 2009, when she posed with her Russian counterpart holding a button she thought read ""reset"" in Russian (it really read ""overcharged"").Flash forward five years to the beginning of 2014, when Russian troops intervened in Ukraine to quell a popular revolution, and have remained in the Crimea region since. Putin formally announced the annexation of Crimea on March 18, 2014.Pence's characterization of the flow of events is accurate -- Clinton and Obama's attempted reset came ahead of Russia's annexation of Crimea, though there were many years between the attempted reset and the invasion.Verdict: Mostly true.Clinton FoundationReality Check: Pence on Clinton Foundation receiving donations from foreign governmentsBy Ryan Browne, CNNPence charged that the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments while Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.""The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign donations from foreign governments while she was secretary of state,"" Pence said.The Clinton Foundation did indeed accept millions of dollars from seven foreign governments during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, according to foundation officials.Although Clinton and the foundation agreed to measures and restrictions on such funding, Clinton Foundation officials admitted that millions of dollars found its way to the foundation.According to The Washington Post, documents provided by the foundation to that newspaper made it ""clear that the 2008 agreement did not prohibit foreign countries with interests before the US government from giving money to the charity closely linked to the secretary of state.""This included a $500,000 donation from the Algerian government.Verdict: True.Reality Check: Pence on Clinton Foundation's donations to charityBy Eve Bower, CNNPence said that the Clinton Foundation gives ""less than 10 cents on the dollar"" to ""charitable causes.""But a recent analysis by independent watchdog CharityWatch found that the Clinton Foundation actually spent 88% of its budget on its charitable programs in 2014.So why the large discrepancy? Pence was likely referring only to the charitable grants the Clinton Foundation has awarded to outside groups, as opposed to the charitable work conducted by the Clinton Foundation's own programs. According to Clinton Foundation tax forms -- in 2013, for example -- the foundation reported total revenue of almost $149 million, and awarded external grants worth a total of nearly $9 million -- or about 6 cents on the dollar.But most Clinton Foundation work is implemented by the foundation's own program staff, and is also considered charitable work. CharityWatch considers any foundation with more than 75% of its expenses in charitable programs to be ""highly efficient."" With 88%, the Clinton Foundation meets that standard.Because Pence's figure failed to account for the total amount of the Clinton Foundation's charitable work, we rate his claim false.Verdict: False.Social SecurityReality Check: Kaine claims Trump called Social Security a 'Ponzi scheme'By Amy Gallagher, CNN""Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us,"" Kaine claimed.In ""The America We Deserve,"" published in 2000, Trump wrote about Social Security.""The truth is undeniable. The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme. The pyramids are made of papier-mache."" In the book, Trump goes on to advocate for the privatization of Social Security, describing it as ""letting people keep the money that is rightfully theirs"" and crediting the idea to a retired laundry worker named Oseola McCarty. During his presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly promised to leave Social Security untouched.""I'm not going to cut it, and I'm not going to raise ages,"" Trump said earlier this year.This stands in contrast to Pence's views as he has expressed them in the past. As a congressman, he backed a Republican plan that would have allowed workers to divert some funds into private accounts.We rate this claim as true both because it accurately reflects Trump's words in his book and because Kaine is correct in pointing out that Trump's past statements about Social Security (and Pence's) contradict the Trump campaign's present commitment to leave it untouched.Verdict: True.EconomyReality Check: Pence on poverty By Tami Luhby, CNNMoneyPence slammed the Obama administration's economic record, noting that poverty has increased during his tenure.""There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama, with Hillary Clinton at his side, stepped into the Oval Office,"" he said.It's true that both the number of people and the rate of poverty increased at the start of the Obama administration, which coincided with the nation's worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.In 2008, the year before Obama took office, there were 39.8 million people in poverty and the rate was 13.2%. Two years later, the rate peaked at 15.1% and the number of poor people jumped to 46.3 million.But the improving economy made a big dent in poverty in 2015. The rate fell to 13.5%, the largest decline in decades. The number of Americans in poverty fell to 43.1 million, down from 46.7 million the year earlier.Also, experts say it's more important to look at the poverty rate than the number of people in poverty since the American population is growing.Therefore, we rate Pence's comment true, but misleading. It's true that there are millions more in poverty than when Obama took office, but Pence should refer to the rate rather than the number of people in poverty. And he overlooks that fact that both the share and the population declined greatly in 2015.Verdict: True, but misleading.Reality Check: Does Trump want to eliminate the federal minimum wage?By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoneyKaine asserted that ""(Donald Trump) and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.""Trump has changed his tune on the federal minimum wage many times during this campaign.He did seem to support eliminating it when he suggested that states should decide on a minimum wage, not the federal government.At other times, he expressed support for keeping it. In the summer of 2015, he said he thought the minimum wage should stay where it is, at $7.25 an hour.Then this summer, he advocated for raising it to $10.Verdict: True, but misleading.Reality Check: Pence claims 'We are in the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression'By Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoneyThe economy's recovery from the Great Recession that began in December 2007 is the slowest comeback since World War II.The US economy has only grown 2% a year since it bottomed out in June 2009. That's slower than the average annual growth of 2.7% under George W. Bush and well below the 4% growth America often reached in the 1980s and 1990s.Some bright spots: The current recovery has been long -- longer than most. Since World War II, the economy has typically grown for about five years and then contracted. This recovery is already seven years old.And as important as overall economic growth is the pace of jobs creation. By that measure, this has been only the second-slowest recovery, with 14 million jobs created, beating out the recovery during Bush's presidency. Verdict: True.Nuclear proliferationReality Check: Kaine on Trump's stance on nuclear proliferationBy Ryan Browne, CNN""Most dangerously, Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons. He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them, Korea should get them. And when he was confronted with this and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald said, and I quote, 'Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves.'""But has Trump said this?Trump has sent mixed messages on the issue of nuclear proliferation.When asked if he was prepared to accept Japan and South Korea acquiring nuclear weapons, Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""I am prepared to ... if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and the police for the world. We are, right now, the police for the entire world. We are policing the entire world.""Trump also said in a New York Times interview, ""Well, I think maybe it's not so bad to have Japan -- if Japan had that nuclear threat, I'm not sure that would be a bad thing for us.""When talking about tensions with nuclear-armed North Korea with CNN's Anderson Cooper, he said, ""Now, wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons?"" Cooper also asked Trump if he supported Saudi Arabia's pursuit of nuclear weapons. Trump initially signaled he did.Cooper asked, ""Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?"" to which Trump responded, ""Saudi Arabia, absolutely.""But when Cooper followed up, Trump said, ""No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us.""""It's very simple. They're going to have to defend themselves,"" Trump added.Kaine also said that Trump said, ""Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves,"" in reference to nuclear war between Japan and North Korea.Trump did indeed tell a rally in Wisconsin, ""Good luck ... Enjoy yourself, folks."" While not the exact words Kaine referred to, the sentiment and words are very close.Trump has signaled a willingness to accept a nuclear-armed Japan, a departure from decades of American foreign policy, and has to a lesser extent expressed willingness to accept South Korea acquiring its own nuclear weapons.While he did tell Cooper that Saudi Arabia should have them, he immediately changed his stance.Verdict: Mostly true.DebtReality Check: Kaine says debt explosion under Trump's tax plan would be much bigger than under Clinton'sBy Lex Haris and Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoneyKaine said, ""The debt explosion on the Trump plan is much much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.""Trump has proposed slashing taxes, increasing government spending in some areas while cutting it in the smallest parts of the budget. He also vows not to touch Social Security. Trump asserts the economic growth his plan would generate would more than make up for any shortfall in tax collections by the government.Independent analysts disagree. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan think tank, estimates Trump's plan would add $5.3 trillion to the national debt in the first decade.In contrast, Clinton has proposed increasing government spending, but also hiking taxes on the wealthy. The result, according to the CRFB, would be a much smaller increase in the national debt -- $200 billion.Verdict: True.Trump's tweetsReality Check: Clinton campaign on Trump's tweetsBy Lisa Rose, CNNAbout 90 minutes before the vice presidential debate, Clinton's campaign tweeted out a stat that suggests Trump has not been supportive of Pence on Twitter. According to Clinton's campaign, the Republican presidential nominee has given Pence a tip of the hat in his Twitter feed 21 times. In comparison, according to Clinton's campaign, Trump has tweeted at Rosie O'Donnell 65 times.The comparison is specious because Trump has been trading barbs with O'Donnell for nearly five years on Twitter, though he hasn't tweeted about her since May. Trump only started tweeting about Pence in July, when he announced the Indiana governor was his running mate.  The larger problem is drawing a conclusion that Trump is not supportive of Pence simply by counting mentions on Twitter and then bringing the unrelated O'Donnell feud into the mix. Verdict: False.TaxesReality Check: Kaine on Trump and tax returnsBy Eve Bower, CNNKaine mentioned a 2014 interview Trump gave, saying, ""Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, 'If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes.'""Pence responded, ""And he will.""Trump did indeed make make such a promise. In May 2014, during a visit to Ireland to promote his hotel and golf course, Trump sat down for an interview with Ireland's TV3. The reporter, Colette Fitzpatrick, reminded Trump that he had questioned Obama's citizenship and had said that if Obama presented his long-form birth certificate, Trump would produce his tax returns. ""But you didn't do it, did you?"" Fitzpatrick asked.Trump answered, ""Well, I don't know, did he do it? And I will. If I decide to run for office, I'll produce my tax returns. Absolutely.""Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011 -- more than three years before Trump's 2014 interview. But Trump still has not released his tax returns.Kaine accurately remembered Trump's claim, but Pence did not provide specifics on when those tax returns will be forthcoming. Trump has said that he is not able to release his returns due to an ongoing Internal Revenue Service audit. There is, however, no legal reason why someone under audit cannot make their tax records public while they are running for office.Verdict: True.Trump, Pence on MexicansReality Check: Kaine claims Trump and Pence say ""All Mexicans are bad""By Lisa Rose, CNNKaine accused Pence and Trump of denigrating Mexicans en masse. ""These guys say all Mexicans are bad,"" Kaine claimed.While Trump has made a border wall the centerpiece of his campaign, there is no record of him saying that all Mexicans are bad. When the reality star announced he was running for president in June 2015, he did say Mexico sends criminals and troublemakers across the border. He included a qualifier, however. ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best ... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.  And some, I assume, are good people.""Two weeks after the announcement, Trump told CNN's Don Lemon, ""I love the Mexican People. I've had a great relationship with Mexico and the Mexican people.""More recently, when the businessman visited Mexico City in August, he said that Mexican-Americans are ""just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular hard-working people. I have such great respect for them and their strong values of family, faith and community.""Kaine said both Trump and Pence have made sweeping statements about all Mexicans but a keyword search on Pence's name within close proximity to the word ""Mexican"" yielded no results in the Nexis.com news database. There aren't any references to Mexicans in Pence's Twitter feed.Verdict: False.Trump FoundationReality Check: Trump Foundation gave money to attorney general considering case against Trump UniversityBy Amy Gallagher, CNNIn response to accusations by Pence about the Clinton Foundation, Kaine attacked the Trump Foundation: ""(Donald Trump's) foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.""Kaine then went on to insinuate that the donation may have been pay-for-play: ""The person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University."" It is true the Trump Foundation did make an illegal contribution and they have admitted as much. A senior member of Trump's organization called it ""an honest mistake."" It's also true that the donation was to a political group that supported Pam Bondi, who was running for re-election as Florida attorney general.Her office had received several claims against the Trump Institute (an organization licensing the Trump name but not owned by Trump) and at least one claim against Trump University (one of Trump's own companies). The donation was made after a spokesperson from Bondi's office told the Orlando Sentinel that they were considering the case. After the $25,000 donation was received, Bondi did not pursue charges against Trump University. Bondi admits soliciting the donation, but denies her office's decision was influenced by the money. However, Kaine's critique is worded well: the donation creates an appearance of impropriety.Although the check didn't go to Bondi's campaign per se, we nevertheless rate the claim true because Trump's foundation did, in fact, issue a check to a political organization which Bondi admits to soliciting and because the payment was made at a time when her office was considering a possible case against one of his companies. Verdict: True."	Fact-checking the VP debate	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Fitzpatrick', 'Pence', 'Wolf', 'Cooper', 'Obama', 'Kaine']	['creation']
8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/04/politics/fact-check-vp-debate/index.html	"Kaine, Pence debate: CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claimsAt various times Pence struggled to defend both himself and Trump, saying that he never said Vladimir Putin was a better leader than President Barack Obama (he did). And that Trump never said women who get abortions should face punishment (Trump did say that).Kaine stepped over the the line a few times, overstating Trump and Pence's comments on issues like the minimum wage and others. Here's the run of CNN's Reality Check Quick Takes on the night. Kaine: Pence said that Putin is a better leader than ObamaVERDICT: TRUEKaine said that Pence called Putin stronger than Obama and Pence denied that claim. But he told CNN's Dana Bash last month that it was ""inarguable"" that Putin is a stronger leader.""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,"" Pence said.Kaine said Trump said women who get abortions should face punishmentVERDICT: TRUEKaine said Trump said that women who get abortions should face punishment. Trump said in March that those women should ""face some sort of punishment."" But Trump later reversed himself and apologized.Pence claims ""We are in the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression""VERDICT: TRUE, BUT MISLEADING.If ""worst"" means ""slowest,"" then it's true: The economy's recovery from the Great Recession that began in December 2007 is the slowest comeback since World War II.So Pence's claim is correct...but it comes with a big asterisk. The current recovery has been long - longer than most. Since World War II, the economy has gone in cycles, typically growing for about five years and then contracted. This recovery is already seven years old.In addition, job growth during this recovery has already outpaced the gains in many other expansions. Over 14 million jobs have been added since the low point after the Great Recession.Pence says Kaine boycotted Netanyahu's speechVERDICT: TRUEIn March 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to a joint session of Congress on the Iran nuclear negotiations. The speech was criticized by several Democrats and the Obama adminitration for its violation of protocol, and Tim Kaine was among the more than 50 members of Congress who refused to attend the speech.Pence on Clinton Foundation receiving donations from foreign governmentsVERDICT: TRUEPence charged that the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.The Clinton Foundation did indeed accept millions of dollars from seven foreign governments during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state according to foundation officials.This included a $500,000 donation from the Algerian government.Kaine says Clinton admitted she should not have said ""deplorables""VERDICT: FALSETim Kaine defended Hillary Clinton on her ""basket of deplorables"" blast by saying that she quickly admitted that she shouldn't have said that. But Clinton, who has made an issue out of Trump's ""alt-right"" support only apologized for saying that half of his supporters were ""deplorables.""Pence says Clinton failed to negotiate plan to leave troops in IraqVERDICT: TRUE, BUT MISLEADINGPence accused Hillary Clinton of failing to negotiate an agreement with the Iraqi government allowing US forces to remain in the country past 2011.When President Barack Obama entered office in 2009, he inherited a ""Status of Forces"" agreement signed in 2008 by his predecessor, President George W. Bush. That agreement stipulated American troops would leave Iraq by 2011.Pence's claim that Clinton failed to renegotiate a plan to leave US troops in Iraq is accurate, but he failed to provide the context that the original plan to remove all troops from the country was signed by Obama's Republican predecessor. He also didn't note that the agreement failed because of the Iraqi parliament's unwillingness to provide immunity to US troops.Kaine says federal appeals court struck down Pence ban on Syrian refugees because it was discriminatoryVERDICT: TRUEThe 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided that Pence's ban on Syrian refugees was discriminatory. Judge Richard Posner wrote in his opinion, ""(Pence) argues that his policy of excluding Syrian refugees is based not on nationality and thus is not discriminatory, but is based solely on the threat he thinks they pose to the safety of residents of Indiana. ... But that's the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they're black but because he's afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn't discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.""Kaine says Trump wants to undercut minimum wage workersVERDICT: TRUE BUT MISLEADINGKaine said that Trump and Pence want to eliminate the minimum wage. Trump said in a Republican debate last year November that the minimum wage is too high, but he reversed himself this May, saying that the Federal minimum wage ""needs to go up.""Kaine said Mike Pence wanted to privatize Social SecurityVERDICT: TRUE BUT MISLEADINGAs a congressman, Mike Pence pushed conservative efforts to make Social Security and federal entitlement programs voucher-based programs -- curbing spending and also, effectively, cutting future benefits. Critics have argued that would lead to the privatization of Social Security. But Pence never explicitly called for privatizing Social Security and Medicare -- instead he supported giving individuals vouchers to purchase their own benefits.Mike Pence says Kaine proposed raising taxes $4 billion while in officeVERDICT: TRUEKaine did propose raising $4 billion in new revenue in his first budget, as part of a four-year plan to pay for road improvements. But the plan included some spending cuts and, more importantly, was never approved.Mike Pence says ""we cut unemployment in half""VERDICT: TRUEIndiana's unemployment dropped from a high point of 10.9% in February 2010, before Mike Pence took office, to 5.4% this summer. But most economists state that politicians and policies have very little effect on the economy and jobless rates. It would be hard to assign credit or blame to any politician on the unemployment rate.Mike Pence calls Longwood University ""Norwood University""VERDICT: FALSEIt's Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. Not ""Norwood."""	Reality Check Quick Takes: Mike Pence misstates Donald Trump position on Vladimir Putin	['Pence', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]
