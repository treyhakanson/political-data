Protests during the national anthem have spread to other NFL teams, including the Miami Dolphins, the New England Patriots and the Kansas City Chiefs. Women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe also knelt in solidarity with Kaepernick. In a second tweet, Cruz fired back at basketball commentator Jalen Rose, who saluted NFL players and teams who peacefully protested.""Here's a peaceful protest: never buy another shoe, shirt, or jersey of rich spoiled athletes who dishonor our flag,"" Cruz wrote.The Texas senator also weighed in on the issue when spotted by TMZ at Reagan National Airport last week.""It's sad when you see rich spoiled athletes that don't recognize what an incredible blessing this country is,"" Cruz said.RELATED: Protests during NFL's opening dayThe conservative firebrand slammed President Barack Obama's stance on the issue. Obama said in a news conference last week that Kaepernick was ""exercising his constitutional right.""""I was disappointed to see President Obama stand with Kaepernick and say, 'that's right, disrespect the flag.' That's not the job of the President. The President should be standing up for America and the president should be encouraging every American to honor the flag that so many have bled and died for.""Ted Cruz also retweeted a tweet from supermodel Kate Upton calling the protests ""unacceptable.""

""This last week, I took a physical, and I'll be releasing, when the numbers come in, hopefully they are going to be good. I think they are going to be good, I feel great, but when the numbers come in, I'll be releasing very specific numbers,"" Trump said. Trump was previously scheduled to appear on the ""Dr. Oz Show"" on Thursday, along with his daughter Ivanka, though it's unclear what the specific details are for that appearance. Trump also addressed his opponent's medical situation, saying he hopes Clinton ""gets well soon"" after she was forced to leave a September 11, 2001, terrorist attack memorial service Sunday because of ""overheating,"" according to her campaign. That episode subsequently led to her campaign revealing that Clinton had been diagnosed with pneumonia Friday.""Well, I really just don't know, I hope she gets well soon,"" Trump said when asked what caused Clinton's episode. ""I don't know what's going on. I'm like you. I just see what I see. The coughing fit was a week ago, so I assume that was pneumonia also. I would have to think it would have been, so something is going on, but I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail, and we'll be seeing her at the debate."" Trump's fitness for office has received scrutiny during the campaign in addition to Clinton's health. Trump and his surrogates have repeatedly questioned Clinton's health and stamina throughout the campaign trail. Trump's own health was questioned following media reports into his physician Dr. Harold Bornstein and a note he wrote in 2015 vouching for the real estate mogul's health, which other doctors have said includes medically incorrect terms and an unprofessional conclusion."

""The Asheville Police Department worked diligently to protect both those attending the rally and those exercising their right to protest.""""APD has taken out warrants on Thomas Vellanti Jr. for the assault which was caught on video last night at the Donald Trump Rally. #AVLPD,"" the police department tweeted Tuesday.The Trump campaign has not answered requests for comment. A call to Vellanti also went unanswered.A CNN reporter saw Vellanti accosting a group of eight protesters who began shouting in the middle of Trump's rally and exchanged words with one man before grabbing him by the neck while brandishing his closed fist. Vellanti then appeared to swing at the protester, but it's unclear if the protester dodged the punch.Police officers, who were stationed throughout the arena of Trump's rally, were not involved in the incident and Vellanti remained at the rally.The incident on Monday came as Trump lambasted Hillary Clinton for calling half of his supporters a ""basket of deplorables,"" accusing her of running a ""hate-filled"" campaign.And moments earlier, Trump had brought a group of supporters on stage, proclaiming them hard-working Americans, not ""deplorables.""Clinton has said she regretted saying the word ""half,"" but said she will continue to call out the ""bigotry"" in the Trump campaign.Reporters also witnessed Vellanti trying to grab a female protester who was also being escorted out of the building.And when a woman in a hijab tried to sit down as the group of protesters were ejected, the man shouted, ""Get out!"" and motioned for her to leave.After the protesters were ejected, Vellanti extended his arms, raising his clenched fists like a victorious boxer.The incidents occurred as a Trump campaign staffer arrived by the group of protesters to escort them out of the rally. The staffer did not ask the supporter to leave the rally.Past incidents of violenceThe altercation is not the first incident of violence at a Trump rally.A Trump supporter in Fayetteville, North Carolina, was charged with assault in March after he punched a protester as he was being escorted from the venue by police. Trump later suggested he might pay for the man's legal bills.And last fall, a Black Lives Matter protester was tackled, punched and kicked by a Trump supporter at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama. Trump later said that man maybe ""should have been roughed up.""Trump has also been accused of stoking violence at his rallies, telling supporters during a February rally that he'd ""like to punch him (a protester) in the face.""""In the old days,"" Trump added then, protesters would be ""carried out on a stretcher.""But Trump has sought to mollify the tone of his campaign, saying at more recent rallies that his supporters should be non-violent toward protesters.As he slammed Clinton for saying that half of his supporters are ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic,"" Trump argued that every American deserves ""leadership that honors you, cherishes you and totally defends you.""""Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country,"" he said."

That's on us -- that's on the staff,"" Mook told Tapper on ""The Lead."" ""We were trying to make sure she could see her doctor, getting her to Chelsea's apartment, making sure she was OK."" Clinton departed the ceremony at 9:30 a.m. ET and went to daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment. Later, Clinton returned to her home in Chappaqua, New York, where Mook said she was attended to by her doctor. A video showed a wobbly Clinton stumbling as she was assisted into her van to depart the ceremony. Asked if she fainted, Mook said: ""My understanding is she did not lose consciousness."" After 5 p.m. ET, her campaign released a statement saying Clinton was diagnosed Friday with pneumonia. ""On Friday, she made a decision with her doctors to just power through this,"" Mook said when Tapper pressed on why the campaign hadn't disclosed that diagnosis at the time. ""Obviously pneumonia is more serious than a cold or the flu, but often people continue to go in to work and power through"" with pneumonia, Mook said. ""If it was up to her, she would be out there right now, continuing to campaign. But we definitely think it's the right thing for her to have some down time, get over this and get back over there,"" he said. In the at-times contentious interview, Mook complained that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump hasn't disclosed as much about his own health -- a brief doctor's note with no vital information is all his campaign has released -- as Clinton. ""Donald Trump has released nothing for 500 or more days,"" Mook said. ""Let's hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire to disclose anything whatsoever this serious about his health.""Trump said Monday on ""Fox and Friends"" he'll soon make public the results of a physical exam he had last week. Clinton's campaign, meanwhile, says she'll be examined this week and the campaign will release the full results. Clinton tweeted twice about her health Monday evening, saying: ""Thanks to everyone who's reached out with well wishes! I'm feeling fine and getting better."" Then, in the second tweet, she said: ""Like anyone who's ever been home sick from work, I'm just anxious to get back out there. See you on the trail soon."" Both tweets were signed ""-H,"" indicating they came from Clinton herself, not her staff."	Robby Mook: Staff to blame for slow Clinton health disclosure	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

The Iranians made three radio calls to the two planes warning them not to enter Iranian airspace and risk being shot down with surface-to-air missiles, the official said. ""All three calls used threatening language,"" the US defense official said.The US Navy crews knew they were flying ""outside the known range of Iranian air defenses""  and proceeded with their flight plans.The American crews ""responded in an appropriate and calm manner,"" the official said, adding that the crews identified their planes themselves as coalition aircraft flying in international airspace. The two planes -- reconnaissance aircraft that routinely fly that flight pattern in the Strait of Hormuz -- were on separate flight plans, but close to each other.  Also, senior US military officials are trying to assess whether the number of incidents with the Iranians have increased or whether more incidents are simply being reported by US naval commanders in the region because of the sensitivity to Iranian incidents."

""Donald Trump and I have denounced David Duke repeatedly. We have said that we do not want his support and we don't want the support of people who think like him.""Clinton jumped on Pence's response, tweeting: ""If you won't say the KKK is deplorable, you have no business running the country.""Her running mate, Tim Kaine, also hit Pence over the remark, telling supporters at a campaign event in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Tuesday, ""If you cannot call out bigotry, if you cannot call out racism, xenophobia, anti -- if you can't call it out and you stand back and you're silent about it, you're enabling it to grow, you're enabling it to become more powerful.""Clinton later said she regretted using the word ""half"" to describe the percentage of Trump supporters she feels are racist, bigoted or xenophobic, but said she did not regret calling out Trump's more unseemly supporters.""Hillary Clinton did not apologize for insulting millions of people,"" Pence told Blitzer on ""The Situation Room,"" calling her speech at a fundraiser ""intentional"" and ""forthright."" ""Did she walk it back? She said she regretted saying half. So what was it -- 40%?"" Pence said.Health recordsPence also said that both Clinton and Trump should release detailed medical information on their physical health, arguing that the disclosures are in the public interest.""People are vying for the highest office in the land,"" the Indiana governor said. ""People have a right to know.""Clinton is taking a day off the campaign trail, staying at her home in Chappaqua after stumbling at a 9/11 commemoration event on Sunday. Aides later said she was diagnosed Friday with pneumonia.Pence is in Washington ahead of meetings with Capitol Hill Republicans on Tuesday.Asked if top Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani had gone too far in questioning Clinton's health prior to Sunday's incident, Pence demurred.""We wish Hillary Clinton well. We're praying for a swift recovery. We want to see her back on the campaign trail,"" he said. ""We'll leave it at that.""Tax disclosurePence also defended his running mate's reluctance to release his tax returns, even though Pence himself just released reams of financial data about his own income and tax rates. Trump has said that he will not share his until a ""routine audit"" is completed -- and Pence said the Republican nominee has every intention of doing so.Pressed as to why Trump would not release topline information about previous returns now -- which would not interfere with the audit process -- Pence said Trump would release his returns ""in totality"" and ""not parse them out piece by piece."" Pence added that Trump was not violating any laws by withholding the data, though he acknowledged ""there's a bit of a tradition here.""Trump FoundationPence also batted back increased scrutiny of Trump's charitable foundation, with reports emerging that Trump is almost exclusively directing other people's dollars -- not his own -- to charity work.""Anyone who knows about Donald Trump his career knows that this is a man that has given away tens of millions of dollars to charitable causes,"" Pence said. ""There's simply no question: You can talk to charities all across the country who have benefited by the generosity of the Trump family. And I am very, very proud of their charitable record.""Obama's birthplacePence reiterated that he himself believes Obama was born in Hawaii, but said the campaign and country had moved well beyond the Trump-led controversy: ""It's a four-year old issue. It's not what the American people are talking about.""Trump during the 2012 campaign was the leading skeptic of Obama's birthplace, insisting that his constitutional legitimacy as a president was in doubt. He has repeatedly declined during the 2016 campaign to either walk back or expand on the claims, arguing that it would draw media coverage and distract from what he considers the race's core issues.Praise for PutinTrump and Pence have also caught fire for laudatory comments they've made about Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader who is widely denounced by US politicians of both parties. Both members of the GOP ticket have said that Putin is a stronger leader than Obama, but Pence said that the ticket is not naive about his Russian counterpart.""Donald Trump and I know what we're dealing with,"" Pence said, heralding the businessman's skills as a dealmaker.

Yes, he does.""Hart said to slam the door, Clinton needs to be more revealing in the upcoming debates about what, beyond personal ambition, drives her to seek the presidency.""People want to see who she is and what she's going to be like (as president),"" he said. ""All of the integrity questions create the doubt and uncertainty. ... What are her motivations?""I think if I asked that question in a focus group, I would get a very negative answer.

Calling Putin a ""thug"" and a ""bully,"" Morell said he believes Putin was behind the hack and release of Democratic National Committee emails, noting the Russian president had used similar tactics in nearby countries and Western Europe in the past. He pointed to Trump's praise for Putin as a strong leader and Trump's assertion that Russia could keep the Crimea region -- which it seized from Ukraine -- as evidence that Putin has succeeded in getting Trump to do his bidding. ""Putin does not believe that Hillary Clinton will be easy on Russia. He believes that she will be tough on Russia,"" Morell said. He said he doesn't believe Putin -- even if he is behind the political hacks -- can ultimately affect the outcome of the November 8 presidential race.""He might think he can have an impact at the margins, but I don't believe that's possible,"" Morell said. Morell's comments come the day after The Washington Post published a letter to Trump from Morell and Mike Vickers, the former undersecretary of Defense for intelligence, that was critical of Trump's comments about Putin. The two wrote to Trump that ""you cannot credibly serve as commander in chief if you embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin.""""Demand that Putin stop his aggressive behavior overseas,"" Morell and Vickers wrote. ""Demand that he stop his dictatorial moves at home. Tell him that you will live up to our NATO commitments and defend the Baltics, if need be.
