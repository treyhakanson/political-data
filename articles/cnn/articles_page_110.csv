I am as far as you can get from Nate Silver, let's tote up the numbers, big data"" journalism, Dowd said. ""I just love the effect people can have when they throw their weight against history, how they deal with crises. And the White House is the ultimate pressure cooker.""In this hour-long conversation, Dowd, who is out with a new book called ""The Year of Voting Dangerously: The Derangement of American Politics,"" shares her candid -- and sometimes withering -- insights into this year's presidential candidates, as well as the presidents and other politicians she has covered over her storied career.Donald Trump used to answer Dowd's phone calls but no longer will, she says, after she posed a number of tough, uncomfortable questions to the candidate, including what the consequences would be if a narcissist became president.""He got mad at me and said I wasn't treating him fairly,"" Dowd recalled. ""He doesn't know he's a clinical narcissist, which is maybe one of the symptoms of clinical narcissism.""Dowd, who has earned a reputation over time for her unsparing criticism of Hillary Clinton, recalls initially feeling sympathy for her when she entered the White House, deferring her own accomplished career for the ""antiquated, satin jail called the first lady job.""But, Dowd argues, having observed Clinton since the 1990s, she has also shown a difficulty balancing her ""idealistic, public service side"" with a ""secretive, defensive, my way or the highway"" mentality that has compounded her political problems as she dealt with the fallout from her use of private email, her paid speaking activity, and her campaign's response after Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia last month.To hear the entire conversation with Dowd, which included her views of the four US presidents she has covered closely, what it felt like crossing paths with Joe Biden after she broke the plagiarism story that ended his 1988 presidential campaign, and how journalism has changed over the years, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/watergate-counterfactual-naftali/index.html	"The ostensible reason for Nixon's political downfall was a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex on the night of June 17, 1972. The five people arrested by DC police at the scene all had connections to the Committee to Re-Elect the President. In the days that followed Richard Nixon would be the architect of a series of schemes to insulate the White House from responsibility for the bungled political espionage plot.In the decades since Watergate, many observers have concluded that Nixon's ultimate resignation was an example of ""the system working."" However, if you look carefully at the story, Nixon very nearly got away with it.The Watergate break in was not the first but the third time the burglars tried to enter the facility and the second time that they did. They only went in a third time to move some wiretaps that had been providing the intelligence they wanted.There is some doubt as to whether Nixon ordered the Watergate break-in; but there is ample evidence that he conveyed to his lieutenants that he expected them to spy on his political adversaries. Indeed, in late 1971 Attorney General John Mitchell, soon to head the re-election committee, and White House Chief of Staff H. R. ""Bob"" Haldeman concluded that G. Gordon Liddy should be hired to lead an espionage program against the Democrats. The hiring of Liddy was the culmination of a series of dirty tricks, espionage and governmental abuses of power that made the Nixon White House the most corrupt in modern US history. In 1969, Richard Nixon had ordered wiretaps for national security purposes that he continued long past their utility for a leak investigation because they were turning up useful political information. That same year, Nixon approved seeking federal money to renovate two new vacation homes that he purchased, ordered the Secret Service both to spy on his brother and conduct 24-hour surveillance of Senator Ted Kennedy in the hope of finding him with a girlfriend. In 1971, Nixon approved the hiring of ""thugs"" from the Teamsters Union to commit acts of physical violence against anti-war demonstrators, he ordered the establishment of a special investigative unit to investigate the Pentagon Papers leak and he approved a covert action against Daniel Ellsberg in Los Angeles. That summer he also ordered that a list be compiled of all Jewish-Americans in the US government, to maintain special control over them, and sought to fire all of those in Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. He also ordered the creation of a ""tax list"" later called ""the enemy's list"" for harassment of his perceived political opponents by the IRS. Any one of these abuses would have been cause for impeachment. Yet all remained hidden from Congressional investigation or public view.It is likely that none of these crimes and abuses of power would have become public had it not been for the fact that the Nixon White House was so confident of presidential power that they reused the same criminals who worked on the Pentagon Papers case, the so-called Plumbers, for political espionage in the election year of 1972. Not only had G. Gordon Liddy been involved in the harassment of Daniel Ellsberg, but so had former CIA officer E. Howard Hunt, whose name Nixon knew and who was picked up as Liddy's deputy for the political crimes of 1972. When the Watergate operation collapsed, it compromised both Liddy and Hunt, thus opening the possibility that good investigative journalism would reveal Nixon's hand in White House corruption.Most of the US media was initially not up to the challenge. Nixon was the country's most accomplished liar, who cleverly and systematically shielded most of his bright, young staffers from the truth of his dark dealings. Only the inner core of his team -- a handful of men -- actually knew the reality behind the spin and they were a tough, loyal lot. As a result, with few exceptions, well-established journalists missed the deeper implications of the Watergate break-in and were content to accept the Nixon White House's explanation of the event as an amateurish ""caper"" by zealots.Two young journalists, however, who had no national reputations to lose and lots of energy, convinced their editors at the Washington Post to see where the story led. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein would inspire a revolution in American journalism by not accepting that the Nixon political machine was too professional and too smart to be behind a wiretapping operation at the DNC.In 1972 it was not inevitable that a Woodward and Bernstein would keep pressing the issue. Initially they did not succeed in changing either public or political opinion about the break-in. Nixon's cover-up held; the Court indicted only the five men arrested at the DNC and their two supervisors, E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy. In November Nixon easily won re-election.Had it not been for four independent developments, Nixon's cover up might well have held:The sentencing judge for the Watergate burglary trial, John Sirica, sensed that perjury had been committed in his Court and decided to use his sentencing power to shake the truth out of the defendants.The Washington Post pieces, supplemented by some work at the Los Angeles Times and an expose on CBS News, laid the ground for a congressional investigation of campaign activities in 1972.Since February 1971, Richard Nixon had been taping all of his Oval Office conversations and meetings in his hideaway office at the Executive Office Building as well as many of those that he made on the telephone.Finally, in his confirmation hearings to replace Richard Kleindienst as US attorney general, congressional Democrats received a promise from nominee Elliot Richardson to hire an independent prosecutor to look into the Watergate affair.Fear of long sentences would lead to a crack in the stonewalling of the burglars, thus raising concerns in the White House. Meanwhile, the congressional investigations not only turned up other evidence of abuses of government power by the White House but lead to the granting of immunity to Nixon's ally in the cover-up John Dean who, in a dramatic monotone, would be the first member of the Nixon team to accuse the President of participation in the cover up.But even that would not have been enough to end Richard Nixon's political career. Polls showed that Americans were divided over whom to believe.It was Nixon's decision not to destroy the tapes that would seal his fate. Sick with pneumonia, Nixon was at Bethesda Naval Hospital, when his loyalists alerted him that an aide, Alexander Butterfield, was about to testify in open session about the existence of the tapes. Vice President Spiro Agnew advised the president ""to build a bonfire."" Other aides, including his counsel Leonard Garment, feared that a charge of obstruction of justice, would be inevitable unless the tapes were left untouched. Nixon wavered; at one point, asking his Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig (who had replaced Haldeman in April), whether he would destroy the roughly 5,000 hours of tapes that existed. Haig said he couldn't. But had Nixon found someone to do the job; or had he been well and in the White House, the outcome of this presidential crisis could have been very different.Archibald Cox, the man Elliott Richardson picked as special prosecutor, would educate the American people as to the importance of the Nixon tapes and when Nixon had him fired in October 1973, talk of impeachment gripped Washington, DC, for the first time. Cox's replacement, Leon Jaworski, continued the fight for the tapes, which resulted in a unanimous Supreme Court decision that Nixon had to turn them over.Once members of Congress and the rest of the public read the first transcripts of the many conversations in which Nixon choreographed the cover-up after Watergate, Nixon's impeachment and removal from office was a foregone conclusion. Unapologetic and determined to the end, a reluctant Nixon saw the writing on the wall and left office August 9. No man had fought so hard to become president; and no man fought so hard to stay president."	What if Watergate had not been discovered?

The former secretary of state also frequently states that she does not recall having conversations with officials at the State Department regarding some of the specific issues raised by Judicial Watch, including providing access to the server to State Department personnel, or specifically notifying the department of her decision to use the server.In one response, ""Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall being advised, cautioned, or warned, she does not recall that it was ever suggested to her, and she does not recall participating in any communication, conversation, or meeting in which it was discussed that her use of a clintonemail.com e-mail account to conduct official State Department business conflicted with or violated federal recordkeeping laws.""Clinton maintains in the filing that she chose to use a personal email server for ""convenience,"" and she believed her emails to State Department officials were being archived by virtue of the fact that the recipients had government email accounts. ""Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall considering factors other than convenience in deciding to use a personal e-mail account to conduct official State Department business,"" the filing notes.She acknowledged however that ""she did not consider how emails she sent to or received from persons who did not have State Department email accounts would be searched by the Department in response to FOIA requests."" The filing suggests Clinton relied on her advisers when it came to managing and protecting the server, and does not recall being contact by the State Department during her tenure about preserving her emails. Furthermore, the filing notes, ""Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall being advised, cautioned, or warned during her tenure as secretary of state about hacking or attempted hacking of her clintonemail.com email account or the server that hosted her clintonemail.com account.""""We're pleased that we now have a little bit more information about Hillary Clinton's email practices,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement. ""Our lawyers will be reviewing the responses closely. Mrs. Clinton's refusal to answer many of the questions in a clear and straightforward manner further reflects disdain for the rule of law."""

Asking the Republican congressman about the recent wave of party leaders, like Sen. John McCain and Rep. Paul Ryan, pulling their support from Trump, Hayes tried to size up Farenthold's commitment. ""Until he does something so bad to make him worse than Hillary, I'm still in,"" Farenthold said.Hayes posed a hypothetical: ""If someone off the record, in a locker room -- this was not in a locker room, it was a workplace -- said, 'I really like raping women,' would that be locker-room talk?""Farenthold answered, ""Again, it depends, you don't know the entire context of all this."" ""But you would be fine with that?"" Hayes interjected.""I don't like what he said,"" Farenthold began to answer.So Hayes repeated his hypothetical: ""If a tape came out with Donald Trump saying that, saying 'I really like to rape women,' you would continue to endorse him?""""Again ... that would be bad. And I'd have to consider it, but again, we're talking about what Donald Trump said 10 years ago as opposed to what Hillary Clinton has done in the past two or three years,"" Farenthold said. ""She's been a failure.""Hayes returned to the question and asked if there was a single, conceivable thing Trump could do to earn Farenthold's opposition.""Absolutely, but I think actions speak louder than words,"" Farenthold said, dismissing the controversy over the leaked tape as a ""kerfuffle.""After the interview finished, Farenthold tweeted an apology.""I apologize for my failure to immediately condemn anyone who would say something as outrageous as they like raping women,"" he tweeted. ""During an interview on MSNBC with Chris Hayes tonight, I was thrown off by the anchor's use of a hypothetical question. I do not, and have not ever condoned rape or violence against women. That is not the kind of man I believe Donald Trump to be.""Finally, Hayes brought up allegations that Trump has abused women, including an underage woman.Farenthold returned, ""Well, let's talk about Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton defending what her husband did, too."""

I guess he fires up the people who go to Alex Jones and Breitbart. But I think it is very unbecoming.""This view is a change in the way Clinton's aides initially approached Trump's candidacy. In early 2016, Clinton's aides said they felt that Trump's comments about Latinos, African-Americans and women would boost turnout in those communities, surpassing whatever boost the Republican nominee enjoyed with white, working-class voters.But as Trump's campaign has grown more negative -- Trump tweeted that the ""shackles have been taken off"" from the GOP establishment -- the view from Clinton's Brooklyn headquarters has changed.Clinton herself gave voice to turnout concerns.""Despite all of the terrible things he has said and done, he is still trying to win this election. And we cannot be complacent, we cannot rest,"" she told a Florida radio host on Tuesday.She added, quoting scripture: ""Do not go weary while doing good. That applies to this election as well as to our lives and our communities and our faith.""One way Clinton's aides feel she can counter Trump's negativity is to speak about her affirmative message. The issue with that is that incessant releases of hacked emails from Wikileaks and Trump's flame-throwing comments get more coverage than Clinton's policy proposals, a fact that irks Clinton's aides.To overcome that, Clinton's aides plan to campaign more with candidates running against vulnerable Republicans in key swing states, hoping to tie those Republicans with Trump.""For down ballot Republicans, people running for the Senate, people running for the House, are they going to stay in line with this unshackled Donald Trump?"" Podesta rhetorically asked. ""Are they with him, or are they against him?""Clinton's campaign also hopes that their ground game can counteract any apathy that may be out there on this election.On Tuesday, Lily Adams, Clinton's director of battleground communications, sent reporters an email that touted higher ballot requests for Democrats than Republicans in Florida, a more diverse electorate in North Carolina and a sizable uptick in Hispanic registration in Nevada."

Democrats have asserted that the hacks were intended to benefit Trump, a point Hillary Clinton emphasized at the second presidential debate on Sunday night.""Believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected,"" Clinton said. ""They're doing it to influence the election for Donald Trump.""That sounds plausible to Kasparov, who called Trump an ""ideal person"" for Putin to recruit. One of the greatest chess players of all time and a passionate human rights activist, Kasparov has been one of Putin's most vocal public adversaries. Kasparov was detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport in 2007 while en route to an opposition rally, an action that was condemned this week by the European court of human rights.Kasparov lately has shifted some of his criticism to the US Republican ticket. In September, he ripped Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, for praising Putin's leadership.In Trump, Kasparov seems to see the same instincts exhibited by his Russian nemesis.
