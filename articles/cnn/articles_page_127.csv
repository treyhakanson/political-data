Another man -- a colleague of Burnett's friend -- was in the boardroom at the time of the incident.The woman told Burnett: ""Trump took Tic Tacs, suggested I take them also. He then leaned in, catching me off guard, and kissed me almost on lips. I was really freaked out. ... After (the meeting), Trump asked me to come into his office alone. Was really unsure what to do. ... Figured I could handle myself. Anyway, once in his office he kept telling me how special I am and gave me his cell, asked me to call him. I ran the hell out of there.""The Trump campaign has not responded to a request for comment.The alleged incident mirrors Trump's own words in the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape. Trump was talking about actress Arianne Zucker, who was waiting to escort Trump to a soap-opera set on which he was about to tape a cameo appearance. ""I've gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,"" Trump said. ""You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything."" The woman Burnett knows said Friday that hearing Trump's line about Tic Tacs in the 2005 tape ""just made me sick."" The other man who was in the boardroom in Trump Tower confirms the alleged 2010 exchange between Trump and the woman occurred. Trump was married to Melania Trump at the time of the alleged 2010 incident."	Source: Trump attempted boardroom kiss

An example of the rapid response came from Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat running in a narrow race against GOP Rep. Joe Heck for the seat being vacated by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. Trump bragged on hot mic about being able to grope women""It's clear from Donald Trump's past comments that he does not respect women, but these comments are beyond disgusting,"" Cortez Masto said in a statement. ""Lewd and offensive comments like this perpetuates a society in which sexual assault is normalized as 'locker room' behavior. Instead of standing up to this rhetoric, my opponent, Congressman Heck 'completely supports' Donald Trump.""Heck supported Trump prior to the audio being released but could not be reached immediately for comment.One of the most vulnerable Republicans running for re-election is Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who made headlines earlier this week when at a debate she said Trump was a role model for children. She backpedaled a day later, saying she had misspoken. Ayotte has said she will vote for Trump but not formally endorse him. When news of the Trump audio broke, Ayotte quickly put out a statement saying, ""His comments were totally inappropriate and offensive.""But that fell short for her opponent, Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. ""It's unfathomable and utterly inexcusable that Kelly Ayotte could hear these vile Trump comments, bragging about sexual assault, and not immediately disavow his candidacy for president,"" she said. ""Merely calling Trump's comments 'inappropriate' while continuing to support him to lead the free world is pathetic and wrong.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan both condemned Trump's remarks.""These comments are repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance. As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,"" McConnell said in a statement.Trump was scheduled to appear with Ryan on Saturday, but instead will stay away from Wisconsin.""I am sickened by what I heard today,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests. In the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow's event in Wisconsin.""Sen. Ted Cruz wrote, ""These comments are disturbing and inappropriate, there is simply no excuse for them.""Another GOP campaign rival to Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, tweeted, Donald's comments were vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify. No one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private.""Wyoming congressional candidate Liz Cheney tweeted, ""As the mother of three daughters & two young sons, I'm disgusted by Trump's ""locker room banter."" His appalling comments are indefensible.""CNN reached out to several GOP Senate candidates for comment but most did not respond, perhaps unwilling to touch the toxic comments from their standard-bearer.One that did is Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, who is in a close race against Democratic challenger Deborah Ross.""The comments are inappropriate and completely unacceptable,"" Burr said.And Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, who opposes Trump and frequently speaks out against his abrasive comments, tweeted, ""DJT is a malignant clown -- unprepared and unfit to be president of the United States."" Kirk is trailing Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth in most polls.Ron Johnson, an endangered Republican senator from Wisconsin, is scheduled to attend a Republican unity rally for Wisconsin Republicans Saturday. Johnson's campaign didn't answer whether he still plans to go.  Other Democrats who tried to pressure their candidates include Katie McGinty, who is in a tight race against Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. ""The only thing worse than Donald Trump's comments are the people who should be standing up to him but instead do nothing. Pat Toomey likes to say he'll stand up to Donald Trump, but every time something like this happens, he runs and hides,"" McGinty said. Toomey tweeted, ""Donald Trump's comments were outrageous and unacceptable.""And former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat who is running an increasingly distant second to Republican Sen. Rob Portman, blasted the incumbent for still supporting Trump.""Everyone in America is disgusted with Donald Trump -- except Senator Portman,"" Strickland said.

""I'm not going to get into the 'who said what' this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it,"" he said immediately after. When Trump bombed at the first GOP debate, Ryan sung his praises. ""I think he gave a spirited argument,"" Ryan said. And when it was revealed that Trump may not have paid 18 years worth of federal income taxes, Ryan brushed it off. ""I don't think it's that harmful,"" Ryan said. But in the aftermath of Friday's bombshell, a tape revealing Trump's lewd and offensive comments about women in 2005, Ryan had enough. Through aides and intermediaries, Trump was told he was no longer invited to a Republican event in Ryan's district known as ""Fall Fest"" designed to show unity and fire up the grass-roots in Wisconsin. The two men never spoke, but the message was sent. ""I am sickened by what I heard today,"" Ryan said. ""Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified."" For Ryan, handling Trump has been a challenge. He initially declined to endorse Trump, prompting an uproar. He lashed Trump for ""racist"" comments about a Mexican American judge. And Trump prompted a distracting fight this summer when he said he wouldn't back Ryan's re-election fight. (He later did.)Yet as the speaker of the House, Mitt Romney's 2012 running and a potential future presidential candidate, a lot is riding on the line. If he appears to be undermining Trump, it would cause a backlash from his party and could hurt his own House candidates who need Trump supporters to come out in November.So Ryan has been making the case in recent weeks for a ""unified"" Republican Washington led by a President Trump. Whether that message changes remains to be seen.The aftermath of Trump's stunning comments leave the GOP in an uncertain territory a month from Election Day. Republicans had hoped that the worst of Trump's controversies were over, and ultimately voters would not punish them for being on the same ticket as their controversial nominee. Not anymore.Now, party officials tell CNN say they will monitor how bad the fallout will be for Trump -- and how he performs at the next two debates -- before abandoning him completely.On Friday, one Senate Republican after another condemned Trump, though no one yet has pulled their endorsements. GOP officials say that could certainly change, especially if Trump continues his free fall. ""These comments are repugnant,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. ""As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere.""Democrats said simply expressing outrage was not enough. ""This is a moment for Republicans,"" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. ""It is time for every Republican elected official in this country to revoke their endorsements of Donald Trump.""Ryan has long said his Trump endorsement is not a ""blank check,"" but there's no indication yet that he would rescind his backing of Trump.But when the news came out Friday evening of Trump making lewd comments about women a decade ago, Ryan's top allies were perplexed. Top officials went underground, not answering questions for hours. It took several hours for both McConnell and Ryan to respond, angering senior Republicans looking for guidance from their top leaders.What makes the GOP unnerved is that they need Trump to keep the race competitive with Hillary Clinton in order to save their seats down-ticket. The calculation, according to top Republican officials, is that if Trump craters, it could prompt a wave election and give Democrats control of Congress.""If the (Republican National Committee) wants to maintain the shred of credibility they have left, they will immediately redirect every human and financial resource they are wasting on the SS Trump towards saving the Senate and the House,"" a senior GOP congressional official told CNN.So they've been eager to showcase unity with their controversial nominee, believing that a party at war heading into November will imperil their seats.But now, it's anybody's guess what may happen. ""We just got to run our own races,"" said one top Republican."	Donald Trump now too toxic for Paul Ryan, Hill GOP

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/what-is-the-electoral-college/index.html	"You thought you would be voting directly for a presidential candidate? ""One man, one vote,"" as they say? It's not that simple. Where did the idea come from?Instead of setting up a presidential election system through direct democracy, the nation's founders established the Electoral College in part to ensure the entire nation has a more equal say in the choosing of a national president. In a time when the states were more autonomous and the federal government didn't have as much power as it does today, the framers wanted to offset the chance that a single populous state or region would put forth a ""favorite son"" candidate that would almost exclusively represent the contender's home state and disregard the needs of other parts of the country. How many members of the Electoral College are there?Today, there are 538 electors from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The number of electors from each state is equal to the number of congressional seats the state has in the House and Senate. The District of Columbia was granted three electors by the 23rd Amendment, the minimum number. The people who make up the Electoral College are usually comprised of state party officials and generally chosen at the party's state conventions. Each party with a candidate on the presidential ballot puts forth a slate of electors. All but two states traditionally award the entire slate of electors to the candidate that receives a majority or plurality of votes. (The two states that do not follow this model, Maine and Nebraska, award two electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote and then candidates receive another vote for each congressional district they win.) Some states require their electors to vote for the candidate who receives the most votes, but even in states where it is not required, Electoral College members rarely depart from the will of the people. The candidate who receives at least 270 Electoral College votes becomes the next president.What does the current map look like?Applied to the 2016 presidential race, the ""Electoral College map"" that shows electors from each state heavily favors Democrat Hillary Clinton because of the demographic realities in recent years. Densely populated and ethnically diverse states such as California, New York and Illinois, which pack a combined punch of 104 Electoral College votes -- more than a third of the 270 votes needed to win -- are virtually guaranteed to vote Democratic. Recent state polling also suggests that support for Republican Donald Trump has fallen away in states he would need to secure the presidency, leaving Clinton ample room for victory. The current CNN battleground map is featured below.Clinton needs to pick up one battleground state to winBased on that CNN Politics analysis, Clinton would need to win just one of the most sought-after states that are traditionally required for victory -- such as Florida -- to be elected president. If she just wins the states that are solidly or leaning Democrat in our current analysis, she'd win 268 electoral votes, falling just short of the White House. Clinton could win a battleground as small as New Hampshire to push her over 270. The map below shows what a Trump sweep of all battleground states except Florida and a Clinton victory would look like:Trump must win all battleground statesIn order for Trump to win, he would need to secure all of the states currently considered battlegrounds, including Florida, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and New Hampshire, which would put him at exactly 270. Here's what a Trump winning map could look like:Of course, much can change between now and Election Day. Nearly anything can happen in the final run-up to an election. One other hiccup in the math is that Maine and Nebraska distribute their Electoral College votes semi-proportionally, so either candidate could squeeze electoral votes from districts in those states.What if there's a tie?You might have noticed that the total number of electors, 538, is an even number, which could, hypothetically lead to a tie. In this case, the House of Representatives would be called upon to choose the president. This has only happened twice in the nation's history, when there was a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr in 1800 and a four-way split in 1824. It is extremely rare. Can you lose the popular vote and still be elected president?The use of an Electoral College system can also mean that a candidate can win the popular vote and lose the election. This occurred most recently in 2000, when Democrat Al Gore was defeated by Republican George W. Bush despite winning more votes nationwide. "	Electoral College: What is it, and why is 270 important?

When British and French navies began seizing American merchant ships, Jefferson banned all his nation's vessels from the high seas. Soon 40,000 sailors rioted in our ports. Businesses collapsed and New England talked treason. A newspaper described it as ""cutting a man's throat to cure a nosebleed.""""What if"" -- or counterfactual history -- offers a unique way to explore the motives and potential actions of a major historical figure such as Alexander Hamilton. What if he hadn't died after that duel in 1804? We can't know for sure, obviously. But here are some ideas:The Hamilton who survived the duel would have run for president against Jefferson's handpicked successor, brilliant but colorless James Madison -- and won going away. He would have taken the country in a new direction, creating a trained army to win the War of 1812, absorbing Canada and changing the nation's name to The United States of North America.President Hamilton would then have turned his attention to large states such as Virginia, which was controlled by a critical Jefferson and his friends. Hamilton would have persuaded Congress to pass a constitutional amendment, empowering him to break them into several smaller states, more amenable to federal control. He had discussed this idea with several people before the duel. If the Virginians resisted, President Hamilton would have ordered his army to flatten them. This victory would have made it easy to abolish slavery.Next, President Hamilton would have used his army to force the Spanish out of Florida and Texas. If they refused to yield Texas, which menaced federal control of the key city of New Orleans, Hamilton would have smashed his way to Mexico City and set up a puppet government. He had often said we should at least ""squint"" toward Mexico as an easy extension of American power.Our dynamic president now would have turned to founding engineering schools and industries to make America a commercial giant, more than equal to Great Britain. Then would have come another task that he considered himself destined to master. The last letter Hamilton wrote before the duel called democracy a ""disease"" that endangered the republic. President Hamilton would have solved this problem by all but eliminating dissent. Tough libel laws would have tamed newspapers and the curriculum of all the schools would have emphasized strict adherence to federal leadership. President Hamilton would have underscored this by personally selecting all the nation's federal judges.Now would have come an opportunity for Hamilton to introduce one of his favorite ideas: the Christian Constitutional Society. He had proposed it when Jefferson won the presidency in 1800. It was designed to make Christianity a political force in the nation. Each year President Hamilton would have given a fervent speech at a national convention in Washington virtually guaranteeing sainthood to those who backed him.At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Hamilton had given a three-hour speech recommending a president should serve for life. A Christian nation would have made it easier for President Hamilton to announce he was going to seek a third and perhaps a fourth term. People would be inclined to see this as a blessing.Unfortunately, in the ""what if"" world of the Hamiltonian presidency, this lengthy tenure enabled his sons and their friends to acquire immense wealth. When they began winning Senate and House seats, people began talking about the dangers of an American royal family.President Hamilton would have died in office in 1830, after ruling for 22 years. On his deathbed he would have been rumored to have urged successors to imitate President Washington, who retired after two terms. But it was much too late to reverse the engines of federal power and change the family circle government that was running America.When other nations acquired labor movements, an idea that was scorned in Hamiltonian Washington, a handful of historians would begin debating an even more taboo topic. Astounding as President Hamilton's achievements had been, they would begin asking each other whether it was a good thing that Aaron Burr had missed on July 11, 1804."

His vice president, Harry Truman, had only been in that office for three months, so it's worth asking what might have happened if Franklin Roosevelt had actually lived through his fourth term,"" Yale University history professor Beverly Gage told CNN. Gage believes that foreign policy would largely have occurred the way it did under Truman. Roosevelt would likely have dropped the atomic bombs on Japan to end WWII and the Cold War would have risen, but perhaps more slowly than it did. Roosevelt's major impact would have come domestically, according to Gage. After winning four elections, FDR was clearly popular with the American people. Truman, on the other hand, was a political unknown without much momentum to lead the Democratic Party or his constituents.  ""The Republicans really mobilize. They won the 1946 election, and that becomes one of the moments when a new anti-Communist politics begins to emerge in the United States,"" Gage said. ""Joe McCarthy, he comes to Washington in 1946.""Truman's distaste for the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover -- with whom FDR had a good relationship -- may have indirectly led to McCarthy's influence in another way. Hoover took the information about Soviet espionage to Congress instead of the White House, leading to the House Un-American Activities Committee and the rise of McCarthyism as a central issue of American politics.""If Franklin Roosevelt had listened, responded, done some of the things the FBI was urging, maybe you never would have had that congressional committee moment. Maybe you never would have had McCarthyism,"" Gage said. But it wasn't just Sen. McCarthy who came to Washington after 1946 -- the ripple effects of that election spanned decades. ""If Franklin Roosevelt had been in office, if he had been able to mobilize different political constituencies at home, we might not have seen both McCarthyism, but we also might not have seen John Kennedy, who was (first elected to Congress) in 1946. We might not have seen Richard Nixon,"" Gage said. Both future presidents won seats in the House in the key midterm."	What if FDR had lived through his final term?
8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/clinton-emails-state-department/index.html	"The release is the first of four large productions before Election Day, with more expected in the months after.That production schedule comes as the result of several Freedom of Information Act lawsuits filed by the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch and VICE News journalist Jason Leopold, seeking information about the former secretary of State's tenure in office.Here's the latest in the Clinton email saga:Didn't the State Department already release Clinton's emails?Well, yes. But some of the ones coming Friday and in the future are new. Clinton turned over approximately 54,000 pages of her emails to the State Department last year, shortly after a New York Times report revealed her unconventional email setup of using a private server. Most of those emails were then released by the State Department, with redactions, between May 2015 and March of this year. So case closed. Right?Not so fast.Clinton's critics, including Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, continued to publicly question whether her staff had turned over all the work-related emails in her possession, as required by the Federal Records Act. That criticism reached a fever pitch in July, when FBI Director James Comey announced his investigators had recovered ""thousands"" of documents during their investigation of the private server, including emails that had not previously been provided to the State Department. How many emails are we talking about here?After an initial review, the State Department concluded the FBI's trove of documents included approximately 15,000 emails sent to or from Clinton. Of those, they believe about 9,400 are personal emails not subject to release. Of the remaining 5,600, the State Department believes ""a significant number"" are duplicates or near-duplicates of emails already turned over by Clinton.   Last month, US District Judge James Boasberg ordered the State Department to process 350 pages of emails for release on October 7, October 21 and November 4. The State Department then reached an agreement in a separate FOIA lawsuit to process an additional 1,850 pages for release by November 3, ensuring a review of at least 2,900 pages before the election. Five emails recovered by the FBI were released last month in a separate FOIA case, including a previously-unreleased email related to the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and an exchange between Clinton and former Secretary of State Colin Powell.Okay, so what's in this latest batch?Short answer: No bombshells. More than half of the emails are these so-called ""near duplicates"" of previously released emails, State Department Spokesman John Kirby noted in a statement Friday.""For instance,"" he said, ""a 'near duplicate' would be substantively identical to previously released emails but for a top email in the chain stating 'Please print.'""The State Department also found a few dozen exact duplicates -- which it did not re-release.There are also a number of emails between Clinton and her close aides in which they discuss scheduling matters -- timing for phone calls, meetings, etc.... And was there any classified material?None of the new emails contained information marked as classified or upgraded to classified. But six of the emails were near duplicates that included a previously-released email that had been upgraded when originally released. "	Clinton emails: State Department releases new batch

First up: Donald Trump thinks wages are too high. This one gets a little complicated: The Republican presidential candidate did use those words in a November debate, but the question was about raising the federal minimum wage to $15 -- a part Clinton fails to mention. Second: Trump doesn't want to raise the national minimum wage. Clinton's correct on this one -- partly. Trump has previously said he opposes raising the federal minimum wage, but would allow states to ""call the shots."" But later, in late July after clinching his nomination, Trump said the federal minimum wage should go up from the current $7.25 to $10 per hour.Third: In response to an auto bailout, Trump said he didn't care. Clinton might be twisting words on this one. While Trump did downplay the role of the Obama administration's intervention in the auto industry, he did say the situation could have ""rebuilt itself."" Finally: Trump has been sued 4,000 times for not paying his bill. Another false statement. He has been named in over f4,000 lawsuits, but more than half of the time, Trump was the one doing the suing. This fact check is one in a two-part series examining candidate.
