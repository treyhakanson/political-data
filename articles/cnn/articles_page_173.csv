Butterfield, a Democrat from North Carolina and chair of the CBC. ""Donald Trump is a disgusting fraud.""Butterfield, along with a dozen other members, made their comments at a hastily arranged news conference on a noisy Washington street corner, just outside a convention center where many were attending events for ""CBC Week."" One by one, members tore into Trump, calling him an array of names including ""hater,"" ""bigot"" and ""racial arsonist."" (They stressed that they were speaking on behalf of the group's political action committee -- which endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton earlier this year -- and not the caucus itself.)They were outraged by Trump's actions Friday morning, when he concluded a campaign event at his new hotel just across town in Washington with a few blunt sentences admitting that Obama was born in America. His comments came two days after he refused to say as much to a Washington Post reporter.""President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again,"" he said Friday, then ended his event and ignored shouted-out questions from reporters as he left the room. Trump is widely considered the leader of the birther movement and has taken credit for Obama releasing his long-form birth certificate five years ago.But as the nominee has begun to court votes from African-Americans in recent weeks, the issue has resurfaced given that many black voters felt his birther campaign was an attempt to delegitimize the first black president. Representatives from the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the news conference. ""One of the things we all are used to in this business is dog whistles, but the thing that we're not used to, and I'm finding it very difficult to get used to, are the howls of wolves,"" said South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn. ""These are howls. These are not whistles.""Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas argued that Trump could have ended the controversy in the same Washington Post interview where he continued it. ""There were no lights or cameras. It was a simple interview,"" she said. ""He could have taken the quiet time to apologize.""""But Mr. Trump could not bring himself to do so because he has lived a life of bigotry,"" she added. Others flatly refused to believe that Trump was honest in his comments Friday. ""He doesn't believe the things he's forced to say now in order to curry favor with people who are never, never going to support him,"" said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey. Virgin Islands Delegate Stacey Plasket also said Trump only addressed the matter because ""he was forced to address it."" ""Did he address in the a manner that showed him incorrect? No. He has moved on,"" she said. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that Trump had only 3% support among African-American voters. Trump has tried to boost his popularity among minority voters by traveling to places like Detroit and Flint, Michigan, as well as promising to address inner-city crime and expand education opportunities in urban areas. ""Don't be surprised -- because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks -- if, on November 8, I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago,"" he said last week before a largely white audience of evangelicals in Washington. While he has a few notable African-American surrogates, his outreach has been met with much resistance, including Friday's press conference by the CBC. ""Don't walk to the polls. Don't jog to the polls,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. ""Run to the polls to make sure this hater is not elected as the next president of the United States of America."""

""Donald Trump has had a great four days. Maybe he has had a great two years. He is taking up a lot of oxygen.""She said the solution was for the party to concentrate on registering voters.""You know what I tell the folks in Florida? Keep working ... Keep getting new voters registered,"" Brazile said. ""The (voter registration) deadline in Florida is October 11. Early voting starting in a couple of states on September 22. Keep working. Keep working. Keep working.""Donald Trump's unfulfilled promisesBrazile -- who became interim chair of the Democratic National Committee after her predecessor, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, stepped down after hacked DNC emails revealed staffers showing favoritism toward Clinton over Bernie Sanders -- also said hacking is a concern across the political spectrum.""I am convinced based on the evidence that we received from our sources that it was Russian intelligence services,"" Brazile said, adding, ""It is something not just political parties should be concerned about, but individuals as well as ordinary consumers.""Brazile also said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is taking steps aimed at preventing electoral systems being hacked.As for Trump's claims to be in good health, based on a letter from his doctor, Brazile was dismissive. ""I saw the one-liners -- 'excellent,' 'healthy,' 'great,'"" she said. ""I look forward to Donald Trump being in the next Olympics, OK?"""	DNC chair expresses confidence despite tightening polls

""There are worse statements made by members of Congress over a long period of time that they'd tried to implement into law.""Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961.Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller released a statement late Thursday attempting to lay to rest the birtherism that Trump promoted five years ago.

As the world knows, I was a little under the weather recently,"" Clinton said. ""The good news is my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women's health.""Democrats have long hit Republicans for, in their view, ignoring women's health needs by pushing to defund Planned Parenthood and other policy positions.Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia last week, but opted to ignore her doctor and continued to campaign over the weekend. On Sunday, at a 9/11 memorial ceremony, the former New York senator seemingly collapsed after leaving the event early. She had to cancel three days of campaigning because of the diagnosis.""Looking back I know I should have followed my doctors orders to test, but my instinct was to push through it,"" Clinton said at the Black Women's Agenda forum. ""That is what women do every day.""Last month, as Trump and his supporters pushed conspiracy theories about Clinton's health, the Democratic nominee went on Jimmy Kimmel's late night show and opened a jar of pickles to show her strength.""Back in October, the National Enquirer said I would be dead in six months. So with every breath I take I feel like I have a new lease on life,"" Clinton joked.'No erasing' Trump birther historyClinton weighed in on Republican nominee Donald Trump trying to walk back questions he raised about President Barack Obama's country of birth and American citizenship.Trump's campaign issued a statement on Thursday night that said the Republican nominee, who rose to political prominence by questioning the president's birthplace, now believes Obama was born in the United States. Trump has not publicly expressed that sentiment himself.Clinton said Friday that there is ""there is no erasing"" Donald Trump's birther history, arguing that Trump's campaign was ""founded on this outrageous lie.""""For five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,"" Clinton said. ""Barack Obama was born in America plain and simple and Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.""Clinton added, ""My friends, there is no new Donald Trump. There never will be.""Friday's event was a friendly one for Clinton. African-American women have been a supportive voting bloc for Clinton for decades and the former secretary of state said that she ""would not be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States were it not for black women.""Clinton, nodding to a popular hashtag on social media and phrase used to celebrate black women's resilience, added, ""You are proof that yes indeed, black girl magic is real.""

But what happens to those items after visitors leave? The wall is under the care of the National Park Service, and NPS staff has collected and archived the majority of items left there. And though there are a number of other memorials on the National Mall, the NPS only regularly collects items left at the Vietnam Memorial. ""We weren't sure what to do with the items at first. There were a couple of maintenance people who felt too guilty to throw away the things that they were finding there, and so they kind of squirreled away the items and kept them,"" NPS Museum Technician Janet Donlin told CNN. ""And in 1984, our regional curator found out that this was happening and she decided to make it an official Park Service collection."" Once collected at the wall by NPS employees, the items are taken to the Museum Resource Center in Maryland. The Center serves as the storage center for NPS collections in the National Capital region and holds more than 40 museum collections. To date, more than 1,400 boxes are dedicated to items from the Vietnam Memorial.Donlin is the museum technician in charge of cataloging and preserving the Vietnam Memorial collection. She estimates that, after more than 30 years, there are hundreds of thousands of items. The only thing the NPS doesn't keep are things like wreaths left by school groups — there are just too many. ""The biggest category of things that are left at the wall are what we call documentary artifacts -- basically documents. It's letters, poems, notes, pictures, collages,"" Donlin said. The collection includes such unique items as a race car hood, mannequins, a helicopter blade and a motorcycle. Per instructions from the Wisconsin veterans who constructed and donated the motorcycle, it is not to be ridden until all of the state's missing soldiers are brought home. There are still more than 1,600 Americans missing from the Vietnam War. POW/MIA Recognition Day is regularly marked on the third Friday in September when the President traditionally signs a proclamation.

""It's a little more personal. A little meaner. A little uglier.""Obama was speaking in Washington at a gala dinner for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, acting as a warmup for Hillary Clinton, who spoke afterward. Earlier, the White House said that no formal meeting was planned between the two Democrats, but that it was possible they would encounter each other backstage.During his remarks, Obama bemoaned controversial language about immigrants emanating from the campaign trail, saying it was destined to alienate voters.""There are a lot of folks who have this notion of what the real America looks like. And somehow it only includes a few of us,"" he said. ""But who's going to decide who the real America is? Who's to determine that in this nation of immigrants, in a nation where unless you are a Native American, you came here from someplace else, that you have a greater claim than anybody here. So we can't let that brand of politics win.""The President's immigration agenda has largely been stalled by Republicans in Congress, who have resisted attempts at passing a comprehensive reform package. Obama worked to enact unilateral changes to the system, but much of his efforts have been blocked in court.Obama said his successor will require support from lawmakers to advance meaningful immigration reform, ""no matter how tough she is."""

Bush, was a regular exerciser, Johnson has a decent case to make. The Libertarian candidate for president and former governor of New Mexico is an avowed athlete and outdoor adventurer. He said he has climbed the tallest peak on every continent, including Mount Everest. Men's Health totaled up the marathon times offered by previous presidential candidates, and Johnson had the shortest personal best. He was about an hour faster than Bush and faster still than House Speaker Paul Ryan, another well known fitness obsessive.Johnson has done more than marathons and titanic hikes, however. He talked to Runner's World about his performances in 10K, Olympic triathlon and Ironman as well. In July, CNN's Brianna Keilar asked Johnson about his athletic accomplishments and if he had any advice to dole out.""One step in front of the other,"" Johnson answered. He also took the opportunity to correct what he said was a previous misstatement. Johnson said he did not bike 600 miles in 36 hours -- ""I believe it was 485 miles in 36 hours."" The third party candidate and his campaign have often referenced his athletic chops to bolster his presidential bid. In the aftermath of his ""Aleppo"" gaffe, Johnson campaign spokesperson Joe Hunter told CNN that Johnson would overcome the major blow, adding, ""He has, after all, climbed a few mountains in his life.""

I was talking about media bias. I was talking about, if you're a conservative, it's essentially capital punishment. Even Jake Tapper from CNN said, listen, Donald Trump Jr. put out the same thing, he played the clip yesterday on his twitter account -- I said the same thing two weeks ago, and used the term electric chair. It was a poor choice of words, perhaps, but in no way, shape or form was I remotely talking about the Holocaust,"" Trump Jr. said. He also pointed to his sister, Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism when she married Jared Kushner, and said that ""half of my best men in my wedding and the bridesmaids in my wedding were Jewish.""""I would never do that. But what it shows, unfortunately, it almost proves the point. I say something, rather than the media asking me about it, rather than saying, 'Hey Don, were you talking about the Holocaust?' -- they jump to, 'oh my God!"" he said.The son of the Republican presidential candidate also discussed the Trump Organization and the scrutiny over its web of international business dealing, which have raised concerns about creating potential conflicts of interest for a Trump presidential administration. Trump said that his father would put his company in a blind trust that his children would manage, and dismissed concerns that having the children run the company would be an insufficient means of eliminating potential conflicts. ""It's not a blind trust if you and your siblings are still running the company,"" host George Stephanopoulos said. ""We're not going to be involved in government. We wouldn't be involved in government,"" Trump replied. Stephanopoulos countered, ""A blind trust is not a blind trust if it's being run by his children.""""It is because he'll have nothing to do with it,"" Trump said. ""He said that. He wants nothing to do with it.""""He's still going to know what the businesses are, where they are,"" Stephanopoulos pointed out.""No he won't. We will not discuss it -- "" Trump Jr. began, but Stephanopoulos interjected. ""How will he not know that?""""Because we're not going to discuss it. We're not going to discuss those things. It doesn't matter. Trust me, as you know, it's a very full time job. He doesn't need to worry about the business. The business is in good hands. He trusts us with that, the 100%."""

""US Special Operations Forces have been approved to accompany Turkish and vetted Syrian opposition forces as they continue to clear territory"" from ISIS, Pentagon spokesman Marine Maj. Adrian J.T. Rankine-Galloway said in a statement Friday.According to Rankine-Galloway, the US personnel will be conducting the same type of advising, assisting and training missions that the US had been providing to moderate opposition and anti-ISIS Kurdish and Arab fighters like the Syrian Democratic Forces.Turkish troops, tanks and Turkish-backed Syria opposition fighters crossed the Syrian-Turkish border in August, seizing the town of Jarabulus from ISIS and pushing south and west in an effort to clear the terror group from its border. The effort was backed by US and coalition airstrikes but not by American ground forces.Rankine-Galloway called the area that Turkey was working to secure ""strategically important"" to ISIS.A US official had told CNN last month that Special Operations Forces had initially intended to accompany the original Turkish offensive but that the US was still working on approving the proposal when Turkish units pushed across the border.  President Barack Obama has authorized up to 300 Special Operations Forces to be deployed to Syria. It was not clear if the Americans accompanying the Turkish military had been re-assigned from other locations in northern Syria or were part of a new contingent. A video reportedly showing US troops in Syria alongside Turkish army tanks in the northern town of Al Rai recently emerged online. A senior US official said that US troops had entered the town but had since left.The latest mission could also help ensure that Turkish troops and their Syrian allies do not come into conflict with other US-backed groups in Syria, such as the Syrian Democratic Forces. The Turkish government considers the Kurdish elements comprising that force to be terrorists, while the US sees the Kurdish fighters as key to efforts to combat ISIS. Clashes between the two groups took place at the start of the Turkish incursion into Syria, and the US has since helped oversee an informal arrangement under which Turkish and Kurdish forces will operate on opposite sides of the Euphrates River."
