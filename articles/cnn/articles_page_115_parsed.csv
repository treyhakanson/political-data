The justices considered whether the so-called ""no impeachment"" rule -- meant to protect the secrecy of jury deliberations and the finality of jury verdicts -- should be pierced when the deliberations include racial bias.As the lawyer for criminal defendant Miguel Angel Pena-Rodriguez began his argument seeking a new trial for his client, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito jumped in almost immediately. While both justices agreed the statements by the juror were clearly offensive -- they were troubled with where they could draw the line.  ""What about religious bias?"" asked Roberts. He suggested that if the court were to allow an exception to jury secrecy for race ""the next case"" was going to concern religion.But Pena-Rodriguez's lawyer, Jeffrey Fisher, said that ""race is different."" It was  a point several of the more liberal justices seemed to agree upon.Justice Elena Kagan noted there was ""screaming race bias"" in the jury room.""I always thought the most pernicious and odious discrimination in our law is based on race,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.Justice Stephen Breyer said, ""We're  trying to create a fairer system in general and one that will be perceived as such.""At a time when racial unrest has rocked the country, the Court has twice in two terms considered racial bias in the jury system. Last term a 7-1 court ruled in favor of a death row inmate in a case concerning racial discrimination in jury selection.Pena-Rodriguez was charged with unlawful sexual contact and harassment after two girls testified that he groped them in a bathroom at a horse-racing track in Colorado. Their father, a track employee, called the police who caught up with Pena-Rodriguez later the same night. The girls positively identified him as their attacker and he was later convicted.Consistent with the practice in the state, after the jury's dismissal, defense counsel remained to speak with the jurors. Two jurors privately explained that during deliberations another juror called ""H.C"" in court papers had expressed bias toward Pena-Rodriguez because he is Hispanic.The jurors signed affidavits outlining H.C's remarks including the fact that he was an ex-law enforment officers who felt that ""Mexican men had a bravado that caused them to believe they could do whatever they wanted with women.""The defense moved for a new trial, but the request was denied. Lower courts held that the state's ""no impeachment rule"" -- could not be breached.Sotomayor noted that everybody ""is afraid of opening the door"" in the case and asked Fisher to explain why the racial testimony in the case should be considered.Fisher called racial bias a ""stain"" on the entire judicial system and the ""integrity that it's built upon."" In court papers he emphasized that ""infecting the deliberative process with such racial bias violates the right to an impartial jury."" Roberts asked what would occur if the racial comments were ""less direct"" if, for example a juror referenced a bad neighborhood. Alito shared Roberts' concern of a limiting principle in other cases.Frederick R. Yarger , the solicitor general of Colorado, agreed that H.C.'s statements were ""reprehensible"" but he argued that sixth amendment does not compel an exception to ""no-impeachment rules"" even if there is misconduct during deliberations.He argued there are safeguards built into the system including -- voir dire -- the chance to probe potential jurors before trial of any bias.The Obama administration supports Colorado in the case. ""Racial bias is a real problem,"" Assistant Solicitor General Rachel P. Kovner told the justices. ""But there are ways to address that problem without undermining structural protections of the jury system that have withstood legal challenges for hundreds of year,"" she said."

Are you kidding me?"" the former Republican presidential candidate told CNN's Brianna Keilar. ""As I was growing up, people were always trying to talk about their sexual conquests and trying to make themselves appear like Casanova.""Carson, who supports Trump, said that at the time they were recorded -- nearly 11 years ago -- the Republican presidential candidate was a ""billionaire playboy,"" adding that he had personally heard people speaking in a similar manner about women in the past. Trump was married to his third wife, Melania, at the time.RELATED: Donald Trump: 'The shackles have been taken off me'When Keilar said she had never heard such lewd comments made, Carson said: ""Maybe that's the problem."" ""Whether they've heard it or not, the issue is the train that's going off the cliff. We can come back after we save the country, after we save the country from going off the cliff,"" he said.Carson said that conversation surrounding the leaked audio -- and accompanying media coverage -- were detracting voters from more pressing concerns, such as college debt and rising taxes. Trump campaign co-chair: Trump made lewd comments before recent faith journeyWith under a month remaining until Election Day, Carson said Trump must concentrate on leavening key issues and platforms, instead of responding to statements he made more than a decade ago. ""It's probably not what I would be concentrating on right now,"" Carson said. ""The place where Donald Trump is going to win is on the issues. Why not concentrate on what two out of three Americans are concerned about? That's the direction of the country. That's one he can win easily."""

They claim that it violated  their due process rights to hold them in ultra restrictive conditions.""Respondents do not challenge their detention,"" Jeffrey A. Lamken argues on their behalf in court papers. Instead, he says they challenge ""their highly restrictive confinement conditions"" that were inappropriate because they had no genuine terrorism connections.In the one-page order the Court noted that only six justices would hear the case as Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan are recused.A federal appeals court held that the claims could proceed against Ashcroft and others."

The update from Secretary Jeh Johnson warned those on the fence to make a decision. ""Time is a factor. There are only 29 days until election day, and it can take up to two weeks from the time we receive authorization to run the scans and identify vulnerabilities,"" Johnson said. ""It can then take at least an additional week for state and local election officials to mitigate any vulnerabilities on systems that we may find.""While it would be extremely difficult for any hackers to affect the outcome of the presidential election by attacking voting machines, experts say voter registration databases could be more vulnerable to tampering. Dozens of states have experienced attempts to access those registries, officials said, and roughly 90,000 of Illinois' voter records were stolen by hackers, though no data was altered in the system. The US government took the unprecedented step Friday of publicly blaming the Russian government for hacking into Democratic Party-affiliated groups in an effort to meddle in the election.

""So, I'm sticking with him, and I think that's the best place for conservatives to be."" The Republican Party was thrust into chaos last week following the publication of a recording in which Trump can be heard bragging about kissing and groping women. Dozens of Republicans rescinded their endorsement of Trump, whose poll numbers already appeared to be dipping even before the bombshell dropped. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the highest-ranking Republican on Capitol Hill, said Monday that he will no longer defend Trump -- although Ryan has not walked back his endorsement.Trump apologized for the remarks on the tape, which was recorded in 2005, but he has also dismissed them as ""locker-room talk."" King, one of the most conservative members of Congress, said Tuesday that a presidential election is unlike the decisions he faces as a lawmaker.""On the floor of Congress, I have the opportunity to vote yes or no on any bill that comes to the floor. ... But I don't get a yes or no for president, I only get a yes,"" King told Cuomo.""This is not a hard decision,"" he added. ""It's a binary decision."" King said that most of his GOP colleagues who have withdrawn their support for Trump are ""much closer to the left side of the Republican Party than those that are the solid conservatives in the party."" Asked about the vulgar comments Trump can be heard saying on the unearthed recording, which was first reported on Friday by the Washington Post, King said he would never say them, but ""I wouldn't say none of us have back in college years.""

Here's a look at some of his most notable comments of the day.'More inappropriate things'At his campaign event in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, Trump warned that if more embarrassing footage of the GOP nominee was released -- a reference to the fallout over the 2005 leaked audio in which he could be heard making crude comments about women -- he would retaliate.""If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we'll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things -- there are so many of them, folks,"" Trump said.'He's a good guy, Big Ben'Trump started his Ambridge rally -- his first time addressing his supporters in person since the 2005 audio surfaced -- with praise for Pittsburgh Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who has been accused of sexual assault on two separate occasions.""And we love Big Ben, Big Ben's a friend of mine,"" Trump said. ""We play golf together. He once played a shot that went dead right into a tree ... he is a strong guy, and he's a good guy, Big Ben.""'I consider myself in a certain way to be a blue-collar worker'Toward the end of Trump's speech in Ambridge, he said that wasn't proud of everything he's done in his life but was proud of his political movement and the way he's treated blue-collar workers. Trump -- who grew up in a Queens, New York, estate, has said he began his business career with a ""small"" $1 million loan from his developer father -- on Monday even described himself to be blue-collar ""in a certain way.""""I'm not proud of everything that I've done in life. I mean, who among us is? Is anybody totally proud of every single element? Some we are,"" he said. ""But let me tell you what I'm very proud of. I'm proud that I've always treated the blue-collar worker -- and I consider myself in a certain way to be a blue-collar worker -- that make this country run with tremendous respect.""'We're going to get a special prosecutor to figure this deal out'Trump made waves at the second presidential debate when he said that if he becomes president, he'd seek to imprison Clinton over her email controversy -- a stunning departure from the typical decorum of American politics.He reiterated his remarkable threat during his second campaign rally of the day, in Wilkes-Barre.""We're going to get a special prosecutor to figure this deal out ... I have never been so ashamed of this country as what's gone on with Hillary Clinton. I've never seen anything like it,"" he said. ""You've never seen anything like it. Thirty-three thousand emails.

Mike Pence, issued a stern statement denouncing Trump's remarks and canceled plans to appear on Trump's behalf in Wisconsin on Saturday.Then, at Sunday's debate, Trump disputed Pence over the GOP ticket's policy on Syria.In Wilkes-Barre, Trump addressed his relationship with Pence, saying that the Indiana governor contacted him before he put out his statement on the 2005 audio, and Trump called him a ""terrific person.""""Totally loyal guy, he called me up, 'Mind if I put out a statement?' Absolutely. So loyal. Such a terrific person,"" Trump said about his running mate. ""One of our really good choices. Do you agree with it?

On Tuesday's call she told her House colleagues that she is optimistic, especially with new polls. But the Democratic leader also noted that the election isn't for another four weeks and they need to continue to work hard because Republican groups will begin pouring additional resources into efforts to support GOP candidates. Tuesday's call concentrated on the fallout from the video that was released on Friday that showed Donald Trump using sexually aggressive and lewd language about women. Pelosi and Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, discussed their strategy in the final stretch of the campaign, sources told CNN.House Republicans were quick to dismiss Pelosi's latest prediction.""Nancy Pelosi's record of predicting House races is about as reliable as a carnival palm reader,"" Katie Martin, spokeswoman for National Republican Congressional Committee told CNN. Democrats need to pick up 30 House seats to win back the majority in the lower chamber.  That is a high hurdle with a relatively small universe of competitive districts. Redistricting in states around the country have made the vast majority of House seats solidly red or solidly blue, but Democrats are now hoping that a national election featuring a GOP internal fight with Trump can put more of these areas into play.Lujan told members there were numerous opportunities to pick up seats, and that more opportunities were coming up because of the changing dynamics at the top of the ticket.RELATED: Trump called Tyson rape conviction 'a travesty' in 1992 radio interview  Democrats on the call also discussed the recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showing Democrats leading Republicans in the generic ballot by a 7-point margin, 49-42%, which is the largest lead the party has held since the 2013 government shutdown. Lujan discussed a poll he commissioned that had similar results, according to the Democratic sources.As they do on calls with rank-and-file members, Democratic leaders urged members to pay their ""dues"" to the DCCC -- the amount each member is expected to contribute to the party's election efforts. Although many have already sent checks, leaders are continuing to remind those who haven't that's it's time to pay up."

Individuals on Facebook have since been commenting on posts from McCaughey's professional Facebook page with dozens of emojis, though as of Tuesday afternoon, the posts appeared to have been removed.
