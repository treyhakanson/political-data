""So it's a sign of hope for those who cannot bear wild globalization. They cannot bear the political life led by the elites.""Will Donald Trump transform European politics?""This win also kills the argument used by my opponents about isolation,"" she said. ""They say, 'Marine Le Pen, your policies have isolated you.' I feel less isolated today because of the multi-polar world defended by Donald Trump but also by Theresa May and Vladimir Putin.""Instead, she said, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande should feel isolated as the political landscape changes following Trump's win in the United States and Britain's vote for Brexit.Rise in populist partiesLe Pen is hoping that the recent rise in populist parties will continue in April and May when French voters go to the polls to elect a new President.""Each year that goes by, France sinks a little bit more into economic and social difficulties and I said five years ago, 'We will take power, within the next 10 years,' so I hope, I believe it will be in 2017.""Echoing Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" election slogan, she vowed to oversee a return to France's glory days, saying if she were in power, the country would be ""nothing like you have seen in the last 30 years.""""It would be very different. It would be the comeback of France, of the France that you like, of the France that hundreds of millions inhabitants of the earth love."" Trump's populism could be end of EUShe said there would be no place for multiculturalism under a Le Pen presidency.""I am opposed to a multicultural France, I think that those who have a different culture and who arrive in France have to submit themselves to French culture. Like the old saying, 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do.' I think that in France we should do like the French people.""That doesn't mean discriminating against, (or) persecuting; it means we have a culture, we have values, and all those who come to our place have to submit themselves to this culture and these values. ... Saying ... 'Come as you are, keep living like you do, keep your culture and we will add all that together,' doesn't work.  Multicultural societies are multi-conflict societies.""Establishment accused of scare tacticsLe Pen praised the US President-elect for what she called ""his willingness to break with the idea that the USA has to police the world."" And she accused the establishment of using scare tactics to try and persuade voters to stick with the status quo.""The system, when it disagrees, infantilizes the people and plays the 'Big Bad Wolf,' "" she said, insisting, ""They try to scare people because they don't have arguments, and (then) the day after the election of Donald Trump, the sun rises and we realize that none of the big disasters that were announced has happened.""They did exactly the same thing for the Brexit: The Brexit vote was going to trigger the collapse of the British economy, they were going to find themselves isolated in the world and Great Britain was going to drift away from the French coast. All that did not happen -- in fact the reverse has happened.""Donald Trump finds allies on Europe's rightA prominent Euroskeptic, Le Pen dismissed the European Union as a ""quasi-totalitarian political system"" that was being ""deeply rejected by the people of Europe"" and should be disbanded in favor of a Europe ""of free nations and of cooperation.""""Every time a referendum is organized, in whatever European country, it turns to the disadvantage of the European Union,"" she said. ""The nations want to take back their sovereignty, want to decide and be the owner of their fate.""I oppose the EU in the strongest way. ... It has to end.""Charges of xenophobia dog partyThe former lawyer blamed globalization and wide-scale international migration for causing conflicts around the world.""The truth is that nations are very ancient and have won their spurs for the protection of people on matters of security, prosperity, defense of identity,"" she said. ""The nations are not triggering the war; it is ultra-liberalism, the disappearance of borders, the great migration of people ... according to the ambitions of the multinationals that creates war. There have never been as many conflicts as there are today.""Anti-establishment tsunami sweeps EuropeLe Pen, 48, has led the National Front since 2011, attempting to ""detoxify"" the party somewhat of its reputation for racism and xenophobia, focusing instead on anti-EU and anti-immigration policies.In 2015, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was barred from the party he had founded in the 1970s after he was regularly accused of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. His repeated characterization of the murder of 6 million Jews as a small ""detail"" of World War II violated France's strict Holocaust denial laws, leading to a series of convictions and hefty fines."

Avakian, a champion of the LGBTQ community, was running for Secretary of State.  As labor commissioner since 2008, Avakian often made news for his tough calls against businesses discriminating against gay and transgender customers.The most noteworthy was when Sweet Cakes by Melissa refused to make the wedding cake for the same-sex couple in 2013, citing the owners' religious beliefs. Shop owners Melissa and Aaron Klein were ordered to pay $135,000 in emotional damages. They were also told they couldn't refuse customers based on sexual orientation. Melissa Klein claimed the ruling stripped the couple of their First Amendment rights. ""According to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech,"" she said in a Facebook post at the time. ""Sweet Cakes by Melissa"" eventually shut down completely, though their Facebook page remains active.Avakian was also responsible for slamming a $400,000 fine on a Portland bar owner who refused service to transgender customers, according to the Oregon Live.In his bid for Secretary of State, Avakian promised a push for ""progressive values"" like wage equality and reproductive freedoms. His conservative opponent promised to adhere to the position's basic, more traditional roles, like auditing public records and officiating elections.In the end, the opponent, Dennis Richardson won 48% of the popular vote, beating Avakian by nearly 100,000 votes. The victory makes Richardson the first Republican to win a statewide office in Oregon since 2002. "	Oregon official who shut down local bakery loses election

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/immigrants-daca-chicago-sanctuary-city/index.html	"""I have been reckoning with the reality and the possibility that my dad will lose his job.  That my family will lose their home. And that I might lose my friends and family to deportation and suicide,"" Gomez said with a shaky voice. Gomez was 11 years old when he came to the United States.  As an undocumented immigrant his sense of security has been a roller coaster of emotion. When he was a senior in high school, he said, he felt hopeless. ""I was depressed. I felt like giving up and I was in a very dark place,"" Gomez said. But his fears were eased when President Barack Obama offered young people who were brought to the United States as children a legal stay in 2012, through DACA.  DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, allowed hundreds of thousands of youth to come out of the shadows and get jobs and seek education opportunities. Gomez felt a sigh of relief under the DACA blanket.  He enrolled in college and began studying biochemistry at Illinois Institute of Technology.  But the grim feelings of despair returned when Trump won the election. ""Since Tuesday night, I have been feeling the same way I felt senior year. I feel as if my degree will mean nothing once my DACA expires,"" Gomez said. Public health crisis in Chicago Gomez's fears and those of other immigrants, refugees, Muslims and LGBTQ people have leaders in Chicago calling the post-election scene in the city and around the state a public health crisis. Calls to mental health hot lines have increased by 200% at the state level and 250% at the national level, said Patrick Magoon, president and CEO of Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago during a press conference citing crisis center data. ""We've also been alerted about an increase in demand for counseling services at colleges and schools across our state,"" Magoon added. In a press release, the hospital pointed to evidence that some students have interpreted the rhetoric of the election as permission to bully students of color and minorities.  Schools are reporting instances of hate speech, racist vandalism and classes being canceled due to safety concerns.  The medical community worries for the well-being of the victims of bullying because of the possible mental health risks.  ""Whether they be adults or children who are concerned or scared, and suffering, we need to make sure that they feel the protective shield of an adult community that loves them and will connect them to appropriate services,"" said Colleen Cicchetti, executive director of the Center for Childhood Resilience. Fearing deportationThe pain is real, said Nancy Villa.  She is a DACA recipient whose anxiety skyrocketed when  Trump took the White House. ""I'm scared. I cannot focus in school. I worry all the time,"" Villa said.  ""The anxiety and the worries that I fear hurt.""  Villa, 21, fears deportation and said she has experienced the separation of family before.  Her mother made the trek to the United States from Mexico when she was a little girl, leaving her behind.  Eight months later, Villa, who was 9 years old, made the two-week journey to Chicago with her grandfather.  Reuniting with her mother, Villa said, is a moment she remembers vividly and emotionally.  It was Mother's Day 2004. ""I got down off the bus and I got to see her from far away, so I ran to see her and hugged her,"" Villa said. Her single mother, she said, has raised her and her five siblings by cleaning bathrooms and offices in a factory.  Villa's dream is to finish college and get a good job, so her mother doesn't have to clean bathrooms for a living. ""Without DACA I cannot do this. I will not be able to work. I will not be able to pay for my school and I will not be able to help my mom,"" Villa said. When asked if Trump's latest interview with ""60 Minutes,"" in which he said he would focus on deporting criminals rather than the masses, gave her peace of mind, she said words from  Trump don't settle her fears. ""I don't have faith in the things that he says, I guess. It's kind of hard to trust him,"" Villa said. Chicago is a sanctuary city To calm the fear and the anxiety in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel reiterated his support and the city's commitment to immigrants and people of all faiths living in the city. Chicago is a sanctuary city, Emanuel emphasized, a place where local police will not coordinate with immigration agents or federal agencies to enforce federal deportation efforts. ""To be clear about what Chicago is, it always will be a sanctuary city. To all those who are, after Tuesday's election, very nervous and filled with anxiety, you are safe in Chicago,"" Emanuel said. Like many cities around the country, Chicago has seen hundreds of protesters hit the streets after  Trump's win.  Some of the protesters are undocumented, and have taken their fears and turned them into action. Gomez, the DACA recipient who fears Trump's America, said he hopes politicians take action on immigration, too.  It's the only way to end the roller coaster of fear and anxiety that has marked his life in the United States. ""Protect us, protect my community, protect me. Or get ready to step down for those who are ready to fight Trump's policies,"" Gomez said.  "	Immigrant youths fear Donald Trump's America

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-shortlist-national-security-worldview/index.html	"One source with knowledge of the transition described it as a ""knife fight."" The split has put traditional Republican operatives such as Reince Priebus -- named Trump's chief of staff Sunday -- against more non-traditional influences such as Steve Bannon -- the alt-right leader of Breitbart News -- who will be Trump's chief strategist. A particular challenge is lack of clarity about the division of power among Priebus, Bannon and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who also has a key role in transition decisions. Another source tied to the transition described the resulting confusion as ""buffoonery.""On Tuesday morning, former congressman Mike Rogers announced in a statement that he parted ways with the Trump transition team. Rogers' participation was seen as a heartening sign to many of the establishment side of national security advisers. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the new leader of the transition operation, will be at Trump Tower in New York Tuesday to meet with Trump and discuss possible nominees.The divisions are being played out as Trump considers key appointments in the national security and diplomatic sectors, including secretary of state, with mainstream conservatives supporting John Bolton against Rudy Giuliani, who is seen as a loyalist to Trump.On other key national security appointments, there is more agreement. Sen. Jeff Sessions is now the leading contender for attorney general, and is in the mix for secretary of defense as well, say multiple sources with knowledge of the transition. Retired Lt. General Ron Burgess, former director of the DIA, is a leading contender for director of national intelligence. Retired General Michael Flynn is leading candidate for national security adviser.No matter who gets what job, one description seems to fit the makeup of the short list: unconventional. And it highlights the dilemma faced by Trump, who is now torn between a campaign promise to shake up Washington and a need to build a national security team with policy experience.  The presence of so many political backers could signal that Trump values loyalty over experience and is keen to have people on board who share his worldview and are willing to depart from conventional wisdom. Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?This is particularly true when it comes to the secretary of state post. The position of America's chief diplomat is considered a particularly high-profile one, charged with maintaining relationships around the globe.But some of the names being rumored for the job seem to indicate that Trump will favor an iconoclastic approach to the role:Rudy Giuliani, possible secretary of stateGiuliani, a former federal prosecutor and mayor of New York, has little foreign policy experience to speak of but has been a vocal advocate of Trump's since early on in the campaign.During his own run for the presidency in 2008, Giuliani espoused a fairly conventional Republican foreign policy view, calling on continued US engagement abroad and robust efforts to fight terrorism and stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan.He also signaled support for democracy promotion, something at odds with Trump's pronouncements where he has put value on stability and counter-terrorism as opposed to democracy and human rights. A source familiar with the transition process told CNN that Giuliani has expressed his preference for the secretary of state position as opposed to the post of attorney general. John Bolton, possible secretary of stateBolton, a diplomat in the George W. Bush administration, backed Trump soon after he secured the nomination and would be one of the more conventional choices. But despite spending years at the State Department, Bolton has at times ruffled feathers in Washington. He was appointed to be ambassador to the UN, a Cabinet level position, in 2005. But his nomination was met with fierce opposition in Congress and Bush was forced to appoint him during a congressional recess.A source familiar with the transition said the Trump team acknowledges that Bolton's confirmation might be difficult but they think it would be less tough than it was 10 years ago.He also has elements of the conservative mainstream in his corner; he was endorsed by the influential National Review magazine in an open letter to President-elect Trump over the weekend. Bolton has consistently advocated for unilateral and interventionist approaches to foreign policy challenges.Like Trump he has opposed the Iran nuclear deal going so far as to call for airstrikes against Iran, penning a 2015 op-ed in the New York Times titled ""To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran.""He has also been highly critical of international institutions and organizations like the UN, something that tracks closely with Trump's professed ""America first"" and anti-""globalist"" approach to foreign policy. In that vein Bolton led efforts to withdraw America's signature from the International Criminal Court. But Bolton has also been a harsh critic of Russia -- a stance that might put him at odds with any effort to improve ties with Moscow, something Trump has stated as an objective of his administration. Sen. Jeff Sessions, possible attorney general or secretary of defenseAccording to one source familiar with transition, the job of Defense Secretary is Sessions' if he wants it. Trump is also interested in the senator for attorney general, CNN's Dana Bash reports.Sessions would also be a more conventional choice having represented Alabama in the Senate since 1997. He sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and also served in the US Army Reserve from 1973-1986.Sessions also meets the loyalty test having been the first sitting senator to endorse Trump during the campaign. But Sessions is not a typical Washington insider, at times taking positions at odds with his colleagues on the Armed Services committee. While Sessions has called for a defense spending boost, many of his other positions, such as a skeptical view of NATO and friendlier view of Russia, while at odds with his Republican senatorial colleagues brought him more into line with Trump's campaign comments. Sessions shares Trump's hardline positions on immigration as well and is also under consideration for Attorney General. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, possible national security adviser On the defense side, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has emerged as a possible choice for national security adviser. Former military officers have found themselves in the role before, Barack Obama's first national security agency was former Gen. James Jones and Colin Powell served as the National Security Adviser to President Ronald Reagan. Flynn, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is well versed in international and security affairs.But Flynn, a vocal and sometimes fiery advocate for the president-elect during the campaign, has also echoed Trump's rhetoric of fighting terrorism, boosting ties with Russia, and casting a more critical eye on NATO. Why there are so few conventional choicesA few more establishment type names are being floated for roles that oversee the intelligence community.Burgess, the former DIA director, is also thought to be a potential selection for the director of national intelligence, which oversees the sprawling intelligence community.And Pete Hoekstra, a long-serving former congressman from Michigan who chaired the House Intelligence Committee from 2004-2007 is thought to be in the running for the same role or director of the CIA.While more conventional picks had initially been rumored for State and Defense such as the head of the Council of Foreign Relations, Richard Haas, and George W. Bush's National Security Adviser, Stephen Hadley, most analysts are beginning to believe that the odds favor a more conventional choice. One of the reasons for the non-traditional short-list is that many of the Republican Party's most senior national security experts denounced their presidential candidate during the campaign as too reckless to lead the nation safely, somewhat limiting the pool from which to draw. But some foreign policy luminaries have suggested that Republican experts should put aside their differences and Brent Scowcroft, George H.W. Bush's national security adviser national security adviser and who backed Hillary Clinton for president, told attendees as a ceremony at the Aspen Strategy Group Monday that ""If you're asked to serve, please do. This man needs help.""One rumor has emerged that radio host Laura Ingraham could be Trump's White House spokesperson.Asked outside of Trump Tower about that possibility, transition communications adviser Jason Miller did not address it specifically, but said to expect some interesting names.""You're going to see a number of different names that are ultimately becoming a part of the President-elect's administration,"" Miller said. ""There will be non-traditional names, a number of people who have had wide-ranging success in a number of different fields; wide-ranging success in business ... People will be excited when they see the type of leaders the President-elect brings into this administration.""This story has been updated."	'Knife fight' as Donald Trump builds Cabinet
