1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/epipens-congress-response/index.html	"One Democratic senator whose daughter has allergies has called for action and another Democratic senator's daughter is CEO of the company responsible for the price hike.Sen. Joe Manchin said Thursday Mylan, the company which manufactures Epipens which is headed by his daughter, is responding to constituent and lawmaker questions.""I am aware of the questions my colleagues and many parents are asking and frankly I share their concerns about the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs,"" the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement. ""Today I heard Mylan's initial response, and I am sure Mylan will have a more comprehensive and formal response to those questionsâ€Ž.""His daughter, Heather Bresch who is Mylan's CEO, announced Thursday the company is taking steps to make the product more affordable, including providing $300 savings cards to cut the price in half, though she told CNBC the health care ""system"" needed to be fixed. ""I look forward to reviewing their response in detail and working with my colleagues and all interested parties to lower the price of prescription drugs and to continue to improve our health care system,"" Manchin added.But Sen. Richard Blumenthal dismissed the change as a ""PR fix.""""This step seems like a PR fix more than a real remedy, masking an exorbitant and callous price hike. This baby step should be followed by actual robust action,"" the Connecticut Democrat said.""The only fair and effective relief is a substantial price reduction for everyone who needs access to this life-saving drug, not just a special break for people who are in particular health plans and have the extra hours in their work day to navigate a bureaucratic labyrinth of discounts. I will continue to push for a federal investigation and Congressional action.""Sen. Chuck Grassley also said Thursday that those changes don't address the big issues.""The announcement today doesn't appear to change the product price. The price is what Medicare, Medicaid and insurance companies pay.  It's what patients who don't get assistance cards pay,"" the Iowa Republican said in a statement. ""And when drug companies offer patient assistance cards, it's usually not clear how many patients benefit.""  Grassley had written Bresch earlier this week, requesting information about the reason behind the price increase. On Thursday, Grassley said he was still seeking answers from Mylan.Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat whose daughter relies on EpiPen, urged the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week to investigate the price increase of the medication, calling it ""unjustified.""Klobuchar, voicing concerns for parents whose children have allergies, wants action.""Many Americans, including my own daughter, rely on this life-saving product to treat severe allergic reactions,"" the Minnesota Democrat wrote in a statement on her website. ""Not only is this alarming price increase unjustified, it puts life-saving treatment out of reach to the consumers who need it most."" The price increase has caused a public outcry as parents of children who have these severe allergies are particularly sounding the alarm as students are returning to school.A standard two-pack of EpiPens now costs about $600 whereas the price was $100 in 2009. The pen provides epinephrine, a hormone also known as adrenaline that can help relax muscles in the airwaves in the midst of a severe allergic reaction. The School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act became law in 2013 to encourage states to increase their supply of epinephrine in schools. Some states have gone as far to pass laws requiring schools to have the drug.""EpiPen expires after a year, meaning consumers are required to buy new EpiPens annually. However, due to the increasing cost, some people are being forced to carry expired doses of EpiPen, hoping the product will work even past the expiration date,"" Klobuchar added.Klobuchar also urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Mylan has used incentives and exclusionary contracts to deny an alternative product to hit the market. She said the concern around EpiPens is not unique to this drug. ""Unfortunately, the story of EpiPen is not unique. Time and again, we see reports of a pharmaceutical company buying a prescription drug product and then raising the price dramatically,"" she wrote. Sen. Claire McCaskill and Sen. Susan Collins, leaders on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, wrote Bresch expressing their concern about the declining affordability of Epi Pens.""There have been numerous accounts of individuals who are simply unable to afford this lifesaving medication and as a consequence have gone without, risked using an expired product, or resorted to uncertain (but less expensive) treatments,"" they wrote.The Senators are requesting a briefing with Bresch to occur ""at a mutually convenient time no later than two weeks from"" Wednesday. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton weighed in on the issue calling the increases outrageous.""Over the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%,"" she said. ""That's outrageous -- and it's just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers.""Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders also tweeted that the price increase is unreasonable.""There's no reason an EpiPen, which costs Mylan just a few dollars to make, should cost families more than $600,"" he tweeted. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that pharmaceutical companies ""do real damage"" to their reputations by making drugs unaffordable.""Obviously, I'm not going to make specific comment or specifically second-guess the pricing strategy or the business practices of one private enterprise,"" he said. ""I will observe, however, that pharmaceutical companies that often try to portray themselves as the inventors of lifesaving medication often do real damage to their reputation by being greedy and jacking up prices in a way that victimizes vulnerable Americans.""This is not the first time this year Congress has gotten involved over the high cost of pharmaceuticals. In February, the House Oversight Committee questioned former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli for hiking up the price of Daraprim, a toxoplasmosis treatment used by AIDS patients, by 5000%.Shkreli defended Mylan in a tweet Wednesday.Rep. Elijah Cummings accused Shkreli of dealing in ""blood money"" and taking advantage of Turing's customers. ""People are dying and they're getting sicker and sicker.""""Like a Ponzi scheme, it appears that Turing might be using profits from Daraprim to invest in new drugs that it would then jack up prices for,"" the Maryland Democrat told Shkreli."

""It's become socially desirable -- especially if you're a college-educated person in the United States of America -- to say that you're against Donald Trump.""The hidden Trump vote in this country is a very significant proposition,"" she said.Conway told CNN Wednesday that interview was conducted weeks ago before she was named campaign manager.And Conway -- a veteran pollster who previously worked on Ted Cruz's presidential campaign and for Trump's VP pick Mike Pence -- suggested that the campaign's internal data was more favorable than most polls show. ""Have you been able to put a number on"" those particular voters, asked Matt Frei, the interviewer. ""Yes,"" Conway replied.""What do you think it is?""""I can't discuss it.""""Oh come on,"" Frei interjected. But Conway declined. ""No, it's a project we're doing internally. I call it the undercover Trump voter, but it's real."" Trump's campaign manager also criticized the media for presenting a skewed picture of the 2016 race. ""Just the cherry-picked polling numbers that are put out there by media outlets that are also bent on his destruction. Donald Trump performs consistently better in online polling, where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the election,"" Conway said.Trump has also employed a version of this argument. Last week, he sent out a tweet that read, ""They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!"" It was a reference to the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union -- the result of a referendum that many observers expected to go the other way but which polling showed to be close. Nevertheless, the Brexit vote has become a talking point for those who question the accuracy of polls of the 2016 presidential election. Nigel Farage, a leader of the Brexit movement, told Sky News that he would appear on stage with Trump on Wednesday. CNN has reached out to confirm the visit from Farage but has not yet received a response. The idea that a significant portion of Trump voters are disguising their support to pollsters because they are embarrassed or afraid to admit it isn't backed up by much evidence. But it's the latest example in a long history of trailing candidates taking shots at unfavorable polls. As founder of FiveThirtyEight Nate Silver pointed out on Twitter, 1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale also sought to discredit his poor polling by pointing to the size of his rallies and the enthusiasm of his supporters -- an argument frequently made by Trump surrogates -- only to lose the election by 18 points. In CNN's latest poll of polls -- an average of multiple polls that meet CNN's standards -- Clinton leads Trump by 10 points. "	Donald Trump polls: Campaign manager points to 'undercover' voters

She went to his wedding,"" she said, adding, ""No, he was not paying to play.""Trump has recently upped his attacks on Clinton and her family's namesake foundation saying that foreign governments and business leaders gave primarily to get something in return.""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins,"" Trump said Tuesday night at a rally in Austin, Texas. ""The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech.""Trump's name is listed on the Clinton Foundation's website as having given between $100,001 and $250,000.""As part of the Foundation's commitment to transparency, we publicly disclose those who support our efforts on a quarterly basis,"" the website said. ""This list is comprised of those who have made contributions or grants to advance the work of any part of the Clinton Foundation, as well as membership, sponsorship, and conference fees for the Clinton Global Initiative.""Conway said Trump gave because he believed the foundation did good work.""The Clinton Foundation does a lot of good work and I also want to say that for the record that they do,"" she said.""They do good work.

""I had a great meeting with great people, great Hispanic leaders, and there could certainly be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We want people -- we have some great people in this country. We have some great, great people in this country but we're going to follow the laws of this country and what people don't realize -- we have very, very strong laws.""Trump did not provide further details.His stated immigration stance -- which include deporting all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country and building a wall along the US-Mexico border -- is a key part of his appeal to the Republican Party base and helped propel him during the primary season. But his policies have been harshly criticized by Democrats and some Republicans, recent polls have shown him trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and last week, he shook up the leadership of his campaign, installing a new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and CEO, Steve Bannon.Conway also declined to provide details when asked about the ""softening"" by CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday. But she didn't dispute the notion.""In principle, it's exactly the same. It's how to execute. And he's been taking the counsel of many different people who tell him what is possible,"" Conway said.Asked specifically about the deportation plan, Conway replied, ""There could be a way to figure out how to do it so we're not here to harm people.""Speaking before Trump's campaign rally in Austin, Texas, Tuesday night, Alabama Republican senator and longtime Trump ally Jeff Sessions tried to parse Trump's words, saying he was softening his position on the ""legality"" of illegal immigration. Pressed on what he meant, Sessions said Trump is ""wrestling with this issue.""Immigration in focus at rallyIn Austin, Trump trained his sights on border security as he reached the illegal immigration section of his stump speech. ""This election we'll decide whether we have a border,"" Trump said, vowing again to build a wall on the southern border.Trump did not address his proposal to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US nor the ""softening"" of his positions.But Trump lamented crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and laid the deaths of American citizens killed by undocumented immigrants at the feet of ""the policies of Hillary Clinton and (President) Barack Obama,"" before introducing eight mothers who lost their children to undocumented immigrant criminals.One of the mothers, who did not say her name, pointed to the need to deport undocumented immigrants, regardless of whether they are criminals -- the very policy Trump appears to be rethinking.""If a few of you still feel that compassion for illegal families not being separated, this is what I have of my family -- his ashes,"" the woman said."

Sanders sent his first fundraising email for the new organization to supporters at the beginning of the month.2016 candidate matchmaker""We are building a new organization called Our Revolution. Our goal will be the same as in our campaign: we must work to transform American society by making our political and economic systems work for all of us, not just the 1 percent,"" he wrote on August 3. Our Revolution will focus on involving new progressives into politics, even as local as school board and city councils. It's a message Sanders fervently preached as his campaign was ending. ""All of you know that election days come and go but what is much more important is that political and social revolutions continue,"" he said in a rambunctious town hall in New York City at the end of June.Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college mapThe organization's first mission has been fundraising for the primary opponent of former Democratic National Committee chief -- and Sanders nemesis -- Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Tim Canova.Our Revolution will be lead by Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, who will function as the president of the organization. Sanders' former bodyman, Shannon Jackson, will work as the executive director.

Taste test 2016: Clinton's cookies vs. Trump's cookiesThe slow end of the Sanders campaign was viewed by some in the campaign as a good way to ease die-hard fans into the idea of Clinton as the Democratic nominee. Weaver, for his part, is not concerned that Bernie supporters might be losing interest or steam now that Sanders is no longer in the race. ""I think that Bernie Sanders' supporters were strongly motivated by that desire to see progressive change. I'm confident they will want to remain involved and I'm very confident that we will be able to retain the level of excitement,"" he told CNN.Despite positive spin from Weaver, the organization itself is already experiencing some turmoil. Buzzfeed first reported that eight members of the organization recently quit. Weaver confirmed to CNN that seven had left, saying one person thought they were going to leave but decided to stay.Weaver said he was not sure if Sanders would mention Clinton and his desire to see Donald Trump defeated.

Robert Abrams testified during a pre-trial hearing. ""I take that duty very, very seriously.""Abrams, commanding general of Forces Command, was compelled to take the stand after Bergdahl's attorneys filed motions earlier this week against Abrams challenging his ability to oversee the case fairly. The case was referred to general court-martial by Abrams, the convening authority in the case.Bergdahl, who could spend the rest of his life in prison, is facing the court martial for charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy after he disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in June 2009. He was captured and held in captivity by the Taliban until a prisoner exchange in May 2014.For about 30 minutes, Abrams answered questions from Judge Army Col. Jeffrey Nance, who is overseeing the court-martial trial, in a courtroom at Fort Bragg.On the stand, Abrams, a four-star general, denied any wrongdoing and insisted that he has not been swayed by comments made about the case by Sen. John McCain or his time working for former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. While Abrams noted that he had worked for Hagel at the time the US military was trying to find and rescue Bergdahl, he said he never had any direct involvement in those missions. Abrams also addressed what he called ""inappropriate comments"" McCain made to Th Boston Herald in October. McCain told the Herald he would hold a congressional hearing if Bergdahl wasn't punished during his military trial. In the same interview, the Arizona Republican added that Bergdahl ""clearly deserted"" his post.Abrams said comments made by McCain and other public figures are inappropriate and make it hard find jurors who have not been affected by such remarks.Defense attorneys also have said that Abrams should be removed from the case because of letters he received from the public about Bergdahl that were destroyed without the defense seeing them.Eugene  the lead defense attorney, told reporters that Abrams' destruction of the letters was ""detrimental to the defense"" and ""uncorrectable.""Prosecutors argued the letters would have no impact on the trial since they were inadmissible.Nance ended the three-day pre-trial hearing Wednesday without ruling on the motion to have Abrams dismissed, but said he will issue his opinion in writing as soon as possible."

Trump's remarks suggesting ""premedication"" on Clinton's part also come as he continued to accuse her of engaging in corruption during her time as secretary of state, prompting his supporters to cry out with the staple chant of ""Lock her up! Lock her up!""Trump once again read from teleprompters Wednesday, which he's done at every rally since early last week.Trump was introduced by Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, who argued that Clinton ""committed numerous, numerous serious federal felonies"" and that recent emails suggesting favors traded between the Clinton Foundation and Clinton's State Department amounted to a scandal potentially ""bigger than Watergate."""

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/joe-biden-turkey-coup-us-support/index.html	"""I can understand how some of your countrymen feel the world didn't respond to their existential crisis rapidly enough or with the appropriate amount of solidarity and empathy,"" Biden said following a two-and-a-half hour meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""That's why I wanted to be personally here and was asked by the President to personally represent him to tell you and your colleagues and countrymen how very, very sorry I am"" about what the nation experienced.A strain in relations -- Turkey's request that the US extradite the cleric, Fethullah Gulen -- was a key part of the agenda during the vice president's brief visit to the country.According to a US aide, Biden, in a meeting with the Turkish Speaker Ä°smail Kahraman, said he ""wish(ed) Gulen were in another country"" but added in his meeting with Erdogan that the United States will abide by its system of extradition according to law and extradition treaties.""We will abide by our system. We will continue to abide by the system and, God willing, there will be enough data and evidence to be able to meet the criteria that you all believe exist,"" Biden said, according to reporters traveling with him.Erdogan, however, firmly called for Gulen's extradition, claiming that the cleric manages a terrorist organization from Pennsylvania.In a press conference at Ã‡ankaya Palace following his meeting with Prime Minister Binali Yildirim earlier in the day, Biden said the US was committed to helping the Turks bring to justice those responsible for the coup attempt.""We are cooperating with Turkish authorities,"" Biden said, referring to the extradition request. ""We have no, no, no interest whatsoever in protecting anyone who has done harm to an ally, none. But we need to meet the legal standard requirement under our law.""Some in Washington privately doubt Gulen's involvement and have been critical of the heavy-handed Turkish government response to the coup attempt.The fallout has left US-Turkish relations at their most fragile point in decades. Erdogan and his Islamist AKP have taken positions contrary to American preferences even as Washington depends on its NATO ally for support on a host of regional issues, ranging from fighting terrorism to dealing with Syrian refugees and foreign fighters who transit through the strategically located country.The trip comes as Turkey launched a new campaign Wednesday to clear ISIS from a border town in northern Syria after recent attacks in the region that the government has blamed on terror groups.In the wake of the coup attempt, Turkish leaders have accused the US of insufficient support for the government and even alleged possible American involvement -- which the Obama administration has strenuously denied.Yildirim said Wednesday that while the Turkish government accepts the US assertion that it wasn't involved, there may be some people in the country who believe differently and he pointedly suggested the successful extradition of Gulen could affect those perceptions.""The US administration, President Obama and Mr. Vice President as well, have clearly and explicitly condemned the coup attempt,"" Yildirim said, indicating he accepted the validity of their words.But he continued, ""There might be different opinions among the people,"" which he said the extradition of Gulen would ""in a short amount of time return or rectify the people's perception back to their normal positive situation.""Biden stressed Wednesday that the decision of whether to extradite Gulen would be handled by a judge, not the President. Such a move would be an impeachable offense, he said, noting that US legal experts are working closely with Turkish officials to review relevant evidence to be supplied to an American court.The vice president also expressed ""admiration"" to the Turkish people for taking to the streets during the coup attempt to ""take back"" their democracy.""The people of Turkey have no greater friend than the United States of America,"" Biden said. ""We've seen that borne out each time we stand together to face down threats to our shared security and common values.""The Turks have submitted four extradition requests for Gulen, but all of them were related to allegations of criminal behavior that predated the coup attempt, said a senior administration official who briefed the press traveling with Biden.The official said the Turks had not yet provided extradition requests related to Gulen's alleged involvement with the coup attempt on July 15, nor provided evidence of his connection to it.Gulen has denied any involvement in the failed coup, which left more than 200 people dead.The Department of Justice is taking the extradition request ""very seriously"" and has more lawyers on the case than any recent extradition request they have handled, according to the senior administration official. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that some Justice Department officials were set to travel to Turkey this week to meet with their counterparts to review some of the materials that have been produced by Turkish officials.Within Turkey, Erdogan has launched a massive crackdown on judges, teachers and journalists whom the West sees as unlikely to have joined with the military officers behind the plot. The effort has raised significant human rights concerns.Biden said he had addressed the issues in his meetings with Turkish leaders Wednesday. ""They plan on making sure their constitutional principles are adhered to and that the rule of law will prevail,"" Biden said. ""Remember the confusion after 9/11? Let's give this some time. Let's give them some time. I believe they mean what they say and so let's move on.""Maintaining strong relations with Turkey is particularly important as the US and coalition countries battle ISIS. At one point after the coup attempt, the Turkish government temporarily cut off power to Incirlik Air Base, which Biden called a ""linchpin"" of US anti-ISIS efforts. US forces have relied on Incirlik for launching air strikes and conducting surveillance and reconnaissance missions against the terror group.Biden said he regretted not being able to travel to Turkey sooner to show solidarity with the Turkish people and the Turkish government.Before the new conference, the vice president also toured the parliament building, badly damaged by air strikes during the coup attempt, with the Speaker of Parliament Ismail Kahraman and Biden noted the psychological impact the damage has on the public.""This is devastating, can you imagine if this happened at home?"" Biden said after seeing windows blown out by the blast, broken glass and rubble in the complex's courtyard. ""Can you imagine what the American public would be saying or doing?""Biden later talked about the damage ""striking at the heart of Turkish democracy"" and said he was thankful the speaker had not been in his office when the building was struck."
