But Bill Groth, a Democratic lawyer fighting the Pence administration in state court, cautioned that if the court accepts their argument, it could shield all his communications from the public. ""If the court buys their separation of powers argument, the executive branch will be exempt from (Indiana's public records law),"" Groth said. ""Why are they willing to take that risk if they have statutory arguments and they aren't really seeking to exempt the executive?""In Clinton's case, her use of a private email server led to an FBI investigation that dogged her campaign but never amounted to a determination of wrong-doing. But the GOP ticket used it as an example of what they said was poor decision-making and worked to further voter distrust of her.""The FBI last summer concluded that Hillary Clinton having classified documents on that private server was 'extremely careless,' "" Pence said just last week. ""And I guess today, I don't know if you heard, today they announced that they had not changed that conclusion.""But a top Pence spokesman said that this current email case, which is being weighed in Indiana's Court of Appeals now, is nothing like Clinton's email scandal. ""The plaintiff received the text of the email in one question. One email,"" said Pence deputy chief of staff Matt Lloyd. ""The court reviewed the white paper and determined the state was correct in protecting it as attorney client privilege.""Lloyd added that Pence has never had a private email server and never destroyed any devices containing his emails. Groth did receive the email he sought, about Pence's decision to have the state join a consortium of other states suing to block President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration. But he is fighting for access to the attachment to that email, an issue paper that Pence's lawyers argue is confidential under attorney-client privilege. Indiana's public access counselor, a lawyer who independently reviews public access and transparency complaints, determined that Pence had complied with state law in the case and did not ding him on the issue. The same counselor, last year, blasted state lawmakers for shielding their communications from public view. But public access advocates and journalists have put Trump on watch, after he blacklisted reporters -- something Pence said he fought against after joining the ticket. And Pence himself has had transparency woes, after he was forced to pull the plug on a proposed state-run news service last year."

I don't -- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot ... I would certainly like to talk to him. And -- see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that.""Comey has almost seven years remaining in his 10-year term. A president can fire him for cause. The political repercussions of doing that are another matter. The 10-year term is intended as a way to give FBI directors a measure of political independence that spans presidential administrations.Counterterrorism is the FBI's top priority and those matters are likely to make up the bulk of the interaction between FBI director and president.But during his campaign, Trump also advocated discriminatory policies such as surveillance of mosques and compiling a database of Muslims that are likely unconstitutional. He also embraced the use of torture, including waterboarding and other so-called enhanced interrogation techniques that are now banned. Speaking to a rally in February, he said ""torture works.""Trump also has raised the possibility of reopening a federal investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, a matter Comey has signaled is now closed.Comey in recent months has declined to comment on questions about Trump. It's not clear when the new President plans to sit down with the FBI director.Attempting to push through discriminatory policies would meet resistance among career lawyers at the Justice Department and elsewhere in the government.""There are thousands and thousands of people in the government who are going to have to resist what Trump and his entourage are planning,"" said Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman and top aide to former Attorney General Eric Holder. ""And Jim Comey is one of the most prominent and powerful of those people.""Comey has a history of bucking presidents. In 2004, as the Justice Department's No. 2 official, he refused to reauthorize a surveillance program ordered by President George W. Bush. The episode included a dramatic showdown between Comey and White House officials at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft. He and other top officials threatened to resign until Bush made changes to quell the rebellion.From ballots to Bannon: What's happened in one weekThree years later, as the Bush administration tried to save the shaky tenure of then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Comey, by then no longer in the government, appeared before a Senate hearing to retell the story of the hospital incident. His testimony describing the confrontation with Gonzales, at the time the White House's top lawyer, sealed the fate of the embattled attorney general. The 2016 political maelstrom that engulfed Comey and the FBI is exactly what Comey tried to avoid, people close to the FBI director say. The FBI worked to complete the Clinton investigation before the July Democratic convention.No one could have counted on the intrusion of Anthony Weiner, the disgraced congressman and estranged husband of Clinton's longtime aide Huma Abedin.FBI investigators looking into allegations that Weiner sent sexually explicit messages to an underage girl stumbled on a batch of Abedin's emails that appeared to relate to the Clinton probe.Even if Clinton had won the election, Comey would have faced similar awkward questions.In July, when he announced a recommendation of no charges in the Clinton email investigation, he also delivered stinging criticism of the Democratic presidential candidate's carelessness in using the private server. In October, 11 days before the election, Comey dispensed with longstanding Justice Department police not to comment on politically sensitive investigations and sent a letter to Congress advising that the FBI was investigating the recently discovered batch of Abedin emails.After blasting Clinton, Pence in an email battle of his ownThe incoming Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, before the election, said he had lost confidence in Comey's ability to continue in office.People close to Comey say he has no plans to leave the job prematurely.One senior US government official says that asking Comey to leave office now would be bad for the institutions involved, including the FBI and the White House.""The purpose of the 10-year term is to put the office above politics,"" the official said.Rick DesLauriers, who served as the bureau's top agent in Boston and held a high-level post at headquarters before retiring, said he imagined things might be awkward between Trump and Comey initially.""But if I was a betting man,"" the 26-year veteran agent said, ""I would bet that he'd keep his job.""DesLauriers said he suspects former US attorneys and Trump advisers Rudolph Giuliani and Chris Christie, would be able to give the President-elect some perspective on the tough spot Comey found himself in with respect to the investigations involving Clinton.""There's no reason for him to be removed for cause -- he's broken no laws,"" he said of Comey.One official familiar with Comey's thinking says he's aware ""the first meeting or two will be awkward"" but ""he has no plans to go anywhere. He feels perfectly comfortable in his place,"" one source says.Despite causing a political firestorm with the letter he sent to Congress about the new emails, he still believes he did the right thing, including the unprecedented July announcement.""The big things he decided to do he would do it again,"" one person familiar with the matter said. Some Clinton supporters aren't yet ready to forgive Comey for his actions in recent months. But they also hope Comey can be the one to stand up to Trump.""You can point to a lot of reasons why Hillary Clinton lost but I think the evidence is clear that had Comey not sent his letter 11 days out, Hillary Clinton would be the President-elect right now,"" Miller, the former Justice Department spokesman said. ""He owns that for history. The least he can do is to stand up for fair enforcement of the law inside the Trump administration.""Even if Comey survives the Trump audition, there's still the matter of quelling grumbling from some inside the bureau about the handling of the Clinton investigation.Months of wrangling, particularly between the FBI's New York office and FBI headquarters, have prompted concerns that FBI leaks could do damage to the bureau's reputation.Former FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert Anderson, who worked alongside Comey before retiring last year, acknowledged that there are pockets within the bureau unhappy with Comey's actions surrounding the Clinton email server investigation. But he believes that in time tensions will subside. ""The bureau has done what it's been doing the last 100 years,"" Anderson said.  ""Overall the men and women in the FBI are very good at what they do and know this will pass."""	Critical Dems hope Comey can help curb Trump

A surge in donations for organizations like the ACLU. And the #SafetyPin movement, where you clasp the pin somewhere on your person to indicate you're a safe ally to talk to. Keep the momentum going. Here are 25 ways you can elevate your activism: Local politics and activism1. Know who your local legislators and politicians are Here's where to find your House Representative. Put your address in here to find a full list of your elected officials. 2. Know how to get in touch with them (and actually make them listen.)Here's a great Twitter thread from a former Congressional staffer about how to actually get politicians to listen (your phone is your best ally). Here are some general guidelines on how to contact them. 3. Identify an issue you care about and pursue itHopefully you don't need too many resources on this, though here's a good list of social issues to get you started. 4. Attend town hall meetings A town hall is where you, in person, can make your actual voice heard, in front of local politicians who can actually do something about it. Your congressperson will usually have a schedule of Town Hall meetings on their website, or you can check out your city's website as well. 5. Attend City Council meetings Alternately, attend a City Council meeting to get an up-close view of what's important to your city's legislators. 6. Get to know your local School Board If you have kids in school, you probably need to know about your school board. Here's everything about what a school board does and how you can get involved.  7. Join your local PTA Not only can you have a direct communication with your school, you can also volunteer and participate in other ways that directly impact your community. Here's how (and why) to join. 8. Mobilize more people to support your cause You alone are great and awesome and boy, can you make a difference. Now imagine,a dozen more of you. Get a group together to do any of the above things; attend meetings or join an association, and your cause will be magnified. 9. Join a voting league or political organization A non-partisan group like the League of Women Voters is a good way to get informed, or you can choose a political group that aligns with your values. 10. Register to act on behalf of a political party. Here's a starting place for Republicans. Here's one for Democrats. Keep in mind your party has a state chapter, too. Not feeling the bipartisan vibe? Here's a full list of established political parties, along with their missions and contact information. 11. Join a campaignIf you find a local politician who represents the change you want to see in your community, contact their office to figure out how you can get involved in the campaign! Maybe they'll have you stuff mailers or put up signs or some other boring task, but the boring tasks is what actually gets stuff done. 12. Volunteer at their headquarters Like we said, your state, city and county have party headquarters that are just waiting for your time and energy. Just give it a Google. They WANT you to help out, so it's not that hard to find. If you'd rather stay at home, you can most likely take part in digital activism: Sending newsletters or text messages or organizing online campaigns. 13. Attend or organize rallies and events Just make sure you're safe and lawful. Alternately, there are always political talks and events going on, probably in your area. Look them up here. 14. Pound the pavement If you want to influence people, you're going to have to actually go out and, you know, MEET the people you want to influence. Here's a good article from the New York Times on why this method actually works. 15. Volunteer to work at a polling placeTo start, you can get registered on the Election Assistance Commission's website. 16. Volunteer to register voters Here are some openings for voter registration drives. If you can't find what you're looking for, simple search for your city and state, along with ""voter registration drive."" 17. Vote Make sure you're registered. And do it in every election, not just the big ones. Political education18. Subscribe to a paper or other publication you believe in If you're unhappy with journalism or media coverage, find a publication that represents good journalism to you. Click on it often. Pay for a subscription. Support it any way you can. 19. Read up on American history and civics USA.gov is your best friend. There's history and civics there, but it's just the beginning. Here's a link to the National Constitution Center where you can read a word-for-word breakdown of the document. Here's a link to the American History section of the Library of Congress. Go crazy. 20. Share that knowledge Have discussions with your friends and family. Engage in respectful debate when appropriate (and no, that doesn't mean on Facebook timelines). Spread the word. Community outreach21. Volunteer at a place that benefits your community Ideally, you can align your volunteer work with your most important causes. Volunteer at church, at the local VA hospital, at a homeless shelter or at a school. The possibilities are endless, but this website is a good place to start. 22. Volunteer at a museum, state or national park, cultural center or historical society Volunteering isn't just about serving others, it's also about making sure the organizations that are important to you can continue to serve others. 23. Hell, GO to a museum, state or national park, or historical society SUPPORT. EDUCATION. IN ALL. FORMS. 24. Donate At the very least, let your wallet do the talking. If you're looking at a specific charity, check Charity Watch to make sure your money is being well-used. 25. Get off the internet Complaining on social media only gets you so far. Get out, meet people, use your hands and your time. "	25 ways to be politically active...without the safety pins

Marco Rubio, assembled vast networks to finance their bids. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tapped into the grassroots to fund massive campaigns based on small donors.The year when money won nobody nothingAnd then there was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on whose behalf donors gave more money than anyone else. But when all the votes came in, Trump's unorthodox campaign and its haphazard financing managed to upset them all.Here's what that money looks like.Biggest donorsPer Open Secrets, the biggest donor in the entire cycle was liberal billionaire Tom Steyer, who put in $67,286,217. Steyer is a Democrat and a climate change advocate who has spent the past few electoral cycles pouring money into races he thinks will push the US towards action on the issue.The other largest Democratic donors after him were Donald Sussman and Fred Eychaner, who dropped $39,134,400 and $34,274,991, respectively.The three largest Republican donors were Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson with $47,357,200, GOP powerbroker and Trump ally Robert Mercer with $23,539,900 and Paul Singer with $23,027,164. But the largest contributor on record to the Republican cause in the 2016 cycle was the man who will soon occupy the White House -- President-elect Trump. He regularly claimed he was self-funding and pledged to spend $100 million of his own money. As the dust settles, it appears Trump donated $65 million to his own bid.Clinton vs. TrumpBy the end of October, Federal Election Commission totals showed the Clinton campaign raised $497,808,791, and the various outside groups supporting her candidacy raked in $189,453,103. All told, that was a staggering $687 million.Meanwhile, the same reporting period showed the Trump campaign raised $247,541,449, and the various outside groups supporting him took in $59,389,531. Taken together, the Trump effort was worth about $307 million -- less than half of the Democratic Party's explicit attempts at keeping the White House.Judging off the numbers available, Trump donors got much more bang for their buck. For every single Clinton vote, the campaign and outside groups took in about $11.21, while the donations behind a single Trump vote were $5.07.PrimariesSome competitors for their party's nominations made it much farther than others, but here's what they pulled in.Sanders, and outside groups that tried to make an independent, democratic socialist the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, had a total of $229,094,231. And on the GOP side, Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz raked in $162,500,053 and $143,008,247, respectively.Perhaps the biggest example of the 2016 disconnect between fundraising and electoral success was Bush. His campaign and its affiliated super PACs -- especially one called Right to Rise -- took in $155,822,452. Bush dropped out of the race after the third primary contest and ended up earning a single delegate for the Republican National Convention.	A $2 billion election, by the numbers
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/gop-governors-donald-trump/index.html	"At the first major gathering of Republicans since Trump's victory, high-profile governors largely set aside the topic of the President-elect himself. Instead, they said they're thrilled that the GOP controls both Congress and the White House. And they're excited about the promotion within their own ranks, with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence set to become vice president. ""I'm just giddy, and if you talk to any of the governors here, we are so excited at the possibility and the opportunities that are going to be here,"" said South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. ""The idea that now we can start to really govern -- I have never known what it's like to have a Republican president. I can tell you that the last five years, Washington has been the hardest part of my job,"" Haley said. ""This is a new day."" Haley added that ""one of the things I'm most excited about"" is Pence's election as vice president. ""It's exciting for the governors to be able to finally say, 'Yes, we can do this,'"" she said. Trump transition memo: Trade reform begins Day 1Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker credited ""big and bold"" GOP governors' reforms with handing the party at least 34 governor's offices and said it's ""why Donald Trump was able to win on Tuesday."" ""We have shown that actions speak louder than words,"" he said, adding that he wants the Trump administration to follow GOP governors' lead. He said there was ""love for Trump and hate for the other candidate"" in manufacturing- and energy-heavy states. Haley and Walker's comments were notable because the two opposed Trump -- with Haley both criticizing and antagonizing Trump while campaigning in the GOP primary with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Walker running against the President-elect in the Republican primary and later criticizing Trump's controversial remarks. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said he's ""completely thrilled"" that the GOP fully controls Congress with ""someone of our own stripe, Mike Pence,"" guiding Trump in the White House. He said shifting control of federal dollars to states for education, health care and transportation are priorities. ""To me, it's wide open and it's exciting. It seems to be a very bright day,"" Ducey said, while warning that Republicans should also have ""humility"" and acknowledge the party hasn't fully capitalized on its windows of full control of the government in recent decades. ""We cannot squander this opportunity. We have to act with purpose,"" he said. The four governors were part of a panel discussion at the first public event of the Republican Governors Association's annual meeting here.Republican leaders to Obama administration: Stop enacting new regulationsThey each credited Trump with seizing on economic frustration and a sense that Washington has stalled. ""I think the message of a complete outsider, a non-politician and a business man in a change election was extremely powerful,"" Ducey said, crediting Trump for tapping into voter frustration with Washington. ""Anybody that wants to get up on Monday morning and go to work for a living -- these are people we should be talking to,"" he said. Hutchinson noted that Trump's own allies and supporters urged him to stay on message during the campaign. ""People are going to be pulling for him to be successful, because he is our president,"" Hutchinson said. ""And I'm hopeful that just like he was pragmatic in the campaign, he'll be pragmatic as president."" "	GOP governors 'giddy' in wake of Donald Trump's win

Trump has been criticized by Republicans at times for his praise of Putin and believes that the US and Russia can work strategically together to advance an international agenda.McCain said President Barack Obama's attempts to cool tensions between the US and Russia had enabled the nation to exert more power in Syria and provide key support to embattled Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.""At the very least, the price of another 'reset' would be complicity in Putin and Assad's butchery of the Syrian people. That is an unacceptable price for a great nation,"" McCain said. ""When America has been at its greatest, it is when we have stood on the side those fighting tyranny. That is where we must stand again.""McCain said to pay no heed to any more conciliatory language from Putin, who he blasted as a ""former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections.""Trump and Putin spoke recently by phone, and the incoming US president also spoke Tuesday with Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko, a Putin foe."

Some of it pretty troubling and not necessarily connected to facts, but being used effectively to mobilize people,"" Obama said at a news conference alongside Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. ""And obviously, President-elect Trump tapped into that particular strain within the Republican Party and then was able to broaden that enough and get enough votes to win the election.""Obama said countries across Europe, as well as the United States, were confronting populist movements based on a fear of intruding global forces, arguing people ""are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world."" He said leaders should heed lessons from results in the US and in Britain, which in June voted to exit the European Union.""It starts looking different and disorienting. And there is no doubt that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right,"" he said. ""That sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity. And that can be a volatile mix.""He said Americans must guard against those trends during Trump's presidency, and insisted he, too, would speak out against divisive language even after he leaves office.""We are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a them,"" he said. ""And I will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the future of the world is going to be defined by what we have in common as opposed to those things that separate us and ultimately lead us into conflict.""'Between frustration and anger'Explaining Trump's win to Europeans, who themselves face rising populist movements in countries across the continent, Obama theorized Americans were simply ready for a change in Washington and were not rejecting his policies outright.""People seem to think I did a pretty good job,"" he said, alluding to surveys showing his job approval rating near its highest point. ""And so there is this mismatch, I think, between frustration and anger.

We just got a shellacking last Tuesday. We got an unexpected defeat and we've got to recalibrate it and decide how we go forward,"" said Rep. G.K. Butterfield, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and a Pelosi supporter. ""It's just like death. There are difference stages of grief you go through.""The vote is now scheduled for November 30.As she left the meeting Tuesday, Pelosi downplayed the delay, saying that it doesn't mean ""very much because we'll be out for Thanksgiving. But we'll have for the rest of this week to go over some issues.""No formal challenger has surfaced to Pelosi, but Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan has emerged as the de facto leader of a younger group of House Democrats looking for new direction. Ryan called Tuesday's delay a ""good first step"" and said the Democrats need to start thinking about states in ""flyover country"" that they lost to Trump.""We lost those voters and we've got to find a way to get them back in. And it starts with a message that resonates in the fly-over states,"" Ryan said. ""Who is the leader who can going into the Southern states? Who can going into the Midwestern states? That's the question, that's the discussion we need to have.""On CNN's ""The Lead,"" anchor Jim Sciutto pressed Ryan, ""it sounds like it's clear you're not ruling out challenging Pelosi for the leadership."" ""I'm not, and I don't think anyone else is. I think there are a lot of people having conversations right now,"" Ryan confirmed. A group of younger Democrats has been organizing behind the scenes to review Democratic leadership in the wake of last week's results. By Monday evening, Pelosi's challengers had gathered 33 signatures to a letter seeking a thorough review of why Democrats lost so badly, although the letter did not explicitly call for a challenge to the former House speaker.Wounded Democrats attempted to laugh off last week's results at the opening of their meeting, watching a series of ""Saturday Night Live"" clips mocking Trump. But the mood quickly turned serious, as Pelosi said she was open to delaying when Democrats pick their leaders, but that she had been hearing from members that they wanted their leadership selected before Thanksgiving and that the vote on timing should happen this Thursday. Pelosi told the members that she had planned to leave the decision until after Thanksgiving, but said they have to move forward now, according to a Democrat in the room.""I don't care. I'm agnostic. I was ready to go with after Thanksgiving because I didn't want the new members to be spending all their time worrying about who they are going to vote for -- for this, that or the other thing,"" Pelosi said. ""Then, many of the members were saying: 'Why are you delaying the elections?' And the press was picking that up. 'Why are you delaying the elections?' I'm not delaying it.""But there was long line of House Democrats who stood up inside the meeting looking to decide Tuesday whether they would push back their selection of leaders. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, pushed inside the meeting to hold a leadership vote December 1, but after it became clear that the majority of her colleagues wanted more time Pelosi backed down and set the vote for November 30.A Democratic member supporting Pelosi downplayed Tuesday's strife, ""today was letting the steam out of the pot.""Instead, the source said that much of the anger was directed at Clinton campaign for dragging down the rest of the ticket. The source also noted that Pelosi helped Democrats flip five seats previously held by Republicans.But even if Pelosi stays, the source acknowledged a need for change elsewhere among the Democratic leadership.""Our caucus needs a change, but it's not at the top. Replacing a woman with a white male would mean that the next time our nation's leaders meet -- the President with Senate and House leaders -- will look like the first time our nation's leaders met,"" the member added, referring to Tim Ryan's possible candidacy.

I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!"" he said.Former Congressman Mike Rogers said Tuesday he parted ways with Trump's transition team, removing an establishment national security voice from the planning process of the next president's cabinet.Rogers was told Monday on the phone that he was out, according to a source familiar with the transition. The source said this was part of an effort to replace the transition team members associated with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who previously headed up the transition team's efforts until being replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  ""Sometimes in politics ... there are people who are in and people who are out. And the people who have been asked to move on have some relationship with Chris Christie,"" Rogers told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday night.  ""And so there's a whole series of about five of them that fit that criteria that were asked to leave in the last few days. And you know what? That's absolutely the campaign's prerogative. I hope they all stay engaged,"" he added.Kushner has been rubbing allies the wrong way in his recent efforts to purge the transition team of Christie associates, sources say.Kushner's father was prosecuted by then-US Attorney Christie in 2004 for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions.Trump's team of bitter rivalsRogers, who had been working on the transition team for months under Christie, was sidelined as the campaign and transitions merged into one presidential team, with members of Trump's inner circle that were with him through the campaign taking more prominent roles in the transition, according to one source familiar with the transition activity.But another source, a longtime Christie associate, cautioned that there was no ""purge"" of Christie staff, the team that began the transition months ago, and that such a characterization is ""overblown."" While some Christie staff have left, others are continuing on with the transition team.A high-ranking Trump insider said the so-called ""purge"" focused only on lobbyists.The Christie associate said it makes sense that Pence would want some of his own people involved now that he is running the effort.""I think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they'll get that settled pretty soon. I think they're going to need to do it because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important,"" Rogers told Cooper.Earlier Tuesday, Rogers positively described his time period working with the transition team as a ""privilege,"" in a statement to reporters, and said he was handing off his responsibilities as a national security adviser to the transition organization to Pence and ""the stellar new leadership team."" ""I look forward to continuing to provide advice and counsel as needed to the incoming Trump administration as they work to make America great again,"" Rogers said in the statement.Speaking to CNN's Jim Sciutto on ""The Lead,"" Rogers said later Tuesday that he felt the transition team was ""going in a different direction,"" though he noted some confusion on the team.""Is there a little confusion in New York? I think there is. I think this is growing pains,"" Rogers said.The news of Rogers' departure was first reported by Bloomberg. Rogers' participation in the transition team was seen as a heartening sign for traditional GOP national security advisers.Sources tied to the transition team talking to CNN described the organization's internal disagreements -- mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more non-traditional influences on national security issues -- as a ""knife fight"" on Monday.'Knife fight' as Trump builds an unconventional national security cabinetRogers chaired the House Intelligence Committee while he was in Congress and is an Army veteran and former FBI agent with an expertise in national securityHe has also been critical of Russia's role in recent hacking episodes, including the hacks of Democratic political groups during the election which the US government attributed to high levels of Russian government. Trump repeatedly declined to acknowledge Russia's role, saying the evidence was inconclusive.Amid the churn in Trump's transition team the Obama White House Tuesday night said it's moving forward with a broader sharing of information.""We received the MOU signed by Vice President-elect Pence this evening,"" said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokesperson. ""The next step is for the President-elect's transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government. Once we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts as we continue our work to facilitate the transition to the next administration.""
