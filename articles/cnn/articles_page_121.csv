He attacked Hillary Clinton over Bill Clinton's alleged sexual misconduct. And he repeatedly made false claims and factual errors. For Trump, it was a real improvement. The second presidential won't catapult Trump past Clinton -- but it might save his candidacy from the cratering that appeared imminent in the 48 hours leading up to their showdown in St. Louis. Here are CNN's takeaways from the second presidential debate: Scorching the earthTrump called Clinton ""the devil,"" told her if he were elected he'd appoint a special prosecutor and ""you'd be in jail,"" and claimed Clinton has ""tremendous hate in her heart.""  And those weren't even his most shocking moments of the night.  Ninety minutes before the debate, Trump held a surprise event with three women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and one woman who was 12 when Hillary Clinton was the court-appointed defendant for the man she said raped her. Trump also invited them into the debate hall as his guests. And he attacked Clinton over her husband's behavior during the debate.  ""What he's done to women, there's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation who's been so abusive to women,"" Trump said of Bill Clinton. ""Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously,"" he added, without providing evidence to support his claim.  A scorched earth debate, on The Daily David ChalianThis is what scorching the earth looks like.  It was even too much for Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus to take. ""I wasn't involved and it's a campaign decision,"" he told CNN's Sara Murray after the debate regarding the decision to invite the four women.Trump downplays lewd comments as 'Locker room talk'Trump was forced at the opening of the debate to address the controversy that's torn apart the GOP and led more than two dozen high-profile Republicans to withdraw their support: his 2005 comments on a hot mic that his star status allows him to sexually assault women.  His message: It wasn't really that bad.  ""This was locker room talk,"" Trump said. ""I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family; I apologize to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it, but this is locker room talk."" When co-moderator Anderson Cooper pressed Trump to say whether he's ever actually -- as he claimed in the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" video -- gone up to a woman to ""grab her by the pussy,"" Trump said, ""No, I have not."" Clinton pounced, calling Trump's remarks in the video revealing. ""What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women -- what he thinks about women, what he does to women.""  Clinton used the moment to deliver a scathing attack on Trump's history of attacks on Muslims, Mexican immigrants, a disabled journalist and African-Americans. ""So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is,"" she said.Clinton escapesWhat stood out to many Republican political operatives about Clinton's performance is just how vulnerable the Democratic nominee is on many issues -- and how a GOP candidate other than Trump could have exploited those weaknesses. Trump never cited Clinton's call to eventually move to open borders throughout the hemisphere -- a remark  that came to light Friday in transcripts of private speeches obtained released by WikiLeaks.It was a moderator -- not Trump -- who raised Bill Clinton's comment that Obamacare is the ""craziest thing in the world."" Who won the town hall debate?Trump landed one clean blow when Clinton leaned awkwardly on Abraham Lincoln as she answered a question about whether it's OK to be ""two-faced"" and have a ""public"" and ""private"" position on issues, saying Lincoln himself used different arguments with different lawmakers to end slavery.""She lied, and now she's blaming the lie on the late great Abraham Lincoln,"" Trump shot back. ""Honest Abe never lied. That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.""However, Clinton was able to go mostly unscathed over controversies that should have badly damaged her. She managed to land the punches she wanted to land, while letting Trump's performance be the story of the night. And she stood firm and showed little emotion as Trump early on delivered scathing attacks against her and her former husband's infidelities and actions. ""I pretty much saw what I expected to see,"" Clinton told reporters aboard her campaign plane afterward. ""That's why the first thing I said, something I've been saying since June -- that he's not fit to be president and commander in chief, and there are a lot of people who said it before and increasingly more adding it to the chorus.""Trump appeals to the base, but didn't reach beyond itThe biggest problem for Trump is that even if Capitol Hill Republicans rally back to his side, he did nothing to expand his appeal to voters who don't already support him. There was plenty of red meat -- from his lock-her-up promises to the stagecraft of his attack on Bill Clinton.But many of his comments appeal only to a narrow subset of right-wing activists. Among them: Attacking Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal and former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and repeatedly revisiting Clinton's private email server. CNN's Reality Check team vets the claims at second debateThose topics are gangbusters with listeners of conservative talk radio and pro-Trump loyalists who read Breitbart News and similar websites, but they do little to sway women in the Philadelphia suburbs and other voters Trump needs if he's going to win.He also risked offending African-Americans by referring -- in response to a black man's question -- to helping the ""inner city,"" implying it's the only place African-Americans live.   And he responded to a Muslim woman's question about Islamophobia by saying that ""we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.""  That -- and Trump's unusual posture, standing closely behind Clinton as she responded to some questions -- led to this tweet from New York-area college professor Moustafa Bayoumi going viral: ""I'm a Muslim, and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri.""Lock her up?!?Trump arrived Sunday with two tricks up his sleeve: The pre-game Bill Clinton attack and a heightened attack on Clinton over her private email server.""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,"" Trump said, ""because there has never been so many lies, so much deception."" Even by 2016 standards, it was a remarkable moment -- one more befitting of an autocracy than American democracy.   Clinton attempted to turn the moment into an attack on Trump's biggest weakness -- his temperament.""Good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" she said. To that, Trump shot back: ""You'd be in jail.""Gone is the Donald Trump who responds to adoring crowds' chants of ""Lock her up!"" by saying: ""Let's defeat her in November."" Instead, Trump has fully embraced a much more aggressive posture that's likely to extend through the campaign's final four weeks.Trump's falsehoodsIn a repeat of the first debate, Trump repeatedly made inaccurate claims, and Clinton directed viewers to her website for a real-time fact check. In Sunday night's debate, Trump blasted Clinton over taxes, accusing her of proposing to ""raise taxes on everyone"" when she has focused her proposed tax hikes only on the wealthy. He claimed he'd never directed people to search for former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's (non-existent) sex tape, when on September 30 he'd denounced ""disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M"" on Twitter.He said he opposed the war in Iraq, when in fact he supported the war in Iraq. He claimed that ""many people saw bombs all over the apartment"" of the San Bernardino shooters, which is not true. He falsely blamed Clinton for starting the ""birtherism"" controversy, when it was Trump who led the racially motivated attack on President Barack Obama for five years.It's a reality that's baked into the cake with Trump at this point: His supporters don't take his claims literally, and Trump claims that refusing to reveal his true hand is part of what makes him a brilliant negotiator. Fact-checks mean nothing to him.Did Trump stop the bleeding? Forget the bigger, tougher task of convincing voters he has the character and temperament to be president for now. Trump's chief assignment Sunday night was to stop a crisis.Ahead of the debate, running mate Mike Pence was bailing, members of Congress were denouncing him en masse and the Republican National Committee was considering cutting him off. That would have left Trump a dead nominee walking, with no get-out-the-vote operation anywhere four weeks from Election Day as others in the GOP try to save their skin.Afterward, a CNN/ORC instant poll of debate watchers found that Clinton had won, 57% to 34%. But 63% of debate watchers said Trump had done better than they'd expected, to 21% who said he'd done worse. It wasn't a victory for Trump -- but he'd averted a total meltdown. Trump needed to make it to the third and final debate next week in Las Vegas still a viable candidate with a shot at defeating Clinton next month. His performance will buoy his supporters -- which will make it harder for Republicans to defect and may guarantee Trump still has the infrastructure and organizational support to continue his campaign. Still, there are signs of splits. One of the many odd moments -- and a divide to watch within the GOP moving forward -- came when Trump threw Pence under the bus. Pence had said the United States should be ready to use military force in Syria -- but Trump defended Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad (who is backed by Russia) and called the crumbling city of Aleppo lost. ""He and I haven't spoken and I disagree,"" Trump said of Pence.But Pence, at least, didn't appear ready to jump ship.""Congrats to my running mate @realDonaldTrump on a big debate win! Proud to stand with you as we #MAGA,"" he tweeted. "	7 takeaways from the second presidential debate

""The red sweater is plan B. I'm glad it worked out.""""I don't see how I could not have worn the red sweater this morning,"" he added. ""It's more famous than me.""Bone's adorable celebrity was sealed after the debate, when he was seen snapping a picture of the debate set... with a disposable camera.Acknowledging the spoils of viral famem Bone said his Internet following exploded in the hours following the debate. ""I went from last night having seven Twitter followers, two of which were my grandmother... now I have several hundred,"" he said. ""I am not sure why they care about what I have to say but I'm glad they're engaged in the political process."" On more serious issues, Bone said he had entered the debate favoring Donald Trump, but Hillary Clinton's poise on stage  caused him to reconsider. ""I think I might be more undecided than ever,"" Bone told Costello. ""I was leaning very heavily towards Donald Trump but Secretary Clinton impressed me with her composure and with a lot of her answers.""Bone added that he was not impressed by the Trump campaign's last-minute maneuver to bring women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault to the debate, saying the stunt was ""uncalled for."""

And Driver noted that it was Clinton's own ""strategic"" decision to range freely around the stage and position herself in front of Trump when she was answering questions that contributed to him appearing to lurk behind her because, Driver noted, he had nowhere to go.""Hillary is going to his side of the stage and standing in front of him,"" Driver said. ""What's he going to do? Sit down? Go to her seat? So he begins to hover ... She's on his side of the stage. I think this is strategic.""""Did Trump interrupt at all when she was standing in front of him?"" Driver added. ""Not once.""But Driver also called Trump's movements a ""pre-assault indicator.""""At some parts of watching last night, I was really getting nervous because she was in his space,"" she told CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""He's like a dog who's starting to get anxious and being backed into a corner.""A scorched earth debate, on The Daily David ChalianKellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, called the focus on her boss' body language and movements around the stage a non-story and a ""yawn.""But Trump's standing behind Clinton at times Sunday night drew derision from some viewers on social media. ""This looks like a poster for a 1970s horror movie,"" tweeted New York Times culture writer Dave Itzkoff in response to a photo of Trump standing behind Clinton and frowning. Senator John McCain was criticized for similar ""lurking"" in the background on stage during a 2008 presidential debate against Barack Obama when McCain was the GOP nominee.While the candidates stood at podiums for last month's first debate, the town hall-style debate on Sunday night allowed Trump and Clinton more freedom of movement because the stage was largely empty besides two chairs and two side tables. Driver also said Clinton ""snubbed"" Trump at the beginning of the debate by not shaking his hand. ""He looks at her a little longer, about three seconds longer,"" Driver said. ""She turns away first. He was going to shake her hand if she offered first."" But when the candidates did shake hands at the end of the event, Driver said Trump moved to take control.""When he shook it, he then did that elbow grab,"" Driver said, ""Like, 'I might be cowering down and shaking your hand and giving you power, but I'll talk a little power back with that elbow grab.''""More mysterious was Trump's sniffing, a behavior the candidate can't seem to get rid of -- it captured the attention of viewers at the first debate, too.""Last time, he said he didn't have a cold,"" Driver said. ""I said, he probably should say he has a cold, because maybe he's just stressed throughout the whole entire debate, although he was way more prepared this time."""

CNN's KFile has obtained partial audio of the radio ad.The ad, which aired on Christian radio stations in several states, was a response to then-Republican nominee Bob Dole pointing the finger at Clinton for creating a ""moral crisis"" in the country. In the audio provided by the Republican National Committee upon request from CNN's KFile,  a narrator says, ""Don't be misled by Bob Dole's attack ads. President Clinton wants a complete ban on late term abortions except when the mother's life is in danger or faces severe health risks, such as the inability to have another child. The president signed the Defense of Marriage Act, supports curfews and school uniforms to teach our children discipline.""Donald Trump's mission: Make Clinton's life hell for the next month""The president enacted the V-chip to block out violent TV programs. His crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins. Bob Dole opposed him and is resorting to untrue negative attacks. President Clinton has fought for our values and America is better for it.""While the ad shows just how far the Democratic Party as a whole has moved to the left on issues like same-sex marriage and criminal justice, Bill and Hillary Clinton's past positions on these issues have proven to be a hurdle for Hillary Clinton as she makes her case to younger, more liberal voters — particularly among supporters of Bernie Sanders, many of whom view the Clintons as centrists who are willing to compromise progressive values to cut deals in Washington.The ad, which was aimed at appealing to religious conservatives, was eventually pulled after blowback from LGBT groups. An official from the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force at the time called it ""unsettling and offensive.""""We've had a number of people expressing concerns about the ad, and we listened to those concerns,"" Clinton's campaign spokesman at the time, Don Foley, told the Washington Post. Bill Clinton wrote an op-ed in 2013 for the Washington Post advocating for the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA.Hillary Clinton actively campaigned in support of the 1994 crime bill referenced in the ad, and she did not come out in support of same-sex marriage until 2013 (she said she would have voted for DOMA when she ran for Senate in 2000). When reached for comment, Clinton's campaign pointed CNN's KFile to her recent statements against LGBT discrimination and some of the tough on crime policies of the 1990s. In Hillary Clinton's first major policy speech as a presidential candidate in 2015, she called for an end to the ""era of mass incarceration,"" an era many trace back to the 1994 crime bill passed under Bill Clinton's administration. Clinton told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow last year that her husband signed DOMA to prevent the passage of a constitutional amendment —  a claim LGBT activists and those with knowledge of the bill's passage have said is revisionist history. In a tense interview with NPR's Terry Gross in 2014, Clinton said of her changing position on same-sex marriage, ""I think I'm an American. I think that we have all evolved."" In an interview this July, Clinton said there was ""no justifying"" DOMA.  "	Listen to Bill Clinton's 1996 radio ad touting his passage of DOMA

The move -- highly unusual in US political history -- laid bare the seemingly intractable divisions now seizing the Republican Party with a month left before the presidential vote. Support for Trump among the GOP establishment, already weak amid disagreements over policy and tone, has now eroded to new lows. In a conference call with members Monday morning, Ryan told lawmakers, ""you all need to do what's best for you and your district,"" according to someone who listened to the meeting.Clinton's lead over Trump widens in poll taken after lewd tape""He will spend his entire energy making sure that Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with a Democrat-controlled Congress,"" said the person on the call -- an implied acknowledgment that Trump no longer appears able to capture the White House.Reaction to Ryan's decision illustrates the schism currently splitting the Republican Party. A person who listened to the call said the reaction wasn't entirely positive -- and that Ryan's comments angered more conservative GOP members who believed the speaker was essentially conceding the presidential contest to Clinton.And later on Monday Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus reiterated his support for embattled GOP nominee Trump.""Nothing has changed in regard with our relationship,"" Priebus said in a call with RNC committeemen. He said the Trump campaign and RNC are in full coordination.Trump hits backTrump responded to the House speaker on Twitter Monday, saying Ryan should focus on other policy areas instead of fighting with the Republican nominee. ""Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,"" Trump said. At least eight members angrily pushed back at Ryan, saying the party needs to be united headed into November to keep the majority. One member, two sources on call said, pointedly told Ryan that the better Trump does in November, the better the House GOP will do.""It's not rocket science,"" the member said.Among the people who objected to Ryan: Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, a Trump supporter, Rep. Louis Gohmert of Texas, and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California. Ryan's comments follow a Washington Post story out Friday which revealed Trump made lewd and sexually aggressive comments in 2005 that were caught on a hot microphone. Trump apologized for those remarks at Sunday's debate, but dismissed them as ""locker room talk"" and pivoted to attacks on former President Bill Clinton. But Ryan did make clear that he would no longer provide proactive support for his party's presidential candidate. A source said the speaker would campaign in 17 states and 42 cities this month.A spokesman for Trump's campaign, Jason Miller, tweeted after the news broke, ""Nothing's changed. Mr. Trump's campaign has always been powered by a grassroots movement, not Washington.""A Trump campaign source told CNN the campaign has told members of Congress from the beginning to focus on winning their seats, even if that means abandoning Trump because the campaign wants as big a Republican majority as possible come January.Ryan spokesman Zack Roday said the speaker ""made it clear on the call he's not conceding the presidential race.""Ryan under scrutinyThe speaker's actions in the aftermath of the lewd tape's release have been closely monitored given Ryan's initial reluctance to get behind Trump when he clinched the GOP nomination. Dozens of fellow Republican lawmakers withdrew their support for Trump, many insisting he should withdraw from the race entirely. The defections came largely from Republican lawmakers facing tough re-election battles, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In the House, Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Trump should step aside.RELATED: List: Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking by him?Trump and Ryan were originally set to appear together in Wisconsin on Saturday. But Ryan rescinded his invitation after the new comments came to light. Over the weekend, his office remained largely quiet about how he would respond to the explosive reports about Trump's past behavior.But on the call Monday, the message was unequivocal: Trump will no longer enjoy whatever political firepower Ryan could bring to the presidential race in its final stretch."

Stewart had been threatened by multiple campaign aides earlier on Monday when he staged his small demonstration against the RNC for supposedly abandoning his candidate.Stewart shared multiple text messages with CNN from people who claimed to be Trump campaign aides, warning of ""major consequences."" ""Do not protest the RNC,"" one text message said, referencing Trump's deputy campaign manager. ""Call Dave Bossie immediately.""Stewart and a group of about 30 Trump supporters in Virginia were trying to convince the RNC not to abandon Trump in the wake of falling poll numbers and lewd videos that has dismayed many in party leadership.Reached immediately after news emerged on Monday, Stewart, who expected to be fired for demonstrating, said he had not heard of his ouster. But he immediately took shots at people like Bossie.""I'm loyal to him,"" Stewart said, ""not loyal to political operatives.""Stewart told CNN the following day he had no regrets over protesting and does not feel betrayed by the Trump campaign.But he did condemn the Republican establishment, promising to ""absolutely"" hold them to account if the GOP is decimated this election cycle.""Establishment Republicans are undermining the Trump campaign,"" Stewart told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan on ""At This Hour."" ""There are elements within the campaign who came on board in September and some a little bit earlier than that, that are really part of the Republican establishment and I don't necessarily think they have Mr. Trump's best interests in mind.""He conceded it would be ""very difficult"" for Trump to win on November 8 without an injection of RNC resources in states like Virginia, adding: ""As a party, you've got to come around the candidate.""John Whitbeck, the Republican Party's Virginia chairman, called Stewart's firing ""disappointing"" but said he supports the campaign's ""decision to remove their Virginia chairman. With less than a month until Election Day, we can't afford any distractions.""Trump's support in the GOP has faded in the wake of a 2005 tape that reveals him making lewd and sexually aggressive remarks about women. On Monday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he will no longer defend Trump and instead will focus on preserving his party's hold on Congress, though he did not formally rescind his endorsement.Over the weekend, dozens of fellow Republican lawmakers withdrew their support for Trump, many insisting he should withdraw from the race entirely. The defections came largely from Republican lawmakers facing tough re-election battles, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In the House, Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Trump should step aside.But RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, in a conference call with committeemembers early Monday evening, said  nothing will change regarding its relationship to the Trump campaign.

Roethlisberger did not face criminal charges in either case and denied any wrongdoing.He settled a lawsuit involving one of the cases and was suspended for four games from the NFL at the beginning of the 2010 season. ""We love Big Ben. Big Ben is a friend of mine. Big Ben is great. We play golf together,"" Trump said Monday after taking the stage swinging what appeared to be a ""Terrible Towel,"" the Steelers' signature rally towel. ""He is a strong guy, and he is a good guy, too, Big Ben.""Trump's praise for the football player came as the GOP nominee continued to defend comments he made during a lewd conversation that was recorded by a hot mic in 2005 as ""locker room talk.""Trump in that conversation bragged about being able kiss women and ""grab them by the pussy"" because of his ""star"" status, actions that would amount to sexual assault.Trump frequently praises local sports figures during his political rallies and has previously touted Roethlisberger in Pennsylvania, including when he said in April: ""How good is Ben, Big Ben? Do we love Big Ben?""Roethlisberger has said that he and Trump have played golf together, but has declined to dive into politics and endorse the Republican nominee.Roethlisberger is not the only controversial sports figure Trump has praised.Also speaking in Pennsylvania, Trump has also previously lauded the late Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, who allegedly knew of assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse toward children and did not notify authorities."

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/10/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate/index.html	"Capping the most devastating 48 hours of his presidential campaign, Trump stunned the country on Sunday by convening a press conference with women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and calling the former president an abuser of women in a nationally televised debate.The Republican presidential nominee's decision to bring women from Bill Clinton's past into the debate -- both physically into the debate hall and into his verbal attacks against Hillary Clinton -- signaled a remarkably defiant strategy anchored in some of the most electric allegations that have been leveled against the Clintons in their decades in public life. It also guarantees that in the final, ugly month of the 2016 election, the country's first female presidential nominee will be repeatedly subjected to the indignity of confronting the most painful moments of her marriage in public.A scorched earth debate, on The Daily David ChalianAs Bill Clinton looked on from the front row with his daughter Chelsea -- and with Juanita Broaddrick, who has accused Clinton of rape, also sitting in the audience -- Trump charged that the former president was ""abusive to women.""""There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women,"" Trump said. ""Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.""Trump, Clinton wage scorched-earth debateAppearing irritated, and at times even furious, Trump even claimed that Clinton would be ""in jail"" if he were president.Throughout it all, Clinton showed a remarkable level of composure throughout the night. And the lines of attack may not have the impact Trump intended. A CNN/ORC poll found 57% of debate watchers thought Clinton won compared to 34% who thought Trump came out on top. The poll only represents the views of people who watched the debate and has a slight advantage than average CNN polls of all Americans.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told NBC's ""Today"" on Monday that Trump's actions and language are the sign of a ""spiraling campaign.""""Hillary's steady, she's strong, she's not going to get thrown off her game,"" Mook said. ""That's what Donald Trump tried to do.""Just hours before the debate began, Trump held a last-minute press conference featuring women who have accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior.Broaddrick looked directly at a small group of reporters in the room and said: ""Actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump may have said some bad words but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don't think there's any comparison.""The spectacle continued even after the debate, with Bill Clinton's accusers appearing in the spin room to speak with reporters. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, meanwhile, told CNN's Dana Bash she's been alone with  Trump and he's been ""gracious and a gentleman.""At a Pennsylvania rally on Monday Trump kept up the heat on Clinton over the issue. Trump also said he'll continue to discuss the matter if more candid tapes of him are released.""Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously, one woman said more viciously than he attacked,"" Trump said. Trump looms behind Clinton at the debateSunday night marked a dramatic escalation in what had already been an extraordinary weekend in the 2016 presidential election.A tape released on Friday from more than 10 years ago showed Trump describing in reprehensible terms the aggressive advances he made on women. (""Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,"" Trump says in the tape.) The revelation threw the Trump campaign into chaos and a flood of Republicans quickly turned their backs on their own party's presidential nominee.But rather than attempt to contain the fallout with sincere contrition, Trump signaled Sunday in the most sensational way imaginable that he will subject Clinton to the most agonizing personal indignities.That strategy will do little to slow Trump's crumbling support within his own party, and could even spur more defections. Veteran Republicans have long recoiled from dredging up accusations that have been leveled against Bill Clinton, considering it as a losing strategy that turns off voters.Stephanie Schriock, the head of EMILY's List, told CNN on Sunday that Trump's decision to visit Bill Clinton's past could ""really backfire.""Donald Trump to Howard Stern: It's OK to call my daughter a 'piece of ass'""Even Republicans around this country making it clear that this is a bad strategy. He's alienated the vast majority of women voters already and this will just seal the deal,"" Schriock said.  ""That we could get dragged down to this level on the night of a presidential debate in a very consequential election — to have it turned into a sideshow and a reality show is profoundly sad,"" David Axelrod said on CNN.Hillary Clinton and her top aides sought to engage as little as possible with Trump's attacks on the former president.After Trump's press conference, spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said the Democratic nominee would be ""prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.""""We're not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom,"" Palmieri said. ""Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn't change that. If Donald Trump doesn't see that, that's his loss."" Clinton, meanwhile, simply declined to address Trump's allegation that her husband has abused women.Instead, she trained her fire on Trump's vulgar comments caught on tape.""What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women, and he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is,"" she said. ""But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.""On the campaign plane late Sunday, asked whether she was surprised by the tone of the debate and the women Trump invited, Clinton responded: ""Nothing surprises me about him.""

Rick Scott had opposed the extension, saying last week that ""people have had time to register.""In court papers, Marc Elias, who serves at the general counsel for Hillary Clinton's campaign, argued that Scott ""unambiguously ordered"" Florida citizens to evacuate, and now some voters have been prevented from being able to register which might decrease ""the overall likelihood"" that the party will be successful in helping to elect Democrats.Judge Mark E. Walker set a Wednesday hearing on whether to further extend the deadline beyond Wednesday.""It has been suggested that the issue of extending the voter registration deadline is about politics. Poppycock,"" Walker wrote. ""This case is about the right of aspiring eligible voters to register and to have their votes counted. Nothing could be more fundamental to our democracy.""Hurricane Matthew struck the southeastern United States, hitting two states, Florida and North Carolina, that are crucial to determining the outcome of this year's presidential race.""Hurricane Matthew not only forced many of those voters to evacuate the state, but also foreclosed the only methods of registering to vote: in person or by mail,"" Walker wrote. ""Because those aspiring eligible voters could not register, they could not vote in the upcoming election. As a result, Florida's statutory framework completely disenfranchises thousands of voters, and amounts to a severe burden on the right to vote."""
