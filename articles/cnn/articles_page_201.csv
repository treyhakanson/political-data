Hillary Clinton has always been someone with her hand out as she puts the Clinton family first and continues to do so,"" Collins, a Trump supporter, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""She has been on the receiving end of donations."" The Trump Foundation agreed last Thursday to pay a $2,500 fine to the IRS for a $25,000 donation the nonprofit previously made to Pam Bondi's campaign for attorney general in Florida. The donation came just days after Bondi's office announced that it would look into allegations against Trump University. Following the donation, the office did not open an investigation. But Collins said he doesn't think voters are concerned about Trump's history of political giving.""I frankly don't think America cares too much on an individual giving his money as much as they do about somebody who has got their hands out shaking down donors and then being subject to the, you know, demands of those same donors. I think it is very different,"" the New York lawmaker said.Trump has simply participated in the political game the way it is set up, Collins said. ""Donald Trump has been on the donating side. You make donations to get the ear of somebody that you would like to speak with. That's part of what goes on in politics. It is the dirty side of politics. Clinton has been on the receiving end,"" he said. "	Collins: Clinton has always been someone with her hand out

But the department told a federal court Wednesday that all but one had been previously released.The newly published exchange is an innocuous note from former U.S. ambassador to Brazil Tom Shannon, praising then-Secretary of State Clinton on her performance at a 2013 Senate hearing on the Benghazi attacks.""Please extend to the Secretary my congratulations for her testimony today before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I watched with great admiration as she dealt with a tough and personally painful issue in a fair, candid, and determined manner,"" Shannon wrote in the email sent January 23, 2013, to Cheryl Mills, a top Clinton aide.State also issued parts of two other conversations that were previously released with the exception of ""Pls print"" instructions from Clinton. One is from Clinton thanking State workers for their work on Benghazi and another from a former advance man in the Clinton White House, Rick Jasculca, praising Clinton's performance. Wednesday's release by the State Department is a response to a lawsuit brought by the conservative group Judicial Watch, and is limited to emails determined to be related to the 2012 Benghazi attacks in which four Americans were killed. Judicial Watch and State lawyers are scheduled to meet later this month regarding other emails the FBI has turned over.The State Department said the ""email does not change the facts that have previously been made clear about the Benghazi attacks.""""In response to a Benghazi-related FOIA request, after completing its review of the set of documents previously identified as potentially responsive, State has determined that there is one responsive document that is not a duplicate of the documents provided by former Secretary Clinton in December 2014 and that had not been previously provided to Judicial Watch in this case,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. The Clinton campaign and Judicial Watch both claimed victory Wednesday in competing assessments of the email release. ""As we suspected, it appears these emails were almost entirely redundant with ones she had produced previously,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said.Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said it was further proof that Clinton emails were wrongfully scrubbed from her private server. The group said it will continue fighting in court for the release of all 30 emails, saying they include new metadata not in previous releases.""These new Benghazi-Clinton emails prove that Hillary or her lawyers deleted material which proved to be responsive to federal court orders and congressional subpoenas,"" Fitton said in a statement.

Some aren't sure that Koskinen's tenure at the agency reaches the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" threshold in the Constitution for impeaching a public official, since he took over after employees were found to target some conservative groups. Others believe the House Judiciary Committee's role is to examine questions about impeachment before anyone casts a vote on the House floor. Ryan acknowledged his caucus is deeply split on the issue and the outcome is uncertain. ""You have members on both sides of this -- members on the Judiciary Committee on both sides of this issue and this is something where the conference is going to work its will,"" he told reporters after meeting with House GOP members on Wednesday morning.Ryan worked out a deal with House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan, who has been the point person lobbying for a House vote, to hold a special meeting next Thursday with all House Republicans to discuss the issue. But some Freedom Caucus members vow that regardless of that discussion, they will force a vote on the matter this month before Congress wraps up business before the November election.""I fully expect a vote to happen in September,"" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, said Wednesday.Koskinen went to Capitol Hill Wednesday to plead his case with House Republicans, meeting with a small group of moderate House GOP members.During the meeting, Koskinen noted that he wasn't at the IRS when the targeting took place and many of those involved in the activities are no longer there. He also asserted that punishing the head of an agency would have chilling effect on people like himself who leave the private sector to serve in top government positions.One of the moderate Republicans warned fast action on the floor could backfire.""There has to be some level of due process in a matter like this. I would be very concerned about taking an extremely serious matter like this and just throwing it on the floor for a vote,"" Rep Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, told reporters after the session with Koskinen.Koskinen also met with some members of the Republican Study Committee, a large group of fiscal conservatives.Texas Rep. Bill Flores, who chairs the RSC, said Koskinen pushed for the normal process on impeachment -- going through the Judiciary Committee -- to play out, and there was a Q & A with some tough questions that ""got a little contentious.""""The challenge that he faces is that there was a massive destruction of data at a point in time when Congress had a subpoena and an evidence order over at the IRS and that data disappeared during the time that it should have been protected,"" Flores said. ""That happened under his watch.""          Leaving the Capitol, Koskinen sounded positive, even after emerging from a session where members openly pressed why they shouldn't remove him from his post. ""I was delighted to be invited to both groups and I was delighted that we had a good exchange of views,"" he told reporters.Louisiana GOP Rep. John Fleming told reporters that conservatives want a vote and ""it will be very soon"" because their constituents are demanding some response. He listed several incidents during the Obama administration such as the ""Fast and Furious"" probe under former Attorney General Eric Holder and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of personal email.""They are mad about all the corruption up here -- that we are doing nothing about it, so they just say -- won't you do something about at least one of them? That's why I think this one is the lowest hanging fruit,"" Fleming said about singling out Koskinen.But Flores, who before Koskinen addressed his group said he supported moving ahead with a vote, said the commissioner did lay out his belief that there is a process in place for Congress to go through before rushing for a floor vote. ""He makes some valid points on that and I need to think about that,"" Flores said.If conservatives do go to the floor and bring up a so-called ""privileged resolution"" to force the vote, leaders can move to table it altogether or refer it to the House Judiciary Committee, which effectively punts the issue until after the election.But if the GOP-led House passed some impeachment measure it would move to the Senate and force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take up the controversial issue.  McConnell's main focus for the next nine weeks is holding onto his majority in the Senate and protecting those GOP senators in tough re-election contests from taking any votes that could damage their campaigns."

The bill passed the Senate in May on a rare voice vote, but the White House has repeatedly threatened to veto it. A representative for the victims' families said they've been told by House GOP leadership not only that the House will vote but that the leadership will support the bill's passage.It's unclear what prompted House GOP leaders to schedule a vote on the bill. The move to vote in the House was first reported by Politico.Though Saudi Arabia has denied any role in the attacks, US families tried to pursue the matter in court, where the nation has invoked its immunity. Critics of the bill, including the White House and State Department, have said the legislation would have dangerous consequences abroad and for US citizens, including the potential for retaliatory lawsuits.  The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, warned lawmakers in March that if the bill became law, the country would sell $750 billion in US assets, including treasury securities. The bill's authors have said the threat is a bluff. Earlier this year, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who visited several Mideast countries in April, raised concerns about the impact the bill could have on US relations with its allies.""I think we need to review it to make sure that we're not making mistakes with our allies and that we're not catching people up in this that shouldn't be caught up in this,"" Ryan said at a news conference.But the legislation's supporters, including Senate authors Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, say it's an issue of justice and sending a message to foreign governments that they can't support terrorism without consequences. The companion bill in the House was introduced by New York Republican Rep. Peter King. Saudi Arabia has never been formally implicated in the attacks, but 15 of the 19 hijackers that carried them out were of Saudi descent. Recently unclassified documents detail contact and support between some of the hijackers and individuals who may have been connected to the Saudi government. The ""28 pages"" that were long secret also note suspicions about ties between the Saudi royal family and al Qaeda, though the documents also say the speculations have not been verified.

""But Hillary can lose it.""In order to succeed where 17 Republican candidates failed to beat Trump, Clinton must maintain an incessant focus on her unpredictable rival and persuade voters that he lacks the temperament, character and knowledge required of a potential commander-in-chief.Clinton, press do awkward dance at 30,000 feetClinton has already adopted an aggressive approach this week. She's held briefings for reporters on her new campaign jet two days in a row. She slammed Trump's character and failure to release his tax returns. And she blasted his business career, which is at the center of his campaign as full of ""scams"" and ""frauds.""That is one way of trying to keep the conversation away from the private email server and accusations about the Clinton Foundation that appear to have hurt her standing in recent weeks.Despite signs the race is narrowing -- the CNN/ORC national poll showed her two points behind Trump among likely voters -- Clinton's insists she's not rattled.       ""I don't really pay attention to polls,"" she told reporters on her plane Tuesday. ""When they are good for me, and there have been a lot of them that have been good for me recently, I don't pay attention. When they are not so good, I don't pay attention. We are on a course that we are sticking with.""A senior Clinton campaign official predicted single-digit battles across the swing states that will decide the election. But ultimately her campaign stresses it expected a close race and single digit battles in swing states, but believes it has multiple routes to 270 electoral votes and that Trump has a much narrower path Some Clinton critics have, however, warned that her approach in August -- spending much of the month fundraising away from TV cameras after the Democrats' successful convention in Philadelphia -- lacked the go-for-broke energy of her rival.""Trump is running a high-risk campaign right now. They have to, because they are behind and have eight weeks to go,"" Newhouse, who was a pollster for 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said before Clinton upped the pace after Labor Day.""I don't think her campaign has shown any real guts or faith in their candidate. They're not bold. They are setting themselves up for a potential loss by a thousand cuts.""Seizing on demographic and geographical advantagesIt is without dispute that the hurdles for Trump are enormous. With assistance from teleprompters, he has becomed more disciplined as a candidate, but he has yet to convince voters in swing states, where Clinton leads most polls, that he is fit to be president.For Clinton, the demographics of the electorate work in her favor, and she appears to be reassembling the Obama coalition that was decisive in the 2008 and 2012 elections. She leads Trump among voters under the age of 45 by 54% to 29% and among non-whites 71% to 18%, according to the CNN/ORC poll.Democratic strategist and pollster Celinda Lake noted that Trump has consistently trailed by about 12 points where Romney was among married women in 2012. Romney also ran strong among white women -- and led President Barack Obama in exit polls among white women 56% to 42%. Trump's campaign has yet to show any real effort to improve his image among women, beyond his attempt to appear more moderate with his minority outreach to African-Americans. Trump is also some 20 points behind his Democratic opponent among college-educated women, Lake said, compared to Romney and 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain, who were about 5 and 8 points behind, respectively.Beyond that, the demographic where Trump runs strongest -- non college-educated white men -- is dropping as a share of the electorate each year.""So he is relying on an ever-diminishing pool of votes, where she is relying on an ever-expanding portion of votes,"" Lake said. To win, she said, ""He would need to win the first debate; he would need to have a collapse of Democratic turnout; and he would really need to close the race with independents and women."" The likelihood of those factors falling into place is slim. But the one way to put the race in reach for Trump, she said, ""is to assume that it's out of reach.""So the key for Clinton will be getting those vital constituencies out to vote. That's where her high-powered roster of surrogates comes in.Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and her primary foe Bernie Sanders remain highly popular among key sectors of the Democratic coalition.They will be vital to driving up swing-state turnout in Democratic strongholds like Cleveland, Philadelphia, Northern Virginia, Richmond, Virginia, and parts of Florida that could decide the election.Addressing the trust deficitClinton is certain to seize on any foreign policy or temperamental missteps by Trump to bolster her argument that her foe is a ""loose cannon"" who can't be trusted with America's nuclear arsenal. His efforts to reach out to minorities in recent weeks have managed, in some cases, to further alienate them. His campaign has yet to demonstrate it can string together, not just a couple of good days, but a good two months, given his disadvantages on the electoral map.And beyond just having a good first debate later this month, Trump must force Clinton into making some mistakes to have a chance of winning, strategists said.The two candidates face similar hurdles in the sense that both may find it almost impossible to change voters' opinions about them at this point. After all, Clinton and Trump are the most unpopular nominees of any major party in memory.Both Clinton and Trump are widely distrusted. In the CNN/ORC survey, only 42% had a favorable impression of the former secretary of state while the real estate mogul was barely better with 45%.Clinton clearly has work to do on the trust issue, though. Fifty percent of voters said Trump was more honest and trustworthy. Only 35% chose Clinton.""People just don't trust Hillary Clinton, and they don't trust her -- not on the basis of one single thing -- but on the basis of whole collections of things going back over 20 to 30 years,"" said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, noting that voters cite an array of her controversies from Whitewater to her email server.The trust factor -- as well as the sense among many voters that they can't relate to Clinton or understand her as person -- loom as challenges for the former secretary of state, because there is no one thing she can do in the next two months to fix those issues.Because of the depth of distrust, voters are unlikely to give her the benefit of the doubt if something goes wrong, or she faces a new set of revelations, Hart said.""They're locked in terms of who she is on the issue of integrity,"" Hart said. ""There is not an individual issue that she can address and that has a tremendous negative effect. All of this is baked in.... It doesn't mean that she's going to lose the election. It's like driving your car on the shoulder: that's fine, unless a car nudges you over and then you've got nothing going for you.""The trust factor -- as well as the sense among many voters that they can't relate to Clinton or understand her as person -- loom as challenges for the former secretary of state, because she has been trying to do that throughout the campaign, but has only a short time before voters begin casting absentee ballots. Avoiding overconfidence -- and selling her messageA month ago, when she led Trump by double digits in the polls, Clinton's odds of victory looked good. Historically the candidate who led in the polls two weeks after the conventions went on to win the election.But this campaign has defied patterns of history before. Clinton's campaign warned against overconfidence, in part to keep Democratic voters engaged.Though Obama's numbers are above 50% -- no small achievement for a late-second-term president, Clinton always faced a historically difficult feat as a candidate seeking the third successive term for the Democratic Party. Moreover, her three decades in politics made her a particularly ill-suited choice for an electorate whose chief desire is change. She's effectively an incumbent with dynastic baggage facing an outsider candidate in Trump who built a campaign on voter mistrust of establishment politicians.But Clinton allies argue that her dual-pronged message has been more succinct this time than it was in 2008.While many swing-state voters say in interviews they have no idea what her message is, her strategists say it is piercing through in local markets where she is advertising: the idea that she will put families first while Trump would put himself first; and that Americans are ""stronger together"" while Trump would be a divisive force.Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic strategist who is now executive director of the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, pointed to one ad that Clinton ran just before the Nevada caucuses that he said was a perfect distillation of that message. It was one featuring a little girl who was afraid that her parents would get deported. Clinton told the girl to let her worry about it.""It's incredibly hard for any positive message to break through"" in this toxic political climate, Elleithee said. ""If she can make this: 'I've got your back' argument compelling enough, she can chip away"" at voter distrust. That work is important not only to help her win but also to help her govern, he said. ""She needs to address that issue now and continue until after the election.... She could win this race comfortably with no positive message, but they should not mistake a comfortable win for a mandate."""	How Hillary Clinton could win

Bossie left the group last week to formally join Trump's campaign.Mercer has long run in elite New York political finance circles and her family is known for their tight control over how their donations are spent. But she has never before worked on a political campaign, and she will now be the president of what is aspiring to be one of the leading anti-Clinton PACs during the general election homestretch.Mercer's elevation from the group's lead donor to lead operative is another sign of her family's power in Trump's orbit. The Republican nominee's senior staff is now stocked with Mercer loyalists, including Bossie, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and former Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon.""Rebekah Mercer has always been chair of the PAC and the driving force behind its activities,"" said Hogan Gidley, the group's communications director. ""Rebekah has taken a more active role in its day to day management.""Despite initial promise, the PAC -- which runs only anti-Clinton spots, not pro-Trump ones -- has struggled to collect major donors beyond the Mercer family. The group originally backed Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, before being repurposed in the general election as an anti-Clinton group.The Mercers gave the group $2 million more earlier this summer, and it is expected to focus its budget this fall on digital advertisements, not television.

Despite the tabloid drama involved with Trump's two divorces and bragging about his sex life in the past, Schlafly and the authors said the GOP candidate is ""an old-fashioned man"" who prioritizes family.""Critics can, and will, go on and on about Trump having been married three times, and about how, in the past, he boasted about his indiscretions. But anyone who meets him today will meet an old-fashioned man grounded in his two great priorities -- hard work and family -- and a man who in other respects has led a remarkably clean life,"" the authors wrote. ""This 'straight-edge' living is remarkable especially for a man of such wealth and success.""Trump, who is handily winning with evangelical voters according to the most recent Pew poll, will protect the Christian faith from Muslims abroad and the political left in the US, they wrote.""Christianity is under attack around the world -- most dramatically from Islamists, but also insidiously here at home with attacks on religious freedom,"" they wrote.

""Of his own religious background, he has volunteered that he grew up going to Sunday School Bible class every week at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, and as an adult, learned a lot about spirituality and the inner strength that comes from it by getting to know Norman Vincent Peale and attending his church,"" they wrote.""The importance Trump puts on personal faith inspires Trump to be vigilant against threats to the religious freedom of others. He has boldly asserted that when he is president, people will feel free to say 'Merry Christmas' again,"" they added. ""This is not merely an off-the-cuff applause line for religiously conservative campaign crowds but reflects his long-term thinking about the dangers of public pressure to suppress religious expression and sentiment.""Trump -- who called Schlafly a ""conservative icon"" Monday and said he was ""honored"" to have spent time with her -- has racked up several high profile endorsements from evangelical leaders, including Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins.

Gen. Frank Klotz told the House Subcommittee on Strategic Forces Wednesday, according to his prepared remarks.Committee members called Klotz and other officials to discuss the growing backlog of work needed at the country's nuclear facilities, which include iconic places such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory. At the end of fiscal year 2015, the total cost of deferred maintenance across all NNSA property stood at $3.7 billion, Klotz said.There is ""no obstacle that poses a bigger risk to the long-term success"" of the nuclear mission than this aging infrastructure, said Klotz, who stressed that nuclear deterrence is essential not only to US national security, but to the security of US allies as well.  The physical state of the US nuclear complex is in such bad shape because many key facilities were built during World War II and intended to operate for as little as one decade, according to Morgan Smith, president and CEO of Consolidated Nuclear Security. Today, more than half of NNSA's approximately 6,000 real property assets are over 40 years old, and nearly 30% date back to the Manhattan Project era, Klotz said.""Many facilities and their supporting infrastructure have exceeded or far exceeded their expected life,"" Smith told the committee, according to prepared remarks, ""and major systems within the facilities are beginning to fail."" Klotz outlined steps his administration has taken to control the maintenance backlog, including better documenting need maintenance, disposing of unneeded facilities and introducing a new budget structure. But he and others stressed that they need more resources. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz has pushed to stop the growth of deferred maintenance across the nuclear security enterprise, Smith told lawmakers, ""but significant investment is required to appreciably reduce that backlog and sustain safe operations for the extended life of these vital mission facilities.""In December, Moniz wrote to the Office of Management and Budget to say that their proposed nuclear budget for fiscal years 2018 to 2021 ""doesn't reflect the funding that we estimate is necessary."" He asked for an additional $5.2 billion for that time period, saying that the OMB proposal ""ignores or underfunds"" nuclear needs. ""Events elsewhere in the world reaffirm the seriousness of the threat environment in which we live,"" Moniz wrote, ""and underscore the need for a credible nuclear security program portfolio.""  Smith's Consolidated Nuclear Security manages and operates the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas. Y-12, originally established in the 1940s as part of three Manhattan Project sites where the nuclear bomb was first developed, is now the country's primary storehouse of highly enriched uranium and the place where highly enriched uranium components are manufactured, dismantled and tracked.    The Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas, the only plant in the nation where nuclear weapons are assembled and disassembled, was built in the1950s. Smith shared descriptions of some Y-12 buildings in his written testimony that mentioned leaking roofs, ""large patches of rust and corrosion on interior walls,"" and other examples of ""neglect and deterioration."" The aging systems can also affect production and safety, Smith said. He gave, as one example, a production shutdown at Y-12 because of unplanned outages to humidity control equipment.""The primary concern with knowingly deferring maintenance is that a major, unforeseen failure could occur,"" Smith said.  Gen. Robin Rand, commander of the Air Force Global Strike Command, said he was ""acutely aware"" of the risks posed by the crumbling infrastructure and thought about it when considering missions.""There will come a point when I can't do it with existing capabilities,"" Rand said.

Cecil Haney, the commander of United States Strategic Command, pointed out that Russia has been modernizing their nuclear capabilities and alluded to comments by Russian officials indicating they believe the use of some nuclear weapons is acceptable.The modernization, along with the ""provocative nature of statements that have been made by Russian leaders and the display of their capabilities such as long-range strategic air flights in other areas in the world ... when you add them all together, it is not in a good place,"" Haney said.
