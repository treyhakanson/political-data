""You know when a gross guy at the bar is checking you out? It's that feeling.""As a 20-year-old attending a private Southern Baptist college, she said she was not prepared for what she experienced before and during the pageant. She recalled private parties where the contestants mingled with ""old, rich drunk guys ogling all over us.""At the time, she said, she told her mother what was going on. The final straw, she said, was when Trump and his wife, Melania, showed up backstage.""He was literally walking around just looking at the girls and then he and Melania walked in,"" Holvey said.They both then proceeded to a doorway that led into the dressing room where other contestants were getting ready, she said.""I thought it was entirely inappropriate,"" Holvey said. ""I told my mom about it. I was disgusted by the entire thing. I had no desire to win when I understood what it was all about.""Messages left with a pageant spokesperson and Trump's campaign were not immediately returned.In later years, other contestants also said Trump behaved inappropriately.Prior to the preliminary competition in the 2012 pageant, contestants remembered them parading before Trump and then meeting him onstage.""A few nights before the preliminary show, they kicked everyone out and they wanted us to do just a runway show for Donald Trump,"" said a contestant, who asked not to be identified by name because she continues to volunteer at pageants. ""We had to literally parade in front of him.""A contestant in the 2013 Miss USA pageant was also critical of Trump's behavior. In a Facebook post earlier this year, Miss Washington Cassandra Searles wrote, ""Do y'all remember that one time we had to do our own stage introductions but this one guy treated us like cattle and made us do it again because we didn't look him in the eyes? Do you also remember when he then proceeded to have us lined up so he could get a closer look at his property?""Searles could not be reached for comment.CNN reported last week that Trump told radio host Howard Stern in 2005 that he would ""go backstage and everyone's getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it.""""You know, the dresses. 'Is everyone OK?' You know, they're standing there with no clothes. 'Is everybody OK?' And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I've been very good,"" Trump said."	Ex-contestant: Trump inspected each woman before pageant

Each of his stump speeches has sharpened his attack lines about the Republican Party's presidential nominee, from his avoidance of paying taxes to his treatment of women.Drawing Obama's scorn Friday, Trump's insistence a ""global elite"" is working to rig the election.""This is a guy who spent all his time hanging around trying to convince everybody he was a global elite,"" Obama said. ""Talking about how great his buildings are, how luxurious and how rich he is and flying around everywhere. All he had time for was celebrities and now suddenly he's acting like he's a populist out there. I'm going to fight for working people.""""Come on, man,"" Obama repeated.Obama was speaking in Ohio a day after Trump claimed during a rally in Florida the entire US political system was corrupt. ""The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you,"" Trump said. ""The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.""It was the latest in a pattern of remarks from Trump casting doubts about the validity of the upcoming vote, claims Obama said have no place in US Democracy.""This is somebody who threatens to jail his political opponents. Or silence the media, who welcomes Russian meddling in our electoral process, and is now suggesting that if the election doesn't go his way, it's not because all the stuff he's said, but it's because it's rigged and it's a fraud,"" Obama said.Trump: Clinton 'has to go to jail'And for the second day in a row, Obama hit back at Republicans who are now disavowing Trump, saying it's too little, too late. He spent Thursday night railing on lawmakers like Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman, who withdrew his support for Trump after his sexually aggressive remarks from 2005 were released on tape.List: Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking by him?""I know that some of them now are walking away but why did it take you this long? You said you're the party of family values. What, you weren't appalled earlier when he was saying degrading things about women?"" Obama said. ""I'm glad that some of them now said 'wow, this is really bad, I guess we need to walk away,' but if you're doing it just for political expedience just because you're looking at poll numbers and you say 'Oh, this might get me in trouble,' that's not enough."""

The women's charges were reported by the New York Times and People Magazine. CNN has not yet independently confirmed these accounts and Trump has denied the claims.The support is also on the heels of social conversations this week about instances of sexual assault and why women don't report.Despite many polls showing Trump significantly trailing with women voters nationally and in key swing states, women flooded Twitter with tweets using the hashtag #WomenWhoVoteTrump. The tweeters talked about everything from the reasons why they support Trump to descriptions of themselves, which aimed to undermine stereotypes about the kind of women who are Trump supporters. Some of the women tweeting made a point of saying they are smart, educated and rational thinkers -- who also happen to be Trump supporters.Others described which parts of Trump's platform they agree with, citing why they will be voting for the candidate.One woman explained she was tired of the establishment, saying Trump is the kind of change that America needs.Some of Trump's supporters have jokingly embraced the term ""deplorable,"" after Clinton described last month half of Trump's supporters as fitting into a ""basket of deplorables.""The hashtag had more than 43,000 mentions as of Friday morning."

She walks in front of me and when she walked in front of me. Believe me, I wasn't impressed, but she walks in front of me,"" he said at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina.It was not clear what he meant when he said he ""wasn't impressed"" and a message left with the Trump campaign was not immediately returned. But Trump has commented on women's appearances in recent days, particularly those who have made sexual assault allegations against him.He attacked one of his accusers' appearances -- though he didn't specify which one -- at his rally Friday.""When you looked at that horrible woman last night, you said, 'I don't think so.' The stories are total fiction, they're 100% made up. They never happened. They never would happen. I don't think they'd happen with many people, but they certainly wouldn't happen with me,"" he said about about one of the women.And at a rally in Florida on Thursday, Trump attacked Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter who has alleged that she had been physically attacked by Trump at Mar-a-Lago while she was on assignment in December 2005.""Take a look, you take a look, look at her, look at her words -- you tell me what you think. I don't think so,"" Trump said.Trump -- who raised eyebrows at Sunday's debate by standing close behind Clinton as she spoke -- has claimed in recent days that Clinton upstaged him at the event.Protester attacked at Trump rally""Did you see what she said, that I entered her space?

""They are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country."" Trump's comments came as he once again alleged it's ""all false stuff"" and there is a ""concerted effort"" to take down his campaign, ignoring calls from his campaign advisers to focus on economic issues rather than responding to the allegations.""My people always say, 'Don't talk about it, talk about jobs, talk about the economy,'"" Trump explained to his supporters in Greensboro earlier on Friday. ""But I feel I have to talk about it because you have to dispute when somebody says something.""And during his two rallies on Friday, Trump did just that, forcefully denying the allegations that he kissed and groped several women without their consent -- actions he had bragged about being able to do in a 2005 tape -- and arguing that if just a sliver of voters believe those allegations, he will lose the election. ""If 5% of the people think it's true -- and maybe 10% -- we don't win,"" Trump said.More allegations surfaceThat comment came in Greensboro, which took place less than two hours after two women came forward alleging Trump groped them without their consent. One of the women, former ""Apprentice"" contestant Summer Zervos, made her accusation during that rally.In Greensboro, Trump disputed the account of the other woman, Kristin Anderson, calling her story ""nonsense"" and ""false,"" arguing that he rarely sits alone, even though Anderson never claimed Trump was sitting alone at the time of the incident.""I was sitting alone by myself and then I went wah to somebody,"" Trump said at his Greensboro rally, motioning to his side as he attempted to re-enact Anderson's account of his behavior.He also proposed that his supporters boycott People magazine after a reporter wrote a story alleging Trump began kissing her without her consent in 2005 when the two were alone for an interview at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.""I think maybe what we should do, boycott that issue of People Magazine,"" he said in Charlotte.Trump also accused Clinton of ""character assassination,"" saying in Charlotte that it's Clinton's ""specialty.""""And her specialty, if you look over the years, has been character assassination and really personally just going after people, that's her specialty,"" he said. ""She's been doing it her whole career. The only force strong enough to smash Clinton's corrupt criminal syndicate is you, the American voter, November 8th.""Trump blames 'establishment'As he did a day earlier, Trump again argued on Friday that the allegations are part of a global conspiracy by the ""establishment"" -- including the media and powerful special interests -- to defeat his campaign.""The whole thing is one big fix. It's one big fix. It's one big ugly lie. It's one big fix. The press can't write the kind of things they write, which are lies, lies, lies,"" Trump said in Greensboro. ""The only thing I said is hopefully, hopefully our patriotic movement will overcome this terrible deception.""Trump also attacked the women who have accused him of inappropriate behavior, calling Jessica Leeds, the woman who accused him of groping her on a plane in the early 1980s, a ""horrible woman,"" apparently suggesting she was not attractive enough for him to grope.""When you looked at that horrible woman last night, you said, 'I don't think so! I don't think so!'"" Trump said.As he continued to deny the allegations, several of his supporters shouted back, ""We believe you!""Trump also suggested that the allegations against him were so unfounded that ""they could say it about anybody,"" including President Barack Obama.""Why doesn't some woman maybe come up and say what they say falsely about me, they could say about him? They could say it about anybody. They could say it about anybody. He better be careful because they could say it about anybody. Anybody at all,"" Trump said."

He described the missile launches against the USS Mason as ""a response to direct threats to our people, to our ships and we responded to that threat and we'll respond again.""Also Thursday, the Iranian navy deployed two warships into the Gulf of Aden in order to protect commercial vessels against pirates, according to the Tasnim News Agency, an Iranian news service with close ties to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. ""With regard to the Iranian navy activities, I'll leave it to the Iranians to describe the disposition of those ships,"" Cook said. ""We operate in those waters all the time.""The destroyer USS Nitze blasted radar sites along the Red Sea coast with Tomahawk cruise missiles after attempted attacks on the Mason attributed to Iran-backed Houthi rebels engaged in Yemen's civil war.Administration officials emphasized Friday that the strikes were limited, conducted in self-defense and not meant in any way to indicate that they back Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen or plan to wade deeper into the conflict. ""This was not meant to indicate support for coalition operations in Yemen at large or in the Red Sea,"" an administration official said Friday, ""and we were not intending to be brought into the war in any fashion.""President Barack Obama echoed the point in a letter to the Senate Friday.""These limited and proportionate strikes were conducted to protect our personnel and our ships and will preserve our freedom of navigation in this important maritime passageway,"" Obama wrote. ""The United States stands ready to take action in self-defense, as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats.""Pentagon officials said initial assessments indicated the Tomahawk strikes destroyed all three targets, but the exchange of fire underscored the risks of US support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, which the White House is now reviewing.In the meantime, the war is fueling anti-American sentiment in the region, deepening considerable strains in the US-Saudi relationship and raising the risk of unintended flare-ups with Tehran.""The war in Yemen is escalating and becoming more dangerous,"" said Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution.With its strategic location at the entrance to the Red Sea, extensive border with Saudi Arabia and desperately poor population, Yemen is ""a military and civil strategic nightmare,"" according to Anthony Cordesman, a former state and defense department official at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.A deadly mix of forces are competing within its borders, including small cells of ISIS fighters, separatist groups, tribal factions, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Houthi rebels backed by Iran, forces linked to the former government and groups allied with Yemen's internationally recognized and Saudi-backed exiled leader. The danger in Yemen is growing at a time when Congress has reduced US leverage with Saudi Arabia by passing legislation allowing US citizens to sue the kingdom for damages related to the attacks of September 11, 2001. Congress is also increasingly resistant to arms sales to Gulf nations, Riedel notes.Referring to the Democratic and Republican candidates for president, Riedel added that ""whether Clinton or Trump wins in November, they will inherit a damaged relationship in January.""Cook noted that two attempted missile strikes over four days against the USS Mason had posed a threat to that vessel and its crew. Those missiles had ""originated from Houthi-controlled territory,"" Cook said, but he added that the Pentagon doesn't know who, exactly, ""was pulling the trigger.""The attempted missile attacks on the USS Mason are believed to be Houthi payback for a Saudi-led coalition bombing of a funeral in Yemen's largest city on Saturday that killed 140 people.The alliance of Houthi rebels and followers of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, have been fighting for control of the country since 2014.The war accelerated in March 2015 when Saudi Arabia, fearing the influence of its arch-rival Iran, led a coalition air campaign to support Yemen's exiled leader Abed Rabbo Mansour. The war has since killed almost 10,000 people according to the United Nations, which says that as many as 4,000 of those casualties were civilians.The high level of civilian casualties at the hands of the Saudi-led coalition causes deep discomfort in Washington, administration officials say.Vice President Joe Biden, speaking after a campaign event for Clinton, said the administration has ""been pushing the Saudis as hard as we cannot, not to go in to Yemen and bomb in Yemen. But the Houthis are equally as bad. They're just firing on American ships as well. That's why we're working so hard to get a ceasefire and get a negotiated settlement.""After months of concern about the civilian casualties at the hands of Saudi strikes, the attack on the funeral appalled US officials.""There was absolutely no justification for the strike,"" said a second administration official, speaking to reporters in a telephone briefing. ""It pales next to anything else that had been done before and. as a result, there was a consensus that we need to look at the full scope of the support we provide to the coalition.""The White House is now reviewing its backing for Saudi Arabia's operations in Yemen. Right now that support includes refueling, ""advice and counsel on the conflict"" and on how the Saudis conduct air strikes, Cook said, as well as intelligence sharing that Cook said has been reduced in recent weeks.The White House review will examine ""the degree to which the aid and assistance actually helps try to minimize collateral damage and civilian casualties,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said.""The strike on the funeral was really, really hard to swallow,"" the first administration official said. ""We thought that was particularly egregious.""In the wake of the funeral attack, the non-profit group Human Rights Watch called on the US to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia and for the international community to launch an investigation into possible war crimes there.The US has sold Saudi Arabia over $111 billion in defense equipment and weaponry under President Barack Obama, and US and UK support have been crucial to the Saudi war in Yemen. ""That makes them culpable in war crimes,"" Riedel said. He added that there's also a cost to the US image in the Middle East.""The poorest Arabs are being blockaded by air and sea by the richest -- with our help,"" Riedel said.                  Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Thursday that the US calls on all parties in Yemen to deescalate violence. He stressed that the Tomahawk strikes were conducted in self defense, were limited in nature and were approved by Obama after a recommendation from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. The intent of the strikes was to deter further aggression against US assets in the region, Schultz said. It does not signal a greater US role in Yemen's civil war, nor will it distract from the mission against ISIS, he said. Pentagon officials said that they have put more assets into the area for protection. ""We have sufficient force to protect ourselves at all times,"" one defense officials said. The official wouldn't provide details.He said that planning for the strike mission began right after the first attempt on the USS Mason, but it took a few days to verify the targets and move the USS Nitze and its Tomahawk missiles into place.""We don't take it lightly,"" Cook said of the US decision to strike. ""We don't seek a wider role in the conflict,"" Cook said. ""This is about protecting our troops."" "	Yemen strikes risk US-Iran confrontation
