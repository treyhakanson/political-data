0	0	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/battleground-polls-2016-elections/index.html	The polls find Hillary Clinton inches ahead of Donald Trump in North Carolina and Nevada, but continuing to trail the Republican Party's presidential nominee in one of the biggest electoral vote prizes on the map, Ohio.The polls were taken October 10-15 as accusations of sexual assault against Trump began to roll out in the wake of the release of a video of the real estate mogul captured on a hot mic talking about women in a sexually aggressive and lewd way. All three find most voters in these battlegrounds had heard a great deal about the video itself, and most say the way Trump talks about women on the tape reflects his views about women generally.But in both Ohio and North Carolina, comparisons to CNN/ORC polls in September and late-August respectively suggest the allegations aren't hurting Trump in either of those states, either among likely voters or among the broader pool of registered voters.In Nevada, 46% of likely voters say they back Clinton, 44% Trump, with 7% behind libertarian Gary Johnson. North Carolina's voters are almost evenly split between the two major party candidates, with Clinton holding 48% among likely voters to Trump's 47%. Johnson has far less appeal here than in Nevada, just 4% of likely voters back him. In both those states, Clinton holds a significant edge among the broader pool of registered voters. Ohio's more solidly a Trump state than the others, with 48% of likely voters supporting Trump to 44% Clinton and 4% behind Johnson.See full poll results: North Carolina, Nevada and OhioVoters in Nevada and North Carolina are more divided by gender than are those in Ohio, with the widest gender divide in Nevada. There, Clinton leads by 15 points among women, while Trump wins by 10 among men. In North Carolina, the gender gap narrows: Clinton is up 11 points among women, Trump up 7 points among men. And in Ohio, the gender divide finds women almost evenly split, 48% to 45%, while Trump tops Clinton 52% to 39% among men. The big difference: Married women in Ohio break for Trump, 54% to 40%, while in the other two states, married women tilt the other way. Unmarried women in all three states break in Clinton's favor by a wide margin. College educated whites in Nevada and North Carolina break sharply in Clinton's favor, 49% Clinton to 41% Trump in Nevada and 59% Clinton to 37% Trump in North Carolina. They tilt more narrowly toward Clinton in Ohio, 48% Clinton to 44% Trump. In all three states, college-educated whites backed Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2012, by wide margins.Those white voters without college degrees remain a core of Trump's support, backing him over Clinton by 48 points in North Carolina, 26 points in Ohio and 25 points in Nevada. In Ohio, that support may be boosting Trump's numbers in the state's northern tier outside of Cleveland, an area rife with white non-college voters that has typically tilted toward the Democrats in close statewide races. That area, including the industrial-heavy areas around Akron, Canton and Youngstown, breaks for Trump by 20 points in the poll. In a sign of the shift among these voters, those voters in union households across the state break 52% for Clinton to 40% for Trump. In 2012, they broke for Obama over Romney by a 60% to 37% margin.Racial divides are also prominent in these three states, with non-whites breaking heavily for Clinton while Trump holds broad advantages among white voters. In North Carolina, Clinton's support is bolstered by a 93% to 4% advantage among black voters, about on par with Obama's margin there in 2012, but she lags behind Obama's performance among Hispanic voters in Nevada. Registered voters who are Hispanic there split 54% for Clinton to 33% for Trump.And none of these polls shows Clinton reaching Obama's level of support among younger voters. In Ohio and Nevada, there isn't much of an age gap, though Clinton does fare somewhat better among younger voters than among older ones in North Carolina.There is some evidence in the polls that Trump holds support among white evangelicals in numbers similar to Mitt Romney's backing: 77% in North Carolina and 73% in Ohio back Trump. Romney carried 79% of these voters in North Carolina and 69% in Ohio.Likely voters who back Clinton in Nevada and North Carolina are more set in their choices than are Trump backers in the state, with just 7% of Clinton supporters in Nevada and 6% in North Carolina saying there's a chance they could change their mind by election day. Among Trump backers, the equivalent numbers are 14% in Nevada and 13% in North Carolina. In Ohio, however, both candidate's supporters are equally likely to say they could change their minds before election day, 12% say they're not set in their choices.Among registered voters overall, Trump's backers are more enthusiastic about voting than are Clinton's supporters in both Nevada (57% extremely or very enthusiastic among Trump backers vs. 48% among Clinton supporters) and Ohio (45% for Trump voters, 38% for Clinton voters). In North Carolina, Clinton holds the edge, 53% to 48%.By a wide margin, voters in all three states say the candidates' positions on the issues will be more important to their vote than the candidates' personal qualities, a judgment that appears to work in Trump's favor. He tops Clinton as better able to handle the economy in all three states, though his advantage is within the survey's margin of error in Nevada, and in Ohio, he also holds a significant edge on handling immigration and trade with other countries. In both North Carolina and Nevada, Clinton appears to have the upper hand on those two issues. In all three states, she has the lead on handling foreign policy, and as better able to handle the responsibilities of being commander in chief.Most voters in all three states say Clinton has the better temperament for serving effectively as president, and in the wake of the video, she is more often seen as the candidate who shares voters' values, but sizable minorities in all three states say neither candidate shares their values. And honesty continues to be a challenge for Clinton, she lags behind Trump when voters are asked who is more honest and trustworthy in all three states, though here too, sizable minorities see neither presidential candidate as honest.Looking to the downballot races, both are close in North Carolina, with just a 1-point margin between Richard Burr and Deborah Ross in the state's senate race, and Roy Cooper at 49% to incumbent Pat McCrory's 48% in the gubernatorial race there. The senate race in Nevada tilts Democratic, 52% for Catherine Cortez Masto to 45% for Joe Heck, while in Ohio, Rob Portman continues to hold a wide lead over Ted Strickland, 56% to 40%.The CNN/ORC Polls were conducted by telephone on landlines and cellphones from October 10 through 15. In Nevada, interviews were conducted with 1,006 adults, including 862 registered voters and 698 likely voters. In North Carolina, the 1,025 adults interviewed included 929 registered voters and 788 likely voters. And in Ohio, interviews with 1,009 adults included 890 registered voters and 774 likely voters. Results for likely voters in each state have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, it is 3.5 points for registered voters in Nevada and Ohio, and 3 points for registered voters in North Carolina.

Better numbers, Comey argues, would help the nation understand whether there is a real epidemic of police killings of black men or if the advent of viral videos shared in social media are giving the impression that there are more lethal confrontations between police and minorities. ""A small group of videos serve as an epidemic"" Comey argued Sunday. People who think there is an epidemic of police shootings don't know if there is, and police don't know whether there is, because there is no national collection of police shooting reports. Some police departments report such numbers while many don't. The FBI is trying to change that, recently announcing a pilot program to collect numbers from police departments in 2017. Comey also spoke about the need of police to improve trust with the communities they serve. "	FBI director: Stats don't back up claims about police shooting epidemic	[]	[]

James Cartwright sat quietly with his attorney, former White House Counsel Gregory Craig, as Assistant US Attorney Leo J. Wise described the facts underlying the single charge of making false statements to federal investigators. Cartwright, who became vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2007, signed more than 36 non-disclosure agreements related to Department of Defense programs during his tenure, the government said. Cartwright retired in 2011, but kept his top secret security clearance.  After his retirement, Cartwright again signed a ""Classified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement,"" which included warnings ""that unauthorized disclosure ... by me could cause damage or irreparable injury to the United States or could be used to advantage by a foreign nation,"" according to the government's court filing detailing the charge against him.In 2012, investigators showed Cartwright classified information, including top-secret information, in a book by David Sanger, a national security correspondent for The New York Times, but Cartwright denied providing the material to Sanger, the government said. The government did not reveal the title of Sanger's book. He has written two books on US foreign policy, the second of which was published in 2012 and titled, ""Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power.""Cartwright similarly told investigators that he had not provided classified information to Daniel Klaidman, then at Newsweek.""So you are pleading guilty because you are, in fact, guilty?"" asked US District Court Judge Leon.""Yes, sir,"" Cartwright answered. As CNN has previously reported, Cartwright has been under federal investigation for providing classified information to reporters since 2013. While the charge of making false statements to federal investigators carries a five-year maximum sentence, Cartwright's plea agreement states that he should face no more than six months in prison.Cartwright's sentencing hearing is set for January 17, 2017."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/melania-trump-interview/index.html	"""I believe my husband. I believe my husband,"" she said in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday. ""This was all organized from the opposition. And with the details ... did they ever check the background of these women? They don't have any facts."" She also said she hadn't heard her husband use that kind of language before. ""No. No, that's why I was surprised, because I said like I don't know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private,"" Melania Trump said. ""I heard many different stuff -- boys talk,"" she said. ""The boys, the way they talk when they grow up and they want to sometimes show each other, 'Oh, this and that' and talking about the girls. But yes, I was surprised, of course.""She specifically attacked a first-person account in People Magazine, in which journalist Natasha Stoynoff said Trump made an unwanted advance while she worked on a story about his one-year wedding anniversary. The reporter described a chance encounter later with Melania Trump, who says it never happened -- and her lawyers have threatened to sue over the claim. ""Even the story that came out in people magazine, the writer she said my husband took her to the room and start kissing her,"" she said. ""She wrote in the same story about me -- that she saw me on 5th Avenue, and I said to her, 'Natasha, how come we don't see you anymore?' I was never friends with her, I would not recognize her.""That, Melania Trump said, ""was another thing like people come out saying lies and not true stuff.""'Egged on'It was the first public defense Melania Trump has made of her husband since a tape in which Trump bragged about sexually aggressive behavior toward women was published by The Washington Post and NBC. In the wake of that report, several women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.Trump said her husband was ""egged on"" in the 2005 tape in which he made lewd comments about his own sexually aggressive behavior toward women -- remarks she says were ""boy talk.""""I said to my husband that, you know, the language was inappropriate. It's not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know,"" she said.Billy Bush officially leaves NBC in the wake of 'Access Hollywood' tape""And as you can see from the tape, the cameras were not on -- it was only a mic. And I wonder if they even knew that the mic was on,"" she said, referring to Trump and NBC's ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush. She said they were engaged in ""boy talk, and he was led on -- like, egged on -- from the host to say dirty and bad stuff."" She said she agrees with Michelle Obama's assertion that kissing or groping a woman without consent is sexual assault. ""But every assault should be taken care of in a court of law. And to accuse, no matter who it is, a man or a woman, without evidence is damaging and unfair,"" she said. Melania Trump defended her husband's criticism on the campaign trail of his accusers' looks -- an implication that the women who have alleged his misconduct aren't attractive enough to sexually assault. 'I know he respects women'""He's raw. He will say it as he feels it. So you know, I know he respects women. But he's defending himself because they're lies,"" she said. She said she jokes that her husband at times behaves like an overgrown boy -- and that she saw his ""Access Hollywood"" remarks as emblematic of that.  ""Sometimes I say I have two boys at home -- I have my young son and I have my husband. But I know how some men talk, and that's how I saw it, yes,"" she said. Tight races remain in three battlegrounds: Nevada, North Carolina and OhioShe said she would keep their personal conversations private -- but that Trump apologized for his remarks on the tape. ""I accept his apology. I hope the American people will accept it as well. And it was many, many years ago. He's not the man that I know,"" she said. Melania Trump called her husband ""real"" and ""raw"" -- and said because of his years as an entertainer, he faced an especially tough challenge transitioning into politics, because he has made decades' worth of controversial comments.""It's very hard, especially for him -- when he decided to run for the presidency, because he did so many stuff in his life. He was on so many tapes, so many shows. And we knew that -- that, you know, tapes will come out, people won't want to go against him. ""But my husband is real. He's raw. He tells it like it is. He's kind. He's a gentleman. He supports everybody. He supports women. He encourages them to go to the highest level, to achieve their dreams. He employs many, many women,"" she said. 'He didn't say he did it'She said she wouldn't describe what Trump said on the tape as sexual assault, even though in the video Trump appeared to be describing his own actions. ""No, that's not sexual assault,"" she said. ""He didn't say he did it."" Melania Trump said she believes Trump in part because she's seen him deflect brazen advances from other women. ""I see many, many women coming to him and giving phone numbers and, you know, want(ing) to work for him -- inappropriate stuff from women. And they know he's married,"" she said. ""You've seen that?"" Cooper asked. ""Oh yes, of course. It was in front of me,"" Trump said. ""In front of me. And I've said, like, 'Why did you give your number to my husband?' "" Melania Trump reserved her strongest critique for the political press, which she says has yet to report an accurate story about her. ""I didn't expect media would be so dishonest and so mean. I didn't expect that,"" she said. ""Also for me, from the beginning, I never had one correct story -- one honest story.""She backed her husband's claims that the election is being rigged in Hillary Clinton's favor, arguing that media bias is undercutting her husband. ""Well I see it how the media is portraying -- I see how they report things, and what they want to say and what they don't want to say,"" she said. ""They're going -- just for example, he makes a speech 45 minutes long, they take a sentence out, and they're going on and on about that sentence, nothing else,"" she said. ""And he talks about the issues, and that's what American people want to hear, it's about issues, about jobs, about the future of our country, and that's what he wants to do. She added: ""He wants to secure the borders, he wants to secure America, he wants to bring jobs back, he wants to bring economy back, and he's very passionate about American people, because he knows he can do that. He's a worker, he's a fighter, he is, he's very passionate about it, and he will not give up, he will fight till the end, and he will fight for American people as he's fighting now for himself.""Melania Trump also made clear she doesn't want sympathy. ""I'm very strong. And people -- they don't really know me. People think and talk about me like, 'Oh, Melania, oh poor Melania,'"" she said. ""Don't feel sorry for me. Don't feel sorry for me. I can handle everything,"" she added."	Melania Trump interview: Donald Trump was 'egged on' into 'boy talk'	['Cooper', 'Trump']	[]
4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/white-house-state-dinner-mario-batali-italy/index.html	"The dinner marked an final moment for Obama to deploy the lavish displays of friendship afforded the US commander-in-chief. But it also symbolized an end to the stylish, celebrity-friendly era of presidential entertaining the Obamas ushered in eight years ago.Speaking Tuesday morning, Obama said he had ""saved the best for last"" in extending the most formal of Washington invites to Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Planning the event, the White House embraced the opportunity to go large, inviting more guests than any of Obama's previous 12 events and serving a meal oozing with continental flair.Even first lady Michelle Obama embraced the ""go big or go home"" attitude, striding out of the White House North Portico Tuesday wearing a figure-hugging Atelier Versace gown made entirely of rose gold chainmail. The dress appeared to spark as cameras flashed.The evening was a rare moment of refinement in an otherwise crude election season that's occupied Washington. Even the mud slinging wasn't far from Obama's mind during a dinner toast.""Tonight, we're reminded that American democracy has been graced by the touch of Italy,"" Obama said. ""We look at the dome of the US Capitol and marvel at the touch of Brumidi. Yet some days our presidential campaigns can seem like Dante's Inferno.""Renzi, too, made certain the presidential contest wasn't far from mind. Joking that when Obama leaves office he could visit Florence and compare the White House garden tomatoes to those grown in Italy, Renzi turned his focus to the first lady, who delivered a speech last week denouncing Trump's sexually aggressive remarks.""Michelle, after last week let me be frank -- your speeches are better than your tomatoes,"" he said. ""Thank you so much, as prime minister but also as father of a small daughter.""Tuesday's dinner had political undertones from the start. When guests arrived they were greeted by a group of acapella singers from a non-profit organization backed by Rosie O'Donnell, whom Donald Trump has spent the last decade maligning. And Renzi, the guest of honor, has openly backed Hillary Clinton in November's contest. And there's little secret that White Houses past and present have rewarded donors and like-minded politicians with coveted invites to state dinners, meaning conversation around the pink-draped tables Tuesday wasn't likely be favorable to Trump. Among the prominent Democrats invited: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.But even among a pro-Clinton crowd, few could imagine the same mix of Hollywood and Washington the Obamas have attracted during their time in office, even if another Democrat wins.""I don't know when glamour's going to be ever back in the White House,"" said fashion designer Naeem Khan, who dressed Michelle Obama for her first state dinner in 2009. Indeed, many guests had a hard time imagining the choices a President Donald Trump, or a first lady Melania, might make for a formal White House event.""Gee, I don't know,"" said comedian Jerry Seinfeld when asked what a Trump state dinner might be like.Chance Bennett, the artist who goes by Chance the Rapper, said on his way in he was looking forward to a dance-friendly soundtrack during Obama's final state dinner.""I hope there's some dancing,"" he said, to better advance ""the recurring dance battle that me and the president have had going on for a few years.""Those who scored the last golden ticket of the Obama tenure dined on agnolotti with butter and sage (a sample tasted by a reporter Monday was creamy, autumnal and piping hot), warm butternut squash salad, beef braciole with horseradish gremolata, and green apple crostata with thyme caramel for dessert.The event is a bookend to the administration's first state dinner in 2009, held in honor of India and marred by gate-crashers. Since then, the Obamas have welcomed both close allies -- Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada -- as well as countries with frostier US ties, including two state dinners in honor of China. The events have attracted celebrities, lawmakers, diplomats, athletes and fashion designers -- and the celebration of Italy was no different. Gwen Stefani will perform after dinner, and brought as a date her boyfriend, country star Blake Shelton. Renzi, an outspoken advocate of the Italian fashion industry, invited Giorgio Armani as a guest. The evening's chef, Mario Batali, said between preparation sessions Monday he was honored -- but also anxious at the prospect of serving 500 guests in a temporary tent 200 yards from the White House kitchen.""If there's one thing that I'm not going to sleep well about tonight, it's only going to be the hot plates,"" Batali said. ""I think I'll be shaking in my orange crocs tomorrow when it's about a half-hour before service.""In the end, the dinner was another ""last"" on a long list of final moments for the Obamas. Speaking during his toast Tuesday, Obama said he was reminded of his visit to the Colosseum in Rome in 2014. ""It was late in the day, it was quiet, the sun was going down, and as I walked across those ancient stones worn by the history of 2,000 years, it was a humbling reminder of our place here on earth,"" he said. ""In the grand sweep of time, each of us is here only for a brief moment. So many of the things that we focus on each day, the political ups and downs, the successes and the setbacks, those things are fleeting.""""What matters in the end is what we build,"" he said. ""What matters is what we leave behind."""	White House state dinner: Batali's pasta, 2016 politics to chew on	['Pelosi', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Cuomo', 'Obama']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/joe-heck-donald-trump-support/index.html	"According to audio of the private event obtained by CNN, Heck seemed to recognize that his decision to abandon Trump had become a sore subject among some of his core supporters, calling it a ""very difficult situation."" About six minutes into the recording he defended his decision to rescind his Trump endorsement by saying that the GOP nominee's ""pattern of behavior"" was bound to ""hand"" the White House to Hillary Clinton.""I want to support him, I really do,"" Heck, a Nevada Republican, said during a 90-minute discussion during a Las Vegas fundraiser for his Senate campaign.""But he has got to change his tone and he's got to be -- I don't want to make him into a politician or make him into the same thing he is running against -- but he has got to realize he is not going to win this race by appealing to the 20% or 30% of the Republican base,"" Heck added.Heck, who noted that Trump had ""one more debate chance"" to turn around his candidacy in Las Vegas this week, added, ""At the very least, if I have to go with my own conscience to make this right, I am going to vote for Michael Pence as vice president."" Nevada has no write-in option.The candid assessment gives a glimpse into how Trump has made life difficult for down-ticket Republicans, who have long sought to avoid much public discussion about their controversial nominee. And Heck's private comments are his most detailed views yet in the aftermath of the leaked video of Trump making vulgar and sexually aggressive comments about women during a 2005 taping of a segment on ""Access Hollywood,"" prompting Heck to call on the GOP nominee to withdraw from the race. Yet Heck has come under attack from his Democratic opponent, Catherine Cortez Masto, for waiting until the video to drop his Trump endorsement, even though the Republican candidate has offended other voting blocs, including Hispanics, for months. At the same time, he has endured sharp backlash in conservative circles, underscoring the challenges Republican candidates face in wooing supporters of the GOP nominee while distancing themselves from his incendiary rhetoric.RELATED: List: Which Republicans oppose Trump and why?During the fundraiser, Heck said Republicans ""cut a lot of slack"" to Trump because ""he is not an accomplished campaigner"" and he needed ""to learn the ropes"" as he ran as a ""change agent."" And Heck suggested that had Trump been a more disciplined campaigner, he may have been more forgiving to the GOP nominee in the aftermath of the ""Access Hollywood"" video. ""What has happened is despite who has tried to help him, by focusing his message on where it needs to be to beat Hillary Clinton, he cannot stay on the message,"" Heck said. ""There's only two issues he needs to talk about: the economy and national security. Nothing else matters. And if he would talk about those two issues, he would clean her clock and a lot of people including close personal friends of his have tried to get him to do that.""Heck's 'worst fear'At the fundraiser, Heck said that his ""worst fear"" is that the top-of-the-ticket will depress Republican turnout on Election Day. And he believes if Trump loses Nevada by 10-12 points, ""it's going to be hard,"" predicting that he could outperform Trump by 5-6 points.""We never thought that the House was in jeopardy, that we could lose 30 seats in the House,"" Heck said. ""If the current trajectory continues that becomes a possibility."" Heck spokesman Brian Baluta downplayed his boss' comments at the fundraiser, saying they were consistent with the message he was giving publicly. ""It's unfortunate we've reached the point where it's considered news when someone running for office says the same thing in private that they do in public,"" Baluta said. ""Dr. Heck's position is clear. The same cannot be said for Catherine Cortez Masto, who turns a blind eye to wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton and Harry Reid.""At a debate last Friday, Heck cited his service as an emergency room doctor and as a member of the Army Reserve -- even invoking his wife as a victim of domestic abuse in a prior relationship -- when discussing Trump's ""Access Hollywood"" comments that many liken to sexual assault.""The decision I made was an extremely personal decision,"" Heck said at the debate.Not just the video At the fundraiser, Heck called Trump's comments on the video ""reprehensible,"" citing his wife and two daughters and saying his decision to pull the endorsement was ""morally and ethically right to me and my family.""But he said that the leaked tape alone didn't force him to withdraw his support of Trump. The congressman suggested that had Trump been focusing ""on the issues"" while the tape leaked, he may have approached the situation differently.""Look, it wasn't this video that made the final decision, alright? He's had this pattern of behavior that's persisted... even while he was on the campaign,"" Heck said. ""It's one thing if it happened 11 years ago and now he's concentrating on the issues and talking the way we need to talk to him about it.""In his remarks to donors, Heck said that he's sympathetic to Trump's desire to engage in political brawls -- but said such tactics have undermined his candidacy by taking him off-message.""I mean, I am a New Yorker, I understand,"" Heck said. ""It's not in his nature. Alright, if he's attacked he wants to punch back. He wants to punch back hard. Look what he's doing is shoring up the Republican base and that's great, but you know cannot win a federal race nationwide with just the Republican base, you've got to have a big tent and he doesn't. And that's why he's floundering in the polls.""Yet, Heck said about 59 minutes into the recording that he did agree with ""certain policy stances"" of Trump's, while disagreeing with others like trade.""Ronald Reagan said that my 80% friend is not my 20% enemy,"" Heck said. ""Nobody agrees on 100% on everything."" Heck's decision to pull his endorsement amounted to a sharp reversal; in September the Nevada Senate candidate told CNN he supports Trump.""Why wouldn't I?"" he said when asked if he trusted Trump with the nuclear codes.Now, Heck suggested, Trump may never occupy the Oval Office.""He is going to hand the White House to Hillary Clinton,"" Heck told his donors."

The author works for David Axelrod.""I think the message of this [election] is that ... Republicans have to find a way to talk to a changing America,"" Ron Brownstein, columnist at The Atlantic and longtime political journalist, told David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.Republicans themselves recognized this threat to their future, which is why the party released an ""autopsy"" of the 2012 presidential campaign that called for immigration reform and an embrace of minority voters, among other things.The problem, Brownstein argues, is that Republicans feared that supporting those policies would only have resulted in a more disaffected and potentially mutinous base of voters.""Because so many in the party did not want to go down the policy road that that analysis entailed,"" Brownstein said, ""They kind of grabbed onto another theory, which said, 'No, no, no. The problem isn't that we don't get enough minority, or millennial, or socially liberal whites. It's that we don't turn out enough of our culturally conservative base.'""Republicans have tested that theory in the candidacy of Donald Trump, whose nationalist and economically populist message has been embraced by blue-collar workers. That support, however, has come at a potentially lethal cost for Trump.""[Trump] is now at risk of being the first Republican ever in the history of polling -- going back to 1952 -- to lose most college-educated whites,"" Brownstein says. ""And you'd have to say today that's almost certainly going to happen.""For all its troubles at the national level, Brownstein contends, the Republican Party still might avoid confronting its core vulnerabilities after November and instead justify a poor electoral performance on a uniquely unsuitable candidate. ""One of the problems the Republicans are going to have is that the message of this campaign, if Trump loses, is going to be somewhat confused and obscured by the cascade of personal problems that have beset him.""Turning to the Democratic side, Brownstein believes its problem is that the party has become so urbanized it is nearly impossible to win the House of Representatives and implement its policy agenda unimpeded.""(President Barack Obama) won the hundred biggest counties in America by 12 million combined votes. He lost the other 3,000 by 7 million,"" Brownstein said. ""The way that plays out in the House is that, even before you get to redistricting, as you move outside of the urban areas, Democrats simply can't compete because, in those places there is no work-around, you have to win more blue-collar white voters than they are capable of winning right now.""To hear the whole conversation with Brownstein, which also covered his experiences working for Ralph Nader in the 1970s and the intersection between Hollywood and Washington, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/donald-trump-virginia/index.html	"To back that up, CNN is told the Trump campaign plans to go on the air with television ads in Virginia starting Tuesday in what campaign officials say is a $2 million buy in ""key markets"" through election day. The campaign also announced a 19-member Virginia leadership team.Sources familiar with that conversation tell CNN that Trump was not happy with what they say was a botched message from Trump campaign headquarters in New York to field staff in Virginia. The message was supposed to be that Team Trump wanted to send a handful of his staff in Virginia to North Carolina to help with early voting.Trump sources say the campaign alone has almost 30 paid staffers in Virginia, who are working to get out the vote in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the state. That doesn't include joint operations with the Republican National Committee. These Trump sources say they understand that the Washington suburbs of northern Virginia, which is growing in population and helping turn the state more blue, is not Trump country, but insist that Trump does have support elsewhere. They concede, however, that a lot of that support is in rural areas that requires resources for aggressive get out the vote operations.  All this flies in the face of what many national Republican party officials see as a lost cause in Virginia, especially since its popular Senator, Tim Kaine, is Hillary Clinton's running mate. A Virginia poll released Monday by Christopher Newport University's Wason Center found Clinton with a 15-point lead over Trump in the state.Still, sources say a driving force for Trump to compete in Virginia is his multiple properties there, including a hotel that opened last year on his winery near Charlottesville. Trump sources say the candidate is especially focused on winning battleground states where he is invested through his business.Additionally, Virginia Republicans pushing for Trump to stay in the hunt there are telling campaign officials that the Old Dominion tends to break late and that they still have a chance. They are also reminding Team Trump about recent statewide races, such as Ed Gillespie's Senate run against Mark Warner, where he came close. They say he could have won had the party taken the race more seriously and devoted more resources.The biggest asset for any campaign, however, is a candidate's time. And three weeks before Election Day, Trump is going to Wisconsin -- which most bewildered Republican officials, even some in the state, say he has no chance of winning.Trump sources insist he will be going to Virginia multiple times before Election Day, but they admit nothing is on the schedule yet."

Trump calls for drug test ahead of next debate, says Clinton was 'pumped up'""So I think that every time he says something, you have to look to his vulnerability on those scores,"" she said. Pelosi, a California Democrat, also defended Clinton as she's under fire for saying in a speech revealed by WikiLeaks' hack of an aide's emails that environmentalists should ""get a life"" rather than saying the United States should no longer use fossil fuels. ""The point is this: The Republicans have been in total denial about the climate crisis that we are facing,"" she said, arguing that Clinton is better than GOP options. Pelosi was also bullish on Democrats' chances to retake control of the House as Trump's poll numbers drop. ""If the election were today, we'd have a good chance to do so,"" she said, adding that the ultimate outcome largely ""depends on how big Hillary Clinton's margin is.""""The concern I have is big, dark money coming in -- fossil fuel money, Wall Street Money, special interest money, dark, coming in in a big way,"" she said. Pelosi added that House control ""is definitely within reach.""Democrats would have to win gain about 30 seats to retake the House majority, something few pundits see as likely."
