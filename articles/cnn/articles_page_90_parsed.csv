""So absent overwhelming evidence that there is, it would not be for me to say that there is."" Conway did say that there have been voter issues of concern in the past.""We know in the past we know that people who are dead are still on the voter rolls,"" she said. ""We know that people are voting a couple different times in places, so you do hear reports here and there.""Following a decline in the polls, criticized debate performances and accusation of improper conduct with a number of women, the Republican presidential nominee has increasingly suggested that the election is ""rigged"" against him. He has even encouraged his supporters to head to the polls to monitor them to make sure other voters are not violating rules. ""I think Donald Trump's point is a larger one,"" Conway said, referencing Trump and the campaign's concern about media bias.According to the most recent CNN Poll of Polls, Clinton is leading Trump by eight points among likely voters. Conway told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday that Clinton is beating Trump because she has a lot of advantages. ""She has so many advantages,"" she said. ""She has endless money, she has a lot of the media. She has a very popular president and first lady out there campaigning for her."""

1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/politics/presidential-debate-highlights/index.html	"""I will look at it at the time,"" Trump said when asked during the final presidential debate whether he would concede if he loses on November 8, following his claims that the election is ""rigged"" against him.He added: ""I will keep you in suspense.""The comments at the Las Vegas showdown marked a stunning moment that has never been seen in the weeks before a modern presidential election. The stance threatens to cast doubt on one of the fundamental principles of American politics -- the peaceful, undisputed transfer of power from one president to a successor who is recognized as legitimate after winning an election.The Republican nominee doubled down on his comments about the election Thursday during a rally in Delaware, Ohio, where he said he would accept the results ""if I win.""Trump's debate performance could doom his chance to win over any remaining undecided voters at this late stage in the campaign. His comments about the election results came during a debate in which he spoke of ""hombres,"" language that could offend Latinos. And he referred to Clinton as a ""nasty woman.""His campaign manager sought to blunt the election comments, appearing on CNN's ""New Day"" Thursday.""What Donald Trump has said, over time, if you take all of his statements together, he has said that he will respect the results of the election,"" said Kellyanne Conway, although she argued what he's saying is not without precedent.""Everybody, including Al Gore in 2000, waits to see what those election results are,"" she later added. That's a flawed comparison, however, since Gore's fate was in the hands of an automatic recount due to the narrow margin of George W. Bush's lead in Florida. Gore did not question the integrity of the election before Election Day.The election remarks also expose a divide with Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, who told CNN's Wolf Blitzer before the debate, ""We'll certainly accept the outcome of this election.""CNN Reality CheckDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who is leading Trump in most polls, said her competitor's remarks were ""horrifying"" and accused him of taking refuge in the idea that any event that turns out against him -- even an Emmy award that goes to a rival -- is ""rigged.""""That is not the way our democracy works,"" Clinton said. ""We've been around for 240 years. We have had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what is expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.""She continued: ""He is denigrating -- he's talking down -- our democracy. And I for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.""Trump's remark about the election result is certain to dominate the aftermath of the debate with only 19 days to go before the election, and it seemed likely to overshadow the GOP's nominee's strongest performance in any of the three presidential debates.A CNN/ORC instant poll found 52% of debate watchers viewed Clinton as the winner compared to 39% who felt the same about Trump.Trump didn't have much margin for error going into the debate. He's down eight points in the latest CNN Poll of Polls and is nearly out of time to launch what would have to be one of the most remarkable comebacks of modern times.A new edition of the CNN electoral map on Wednesday moved two key swing states, Florida and Nevada, to ""lean Democrat."" Two other states that have voted almost exclusively Republican for decades, Utah and Arizona, are now considered battlegrounds.Calm startThe showdown began in a more civil and calm way than the two previous debates, in which Trump and Clinton repeatedly flung sharp, bitter jabs at one another. He was far more disciplined for much of the debate, and did his best to avoid taking Clinton's bait, showing restraint as he and Clinton debated the Supreme Court, the Second Amendment, abortion and the economy.The billionaire reality star-turned-politicians did a better job than in the first two debates of prosecuting Clinton's weaknesses, lambasting her over her record as secretary of state and the controversy over her private email server, and painting her as the symptom of a tired political establishment who had achieved nothing in her 30 years in public life.But Trump seemed to lose his cool as the debate went on, harshly criticizing Clinton and occasionally getting testy with the debate moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News. The debate began to take a turn when Trump and Clinton clashed over the Republican nominee's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Clinton blasted Trump as a ""puppet"" of Putin and directly called on him to condemn what she said was a Russian effort to use cyberattacks to influence the election in her opponent's favor.Trump replied that Putin had no respect for Clinton or President Barack Obama.""That's because he would rather have a puppet as president of the United States,"" Clinton said, implying that Putin wanted Trump to win the election.""No puppet. You are the puppet,"" Trump said.Trump said he had never met Putin but allowed that the Russian leader had said nice things about him, and said it would be good if Washington and Moscow worked together to fight ISIS.But he added: ""This is not my best friend.""Clinton and Trump also bitterly sparred over the theme of who is qualified to be president. Wallace pressed Trump on why so many women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault if the allegations were not true.Trump said the claims had been ""largely debunked.""""I think they want either fame or her campaign did it,"" Trump said, referring to the women that came forward after he said at the last debate that he had never been abusive to any women.Clinton noted that Trump had implied at several rallies that he could not have made inappropriate advances toward the women because they were not sufficiently attractive.Trump wrongly denied that he had ever made such a remark.""Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity and their self worth,"" Clinton said.Treatment of womenClinton said that Trump's treatment of women was part of pattern of behavior that saw him insult a disabled reporter, go after the parents of a fallen Muslim soldier and question the impartiality of an American judge of Mexican descent.She said such tactics were in line with a divisive and very ""dangerous vision of our country.""The tone of the debate -- unusually substantial at the start -- never recovered once the atmosphere became charged. As the event wound down, Clinton said that under her economic plan, the payroll taxes of both herself and Trump would go up to ensure the solvency of Social Security -- unless her rival could figure out a way to avoid paying taxes.""Such a nasty woman,"" Trump interjected."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/politics/democrats-arizona-2016-election/index.html	"Along with hopes for record-breaking turnout from newly-registered Latinos and millennial voters, the Clinton campaign is hoping the support of Obama and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will galvanize Democrats into flipping the state.In a passionate speech, Obama said Trump is ""threatening the very idea of America itself.""""And we cannot stand for that,"" she said in Phoenix. ""We all understand that an attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us ... We are a nation founded as a rebuke to tyranny.""The first lady continued, saying Trump doesn't understand or speak for Latino and female voters.""Maybe that's why this candidate thinks certain immigrants are criminals,"" she said. ""Instead of folks who work their fingers to the bone to give their kids a better life to help build the greatest nation on earth. Because he doesn't really know them.""She continued: ""Maybe that's why he demeans and humiliates women as if we're objects meant solely for pleasure and entertainment rather than human beings worthy of love and respect. He just doesn't understand us.""Sanders, delivering an after-dark rally on the University of Arizona's campus Tuesday night, called Trump's qualifications in question.""I dare say that there has not been in the modern history of America -- or maybe in the entire history of our country -- a person less qualified from a character point of view or a policy point of view than Donald Trump,"" Sanders told a crowd reminiscent of his late-night primary rallies on college campuses in Iowa and New Hampshire. Obama and Sanders are aiding Clinton's last-minute bid to expand the presidential battleground map to Arizona -- largely by reminding the voters Clinton needs that they've been offended by Trump. On Wednesday, a new survey showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 percentage points, 43% to 38% among likely voters.The Clinton campaign's belief: Arizona's population growth is heavily Latino, and non-profit groups working in the state for years have registered many of those Latinos to vote. The state also has a younger population and a relatively large number of colleges -- making it easier to reach large pools of millennial voters.  It's why national Democrats believe Arizona -- not Georgia or Texas -- is their best opportunity to flip a traditionally red state.And then there's the Trump factor. ""There is no doubt that Donald Trump's offensive rhetoric has made Arizona more competitive than ever before,"" said Meg Ansara, Clinton's battleground states director. ""Trump has given us an opportunity to be out there and talk to new voters about Hillary Clinton,"" Ansara said, ""and we are seeing a great response when they hear about her lifetime of work for children and families and her plans to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.""Three weeks from Election Day, Clinton's campaign has dispatched its A-list of surrogates to Arizona. Sanders drew big crowds of millennials and liberals on Tuesday, and the first lady helped the campaign reach suburban women and minorities in Phoenix on Thursday. Chelsea Clinton met with voters Wednesday as well.Sanders was deployed to Flagstaff and Tucson -- liberal college towns where Sanders delivered a strong showing in his primary battle with Clinton. He highlighted Trump's most offensive remarks about minorities and women -- Clinton's constituency.  ""We cannot elect a man to be president who objectifies women; who brags about assaulting women,"" he said. ""We cannot elect a candidate to be president who refers to our Mexican brothers and sisters as rapists and criminals. We cannot elect a man to be president who helped lead the birther movement -- a racist effort to delegitimize the first African American president in our history.""Many of the students who showed up in Tucson on Tuesday backed Sanders in the primary -- but most said they're now with Clinton, and cited Trump as the chief reason why. Trump's presence on the ballot ""brings out the normal voters plus the people who feel personally attacked,"" said Chris Gallo, a 19-year-old University of Arizona student who voted for Sanders in the primary but is backing Clinton now.""This election is just the beginning for Arizona to become a blue state,"" he said, citing his Latino friends' opposition to Trump -- while acknowledging Trump's message plays much better in his hometown of Glendale. Clinton's late Arizona bidThe run of first-string surrogate events comes on top of the Clinton campaign's $2 million investment in television ads in Arizona. It's not just Latinos and millennial voters. Democrats expect white, college-educated, suburban voters who have moved West for work in recent years -- particularly women -- to tip for Clinton in Arizona just as polls have shown they are in battlegrounds like the suburbs of Philadelphia. ""I was born during civil rights being signed. I thought we lived in a different world until Trump came along,"" said Leslie Pinder, a 57-year-old Tucson voter who backed Sanders in the primary. ""What I hear from a lot of people who are die-hard Republicans is, 'I cannot face my daughter, my granddaughters, and say I voted for Trump.'"" ""He's just brought all the latent racism into the open. Even bullying in schools. Just a huge cultural change,"" added Lee Hunt, 65, Tucson. Clinton could also run up a major gap among the state's hundreds of thousands of Native American voters.Still, there's ample reason for skepticism: Eyeing Arizona's changing demographics, Democrats for years have seen it as a swing state in the making. Yet since Bill Clinton's victory in 1996, the state hasn't been close.  That history of failure has Republicans expressing confidence that Trump will hold onto the state's 11 electoral votes. ""Clinton's hope hinges on two things happening that have never happened in Arizona: Turning out both the Latino and millennial vote in record numbers,"" said Emily Ryan, an Arizona GOP political consultant and lobbyist with Copper State Consulting Group.""I don't see it happening,"" she said. ""I think with the unpopularity of these two candidates, turnout is going to be abysmally low."" Did Trump leave an opening?Clinton's campaign is also attempting to seize on Trump's relative inattention to Arizona. He has campaigned in the state -- with a stop in Prescott two weeks ago. But Trump hasn't spent any money on television ads in Arizona. And local Republicans said his on-the-ground infrastructure can't match swing-state operations. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for a comment on its Arizona operation. Arizona's state Republican chairman, Bob Graham, has been a prominent and vocal Trump supporter. But the state's two GOP senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have both said they won't vote for him. And McCain is attempting to navigate the presidential race's crosscurrents in a tight re-election contest against Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick.GOP's stronghold: Maricopa CountyFor Republicans, Maricopa County -- which includes Phoenix, more than 4 million of Arizona's 6.7 million residents and a prominent Trump supporter in controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- is where Trump's style could pay dividends.Ryan, the GOP consultant, called Arizona ""a long-shot in a state where guys like Sheriff Arpaio are rewarded for being 'law and order' candidates."" ""And Trump, as imperfect as he is, has very much aligned himself with that type of Republican,"" she said. Many Republicans who said this year's race will be tighter than GOP blowouts like George W. Bush's 10-point cruise past John Kerry in 2004 -- but that Democrats simply don't have the numbers to win outright. In the last year, 148,000 new voters registered -- with 19,000 more Democrats than Republicans. But the GOP still enjoys an edge of 166,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats -- about the same gap that existed in 2012, when Mitt Romney defeated Barack Obama by 9 percentage points. ""Bottom line is that Arizona is a red state and there are simply not enough Democrats to win on their own,"" said Lisa James, an Arizona GOP operative. ""The independents are not known for great turnout and the Republicans who aren't fans of Trump will either quietly vote for him or not vote for either; they will not vote for her,"" James said. She said Democrats' hopes that Clinton can match the results of her husband's last appearance on the ballot -- his 1996 win in Arizona is the last time a Democrat has carried the state in a presidential contest -- are misguided. ""You had a young, energetic governor against an older, long-term federal office holder -- different generations and different backgrounds,"" James said. ""This is not that race.""

Today, she works for Donald Trump at his hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. But she's not voting for him.Trump's immigration proposals and his rhetoric on undocumented people upsets Vargas. Many of the people he derides clean his hotel rooms, she says, gesturing towards herself. ""I will vote for Ms. Hillary Clinton, and my family, too,"" says Vargas, who was 23 when she came to the United States illegally. ""She fights for keeping families together, she fights for the younger people, for Dreamers."" Workers want change at Trump VegasVargas, a guest room attendant, is one of more than 200 workers at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas that voted late last year to unionize. Trump owns the hotel with Phil Ruffin.Appeals by the hotel to the National Labor Relations Board contesting the certification of the union failed, but the hotel has yet to meet union representatives to negotiate.Speaking at the Republican National Convention in July, Ruffin said Trump's ""handshake is better than any contract you will ever write."" Jeffrey Wise, who has worked in Vegas for 30 years, is among the workers calling on Trump and Ruffin to come to the negotiating table. Wise works two jobs, one as a food server at the Trump hotel, and another similar role at a hotel with union negotiated contracts elsewhere on the strip. He says his other job pays $3 more per hour and includes benefits he doesn't receive at the Trump property.""We hear the phrase often and again and again about let's 'Make America Great Again,' let's make America what it was supposed to be,"" Wise tells CNN, ""if you want to start making America great, start from the bottom with the workers."" Neither the Trump campaign nor the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas were immediately able to comment, but when asked last month by the Las Vegas Sun on unionization at the hotel, Donald Trump Jr., citing his father's history of construction projects in New York said, ""I don't think anyone in the history of politics has done more with union labor than Donald Trump.""Trump Jr. said he was not aware of any plans for negotiations to commence but said: ""If you look at our history you'd see a history and decades of negotiation. So we'll see what happens. Everything is a case-by-case basis.""Taking on the bossThe Culinary Workers Union represents more than 50,000 workers in Nevada, and the Trump hotel is one of the very few on the Las Vegas Strip that does not have union-negotiated contracts for its workers. Just last month the union launched a campaign calling on supporters to boycott all Trump businesses, a bid to bring hotel management to the negotiating table.Vargas, Wise, and others are not afraid to take on their boss.Meeting at the union's headquarters, in a quieter part of town two miles off the Vegas Strip, they're still within view of the 64-story hotel with the trademark Trump name emblazoned across its top.""That's what the basis of being an American is all about, it's the right to speak up when you see something unjust and not done fairly and do something about it,"" Wise says of his campaign.Voting the other wayCarmen Llarul, like Vargas, is another Trump worker who isn't voting for the Republican candidate; instead she says she'll cast her ballot for Clinton.Llarul came to the US from Argentina in the early 1980s. She proudly shows a text message on her phone from her granddaughter Olivia, 20, who is on her first deployment with the US Air Force in Japan.Carmen's daughter also served in the armed forces and says Trump doesn't appreciate how much immigrants and their families contribute to American society.  ""These hands clean the rooms every single day for Mr. Trump so he can be rich,"" she says pointing to her hands. ""He should listen to us, the immigrants, the workers, because we have a lot to teach him."""	The Trump workers voting against the boss	['Vargas', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""If you don't get out and vote, this clown could be president,"" a worker told the crowd as he pointed at the building. The rally was organized by the Culinary Workers Union, which vociferously opposes Trump. The group says Trump has refused to bargain with hotel employees who voted last year to unionize.The hundred or so gathered chanted ""Dump Trump"" and ""Make America Great Again - start here!"" The trucks then handed out tacos.The union represents more than 50,000 workers in Nevada, and the Trump hotel is one of the very few on the Las Vegas Strip that does not have union-negotiated contracts for its workers.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-email-hack-what-learned/index.html	"And it turns out, they're not much different than the external ones.The Podesta emails blog Emails posted by WikiLeaks reveal a buttoned-up campaign that analyzes nearly every decision, mirroring Clinton's reputation as a methodical and tactical politician. And secret transcripts of Clinton's paid speeches behind closed doors on Wall Street have failed to turn up any positions widely different than what she says in public. WikiLeaks has been posting the hacked emails from Podesta almost daily for a little over one week. Republican nominee Donald Trump has seized on them to portray Clinton as a corrupt candidate.But the emails are dumped out of order, in some cases without context or knowledge of any other replies. Clinton's campaign has refused to weigh in on the veracity of individual email exchanges, and has accused the Russian government of orchestrating their release -- a claim WikiLeaks has denied. ""There is no getting around it: Donald Trump is cheering on a Russian attempt to influence our election through a crime reminiscent of Watergate but on a more massive scale,"" said Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin. ""It's time for Donald Trump to condemn this intrusion by the Kremlin and tell voters what did his campaign know and when did they know it.""But going through the thousands of emails between Podesta, campaign staff, donors and at rare times Clinton herself, the picture of a highly methodical campaign emerges. Email threads with top advisers debating finer points of the campaign are common.In one exchange, the campaign deliberated for about 12 hours over a single tweet, about low-wage workers' fight for a higher minimum wage. Policy advisers and communications staffers went back and forth over how to carefully word the 140-character message to be signed by Clinton herself, including whether to include the #Fightfor15 hashtag or if that would be too strong an endorsement. Staffers sent around multiple drafts of talking points and speeches on a variety of topics, and strategized about how to handle media interviews. In one instance, the campaign mulled how to respond to reports of her private email server use. In another, they closely watched former President Bill Clinton's every move on a day of campaigning to avoid unforced mistakes. In a different missive, a staffer relayed that Clinton herself was frustrated with ""poll-tested lines that don't work"" on the campaign trail. Another exchange dealt with the dicey issue of whether to allow lobbyists for foreign companies and governments to bundle for the campaign. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said he was comfortable allowing for some of them to donate and fundraise. Jennifer Palmieri replied with: ""Take the money!!""It is not uncommon for professional campaigns to be so deliberate. An academic paper studying the campaign's use of social media in 2012 found that former candidate Mitt Romney's team had up to 22 people signing off before a tweet was sent. That kind of top-down approach contrasts sharply with Trump's freewheeling, uncensored approach to Twitter, with messages sometimes coming in the middle of the night. Clinton has a reputation of being careful and guarded, at times calculating, and the emails show a campaign that runs that way.  Wall Street speechesAlso contained in the emails have been transcripts of paid speeches Clinton gave on Wall Street. While three speeches to investment heavyweight Goldman Sachs were the heart of an attack line for Bernie Sanders during the Democratic nomination fight, the release of the transcripts in the past week have been overshadowed by Clinton's opponent, Donald Trump, and the release of a hot-mic recording of Trump bragging about sexually aggressive behavior. WikiLeaks releases transcripts of Clinton Goldman Sachs speechesDuring the appearances -- which were more question-and-answer sessions with Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein than speeches -- Clinton commented on Wall Street's role in financial regulations, relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and how politics played into the decision to tighten regulations on the financial industry in 2010.While the transcripts show a blunter, less reserved Clinton, much of what the former secretary of state said to Goldman Sachs and other groups appear generally in line with some of what she has said publicly.In an October 2013 speech to the financial firm, Clinton implied that action was necessary to curb Wall Street street abuses ""for political reasons.""""There was also a need to do something because for political reasons, if you were an elected member of Congress and people in your constituency were losing jobs and shutting businesses and everybody in the press is saying it's all the fault of Wall Street, you can't sit idly by and do nothing,"" Clinton said.Clinton, on regulations also said that ""too much is bad, too little"" and argued that ""the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.""Still tight in battleground statesThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed in 2010 in response to the great recession and looked to impose tighter regulations on financial institutions. While business leaders, especially those leading the financial firms, were generally against the measure, the decision was politically popular with Democrats who blamed Wall Street for the recession.Throughout the appearances, Clinton takes a more pragmatic approach towards relegation Wall Street, a departure -- at least in tone -- from the more populist rhetoric she used during the Democratic primary. ""There should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too big to jail,"" Clinton said during the fourth Democratic debate in January.But the speeches offer no dramatic differences between what Clinton said publicly, as Sanders and other liberal Democrats suggested they might during the Democratic primary."

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump-strategy/index.html	"As Ryan becomes the latest punching bag for his party's presidential nominee, the Wisconsin Republican has made the calculation that he faces little political upside in engaging in a back-and-forth with Trump. So he has gone underground, avoiding questions at all costs about Trump and trying to focus instead on preserving congressional majorities. His strategy is an implicit recognition that the Wisconsin Republican finds himself in a lose-lose situation over his party's nominee.If he attacks Trump, he's only bound to provoke even more conservative furor, something that could come back to haunt him if he finds himself searching for votes in the new Congress to preserve his speakership. Yet if he stands by Trump, he'll be accused of backing off his decision to avoid defending the GOP nominee. So the best strategy, according to several of his allies, boils down to this: Pretend Trump doesn't exist.""Ryan is focused on what he can control -- raising funds and bringing attention and enthusiasm to our congressional races by talking about these candidates and the GOP agenda the House crafted,"" said a source familiar with Ryan's thinking.In short, Ryan is trying to avoid staying out of the drama. But there's one problem: Trump won't let up. Ryan, his friends say, is someone who doesn't like to be in a political drama -- something the speaker himself acknowledged in a private call with donors last week when discussing his feud with Trump, something he said he didn't intend to start.But Trump is keeping Ryan in the news. As Trump campaigned in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Monday evening, some Trump supporters weren't shy about their disdain for the GOP speaker, yelling anti-Ryan statements.""I don't want to be knocking Paul Ryan ... I think he could be more supportive to the Republican nominee,"" Trump told ABC News about the chanting. Asked if Ryan wants him to win in November, Trump suggests the speaker may have his eye on the White House himself, telling ABC, ""maybe not, because maybe he wants to run in four years or maybe he doesn't know how to win. Maybe just doesn't know how to win‎.""Trump, speaking to Fox News, said Monday evening that while he is trying to unite the party, ""every once in a while, Paul will stand up and say he disagrees with this or that.""Brad Courtney, chairman of the Wisconsin GOP said in a statement following Trump's rally that the party is ""incredibly proud and fully supportive of Speaker Paul Ryan and the work he does for the conservative movement here in Wisconsin and across this great nation."" Since Ryan privately told colleagues last week in a conference call that he would no longer defend Trump, the House speaker has not said anything publicly about Trump. In his first public appearance last week since making those remarks, Ryan abruptly scrapped a planned 30-minute question-and-answer session with business leaders in Brookfield, Wisconsin. The next day, anticipation was building that Ryan would answer questions about Trump with college Republicans at the University of Wisconsin. But Ryan, whose office helped pre-select the questions, wasn't asked about his party's nominee. And speaking to a friendly Wisconsin radio host later in the afternoon, he wasn't asked about Trump, either.This week, Ryan is stumping for House GOP candidates but he's saying little publicly, including at a Wednesday campaign event with vulnerable Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo where officials said the lawmakers wouldn't take questions from the media.Since last week, Trump has continued his barrage against Ryan, including calling the House speaker ""very weak and ineffective,"" berating him to focus on the budget and saying the congressman has done ""zilch"" to push back against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Ryan's response: Nothing. The mum position showcases the difficult political spot Ryan finds himself in just three weeks before Election Day -- especially as conservative voters unleash their fury at what they see as a political establishment slinging against Trump. For the last few months, Ryan touted Trump's candidacy, but pushed back at times, including over Trump's attacks on a Mexican-American judge.But in recent days, Ryan has tread even more carefully when he felt the need to push back. A spokeswoman over the weekend rebuked Trump for his claims that the election is ""rigged,"" but the speaker himself has yet to speak out.On Monday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid lashed out at Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for not doing more to push back on Trump.""When a major party's nominee riles up his supporters and repeats the lie that the election is 'rigged,' the failure of Speaker Ryan and Sen. McConnell to affirm the fairness of our democratic process and condemn Donald Trump's comments is complicity,"" the Democratic leaders said.Ryan is a precarious spot. Roughly a week after the presidential election, Ryan faces an internal vote by the House GOP conference on another term as speaker. And the blowback for his posture on Trump could factor in that secret ballot contest.  So far one House conservative, Oklahoma Rep. Jim Bridenstine, threatened to pull his support for the speaker because of his reluctance to stand up for Trump in the final stretch before the election. No other House Republican has said they will challenge Ryan for the gavel, but the landscape could change dramatically if his majority shrinks, and conservatives on the right have even more power.It's a remarkable shift from four years ago. Then-Speaker John Boehner hosted a major rally in his district in Ohio -- a key battleground state -- for Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee, and set off on a multi-day bus tour to campaign for the entire ticket.  Ryan, who was Romney's running mate, disinvited Trump from the one public event they were scheduled to do together earlier this month in his district in Wisconsin after video tapes showed the billionaire businessman making sexually aggressive and vulgar remarks about women.  Last week, Ryan didn't mention Trump's name but instead gave an entire speech focused on attacking Clinton and what he described as the threat of a progressive agenda in Washington.But his aides say the speaker wants to focus on his main mission: Preserving the House majority. Last week Ryan's office announced he raised over $15 million in the third quarter for House Republican candidates, bringing his total haul during the 2016 cycle to $48 million.  While the final presidential debate takes center stage in Las Vegas this week, Ryan will be campaigning for House candidates in Florida after a swing through Texas.
