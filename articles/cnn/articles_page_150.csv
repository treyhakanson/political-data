It's the Republican nominee's latest public reference to the 42nd president's infidelity, which he has occasionally cited in his campaign to criticize his Democratic challenger.""If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Jennifer Flowers right alongside of him!"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon.He soon deleted the original message and tweeted again with the correct spelling of Flowers' first name.Cuban quickly shot back via Twitter, mocking Trump for allegedly referring to the two of them as the ""Bobbsey Twins,"" a term referencing the long-running children's book series about wholesome siblings.""Donald. Remember when you told me on the phone we were ""Bobbsie Twins"" and I laughed ? #truestory,"" wrote Cuban.Flowers has said she is planning to come to the Monday debate, but it is unclear if the Trump campaign is planning on inviting her.While representatives of Flowers have not responded to CNN's inquiries, a tweet from her account had earlier said: ""Hi Donald. You know I'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate‎"" and she has now told some other media she is planning on attending.Representatives of the campaign did not respond to CNN's inquiries about whether Flowers would be invited following Trump's message saying ""perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside"" Mark Cuban.Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, declined to comment when asked about the tweet in Providence Forge, Virginia.Trump on Monday had told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly that if Clinton ""treats me with respect, I will treat her with respect."" His tweet Saturday came roughly an hour after The New York Times endorsed Clinton for president.Flowers, a former Arkansas state employee, said she had a 12-year sexual relationship with Bill Clinton during his 1992 presidential run. He later admitted under oath in 1998 to a sexual encounter with her.Bill Clinton's alleged sexual misconduct: Who you need to knowCuban has tried to publicly shame Trump throughout the 2016 campaign, regularly slamming the Republican nominee for not releasing his taxes. The attacks have been particularly effective, given Cuban's status as a fellow billionaire and his public persona as a similarly brash businessman.He cheered his invitation by the Clinton campaign to attend Monday's showdown.""Just got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm  @realDonaldTrump at the ""Humbling at Hofstra"" on Monday. It Is On!"" Cuban tweeted on Thursday.Why does Cuban get a front row seat? Each candidate gets several tickets to Monday's debate, which will be held at Hofstra University in New York. Debate commission co-chair Frank Fahrenkopf explained that each candidate gets to decide who sits where.Fahrenkopf told CNN's Michael Smerconish that attempts to ""impact the debate"" using the candidates' guests will not be tolerated.""We are going to frown upon -- I will tell you this right now -- whether or not a Republican or Democrat or anyone else attempts by use of tickets in placing people in a front row or not to try to impact the debate. It is wrong,"" Fahrenkopf said. ""We would frown upon Mr. Cuban being in the front row if his purpose is to somehow disrupt the debate; likewise, if Mr. Trump was going to put someone in the front row to try and impact things."" The interview aired several hours before Trump's threat to bring Flowers.'A penchant for sexism'Saturday isn't the first time Trump has referenced Bill Clinton's infidelity. He brought the former president's sex scandals into the campaign late last year around the time Hillary Clinton announced her husband would join her on the campaign trail. At the time, she had recently accused Trump of having a ""penchant for sexism"" over his charge that she had been ""schlonged"" in the 2008 primary.""Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!"" Trump tweeted in December.Trump later labeled Clinton ""one of the great women abusers of all time."""	Donald Trump threatens to bring Gennifer Flowers to debate
1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/24/politics/first-presidential-debate-expectations/index.html	"Despite such compliments, an era of good feelings isn't suddenly consuming the nasty 2016 presidential race.Instead, the expectations game is in full swing two days ahead of the first crucial debate between Clinton and Trump -- a clash that will be watched by millions around the world and could prove decisive in determining the winner in November. In the run-up to the debate, both sides are turning to the age-old practice of highlighting the strengths of their competitor in an effort to minimize the impact of their own flaws. ""The expectations game is always huge. Sometimes the expectations matter more than the debate itself,"" said Aaron Kall, editor of a new book, ""Debating the Donald,"" which dissects Trump's performance in the primary debates. The Clinton campaign is trying to shape the battlefield by pointing out that Trump will be in his element on Monday night.""For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August. How to watch the first presidential debateBy that reasoning, anything less than a thrashing for Clinton will be spun as a win.At the same time, the Trump campaign is working hard to raise the stakes for Clinton, arguing that his recently rising polls mean she needs a game changer.""Given her extensive experience debating, high level of preparation, and scripted nature, Clinton's campaign no doubt views Monday night as the best opportunity to alter the trajectory of the race,"" said Trump communications director Jason Miller in a memo this week.Miller said that Clinton had ""more debates under her belt than almost any presidential candidate in history."" Top Republican National Committee strategist Sean Spicer also weighed in, noting that ""Clinton has been at it since she's been on the debate team in high school.""And both sides are trying to get into their opponent's head. The Clinton campaign invited Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and a prominent Trump critic, to sit in the front row at the debate. Trump responded Saturday with a threat to bring Gennifer Flowers, with whom Bill Clinton admitted to having a sexual relationship decades ago, to the event.Flowers has said she is planning to come to the Monday debate, but it is unclear if the Trump campaign is planning on inviting her.While representatives of Flowers have not responded to CNN's inquiries, a tweet from her account had earlier said: ""Hi Donald. You know I'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate‎"" and she has now told some other media she is planning on attending.Charade makes no senseOf course, this quadrennial charade makes no sense. After all, why would a campaign all but suggest that a hated foe is almost certain to wipe the floor with their candidate before a national television audience?What is really going on in this period of embellishment is an effort to shape the media coverage of a debate -- often as important in deciding how a showdown shapes the campaign as what the candidates say. If a candidate is predicted to struggle in a debate but ultimately vaults over the low bar, surrogates and analysts will proclaim an upset win. Days of coded warnings are also used to put moderators on notice that their questions, cross examinations and comments will be parsed mercilessly for bias and that they will become the story if they don't play ball.Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters this week that the campaign's biggest worry is whether expectations for Trump are so low that he can't help but exceed them.""I think that my biggest concern is ... that people accommodate their questions to suit the candidate in front of them and that is what has happened to Trump in the past,"" she said.Palmieri's comments were a veiled warning to the moderator of the first debate, Lester Holt, that he must hold Clinton and Trump accountable to the same standards of questioning. Holt's NBC colleague, Matt Lauer, was slammed by Clinton supporters who thought he gave Trump an easier ride than the former secretary of state at a forum earlier this month.Trump watching highlight reels of Clinton to prep for debateTrump has argued Democratic complaints about Lauer were meant as a warning to Holt.""In trying to hit Matt, they are trying to game the system, game the ref,"" Trump said in North Carolina this week.""But I think Lester will be very fair,"" Trump said. ""But a lot of people will be watching to see if that is true.""History of debate gamesDebate games have a long history in politics. In 2000, for instance, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign pulled off a similar trick to the one Trump's team is trying now. They painted Vice President Al Gore as a debater of such skill that he would almost certainly bury the Republican in their first debate.Bush aide Karen Hughes described Gore as ""one of the most polished debaters in American politics.""Her colleague, Karl Rove, praised Gore as the ""world's most pre-eminent debater, a man who is more proficient at hand-to-hand debate combat than anybody the world has ever seen.""It's true that Gore had excelled in debates before, taking on tycoon Ross Perot in a CNN debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement and more than holding his own against GOP vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp in 1996.The media bought into the idea that Gore was a rhetorical giant and Bush was a oratorical pygmy. The New York Times story previewing the Bush-Gore clash described the sitting vice president as ""one of the most artful and combative debaters in modern history.""Gore's failure to meet that bar severely wounded his campaign.""People were expecting Bush to come in an stumble around and embarrass himself and for Gore to crush him,"" said Kall. ""Gore probably won the first debate and all of the debates. But because of the expectations game, Bush was seen as the winner.""By avoiding disaster, Bush met the test of being sufficiently presidential.""We clearly lost the expectations game,"" senior Gore aide Carter Eskew told author Alan Schroeder for his book, ""Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail.""""I'm not sure we could have won it,"" Eskew said. ""The bar was set very low for Bush. Let's face it, he jumped over it.""Mark Cuban to take his trolling of Trump to the front row of Monday's debateThe Bush team, flushed by their success, cranked up the spin again ahead of Bush's debate with John Kerry four years later. Bush pollster Matthew Dowd told journalists the Massachusetts senator was ""the best debater since Cicero,"" referring to the Roman philosopher and orator.His comment, a classic of the expectations setting genre, might also have been a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the absurdity of pre-debate spin. But it hit the mark, framing Kerry as the favorite -- even though Bush arrived at the debate with all the trappings of the presidency. Bush didn't sustain serious political damage during the debate and went on to win the election, partly as a result of his team's savvy spin operation.Clinton's task on Monday will be to stop Trump's spinners from pulling off a similar coup.

The group, Future 45, is aiming to raise $25 million, but it is unknown how much of their money will be spent outside of anti-Clinton spots in Senate battleground states -- an intentional move to boost down-ballot Republicans.""A secretive, paranoid politician who destroyed 30,000 pieces of evidence,"" says the narrator, referring to Clinton's lost emails as secretary of state. Shadowed figures appear on the screen as Clinton's scandals are rattled off. Nixon and Clinton's images appear side-by-side.""At least Nixon was right about one thing,"" says the narrator as the spot concludes.""People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook,"" Nixon then says.The PAC did not immediately respond to questions about whether the ad will run on television or digital. But CNN reported Thursday that the group plans to run television ads in six states with competitive Senate races: Florida, Nevada, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Iowa.The super PAC, envisioned to be a leading presidential spender on the Republican side, gradually grew dormant earlier this year after Trump won the nomination. But the Ricketts and Adelson families -- seeing a path to the Senate majority for Republicans if Trump can remain competitive -- just this week chose to pony up for their own group; the Ricketts family has dedicated $1 million, and the Adelsons are expected to give at least $5 million to Ricketts political organizations.The Guardian reported Friday that Adelson would eventually give up to $25 million to the group."

But the documents -- a summary of which had already been released in the overall FBI report -- provide little in the way of major bombshells.Politically, however, Friday's release helps keep the issue relevant before the debate. The release also comes hours after news that top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills had obtained a limited immunity deal from the FBI in order to cooperate with its investigation.In one exchange, an unidentified interviewee details alleged efforts by a top State Department official, Patrick Kennedy, to argue during the release of the Clinton emails for classifications that would protect her. But Kennedy, in his own interview, denied the charge.Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, in her interview, explained how they had to update email addresses with the White House so Clinton could email President Barack Obama because the President could only receive emails from approved addresses. If her email was not on an approved list, which was managed by the President's staff, the White House server would reject it. When Abedin was shown a 2012 email exchange, she did not recognize the pseudonym -- when agents explained it was Obama, she replied, ""How is this not classified?""There is no evidence Obama knew that Clinton was using a private email server at the time. He has said he only found out about her use of it when it became public. Many of those who communicated with Clinton have told the FBI they didn't realize she was using a private server, and often one may not realize what email address is behind a name unless one clicks on it.Agents also interviewed ""Guccifer"" -- the hacker who targeted the Bush family -- who detailed his successful infiltration of close Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal's email account and reviewed 30,000 emails and downloaded 25 attachments. Guccifer also detailed taking a screenshot of one Blumenthal exchange regarding the Benghazi attacks.FBI releases Hillary Clinton email reportIn other interviews released Friday evening, Clinton aides seemed generally unconcerned about her use of a private email server and said she adhered to standard security measures -- arguments they have made extensively in public. But one IT worker took a somewhat cavalier attitude, joking in one interview that a new 60-day retention policy was a ""Hillary coverup operation"" -- which sparked the Trump campaign's anger.""The fact an IT staffer maintaining Clinton's secret server called a new retention policy designed to delete emails after 60 days a 'Hillary coverup operation' suggests there was a concerted effort to systematically destroy potentially incriminating information,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. ""It's no wonder that at least five individuals tied to the email scandal, including Clinton's top State Department aide and attorney Cheryl Mills, secured immunity deals from the Obama Justice Department to avoid prosecution."" The latest revelations in the Clinton email scandal are certain to play a central role in Trump's line of attack Monday, when the two meet for their first presidential debate in New York. Trump has built his ""Crooked Hillary"" line of insults off arguments stemming from her emails.The additional notes were released three weeks after the FBI released its report from its investigation of Clinton and her emails, as well as the notes from Clinton's own high-profile interview with federal agents. Clinton, in her interview, said she did not know about key records retention policies and whether she was violating rules. But on the trail, her campaign and supporters have routinely said she did not break any laws with her email handling.No criminal chargesFBI Director James Comey in July took the unprecedented step of announcing in a press conference the FBI's conclusion that there was not enough evidence to merit a criminal prosecution, before handing over his findings to the Justice Department.The DOJ followed that recommendation and decided no prosecution was merited.After Comey testified about the decision before Congress, members requested access to his agency's report. Last month, the bureau gave members of Congress access to the notes, as well as notes from interviews with other Clinton staff and aides, but kept that version of the report classified.Comey testified that no transcript of the interview exists, only the notes taken on it. Clinton was not under oath."	FBI releases notes from Clinton email investigation

He now says that increase is in ""violent crimes.""Since Trump does not say what he considers violent crimes, it is difficult to check his figures. A yearly survey conducted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault and non-fatal shootings increased by about 2% in 65 major jurisdictions. (The chiefs' association list includes large counties such as Los Angeles County and Prince Georges County, Maryland -- outside Washington -- as well as cities such as Pittsburgh, Newark, New Jersey, and Cincinnati that are not among the nation's 50 largest.)But if Trump's claim is that the number of homicides in 2015 was 17% larger than the number of murders in 2014, he is closer to the mark. The major chiefs association survey showed that murders did increase by nearly 16% among its members. And a survey of the country's 30 largest cities done by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice indicated an increase in homicides of 14%.But these numbers do not represent an across-the-board increase in homicides for major jurisdictions, nor that an unprecedented wave of killings is hitting virtually all big cities. In fact, only three cities -- Baltimore, Chicago and Washington -- account for more than half of the national increase in murders, according to the Brennan Center survey. If you take those three cities out of the equation, the number of murders only jumped by about 7% in the nation's largest cities.  ""I think Trump's figure is more misleading than inaccurate,"" said Inimai M. Chettiar, the director of the Justice Program at the Brennan Center.Verdict: True, but misleading."

Here are some of the more notable -- and inflammatory -- salvos the two exchanged while on the campaign trail. 'Lyin' Ted'The attack Trump most frequently deployed against Cruz was the nickname the real estate mogul turned politician used to describe his competition: ""Lyin' Ted."" Trump routinely dropped that moniker on Cruz.Candidates' spouses take the heatIn an election season defined by vicious and often personal attacks, not even the candidates' wives were safe, evidenced by Trump's tweet about Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz. The March spat came after a Facebook advertisement targeted to Mormons showed an old photo of Trump's wife, Melania, posing nude. The ad, however, was produced by an anti-Trump super PAC, which had no known connection to the Cruz campaign.Trump, however, didn't see a difference.""Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!"" Trump tweeted in March. As for Heidi's ""beans,"" Trump never spilled them, much less described what he was referring to.'A sniveling coward'Cruz's irate response was predictable -- even if his choice of words was not.""Donald, you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone,"" Cruz told reporters in Wisconsin, pointing his finger at the cameras for emphasis.Trump links Cruz's father to Lee Harvey Oswald Heidi was not the only Cruz family member to be called out by Trump.""(Ted Cruz's) father, you know, was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's, you know, being shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous,"" Trump said in an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" the day of the Indiana primary in May. ""I mean what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald, shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It's horrible."" No other news outlets corroborated the claim that Rafael Cruz knew of the John F. Kennedy assassin.'A pathological liar'During a May press conference, Cruz's attacks against Trump hit a new level when he called Trump a ""pathological liar,"" ""utterly amoral,"" ""a narcissist at a level I don't this country's ever seen"" and ""a serial philanderer."" The strong rhetoric came after the accusations Trump made about Cruz's father and shortly before the crucial Indiana primary contest -- which Cruz lost, ending his candidacy.Cruz's lack of endorsement at the RNCCruz showed the hard feelings hadn't subsided two months later at the Republican National Convention, when he blatantly undercut Trump with a lack of endorsement during his turn at the lectern. Cruz personally told Trump he would not be offering him an endorsement during his speech, instead encouraging voters to ""vote your conscience"" -- earning boos from an audience hoping for party unity.Trump didn't want Cruz's endorsement, anywayAsked about the snub, Trump said he didn't want it, anyway.""If he gives it, I will not accept it,"" Trump said at a news conference at the end of the convention. A new Canadian prime minister?In January, Trump tweeted a fallback plan for Cruz in case his presidential dreams fell short, suggesting Cruz could be the Canadian prime minister, a jab at questions over Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his Canadian birthplace. 'Pathetic' Kasich and Cruz band togetherWhen Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- a pair Trump once called ""the leftovers"" as they were his last challengers in the primary fight -- made an attempt to divide the map to stop Trump, the mogul didn't mince words about his view of the maneuver.""Actually I was happy, because it shows how weak they are, it shows how pathetic they are,"" Trump said.Trump accuses Cruz of stealing the Iowa caucusesAfter Cruz came out victorious during the Iowa caucuses, Trump accused Cruz of committing fraud and stealing the win. ""Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified,"" Trump tweeted in February. ""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Trump also tweeted. The accusations came after Cruz sent out deceitful mailers that shared voter's caucus attendance records with their neighbors and warned them of ""VOTER VIOLATION."""

I wanted to do it too -- I love the Star Spangled Banner -- but I didn't think I had the right because I was not an American.When I shared this with my husband, feeling silly as I got emotional, he told me something wonderful -- that it was absolutely OK for me to do this if I wanted to. ""There's no rule that says you can't. All it means is that you love this country,"" he said.MENSAH KODUAH, 54, is from Ghana. He drives a taxi and has lived in the United States for 20 years. Pamela Aquino, 28, was born in the Dominican Republic and immigrated here when she was a little girl. Chandra and Amara Nandikolla are from India and live in the Bronx -- he is a software engineer at a bank and she is a physician in training.Together, we were among the 296 immigrants from 53 countries who became American citizens on Ellis Island last Friday.As I recited the Oath of Allegiance with my right hand raised in the air, the historical significance of where I stood was overwhelming. An estimated 12 million immigrants came to America through this gateway -- some of the benches we were sitting on were used by the immigrants who came to New York harbor on ships.I owe my new citizenship to at least several of those people. One of my husband's great-grandmothers,  Brana Frimet, sailed to Ellis Island from Antwerp in the 1920s. (Some of his other relatives have been harder to track down because we believe their Yiddish names were at some point Anglicized.)The process of becoming a citizen can feel complex, time-consuming and expensive for many immigrants. For me, it has also coincided with a wild presidential election -- one that I have covered for the last 16 months as a political reporter for CNN. Despite the arduous process, there has been an uptick this year in people applying for US citizenship, and immigration experts say many are motivated by the desire to vote in November. And so I found myself the subject of one of the most hotly debated political issues this cycle: immigration. I vividly remember an exchange I had at a Trump campaign rally in Iowa last fall. I approached a man and asked who he was voting for, and he responded that he was leaning toward Trump because he was tired of the ""new Americans"" coming into the country.""The people that are coming in here from China, Indonesia and all of them countries, they're getting pregnant and coming here and having babies,"" the man told me. ""They get everything and the people that were born here can't get everything."" He said he didn't mean to offend me.THE MAN at that Trump rally was right: I am a ""new American."" In fact, I am the first person in my family to become an US citizen.But he was wrong if he assumed that my family had somehow tried to game the system.  Like most Koreans of their generation, my parents grew up poor after the Korean War. My father fiercely believed as a young man that the United States was the greatest country on earth. After my brother and I were born, he became obsessed with finding a way to give us an American education. When he saw a professional opening in Hong Kong, he jumped on the opportunity, moving my family away from Korea when I was seven. My brother and I enrolled in an American school, where we learned English and adapted to our new surroundings. We had privileged childhoods.I decided to move to the U.S. to attend boarding school in 11th grade. I never left, and painfully, that means I haven't lived in the same country as my parents in 13 years.Although most people assume that I am American, I've faced constant reminders that I am not from here.Sometimes it's trivial things like not knowing certain cultural references or English idioms (my colleagues recently taught me the meaning of ""worth dying on a hill,"" and I fully intend to overuse it.)At other times, it's feeling left out or lonely. I hate that I am 29 and I've never voted. I envy people who are called for jury duty, and it's gotten harder as I've gotten older to be so far away from my parents. I've also experienced outright rejection: After graduating from Georgetown, I was offered an entry-level job in journalism, but when the employer found out I was on a visa, they took back the offer. I was devastated. Covering this election has at times exacerbated this nagging feeling that I don't fully belong. The campaign has taken me to towns and neighborhoods where I felt certain that I was the only non-white person, and where the first question I am most often asked is where I am from. When a stranger yells at me: ""Konichiwa"" or ""Ni hao,"" I never know how to respond.Meeting my husband has made me both more Korean and more American.He is so interested in my Korean heritage and constantly reminds me that the further away I am from my family, the more important it is for me to embrace my roots. He is delighted to answer my never-ending questions about U.S. history and culture. Long before the citizenship ceremony, he started to call me his ""American girl"" -- he said I couldn't be more patriotic.AS I'VE TRAVELED the country during this election, I've encountered countless voters who are turned off and uninspired. That's not surprising: polls show that either Trump and Clinton would assume the presidency with historically high unpopularity ratings.But if so much of the national coverage has focused on the negativity, insults and controversies, there is also the less told story of immigrants inspired by this election. They include long-time permanent residents who are applying for citizenship so that they can vote in a US election for the first time.Koduah, the taxi driver from Ghana I met on Ellis Island last week, told me this year's election is what persuaded him to finally apply for citizenship.""I want to be part of the American fabric,"" Koduah said. At first, he said he preferred not to share who he was voting for. But as we continued to chat, Koduah smiled widely and blurted out: ""By the way -- I'll vote for Hillary.""The Nandikollas, the couple from India, told me they will be casting their first ballots for different nominees.Chandra said he will vote for Trump because he believes the Republican nominee is a ""very strong"" leader. His wife, Amara, joked that she didn't want to get into an argument. But on a more serious note, she said she has been taken aback by Trump's rhetoric about immigrants and will support Clinton because she feels the Democratic nominee is more capable than Trump. But Nandikollas said they felt the same way about becoming an American.""I'm so grateful to this country,"" Chandra said. ""Now I want to give it back to this country.""According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, more than 38,000 people became naturalized citizens last week. Immigration experts say they've seen an increase in citizenship applications this year compared to 2015. While that is not an unusual phenomenon in an election year, according to USCIS data analyzed by the National Immigration Forum, applications are up about 8.4% in 2016 compared to 2012. Ali Noorani, the group's executive director, said they have found that the overwhelming majority of eligible green card holders decide to apply for citizenship once they are educated about the benefits of becoming a citizen.""We found that to be a function of two things: they wanted to make sure that their voices were heard at the ballot box this year and second, they understood there are certain privileges and protections that came with U.S. citizenship,"" Noorani said. ""Access to better jobs, being able to travel freely -- those are frankly nuts and bolts opportunities that U.S. citizens take for granted.""LAST FRIDAY was one of the most joyous days of my life.Inside the main hall on Ellis Island, a woman sang the national anthem and I proudly placed my hand over my heart.  After I recited the Oath of Allegiance, these were the first words I heard as an American citizen from Robert Katzmann, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. ""My fellow citizens. How good it is to say that,"" Katzmann told us. ""Our country, this great country, is even stronger, even greater than it was moments ago, because you are now citizens."""

""She is a slob."" The ad, entitled ""Mirrors,"" also features Trump saying ""A person who is flat chested is very hard to be a 10"" -- a comment he made about actress Nicollette Sheridan -- and ""Does she have a good body, no? Does she have a fat (expletive)? Absolutely."" -- a comment he made about Kim Kardashian in 2013.While these comments are playing, the ad features a diverse group of young women looking in the mirror, appearing to evaluate themselves as Trump's voice makes demeaning comments.The end of the ad features a black slate with this question: ""Is this the president we want for our daughters?""The ad will air Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and on national cable, according to a campaign release. The release did not say how much money was being spent on the ad.Throughout her campaign, Clinton has argued that Trump would be ill-equipped president to handle issues that matter to women and girls.""Anyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood and wipe out safe, legal abortion has no idea what's best for women,"" Clinton said in June. ""And after all, this is a man who has called women 'pigs,' 'dogs,' and 'disgusting animals.' Kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights.""Clinton's new ad is the latest that goes after Trump's character and mimics an ad Priorities USA, her top-dollar super PAC, released in May that similarly questioned a comment Trump made about respecting women."

""It's great for all Americans when you go look at from the beginning of slavery in America to where we are today.""""All Americans get to see the progress and contributions that African Americans made to this great country of ours,"" he added.President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are scheduled to attend Saturday's opening ceremony where the President will give remarks.

Terence Crutcher was shot and killed last week in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.Meanwhile, multiple police officers and citizens have been injured in Charlotte, North Carolina, this week during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer. Police say Scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family claims that he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him.RELATED: Tulsa police officer charged with manslaughterMeeks told Camerota about wanting Congress to pass laws providing more federal funding to train local law enforcement how to deescalate tense situations with citizens.""There are various bills that have already been written that we need to talk about. We need to have hearings on them and then vote them on the floor,"" Meeks said. ""For example, we have to fund more body cameras. Because what we know is when you have a visual view of what's going on, it helps transparency. Because an issue in a lot of cases is 'Is this a matter of transparency?'""Meeks was also part of a delegation that marched to the Department of Justice Thursday to present Attorney General Loretta Lynch with a letter demanding an investigation into the shootings. ""We need the Attorney General to act. We need her to act now,"" he said Thursday at a news conference. ""And the members of the Congressional Black Caucus are not going to sit back and do nothing we're going to make sure we're going to push for legislation."""	"Rep.
