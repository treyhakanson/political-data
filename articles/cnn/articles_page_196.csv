The spots, sponsored by the ""Institute for Law and Society,"" accused the Mohawk tribe of being involved in drug smuggling, money laundering and trafficking illegal immigrants.The ads ended with the narrator saying, ""Are these the kinds of neighbors we want?""The group was a fake institute, ultimately tied to Trump. Trump and Stone paid the largest fine levied by New York lobbying regulators at that time, while never admitting guilt. In other cases during the 1980s, Trump gave loan and set up subsidiaries which skirted campaign finance limits.  In testimony to the New York State Commission on Government Integrity in 1988, Trump said he did not see anything wrong with it because he assumed others understood what he was doing and that it was what his lawyers suggested. But since taking to the campaign trail, Trump has taken a very different tone, saying that he was buying politicians at the time with his many donations and saying that proved politics was corrupt.""I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me,"" Trump said at a Republican debate last August hosted by Fox News.During a rally in Iowa earlier this year, Trump said he had to give big donations so that politicians would do what he wanted.""I've given to Democrats, I've given to Hillary, I've given to everybody because that was my job. I gotta give to them, because when I want something I get it. When I call, they kiss my ass. It's true,"" Trump said. The Trump campaign did not comment specifically on the prior violations, or whether Trump stood by his previous comments that he routinely bought politicians.But Trump aides pointed to a string of articles showing that Trump was never accused of wrongdoing by the New York ethics panel in 1988 and did not admit any wrongdoing after paying the fine in the Mohawk tribe case.Questions about Trump's political giving rocketed to the spotlight this week after he was fined $2,500 for donating to Bondi through his charitable foundation while Bondi's office was deciding whether to investigate Trump University. Hillary Clinton, who has been under fire over questions of whether donors to her family's foundation were given special access, blasted Trump during a talk with reporters Tuesday. Both Trump and Bondi have denied any wrongdoing. Bondi, in an interview with Fox Business News Tuesday, was defiant, saying she wouldn't be ""bullied"" by Clinton. But Democrats have used the fine as an opening to go at Trump with just two weeks until the election. Democratic groups supporting Clinton have been blasting out stories about Trump and Bondi and a New York Times review of Trump's previous campaign violations. The Federal Election Commission included Trump's violation of a $25,000 limit in the 1988 elections in a case study of its worse violations, ""Selected List of Cases."" A lawyer for Trump said that he had given $47,000 -- well in excess of the limit -- and then failed when he attempted to correct the mistake by asking for the donations back.He was fined $15,000 for the violation. (Trump aides pointed to Trump comments from 1993 where he said he would have fought the fine, but paying the money was easier.)At least one expert said that Trump's violations may not be the worst ever recorded (the FEC also lists serious violations by President Barack Obama's campaign, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm and others) but Trump's violations do stick out. ""Campaign violations are not routine in the sense that it's not true that every candidate or every giver commits a violation. But they do happen,"" said Larry Noble, a veteran government ethics lawyer and former counsel to the FEC. ""Some of them are routine, or of a traffic ticket nature, others are more serious.""In the same decade, Trump was called before a New York state commission investigating public corruption and campaign donations to discuss donations he made to Andrew Stein, who was running for New York City Council president at the time. Trump testified that he gave a $50,000 loan to Stein in 1985, but ultimately repaid his own loan after Stein did not immediately repay. New York rules capped total donations by an individual at $50,000.""I was under the impression I was getting my money back,"" Trump told the ethics commission at the time, according to a New York Times report.Later in his testimony, Trump detailed how he gave another $50,000 to Stein using 18 different subsidiaries which avoided donation limits. He told the ethics panel that he expected everyone knew the subsidiaries were really him and that he did it that way because it was what his lawyers advised, according to a separate New York Newsday account of his testimony from 1988.

Peña Nieto was widely criticized for Trump's visit, which two sources told CNN was orchestrated by Videgaray.In announcing Videgaray's departure, Peña Nieto praised him but did not explain why he was leaving.On Thursday afternoon, Trump expressed regret over the cabinet shake-up.""Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto,"" Trump tweeted. ""With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted."" Trump's spontaneous trip to Mexico last week gave him an opportunity to be seen with a world leader in Peña Nieto, but it was ultimately overshadowed by public disputes over what was addressed in the meeting. The Republican nominee has vowed repeatedly to build a wall on the southwestern US border -- and to make Mexico pay for it -- but he claimed that he and Peña Nieto ""didn't discuss payment of the wall."" Peña Nieto later tweeted that he ""made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall"" at the outset of his conversation with Trump.

When asked by Lauer if that meant the ""only fix is to take women out of the military,"" Trump said: ""No, not to kick them out."" ""But something has to happen,"" he said. ""Right now part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted.

I, at the same time, want to keep the court system within the military. I don't think it should be outside of the military,"" Trump said.There is an existing military court system, with judges, prosecutors and courts martial, but lawmakers have sought to change the current system to better address sexual assault."

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/paul-ryan-fundraising-republican-senators/index.html	"When he reluctantly took the job last fall, Ryan publicly stated he wasn't willing to do the extensive travel and fundraising typical of most speakers because it would eat into his time to be with his young family. Despite that vow, he has spent much of his time both in Washington and during congressional breaks hitting up donors and campaigning for House Republican colleagues and candidates and has broken fundraising records. But the speaker, who got his start in politics as a Senate aide, wants Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the reins of the upper chamber regardless of who wins the White House and is spending considerable time and resources to help him out.Ryan mentioned his efforts at his weekly press conference on Thursday, revealing plans for events with Senate candidates competing in two major battlegrounds in Indiana and Ohio. ""I'm doing a thing with Todd Young pretty soon and I think Rob Portman soon after that,"" Ryan said.Democrats need to pick up 30 seats to regain control of the House, but they can win back a Senate majority if they gain four more seats should Hillary Clinton win the White House, and five if Donald Trump posts a victory.The speaker's political committees, falling under the umbrella ""Team Ryan"" -- which includes Ryan for Congress and Prosperity Action PAC -- spent more than $100,000 in donations to 13 Senate campaigns, giving the maximum amount allowed under federal election rules.  He has given money to those in swing states such as Portman in Ohio, Richard Burr in North Carolina and Marco Rubio in Florida. He's also contributed to Mark Kirk, who is competing in Illinois, a solidly blue state, and to Rand Paul, who is running for re-election in reliably red Kentucky.Some of these candidates are current or former House members who Ryan knows well and are eager to tap him and his successful network with GOP donors.  Last month, the speaker transferred $2.7 million to the House GOP campaign arm, bringing a total of nearly $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee since he took the gavel last October, according to a Ryan political aide. That breaks the record of former Speaker John Boehner, who raised more than $20 million four years ago. One of the most endangered Senate Republicans, Ron Johnson, is from Ryan's home state of Wisconsin. Ryan has already campaigned with him extensively and appeared with him at fundraisers. As the state's highest-profile and senior GOP leader, he's authored direct mail and digital appeals for Johnson and is hosting an event in Washington for him next week. Earlier this year, Ryan transferred half a million dollars from his own campaign account to the state GOP to build out a ground game to help Johnson and other GOP candidates in the state, and last week, he sent another $250,000. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey is Ryan's old roommate when he served in the House, so he has a special line into the GOP leader. Trump is trailing in most polls in the Keystone State and Ryan is likely to travel there later this fall. In addition to sending campaign cash, Ryan has been featured in some mail pieces in support of Toomey and invited the senator to some events he's hosted for the NRCC in the state. Ryan got to know Indiana GOP Rep. Todd Young, who is hoping to win the seat of retiring Sen. Dan Coats, serving on the House Ways and Means Committee. Later this month, Ryan will travel to Indiana to help Young raise money for his battle against former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh, who currently holds a healthy lead in the contest.Ryan hit roughly 17 events during the month of August for House candidates, but where he could also put in some time for those competing in competitive Senate races.At one August event in Nevada, he raised $415,000 in one hour, money that went to Rep. Joe Heck, a current House member who is running to replace retiring Sen. Harry Reid, along with House GOP candidates in the state, according to Zack Roday, Team Ryan's spokesman.For those places he hasn't traveled, the speaker has sent checks and used social media to promote GOP Senate candidates. Last month, he tweeted his support for Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain ahead of his primary and sent an email urging voters in the state to back him.Usually, it's the candidate at the top of the ticket that helps or hurts congressional candidates. But Ryan made the case that his work on behalf of GOP colleagues around the country will actually translate into votes for Trump, saying on Thursday about his fall campaign plans, ""by the way, helping preserve the House majority helps our ticket up and down. It helps our nominee all the way around."""	Senate Republicans lean on Paul Ryan to keep majority

But, he added, the decentralized nature of how elections are carried out, as well as ""clunky"" systems that states use to tabulate votes, would make a hacking of the election very hard to accomplish.The concerns of election tampering follow cyberintrusions into voter databases in two states by foreign actors last week. In Illinois in July, hackers accessed a database for the Illinois Board of Elections, compromising up to 200,000 personal voter records, according to Ken Menzel, general counsel for the board.In Arizona, officials had to take the statewide voting registration system offline in late May after the FBI alerted the Arizona Department of Administration that there was a credible cyberthreat to the voter registration system, according to Matthew Roberts, director of communications for the Arizona secretary of state.Hillary Clinton: Timing of Russian hack aimed at helping TrumpInvestigators believe the hackers in both cases are likely based overseas, according to a law enforcement official.

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/poll-north-carolina-trump-leads-clinton/index.html	A survey from Quinnipiac University found Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by five points in Pennsylvania and four points in North Carolina, differing from an earlier poll released from the Tar Heel State showing Trump with a slim lead. That poll, from Suffolk University, also found nearly half of the state's voters think the Democrat will win the presidency. According to Quinnipiac, Trump also holds a four-point edge in Ohio, and he is tied with Clinton at 43% in Florida, according to the poll. With Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson included, neither Clinton nor Trump eclipsed 45% in any of the four battleground states. Suffolk found Trump with the support of 44% of likely North Carolina voters, a statistically insignificant three points better than Clinton's 41%. Johnson claimed only about 4% in the poll, though the most recent CNN/ORC national poll has his support pegged at 7%. The Quinnipiac survey found Johnson with the support of 15% of North Carolina voters, higher than what most polling in the state has shown. According to Suffolk, 41% of North Carolina voters said they have a favorable opinion of Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, while 49% said they have an unfavorable opinion. Only 37% of North Carolina voters said they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, while a majority -- 55% -- said they have an unfavorable opinion.But when asked who is most likely to be elected president, 49% of the poll's respondents gave the nod to the former secretary of state. Only 33% said Trump will win. Clinton's post-convention bump has dwindled as of late, with national polls showing an increasingly tight race. A CNN/ORC poll this week found Trump near even with Clinton among likely voters nationwide. But Clinton maintains an Electoral College firewall that appears to be far more resilient than Trump's, according to state polling. North Carolina, which 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney won four years ago and has been carried by Republicans in eight out of the last 10 presidential elections, appears to be a virtual tossup at this point. A CBS News poll released last weekend found Clinton leading Trump by four in the state. The Suffolk University poll was conducted September 5-7 using phone interviews with 500 likely North Carolina voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted August 29-September 7 using phone interviews with 761 likely voters in Florida, 751 likely voters in North Carolina, 775 likely voters in Ohio and 778 likely voters in Pennsylvania. The margin of error is 3.6 percent in Florida, 3.6 in North Carolina, 3.5 percent in Ohio and 3.5 percent in Pennsylvania.This story has been updated.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/transgender-bathroom-issues-gavin-grimm/index.html	"""People expect me to say that using the boys' bathroom was super magical and just the best time of my life,"" Grimm said in a recent interview with CNN. ""But I was just using the bathroom,"" he said, ""I went in and left."" What was important for Grimm is that using the boy's room felt natural to him. And what the Virginia high school student can't understand is the uproar it has caused across the country. School districts that dealt with the issue for years under the radar on a case by case basis are now trying to balance rules concerning transgender bathroom access with the privacy concerns of critics.  ""I'm nothing particularly threatening or extraordinary, I'm just another 17-year-old kid"" Grimm said. ""I have 17-year-old fears and worries and I have 17-year-old motivations, which is just to get out of high school and have fun with my friends and family. There's just nothing about me that is predatory or dangerous, or warrants the kind of response I got from the community,"" he said. Before the community got involved, Grimm and his mother visited Gloucester High School in 2014 to tell officials that although his birth certificate recorded him as a female, he had transitioned to be male and legally changed his name. The school allowed him to use the boys' bathroom until a community member spoke up and launched two heated meetings that Grimm attended. ""I felt very small in there, because I knew the majority of individuals who were in there were not very positive towards me,"" he said.  Grimm believes it is based on a misunderstanding about who transgender people are, because most people don't have to think twice about their gender identity.Transgender people, Grimm says, ""have a gender identity which is not consistent with our biological reality.""  It's called gender dysphoria, or as Grimm explains it, the feeling that your body does not match what your brain feels. Grimm emphasizes that a person with the condition can't simply be trained to feel differently. ""It's intrinsic to who they are as a person,"" he said. The case drew national attention of groups including the Alliance Defending Freedom, a non-profit legal organization based in Arizona that advocates for religious freedom. Lawyers for the group sent a letter to the Gloucester County School Board, noting that only a ""minuscule percentage"" of individuals identify as transgender and that it was necessary for the school board to protect ""other students' privacy and free exercise rights"" as well as ""parents' right to educate their children."" After the community meetings, the school barred Grimm from the boys' room but offered him an accommodation.Under the new policy, Grimm could use the bathroom in the nurse's office, or newly constructed single stall bathrooms.Grimm -- the only student mandated to use the single stall bathrooms -- thought the so called accommodation was unacceptable.""I'm not unisex,"" he said. His lawyers filed a lawsuit. A federal appeals court ruled in Grimm's favor deferring to guidance put out by the Obama administration concerning Title IX, a federal law that bans sex discrimination in schools. That guidance interprets ""sex discrimination"" to include claims based on gender identity. Grimm thought that when the school year began this fall, his senior year, he would be able to return to the boys' bathroom. He believes that his critics conflate an argument with indecency with the issue of bathroom use for transgender people. ""You don't see other people's genitals in the bathroom unless you're looking, which is inappropriate in and of itself,"" he said, ""If an individual was to behave incorrectly in the bathroom, their crime would be misconduct in a bathroom, it would not be existing while transgender.""  ""The bottom line is I'm a boy like anybody else,"" he said. ""I'm not a freak -- my very existence is not a perversion. I'm just a person who is trying to live his life like anybody else, and that I have to think about my bathroom usage is unacceptable.""   This summer, the Supreme Court dealt Grimm a setback, granting a request from Gloucester Board to put a temporary hold on the appeals court ruling while the justices consider an appeal. If the high court takes up the case, it will be its first case concerning transgender identity. Kyl Duncan, a lawyer for the school board, argued in briefs submitted to the Supreme Court that the lower court was wrong to defer to the Obama administration's guidance. Duncan acknowledged that some believe that transgender restroom access could be ""one of the great civil-rights issues of our time,"" but he said the administration had overstepped its bounds. The justices could grant the case, or wait and allow the issue to further percolate in courts across the country. Grimm said he wasn't exactly blindsided by the Supreme Court's temporary stay, but he was deeply disappointed. He said, for the brief period when he was able to use the boys' bathroom he never felt push back from his peers who he said respected his gender identity, his name and his preferred pronouns. ""For me and my friends, it's a non-issue. I'm Gavin and that's as far as the situation goes. We talk about video games, we talk about what we want to do that day,"" he said.   The bathroom controversy ""has extended throughout my entire high school experience almost, and it's one that I'd just like to finish so that I can think about high school things -- I can think about being a senior and graduating and going to college,"" he said.  ""It's unfortunate that my thoughts instead are when will I actually be able to use the bathroom at my high school."""	Meet Gavin Grimm, the transgender student at the center of bathroom debate

""About?"" Johnson said.""Aleppo,"" Barnicle responded.Johnson paused and said: ""And what is Aleppo?""""You're kidding ..."" the incredulous Barnicle answered. ""No,"" Johnson said. ""Aleppo is in Syria -- it's the epicenter of the refugee crisis,"" Barnicle said.""OK. Got it. With regard to Syria, I do think it is a mess,"" the Libertarian nominee said.   Johnson pivoted to arguing against military interventions in foreign countries, and said that the refugee crisis ""is the result of regime change that we end up supporting, and, inevitably, these regimes have led to a less safe world."" He also suggested that the US should ""join hands with Russia"" to bring an end to the conflict in Syria. Host Joe Scarborough, though, pressed Johnson on his confusion about Aleppo. ""Aleppo is the center of a lot of people's concerns across the planet about the terrible humanitarian crisis that is unfolding not only in Syria, but especially in Aleppo. You asked, 'What is Aleppo?' Do you really think that foreign policy is so insignificant that somebody who is running for president of the United States shouldn't even know what Aleppo is, where Aleppo is, and why it is so important?"" he asked.Johnson answered: ""Well, no, I do understand Aleppo, and I understand the crisis that is going on. But when we involve ourselves militarily, when we involve ourselves in these humanitarian issues, we end up with a situation that in most cases is not better. And in many cases ends up being worse.""In a follow up interview just after the show with Bloomberg News' Mark Halperin, a frequent guest analyst on ""Morning Joe,"" Johnson said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" with himsself but admitted he'd been caught flat-footed.""Not remembering or identifying that that's Aleppo -- guilty,"" he said. ""I understand the significance. Genuinely -- believe me, no one is taking this more seriously than me. I feel horrible.""He added: ""I have to get smarter, and that's just part of the process.""Johnson later issued an unconventional press statement that sought to explain, in great detail, his error and to brace his supporters for mistakes to come: This morning, I began my day by setting aside any doubt that I'm human. Yes, I understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict -- I talk about them every day. But hit with 'What about Aleppo?', I immediately was thinking about an acronym, not the Syrian conflict. I blanked.  It happens, and it will happen again during the course of this campaign.Can I name every city in Syria? No.  Should I have identified Aleppo? Yes. Do I understand its significance? Yes. As Governor, there were many things I didn't know off the top of my head. But I succeeded by surrounding myself with the right people, getting to the bottom of important issues, and making principled decisions. It worked. That is what a President must do.That would begin, clearly, with daily security briefings that, to me, will be fundamental to the job of being President.Hillary Clinton swiped at Johnson for the gaffe when she was asked about his stumble during a news conference early Thursday. ""Well, you could look on a map and find Aleppo,"" she said. Later, during an appearance on ABC's ""The View,"" Johnson continued to address the gaffe.""There's no excuse. I was thinking in terms of an acronym - Aleppo,"" he explained. Johnson also said he thought the question was a fair one since he's running for president. Co-host Joy Behar told Johnson, ""I think it's a disqualifying statement, frankly.""""Fair enough. Fair enough,"" Johnson replied. "	Gary Johnson: 'What is Aleppo?'
