Jason Chaffetz said, later noting, ""when you are served a subpoena from the United States Congress, it is not optional.""Pagliano previously plead the Fifth in a closed-door session with the House Select Committee on Benghazi last year.Subsequently, Pagliano was granted limited immunity by the Department of Justice to be interviewed by the FBI.Pagliano also declined to answer questions when subpoenaed in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch.In letters to Chaffetz sent ahead of Tuesday's hearing, Pagaliano's attorney, Mark MacDougall, argued that his office was not given sufficient time to respond to the subpoena, and asserted that any call to have Pagliano appear on Capitol Hill a second time to plead the Fifth, ""furthers no legislative purpose and is a transparent effort to publicly harass and humiliate our client for unvarnished political purpose.""The Clinton campaign in the past has encouraged everyone involved with the server to cooperate and answer questions, including Pagliano.Donald Trump's campaign seized on the development. ""The fact that the individuals who maintained Hillary Clinton's secret email server pleaded the Fifth shows once again why she can't be trusted in the White House,"" spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement.Clinton didn't think illness was 'going to be that big a deal'Two other witnesses at Tuesday's hearing appeared before the committee but also invoked their Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions.  Those witnesses, Paul Combetta and Bill Thornton, worked for Platte River Networks, a company hired by the Clinton family to maintain the server.A fourth witness -- a former aide to former President Bill Clinton -- stayed to answer questions."

I have to do business with Putin, I have to do business with Russia, but I don't go around saying, 'That's my role model.' Can you imagine Reagan idolizing somebody like that?"" 2. Obama on Trump's charity""One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a 6' tall painting of himself. And he had the taste not to go for the 10' version,"" Obama joked.3. Obama on transparency""You want to debate transparency? You've got one candidate in this race who's released decades' worth of her tax returns. The other candidate is the first in decades who refuses to release any at all,"" Obama said.4. Obama on electing Clinton""I am really into electing Hillary Clinton. This isn't me going through the motions here. I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton.""5. 'Love trumps hate'""She knows that in a democracy in a big, diverse country like this one it doesn't work if we just demonize each other and call each other names. She knows that love trumps hate.""6. Obama on Trump and working class voters""This is the guy you want to be championing working people? This guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people? This guy's suddenly going to be your champion? He spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could. And now this guy is going to be the champion of working people? Huh?""7. Obama on Clinton's experience""For four years, I had a front-row seat. I watched her intelligence, I watched her judgment, I watched her discipline. I saw her in the situation room where she argued for the mission of (Osama) bin Laden ... because she had never forgotten what she was fighting for.""8. Obama on 2016""In election season, you will often hear crazy stuff. But I got to say, this year we've been hearing a little more crazy than usual. Having said that, after almost two terms as your president, I am here to tell you I'm more optimistic about our future than I've ever been.""9. Obama on his legacy""Let's face it, Republicans don't like to hear good news right now. But it's important to understand this a big deal. More Americans are working. More have health insurance. Incomes are rising. Poverty is falling.""""And gas is $2 a gallon!"" yelled a person in the audience.""And gas is $2 a gallon. I didn't even -- Thank you for reminding me. Thanks Obama,"" Obama joked.10. Obama on the GOP""What we've seen from the other side in this election is this isn't Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party. This isn't even the vision of freedom that Ronald Reagan talked about. This is a dark, pessimistic vision of a country where we turned against each other. We turn away from the rest of the world.""11. 'Bend your knees'""We've got somebody fainted. This is what happens, they'll be OK, just give a little room. Everybody bend their knees one time ... keep on bending them a little bit, we'll do a little exercise right now. EMS folks, they're right in front, if you can find somebody.

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/harry-reid-donald-trump-slim-and-trim/index.html	"""She has pneumonia and, well, you know, it's curable,"" Reid said flatly at a news conference. ""She's off the campaign trail for a few days. She probably needed the rest anyway. So you folks have magnified it.""He urged reporters to turn their lenses to Trump's health instead.""Take a look at this character that's running for president. He complains about her health. What does he do? He's 70 years old. He's not slim and trim. He brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit,"" Reid said.  Reid's frustration arose after several days of intense news coverage of Clinton's illness after she felt ill at a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. She was escorted out and the press pool that covers her was in the dark about her whereabouts and medical condition for several hours.All aspects of the Democratic presidential nominee's recent coughing fits, possible fainting spell, and eventual diagnosis of pneumonia were reported above the fold in the major newspapers and treated as ""breaking news"" on many television networks. Her campaign's lack of disclosure and handling of her health woes also have been poked and examined by editorial boards and panels of pundits. ""You've all been unfair to Hillary,"" Reid complained, further noting that she had ""submitted a multiple-page report from a doctor -- a good doctor -- talking about what medicine she's on. Pretty thorough.""Trump hasn't submitted medical reports, just as he hasn't released details of his charitable giving or his tax returns, Reid said. ""I can't imagine you folks not being a little inquisitive about what he's done to cheat people in Atlantic City and everywhere,"" Reid said. Reid, who is 76 and retiring this year after 30 years in the Senate, predicted that regardless of the negative attention Clinton is getting on the health issue, she will win the White House. ""And we're going to have a Democratic Senate,"" he added."	Donald Trump is 'not slim and trim,' Harry Reid says	['Reid', 'Clinton']	[]

Trump, notably, has been able to spend almost every night at home in New York. He also took nearly every Sunday off. Clinton, on the other hand, took her down days in spurts of two to four. August was actually a lighter-than-usual month for Clinton and she focused on fundraising more than she had in other months.Here's a side-by-side comparison of their campaign activities for August and September, by the numbers.

Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, the senior air commander for the coalition. Harrigian noted that, ""There is still a tough fight ahead against an adaptive enemy that will try to challenge us as we home in on Mosul and Raqqa.""Mosul may be ready for action sooner than Raqqa. Improvements at a nearby Iraqi airbase at Qayyarah are wrapping up. When completed, the base will provide a logistics and supply hub for Iraqi forces moving on Mosul, as well as a possible key location for US troop operations.There are currently 4,480 US troops in Iraq. About 550 are performing a wide variety of training, advising and assisting roles for Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The discussion centers around whether more advise-and-assist troops are needed, jobs filled mainly by Special Operations Forces.They are likely to be out in the field and closer to the front lines in the fight for Mosul, although they are not expected to deliberately expose themselves to fire, go on patrols or undertake combat missions.They could also be called upon to help local forces identify targets from their positions in the field. The idea, one official said, is they are not in buildings several miles to the rear but are closer to the action in order to provide assistance.Several senior US military officials are saying the fights for Mosul and Raqqa are going to expose US troops more directly to risk on the battlefield.If more Special Operations troops are sent, it might not require additional notification to Congress. There are about 160 unfilled military billets in Iraq under the current ceiling of the allowed number of troops. In Syria, the current ceiling is 300 forces, though only about 150 troops are there right now, according to defense officials.One argument against sending more Special Operations Forces to Iraq is the effort to keep the number of US troops down so that Shiite-backed militias don't feel threatened by the growing American presence, one official said.Part of the challenge is retaking Raqqa will be the role of Kurdish forces as well as Arab forces. Turkish authorities are not anxious to see the Kurds take on a bigger role in northern Syria, but there may not be sufficient Arab forces to deal with Raqqa, officials said."

Garcia was recorded by a ""tracker"" -- a person employed in politics to observe and record rival candidates -- and the footage was provided to the Miami Herald. In a statement, Garcia said he is sorry for his ""poorly worded comment about Secretary Clinton.""""My comments were intended to speak to Secretary Clinton's relentless focus on getting the job done, despite the unjust gender stereotypes and biases women in public life are frequently subjected to,"" Garcia said. ""Hillary Clinton is the most competent and qualified presidential candidate in the history of this country, man or woman and I'm with her, because I'm confident she will be one of our country's most effective leaders,"" he added.The video, which was recorded unbeknownst to its subject and shot upside down, showed Garcia speaking in a hallway with unidentified individuals prior to his scheduled remarks to supporters. He made the offending comment while comparing Clinton to Lyndon B. Johnson.""I believe that we're going to have -- I'll mention it when I speak -- I believe we're about to see the most consequential presidency that we've seen since Lyndon Johnson,"" Garcia said. ""This is not because I think Hillary Clinton is the greatest ever. But I do believe she is extremely, exceedingly competent, and she -- I know this is going to sound weird to you, but to me, as somebody who studies history, she's going to be very similar to Lyndon Johnson.He added: ""Lyndon Johnson wasn't a particularly charming man, wasn't a particularly nice man: He would ask you nice, and then when you didn't do it, he made you do it. And Hillary is under no illusions that you want to have sex with her, or that she's going to seduce you, or out-think you.""Garcia is seeking a comeback in Florida's 26th Congressional District, which encompasses the Miami area. He lost re-election there in 2014 and is currently locked in a tight race with the Republican who unseated him, Carlos Curbelo.

He also called for guaranteeing six weeks' maternity leave by extending unemployment insurance benefits to working mothers whose employers do not offer paid maternity leave.""For many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense -- even more than housing,"" Trump said, speaking from prepared remarks. ""Our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.Trump's detailed proposals Tuesday marked Trump's latest effort to repair his relationship with women voters, many of whom have come to know Trump as the candidate who suggested Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly asked him tough questions because she was menstruating and who insinuated his GOP rival Carly Fiorina was too ugly to be elected.Women broke for his rival Hillary Clinton 53% to 38% in the latest CNN/ORC poll.But Trump leads Clinton among married women and the Republican nominee also sought to appeal to stay-at-home parents, extending the child care tax deductions he outlined to families with one stay-at-home parent.In remarks before her father's speech, Trump's daughter said the issue of affordable childcare has been a top concern of hers and she seized the opportunity to address the issue because her father is ""in a very unique position to do something about this problem.""""Little focus has been put on how best to alleviate enormous financial burdens childcare places on low-income and middle-income families,"" Ivanka Trump said.Four women Republican congressman also joined Trump on stage to show their support for his proposals, which Trump argued would have bipartisan appeal in Congress.Details of Trump's planTrump's plan calls for making child care expenses fully tax-deductible, capped at the average cost of child care in the taxpayers' state of residence, for up to four children. The tax deduction would be available to families earning less than $500,000 or individuals earning less than $250,000.The average cost of daycare in the US is $11,666, according to the National Association of Child Resource and Referral Agencies, though the cost varies widely by state. Trump's plan would not cancel out the child care tax credit of $3,000 for one child or $6,000 for two children or more from their federal income tax, a Trump adviser said.Neither Trump nor his campaign offered an estimate of the cost of his proposal, but the campaign said it would pay for the six weeks of maternity leave offered to mothers by eliminating fraud in the unemployment insurance program.The campaign said the rest of the proposals would be paid for through the economic benefits of Trump's overall tax plan.""We want to end the economic punishment for motherhood in the United States. We believe that our plan makes great strides toward doing so,"" a campaign official said Tuesday morning.Ivanka Trump also briefly addressed reporters on a call Tuesday, saying that she is ""excited to see (the plan) come to fruition and present it later on today ... I'm very passionate about this.""Clinton's plansTrump's not the first presidential candidate to bring up child care and family leave on the campaign trail. Hillary Clinton backed 12-week paid family leave in 2015, early in her presidential campaign. Clinton has indicated that she would pay for the plan by raising taxes of top earners, meaning her plan would ""impose no additional costs on businesses, including small businesses.""Clinton declined to support a Democratic backed paid family leave bill in 2016 because it would raise payroll taxes for workers and companies by 0.2%, or about $1.38 per week for the median wage earner.Clinton, though, has questioned the possibility to achieving paid family leave in the current political climate. She told CNN in 2014 that although she supports it, ""I don't think, politically, we could get it now."""	Ivanka Trump joins dad to pitch child care policy	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

We have said that we do not want his support and we don't want the support of people who think like him.""Speaking to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday, Pence declined to call Duke ""deplorable,"" though he disavowed his support. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine hit Pence over the exchange at a campaign event in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Tuesday, saying, ""If you can't call it out and you stand back and you're silent about it, you're enabling it to grow, you're enabling it to become more powerful.""Pence spoke to reporters following a meeting with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill aimed to assuage concern about the party's nominee. Multiple House Republicans told CNN that Pence told personal stories about Trump and his dealings with him one-on-one, and that his running mate helped humanize the real estate mogul for a group that doesn't know the GOP nominee well.Before becoming Indiana's governor, Pence served in the House for more than 10 years. Pence told House Republicans in the closed-door meeting that he didn't know Trump when they first met, but had gotten to know him well, citing what he said was Trump's kindness and things he's done to show that he's different than what people see on TV. Pence also said that the GOP ticket has ""momentum,"" and when asked about its vulnerability with female voters, Pence argued that they are going to come out in large numbers for the GOP.One GOP source in the room told CNN that Nebraska GOP Rep.

Under House rules, the body has to take action on the measure within two legislative days and it's likely leaders will wait until Thursday to act on the matter.Fleming, who is running in a crowded field for the Senate, told reporters at a forum with other House conservatives on Tuesday that Americans have become frustrated with his own party ""because they unwilling or unable to hold high-level officials accountable for their actions‎.""House GOP members are divided on whether or not Koskinen should be impeached. Some believe it would set a bad precedent since he was not at the agency at the time time allegations surfaced that some IRS officials targeted tea party and conservative groups.Many prefer that any impeachment proceeding should first go through the House Judiciary Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over accusations of wrongdoing by government executives. But many House Freedom Caucus members say Koskinen deserves to lose his job because he headed the agency when materials requested by Congress on the investigation were destroyed.House Speaker Paul Ryan already scheduled a meeting with all House Republicans for Thursday morning to discuss the issue.If the GOP-led House does pass the resolution, it's unlikely the Senate will take up the issue.

Supreme Court nominee waits (and waits)The decision is a major gamble for GOP leaders, given that a potential Clinton White House could try to push forward a younger and more progressive nominee than the 63-year-old Garland. Some Republicans have urged party leaders to confirm Garland in the post-election session if Clinton wins the White House, arguing that Obama's nominee would be ideologically more suitable than one by a new Democratic president and potentially with a Democratic Senate majority.Yet moving on Garland in the lame-duck session would be seen as a major capitulation by McConnell, who has refused to take any steps on the nominee. Garland has languished for six months with no action in the Senate. Plus, Republicans believe that even if Clinton wins the White House and Democrats take back the Senate, the chamber will be narrowly divided, forcing Clinton to consider a more moderate pick who stands a greater likelihood of winning confirmation.Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Senate Republican, said ""I'm still thinking it through"" when asked if he'd be open to confirming Garland in a lame-duck session if Clinton wins.""I don't rule anything out,"" Hatch, a senior member on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN. ""I like Merrick personally. I disagree with a lot of his decisions in the last 20 years. But we'll see.""Speaking at a town hall meeting in Iowa last month, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley suggested that moving on Garland in the lame-duck session was a possibility if ""a majority of the Senate changed their mind"" and wanted action after the elections.
