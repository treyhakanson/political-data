That's up sharply compared with last June, when 43% said things had gotten worse shortly after a racially motivated shooting at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina.A similar share, 52%, say the criminal justice system in the US favors whites over blacks, while 36% say it treats blacks and whites equally, down 6 points since February 2015. Read the complete CNN/ORC poll resultsAbout three-quarters of blacks and one-half of whites feel the system favors whites. Whites are sharply split by education level on this question, with 62% of whites who hold college degrees saying the system favors whites over blacks vs. just 42% among whites who do not have college degrees. And urbanites are more apt to say the system is discriminatory than are suburban or rural Americans: 62% who live in urban areas say so, above the 53% of suburbanites and 38% of rural residents who say the same.The share describing discrimination against blacks generally as a very serious problem has inched up from 37% last June to 42% now, a high point during Obama's time in office. Much of the recent shift comes among whites, 34% of whom now see it as a very serious problem, up from 28% last June. Among blacks, that figure has softened somewhat and remains starkly higher than the share among whites, 80% said it was a very serious problem in June 2015 and 73% say so now.Few Americans see their local police as prejudiced against blacks, but there are sharp differences by race and between those who live in urban areas vs. rural ones. Nationwide, 18% say at least some of their local police are prejudiced against blacks. That climbs to 43% among blacks, and dips to 13% among whites. Among urbanites, 25% see at least some of their local police as prejudiced vs. just 10% among those who live in rural areas.In general, Americans have broadly favorable opinions of their local police, 86% view them favorably, 10% unfavorably, with blacks and other non-whites a bit less likely to hold a favorable opinion (91% of whites have a favorable view, 77% of all non-whites, and 69% of blacks feel the same).The Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged after several incidents in the last few years in which unarmed black people were harmed or killed at the hands of police, holds a narrowly net-positive favorability rating: 44% view it favorably, 40% unfavorably, and 16% have never heard of the movement or don't know how they feel about it. Awareness of the movement has grown since last summer, when 33% had no opinion or had never heard of it.Among blacks, 78% have a favorable view of the movement, higher than the 38% of whites who feel the same. There's a sharp divide among whites by education level in perceptions of Black Lives Matter, with 50% of whites who hold college degrees saying they see it favorably vs. 32% among whites without college degrees.Two-thirds of adults say that peaceful protests are justified in response to those recent incidents where blacks where harmed or killed by police, and 14% overall, including about one-quarter of blacks, consider violent protests in response justified.In findings from the same poll released earlier this week, voters were about evenly split between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on who would do a better job handling the criminal justice system. About 48% said Clinton would do the better job and 46% said they preferred Trump's approach. Among whites, Trump held an edge 49% to 42% while blacks favored Clinton's approach 85% to 11%. Overall, Clinton held a wide advantage on improving the lives of racial minorities, 60% to 32% who thought Trump would be better on that score.The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 28 through October 2 among a random national sample of 1,501 adults, including 1,086 non-Hispanic whites and 140 non-Hispanic blacks. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among the full sample, 3 points for results among whites and 8.5 points for results among blacks.

Pence, meanwhile, has faced questions after he repeatedly passed up opportunities to defend his running mate at the top of the Republican ticket at Tuesday's vice presidential debate. The Indiana governor expressed differences with Trump before he joined the party's ticket, including on the Muslim ban. When Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" in December, Pence called the proposal ""offensive and unconstitutional."" Trump moderated the proposal in the months that followed, and by July, after he was tapped as Trump's veep, Pence said the refined policy to suspend immigration of Muslims from ""terror states"" was the ""right call.""On Thursday, Pence said he and Trump ""have been very, very clear about the issue of suspending immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism.""When he was pressed by CNN's Chris Cuomo on his past criticism of Trump, Pence responded only with praise for the Republican presidential nominee.""I'm honored to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him,"" Pence said.

The front reads, ""Icky Trump"" -- a play on the band's 2007 album and song, ""Icky Thump."" The reverse side features a verse from the title track, which reminds Americans that ""you're an immigrant too.""In a brief statement posted to their Facebook page -- the band's first joint comment in ages -- they appeared to threaten legal action.""Regarding the use of 'Seven Nation Army' in a Donald Trump campaign video, The White Stripes would like to unequivocally state that they have nothing whatsoever to do with this video,"" they said. ""They are disgusted by this association, and by the illegal use of their song.""The video clip, created by Trump fan and Breitbart ally ""Pizza Party Ben"" has been removed from a number of venues, including Twitter, which cited ""a report from the copyright holder.""CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for response to the Stripes' criticism, and has not yet gotten a response. The White Stripes join a laundry list of musicians and entertainers to publicly ask Trump to quite playing their tunes. After Trump walked onstage to the Queen's ""We Are the Champions"" on the first night of the Republican National Convention in July, the band tweeted: ""An unauthorised use at the Republican Convention against our wishes."" A month earlier, Queen guitarist Brian May called the campaign ""unsavory"" after asking that their music not be ""be used as a political campaigning tool.""   British singer Adele and the Rolling Stones have also objected to Trump's use of their music at his rallies. Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe and Neil Young have all clashed with Trump at different stages of the campaign."	The White Stripes give Trump an Icky Thump	['Trump']	[]

""It will actually help. We're just talking about fairness, not like tough like we're not going to do business. We're talking about tough so that the United States can make something,"" Trump said. Snyder followed up, asking how the businessman would respond if, hypothetically, ""China said no more visas for our people to go to Las Vegas and stay at Trump Tower."" ""They're not going to do it, because if China ever did that, and if we ever cut off relationships with China, China would go bust so fast. I mean, China lives off the money out of the United States. They devalue their currency and they take our businesses,"" Trump said, adding that the United States has to improve relationships with China.  Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate, rebuked Trump over that line Thursday.""Someone asked him, an enterprising journalist, 'Hey, if you start a trade war with China and they retaliate by denying visas to anyone who wants to go to Las Vegas and stay at Trump hotel, what will you do?' He said we could cut off all relations to China and they'd go bust really fast,"" Kaine said at a rally at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. ""So this is a guy who says if they hurt his hotel business that he would cut off all relations with China. Is this the kind of guy you want in the Oval Office? A guy who will put his own bottom line ahead of America's bottom line? Absolutely not."" "	Tim Kaine hits Donald Trump over China remark	['Snyder', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]

Scalia's death last February shocked the close-knit court leaving it short handed and caught in the middle of a ferocious debate as Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. But it was Scalia's legacy that was front and center at the dedication ceremony. On the cover of the program was a quote from Scalia, ""I am something of a contrarian, I suppose"" it said. ""I feel less comfortable when everybody agrees with me."" Kagan recounted that when she was dean of Harvard Law, Scalia would visit the school. He told her at the time, ""I go to law schools just to make trouble."" He admitted that it would take ""several weeks"" for the students' professors ""to put them back on track."" Nodding to their ideological differences, she insisted that his method of constitutional interpretation changed ""our legal culture"" and the way lawyers, law students and judges think. In his life, Scalia passionately defended a view of interpreting the Constitution and the laws based on their text and original meaning. He also persuaded others not to rely upon legislative history when interpreting a statute. Five other justices were in the audience Thursday, only Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were missing. Judge Sri Srinivasan of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, who was on the short list of Obama's list to replace Scalia, sat near the front as well as former solicitors general Ted Olson and Paul Clement.   Several members of the Scalia family were in the audience including his son Father Paul Scalia, who gave the invocation. Catherine Scalia Courtney, one of Scalia's nine children, spoke in honor for her father who she called the ""son of a professor and a school teacher"" who would, be ""honored"" to have the school dedicated in his honor.  Koch Foundation donationThe naming of the law school was made possible with a $10,000,000 gift from the Charles Koch Foundation and another gift of $20,000,000 from an anonymous donor. Neither Charles or David Koch were in the audience although a representative from the foundation was present. The large gift and the renaming of the school did not come without controversy.In a letter last spring to students and alumni Henry N. Butler, the Dean of the law school announced the gift, the largest the university had ever received and said it would be used in part to increase class size, improve diversity and hire new faculty. In his letter, Butler acknowledged that the announcement took some at the school off guard and that he received many comments -- some of them ""very negative (almost all respectful)"". Although critics expressed concern that the law school would be linked with the conservative politics of the Koch Foundation, Butler said ""the law school has complete independence from the donors regarding the use of the funds within the delineated categories of scholarships, faculty and research.""   Last April, a group of faculty and staff at the university -- not the law school -- released a letter repudiating some of Scalia's opinions on gay rights and affirmative action and arguing that the renaming of the law school ""undermines our mission as a public university and tarnishes our reputation.""The signed letter said that ""the views Scalia affirmed from the bench do not reflect the values of our campus community.""In his letter, Butler also made reference to the fact that the school was initially named the ""Antonin Scalia School of Law"" until ""an ""acronym controversy"" arose on social media. Butler called ""The Antonin Scalia Law School"" a ""logical substitute."" "	Antonin Scalia law school dedicated in Virginia	['Roberts', 'Paul', 'Olson']	['gay']

""Less than 1% of those changes included The Weather Channel. We have requested that stations in Florida delay any of those ads on the Weather Channel until after the storm passes.""Clinton's decision to air ads on The Weather Channel as attention shifted from the 2016 campaign to the approaching hurricane sparked some criticism from Republicans, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. ""I encourage both presidential campaigns to be sensitive to all affected by Hurricane #Matthew in the coming days,"" Bush tweeted Wednesday, linking to a Politico article that reported Clinton will spend $63,000 on a five-day ad buy that would begin Thursday on The Weather Channel. Kristy Campbell, Bush's former spokeswoman, called Clinton's ad buy ""a colossally huge and unforced error.""""This is a colossally huge and unforced error by the Clinton camp. Insensitive and will piss off Floridians,"" she tweeted.Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, called the Clinton buy ""tone-deaf."""".@HillaryClinton tone-deaf to plan flight of negative ads on @weatherchannel in Florida to coincide with Hurricane Matthew. #shameless,"" Miller said.The Weather Channel is expected to get a significant increase in viewership over the next several days due to growing interest in the possibly Category 4 hurricane. More than 2 million people have already been urged to flee their homes in the southeast because of the hurricane, which has killed at least 15 people in the Caribbean. The storm is expected to make landfall on the Florida coast Thursday.Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said the Clinton campaign is concerned about the storm's potential devastation.""We're very mindful of the fact that a visit at the wrong time, when people are really focused on keeping themselves safe, would be a real distraction,"" he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""So we're just going to monitor the weather as it goes, keep everybody there in our thoughts and encourage everybody to pay attention to your local emergency instructions and follow that advice. It's very important.""Both campaigns are focused on Florida voters because of its swing state status. Following the first presidential debate, Clinton gained ground in Florida, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday. The Democratic nominee is leading Republican rival Donald Trump 46% to 41%. Clinton posted a personal tweet Thursday urging Florida residents to ""stay safe.""""Hurricane #Matthew is a major storm. I urge everyone to follow emergency instructions and evacuate if you're told to. Stay safe Florida. -H,"" she tweeted.Trump, who owns a home in Palm Beach, Florida, also tweeted, ""Praying for everyone in Florida.
