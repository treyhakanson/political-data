Elijah Cummings sent a letter to chairman Jason Chaffetz calling for a ""bipartisan"" look at Russia's involvement in the election.Chaffetz was ""open"" to the idea in a private meeting the two had, Cummings wrote, but wanted ""evidence."" Cummings wrote the letter as follow-up to publicly show Chaffetz such evidence. Chaffetz did not immediately respond to the letter. US accuses Russia of election interferenceThe Democrat congressman said that though the hacks were on Democratic groups, the outrage at Russia's actions should be bipartisan.""Elections are the bedrock of our nation's democracy,"" Cummings wrote. ""Any attempt by a foreign power to undermine them is a direct attack on our core democratic values, and it should chill every member of Congress and American -- red or blue -- to the core."" Cummings used the letter to publicly pressure Chaffetz by citing statements from the US intelligence community saying they were ""confident"" that senior levels of the Russian government had been behind hacking of Democratic political groups in the months leading up to the election, and that the objective was interfering in the election. Cummings also quoted Republicans including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan warning about Russia. He quoted Graham to make his point. ""Here's what I would tell Republicans: We cannot sit on the sidelines as a party and let allegations against a foreign government interfering in our election process go unanswered because it may have been beneficial to our cause,"" Cummings quoted Graham as saying.

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-national-security-adviser/index.html	"In selecting the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Trump would be picking a combat veteran to guide him through some of his most critical national security decisions.But he would also be receiving the counsel of a man who has courted controversy in the past and has a reputation for possessing a fiery temperament, not all that different from Trump himself.The role of national security adviser to the President is all-important and would put Flynn into the pages of American history. First created in the early days of the Cold War, the role is seen as critical to implementing a president's worldview on the various departments and agencies involved in national security. Famous national security advisers who made a major impact on American foreign policy have included Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft. Flynn enjoys tremendous access and credibility with Trump, especially because he's had several tours of duty on the battlefield.""What makes Gen. Flynn different from so many others that we've heard about on Donald Trump's transition team is he is the one with the real experience fighting on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq,"" said Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst.""Certainly, he would be a very plausible candidate for national security adviser, which is arguably the most important national security position in the government,"" Bergen added.But the question may be whether his management style rubs people the wrong way. In 2014, he was pushed out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn said it was because he raised alarm bells on Islamic terrorism, but four US officials serving at time told CNN it was because of his contentious management style. Given Trump's reputation for loyalty, it is no surprise that Flynn would find himself in a key role in the Trump administration. But Flynn, having only retired from the Army in 2014, is actually limited in the positions he could fill. By law, military officers must be out of uniform for at least seven years before they are eligible to become secretary of defense, though it is possible that Congress could grant a waiver that would allow Flynn to be named to that post. The idea of Flynn becoming national security adviser is already meeting with opposition from some Democrats.Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday, ""I'd be worried about an impulsive president with an impulsive national security adviser.""Scrutiny over handling of classified informationAt the Republican National Convention, amid shouts of ""lock her up"" from the audience, Flynn delivered a fiery speech condemning Hillary Clinton's handling of emails on her private server.""I have called on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race because she put our nation's security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server,"" Flynn said.But Flynn's own record with classified information has been called into question during his military career. On at least two occasions, his handling of classified information came under scrutiny by the US military. Two former government officials with direct knowledge of the issue tell CNN that while Flynn oversaw intelligence in Afghanistan, he shared classified information with Pakistan on terror networks responsible for killing American troops. The intelligence, the sources say, came from another agency. Flynn wasn't supposed to share it. They say he was trying to convince Pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists.Asked by email about the allegation, Flynn told CNN, ""It is not true ... not even close."" Flynn declined to comment further for this story.In separate incident, the two officials with whom CNN spoke said Flynn did not follow established security procedures when he shared classified intelligence with allies. In an August interview with The Washington Post, Flynn has acknowledged the incident. ""The investigation on me was for sharing intelligence with the Brits and Australians in combat, and I'm proud of that one,"" he told the paper. ""That was substantiated because I actually did it.""Flynn says he had permission to share the classified information. In both cases, sources say the retired general was informally reprimanded but never charged with wrongdoing.  And in 2010, while still a serving senior officer, he published an article criticizing the state of US intelligence operations in Afghanistan. CNN has learned the CIA was so furious at Flynn for publicly disclosing shortfalls that the agency complained to the Pentagon, which had signed off on the article.Mixed messages on RussiaWhile Flynn shares many of the same criticisms over the fight against radical Islam and US intervention in Libya that Trump has lobbed at the Obama administration, there are some policy areas where they have expressed sharp differences.During the second presidential debate, Trump shot down the notion that his administration would consider establishing no-fly zones in Syria, a policy that Vice President-elect Mike Pence had earlier expressed support for. But Flynn seemed to support such an initiative during a June interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt.""We should create, you know, safety zones, flight zones, whatever, both ground and air,"" Flynn said.Flynn has also sounded mixed messages on the state of US-Russia relations.Critics slammed Flynn for traveling to Moscow in February and appearing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a ceremony commemorating the state-owned network RT, formerly known Russia Today. Flynn told Yahoo News in July that he went because he ""wanted to tell Russia to get Iran the hell out of the four proxy wars that they are involved in in the Middle East.""Asked if he was paid for his appearance, Flynn said, ""what difference does that make?"" later referring the question to his speaker's bureau and adding, ""I didn't take any money from Russia, if that's what you are asking me."" Trump has expressed a consistent desire for improved relations with Russia and Flynn seemed to express a similar sentiment while speaking to The Washington Post in August.""We have a problem with radical Islamism and I actually think that we could work together with them against this enemy,"" Flynn said of Russia, echoing Trump's stated belief that Russian and its Syrian ally were fighting terrorists in Syria and that such a team-up would bring benefits.But Flynn has also been a harsh critic of Russia.In his 2016 book, ""The Field of Fight,"" Flynn wrote that Russia was part of an ""enemy alliance"" in league with Iran.""They are certainly not 'fighting terrorists' in the Middle East,"" Flynn wrote of Russia's actions in Syria. He also said ""there is no reason to believe Putin would welcome cooperation with us,"" noting the Russian military was establishing new military bases on its western border and modernizing its nuclear arsenal.""These are not the actions of a country seeking détente with the West,"" he wrote, adding, ""Putin fully intends to do the same thing as, and in tandem with, the Iranians: pursue the war against us.""Speaking about Trump, Flynn told Al Jazeera English in May that he ""doesn't agree with everything he's said,"" refusing to fully endorse the candidate's calls to bring back waterboarding and for ""taking out"" terrorists' families.""There must be more precision in the use of the language that he uses as the potential leader of the free world,"" Flynn said, adding that is the ""advice that I'm trying to get into him.""'We have to clearly define this enemy'However, the two men also agree on key national security issues, ranging from criticism of the Iran nuclear deal to a lack of burden sharing among members of the NATO alliance.""Why do three-quarters of NATO (countries) get away with not paying anything? They have to pay their bills,"" Flynn said in his interview with The Washington Post. Flynn appeared to acknowledge in a May interview with Al Jazeera English, however, that Trump's rhetoric may differ from his actual national security policies.""Read his book, 'The Art of the Deal.' Start really, really high and really, really hard,"" Flynn related. ""And then be prepared to get down to where you think you can actually negotiate.""Despite serving as the Pentagon's top intelligence officer, Flynn has slammed the Obama administration for its handling of the fight against ISIS and echoed Trump in denouncing Obama's terminology for the terrorist group.""We are in a war. And we're not allowed to say that. We have to clearly define this enemy,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper in July.""We have to be able to discredit the doctrines of this radical Islamism, discredit this ideology. And we're not allowed to do that right now,"" he added.He also blasted US leaders for failing to design a strategy and argued in a July op-ed in the New York Post they ""timidly nibble around the edges of the battlefields from Africa to the Middle East.""Flynn's more than 30-year Army record included leading military intelligence efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and helping to oversee Special Operations forces during their battle against al Qaeda in Iraq, a terror group that many see as the parent organization of ISIS.""Mike Flynn has a lot of experience on the ground in Iraq, on the ground in Afghanistan, that distinguishes him from pretty much anybody else that we have heard associated with Donald Trump,"" Bergen said Wednesday.Flynn acknowledged in the New York Post op-ed that he was ""let go"" as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for holding views that clashed with other administration officials regarding the direction of the agency.Flynn also shares Trump's vocal opposition to the Iraq and Libyan interventions in 2003 and 2011, telling Der Spiegel that removing Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi helped spread instability and violence.On the decision to invade Iraq, Flynn said, ""History will not be and should not be kind with that decision.""Flynn has also said that he thinks the fight against extremist groups requires a long-term effort. While he was still in uniform, he told CNN's Evan Perez that the problems in the region defied quick-fix solutions, saying, ""We've got to be very careful that we're not looking for the headline.""""We have to start thinking about what is this place going to be like, you know, 10 years from now, 20 years from now,"" he added.Trump, however, promised in April that ISIS would be vanquished ""very, very quickly."""

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/jeff-sessions-racism-allegations/index.html	"But with the new attention on Sessions -- who has emerged as the top candidate to be the next attorney general, according to a transition official, setting up a potential Senate confirmation hearing -- old allegations of racism against the Alabama Republican are sure to haunt him.It was 30 years ago that Sessions was denied a federal judgeship. At the time, he was a 39-year-old US attorney in Alabama.The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony during hearings in March and May 1986, that Sessions had made racist remarks and called the NAACP and ACLU ""un-American.""Thomas Figures, a black assistant US attorney who worked for Sessions, testified that Sessions called him ""boy"" on multiple occasions and joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying that he thought Klan members were ""OK, until he learned that they smoked marijuana.""On why he never spoke up against Sessions' alleged use of the term, Figures testified: ""I felt that if I had said anything or reacted in a manner in which I thought appropriate, I thought I would be fired.""Sessions angrily denied the allegations at the time. His office did not respond to a recent request for comment.""I am not a racist, I am not insensitive to blacks. I have supported civil rights activity in my state. I have done my job with integrity, equality, and fairness for all,"" he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.He said he detested the Klan, and called the assertion that he made those statements ""ludicrous.""Figures also testified that Sessions was critical of the NAACP and other groups.""On the day in question, Mr. Sessions came into my office just as I was reading a newspaper account of some the recent action of the NAACP. I casually mentioned that development to Mr. Sessions. Mr. Sessions in response stated that he believed the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Operation PUSH and the National Conference of Churches were all un-American organizations teaching anti-American values. This statement clearly was not intended as a joke,"" Figures said.Transcripts of the hearing also show that J. Gerald Hebert, who was a Justice Department lawyer, also testified that Sessions told him the NAACP and ACLU were ""un-American"" and ""Communist-inspired."" Hebert, who now directs a voting program at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, told CNN Thursday he stands by the testimony he gave 30 years ago.""Things that I had heard firsthand from him were things that demonstrated gross racial insensitivity to black citizens of Alabama and the United States,"" Hebert said.At the time, Hebert testified that Sessions said a white attorney who represented black clients might be a disgrace and that the NAACP and ACLU did more harm than good by trying to force civil rights ""down the throats of people.""Hebert told CNN he fears Sessions might disregard the civil rights division of the Justice Department were he to become Trump's attorney general.   ""He has never backed off from the comments he made at that time. He has never apologized for them,"" Hebert said Thursday.In a heated exchange with then-Sen. Joe Biden at the 1986 hearing, Sessions denied calling the NAACP and National Council of Churches ""un-American.""""They may have taken positions that I consider to be averse to the security interests of the United States,"" Sessions testified.The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10-8 against Sessions' nomination, making him the second nominee in 50 years to be rejected for a federal judgeship.Sessions became attorney general of Alabama in 1994, and was elected to the Senate in 1996. Ironically, Sessions went on to be the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- the very panel that had rejected him years earlier.Reflecting on the rejection in 2009, he described the allegations made against him as ""heartbreaking.""  ""That was not fair, that was not accurate. Those were false charges using distortions of anything that I did. And it really was not. I never had those kinds of views, and I was caricatured in a way that was not me,"" he told CNN at the time."	Jeff Sessions dogged by old allegations of racism	[]	[]
6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/lindsey-graham-rand-paul-donald-trump-confirmations/index.html	"""You can put the Republicans in a very small car who are going to follow Rand Paul's advice when it comes to national security,"" Graham told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan on ""At This Hour."" ""He is my friend, he's a libertarian, but he's an outlier.""Graham expressed confidence that both Giuliani and Bolton could be confirmed as heads of the State Department despite early opposition from Paul and Democrats, who have seized on Giuliani's international consulting work and paid speaking engagements -- something Hillary Clinton was criticized for -- as potential conflicts of interest. He also dismissed Paul's complaint  about the hawkish Bolton since his recess appointment during the Bush administration. Graham also said he could support another potential candidate -- his state's governor, Nikki Haley -- though his backing was more lukewarm.  ""I would say (Haley) did a good job as governor of South Carolina. She's talented, she's capable. I think she could do a good job in any assignment given. I don't know about her foreign policy. I haven't talked to her,"" he said, adding later, ""At the end of the day, I would support her.""Other appointmentsGraham opined on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a potential pick for the Supreme Court vacancy, an idea --perhaps jokingly -- floated by Graham himself, despite a long history of criticizing the Texas firebrand. He had remarked earlier this week the largely unpopular Cruz would easily win a confirmation from his Senate colleagues, insinuating they might be eager to be rid of him.""Ted Cruz is a constitutional conservative, very, very smart, in the mold of Scalia,"" Graham said, referencing Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away earlier this year.""The people on (Trump's) list ... I could support them all. I just suggested that if you are looking for a Scalia-type figure, somebody to replace judge Scalia in their image judicially, Ted Cruz would fit that bill,"" he said. And Graham also said that he approved of Trump's apparent moves to install his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an adviser, despite the controversy and charges of nepotism. Graham said it would be ""fine with me"" if Kushner worked as a senior adviser. ""It shows they got a good relationship. I don't know how many father-in-law's would pick their son-in-law's to do anything.""Policy fightsWhile he enthusiastically supported some of Trump's potential administration appointees, Graham -- who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee -- expressed a firm willingness to challenge the new president on policy. As one of the more moderate Republicans in a closely divided senate, Graham could be positioned to wield significant influence in close votes. ""I can tell you if I disagree with the president,"" Graham said. ""I'm going to push back when I need to push back.""  On the issue of Russian aggression, Graham sounded a more bellicose tone than Trump, who has urged friendlier relations. ""I have a different view of Russia. I don't think (Vladimir) Putin's our friend,"" he said. And Graham also stressed that counterterrorism efforts shouldn't be used as an excuse to permit Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad's atrocities. ""I see Assad as the butcher of Damascus ... I don't see Assad as an ally or friend of the United States,"" he said.Finally, Graham put some space between himself and Trump on immigration reform, saying he will ""vote for any bill that secures our border,"" but that ""I'm not going to vote for a bill that can't tell the difference between a grandmother who has been here illegally and a drug dealer. I just can't go there."""	Lindsey Graham knocks Rand Paul: 'He is my friend, he's a libertarian, but he's an outlier'	['Haley', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Cruz', 'Trump']	[]
7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/obama-europe-germany-angela-merkel/index.html	"Instead, Obama found himself warning of an impending shift in the global order, one he advised could lead to a ""meaner, harsher, more troubled world"" if not stopped.""Whoever is president and whoever is the chancellor of Germany and whoever is the leader of other European nations and other democracies around the world, they need to recognize that,"" Obama said. ""There are going to be forces that argue for cynicism. For looking the other way with somebody else's problems. That are not going to champion people who are vulnerable because sometimes that's politically convenient.""""If we don't have a strong transatlantic alliance that's standing up for those things, we will be giving to our children a worst world,"" he said. ""We will go backwards instead of forwards. So whoever the US president is, whoever the chancellor of Germany is, we need to remember that. And our citizenry who decide who our presidents and chancellors are need to remember that.""It was a dire prediction that barely matched the upbeat attitude Obama has attempted to put forward as he works to facilitate a peaceful transition to Trump's presidency. In his appearances in Europe, Obama has made a point of hailing the NATO alliance, insisting that Trump remains committed to upholding the group's commitment to mutual defense. And he expressed cautious optimism Thursday that Trump would moderate his tone once he assumes office.But as his final foreign swing wears on, Obama's alerts about the wave of nationalist politics spreading in the US and Europe have grown more dire. He bemoaned the way information flows in a digital age, and decried an echo-chamber of falsities masquerading as facts.""In an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in sound bites and snippets off their phones, if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,"" he said. ""If people, whether they're conservative, liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down.""He issued a warning to Trump in his dealings with Russia, cautioning that on issues like Ukraine and Syria, Moscow must be confronted head-on. ""I don't expect the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest we cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or violates international norms or leaves smaller countries vulnerable,"" he said.And he said he advised Trump to tone down his campaign rhetoric during their Oval Office meeting last week.""He ran an extraordinarily unconventional campaign and it resulted in the biggest political upset in perhaps modern political history,"" Obama said. ""What I said to him was that what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn't support him.""This is Obama's final visit as President to Berlin, the city where he introduced himself to the world in 2008 but where he now faces persistent questions about the future of transatlantic ties and liberal progress.Obama spent most of his time huddling with Merkel, his closest counterpart who is now Europe's most powerful leader as the continent prepares for Trump's presidency. She expressed guarded optimism about Trump Thursday, her controlled demeanor barely reflecting an iota of worry about the man who lambasted her as a candidate. She praised Obama for facilitating a smooth transition, and said she was approaching Trump with an ""open mind.""As her European counterparts face political challenges at home, Merkel has assumed a critical role in transatlantic ties, voicing strong support for Obama's priorities on climate change, Russian sanctions and economic reform.The personal chemistry between the leaders was on display Thursday, Obama winking as he sat for talks in Merkel's chancellery, and Merkel grinning as she anticipated a visit from Obama in his post-presidency.""I'm game!"" she said.The German leader has not yet said whether she'll run for a fourth term next year, though her political allies have signaled she will. Like leaders in France, Britain, the US and elsewhere, she'll face challenges from far-right politicians who are running on an agenda of populist nationalism.Obama declined to push her to run Thursday, but suggested he would vote for her if he was German.Obama finds himself in Germany in a vastly different political environment than when he first spoke here as a candidate in 2008. Back then, a crowd of 200,000 gathered in the city's Tiergarten to hear a young senator extoll the necessity of multilateral ties after George W. Bush-era tensions.Europeans had grown wary of the US during Bush's presidency. They regarded Obama as an urbane, liberal counterpoint to a Republican administration that had grown derisive of Europe in the debate over the Iraq War.During his 2008 speech, Obama lauded open and diverse societies.""The walls between races and tribes, natives and immigrants, Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand,"" Obama said then. ""These now are the walls we must tear down.""Now, as Trump drafts plans to erect a wall on the US border with Mexico, those words seem from a distant past. While he remains insistent on the values of liberal, open societies, Obama has grown more realistic about the speed and scope of change.""I think our politics everywhere are going to be going through a bumpy phase,"" Obama said.

""This is something that is a huge black mark on our society and we would never want to do it again.""However, Higbie did note on Thursday evening's show that the US Supreme Court's 6-3 decision ruling the exclusion order constitutional was never overturned, prompting the host to push back.""What are you saying here?"" asked Burnett.Seated next to Higbie, guest Keith Boykin jumped in.""He's back-tracking, Erin,"" suggested the former Clinton White House aide. ""That decision that you talked about -- that Korematsu decision of 1944 -- even Justice Antonin Scalia said it is one of the worst decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court ... We don't want to go back to that precedent.""Higbie kept his messaging big picture, insisting that despite suggestions to the contrary, the President-elect would not advocate for an internment camp-style policy, and is most certainly not anti-Muslim.Boykin asked his fellow guest to ""tell that to the Muslim people,"" a challenge which Higbie accepted.Higbie stared directly into the bright lights, saying ""All right, Muslim people of the world, Donald Trump is not in fear of the Muslim community.""Still staring straight ahead, he added, ""He's in fear of the radical faction of the Muslim community that has done harm to Americans and abroad.""Thursday's CNN appearance came only one night after Higbie's cross-town visit with Fox News' Megyn Kelly. That segment first raised the reference to internment camps and resulted in immediate condemnation from not only Kelly but also a Japanese-American member of Congress. Higbie was speaking with Kelly when she asked him about reports that Trump's transition team was drafting policies that would set up some sort of registry for immigrants from Muslim countries. ""It is legal, they say it will hold constitutional muster,"" Higbie said. ""We've done it with Iran, back a while ago, we did it during World War II with the Japanese, which, call what you will.""Kelly interjected: ""Come on, you're not proposing we go back to the days of internment camps, I hope.""""I'm just saying there is precedent for it, and I'm not saying I agree with it,"" Higbie replied.Kelly again appeared incredulous, saying talk like that scares Americans about what the President-elect might do.""Look, the President needs to protect America first. And if that means having people that are not protected under our Constitution have some sort of registry so we can understand, until we can identify the true threat and where it's coming from, I support it,"" Higbie said.Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Trump's immigration adviser and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach has clarified that the registry he referred to would be a national immigration registry that would focus on people from high-risk countries, though critics say that could amount to a Muslim registry depending on how it was configured. During World War II, after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans were rounded up and put into internment camps until the end of the war -- a time period considered a stain on American democracy. Thursday morning, California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, called on Trump to denounce the remarks from his supporter. Takano cited his own parents' and grandparents' internment and called it ""one of the darkest chapters in American history.""""More than 100,000 Japanese-Americans were accused of no crimes and received no trial before being relocated, interned, and stripped of their possessions,"" Takano said in a statement. ""I am horrified that people connected to the incoming Administration are using my family's experience as a precedent for what President-elect Trump could do. These comments confirm many Americans' worst fears about the Trump Administration, and they reflect an alarming resurgence of racism and xenophobia in our political discourse.""Trump's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Asked whether he supported the use of waterboarding -- which Congress banned along with other interrogation torture techniques in 2009 -- Hoekstra hedged, at first saying that ""Congress has spoken on that.""
