By Obama's own admission, the major pieces of his presidential legacy are now subject to a gutting by a successor he resents deeply.But the President insisted to his supporters and Democrats Wednesday this is not the end.""The sun is up, and I know everybody had a long night. I did as well,"" Obama said in the White House Rose Garden. Obama will likely leave office with an approval rating of over 50%, and it's a truism of American politics that ex-presidents get more popular after they leave the White House.Nothing, however, can paper over the fact that the first African-American president will stand on the inaugural platform next to Donald Trump, who stoked divisions and preyed on people's racist fears, including through lies and insinuations about Obama himself. Obama's efforts on Hillary Clinton's behalf over the past month, unprecedented for a modern sitting president, reflected not only a desire to elect his former secretary of state. It was a chance to sell, again, his vision of a hopeful America and the progress inherent in a nation ready to elect its first African-American president. The US electorate affirmed that vision in 2008, and gave Obama more time to fulfill it in 2012. But voters now leave Obama with little hope of salvaging a presidential legacy that depended heavily on his successor. Trump and Obama will meet Thursday, and the President said the White House will cooperate with the incoming administration, citing the example President George W. Bush set in 2008. ""Everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team,"" Obama said. ""This is an intramural scrimmage. We're not Democrats first. We're not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We're patriots first. We all want what's best for this country. That's what i heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night. That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly. And i was heartened by that. That's what the country needs. A sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law, and a respect for each other. I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition, and I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin.""But the sting of Trump's victory will last well beyond the transition period as the framework of Obama's presidential legacy comes under siege by Republicans who fought him tooth and nail for eight years and who, in January, will control the White House and both chambers of Congress. During rally after rally on Clinton's behalf, Obama cautioned voters that electing Trump would mean watching his accomplishments on jobs, health care, foreign policy, climate change and equality go ""down the drain."" He warned his coalition of African-Americans and young people that he would ""consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy"" if they didn't propel Clinton to the type of electoral victory they helped him achieve. Those voters did not turn out in the same levels they did for Obama, despite his aggressive overtures. During every battleground rally or radio phone-in, he declared Trump ""uniquely unqualified"" to hold his office, warning against allowing the brash billionaire near the nuclear codes. He spent the last 18 months reassuring his foreign counterparts that Trump's proclamations about America don't reflect the country's real values. Like all Democrats, Obama faces a reckoning about the true makeup of the American electorate, and his party's prospects going forward. But he also awakens Wednesday with the bitter responsibly of handing the US government to the man whose actions he openly fears. ""This is somebody who would do damage to our democracy,"" Obama said of Trump in Florida last week, adding Trump made him ""fear for the Republic."" Readying assault on Obama prioritiesTrump has promised to scrap Obama's signature health care law, which has become increasingly fragile as costs spike and insurers withdraw from exchanges. The fixes that Obama insists will reinforce the Affordable Care Act now appear to have little chance of moving forward.Trump's transition team has been developing plans to reverse the patchwork of executive actions that Obama devised to skirt a Republican Congress on immigration and climate change. That includes Obama's unilateral moves easing deportation enforcement and his regulations on power plants. Even before Obama leaves office, those actions remain mired in legal challenges and haven't yet taken effect. Proponents of the moves had claimed if they eventually did take hold, their positive impact on society would make it difficult for future presidents to reverse them. Having never taken full effect, there's little expectation now those actions will ever be realized. Trump has committed to withdrawing the US from trade agreements, including the pending Trans Pacific Partnership that Obama has championed. So, too, has Trump said he would remove the US from the agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear ambitions and from a global climate accord signed in Paris last year. The fate of the Supreme Court, with a GOP Senate now under no pressure to take up Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, is likely sealed. Trump has named several conservatives as potential justices; it's likely he'll have multiple seats to fill as the court's older members approach retirement. Tone of final monthsIn the coming weeks, administration officials are expected to work on cementing what elements of Obama's unfinished agenda they can, either through new executive orders or action in the lame duck Congress. Obama himself is expected to deliver a major address on democracy next week in Greece -- the ancient birthplace of that type of government -- and to meet for a final time with close US allies. Those meetings are now expected to center on shoring up shared priorities as trans-Atlantic alliances face an uncertain future. But even as Obama works in his final weeks to salvage what he can of his agenda, there's little doubt that his message of hopefulness has suffered a deep setback. The tone of the just-concluded presidential contest is perhaps the best reflection of his inability to improve the tenor of American political life. When he announced his presidential run in 2007, Obama decried the ""the smallness of our politics"" and vowed to reform Washington. Eight years later, the race to succeed devolved into one of the darkest national election races in memory, a bitter and ugly fight between two deeply unpopular candidates. ""It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,"" Obama said in his final State of the Union address earlier this year."

1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-victory-speech/index.html	Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business. Complicated. Thank you very much.I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.It is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be President for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people -- and serve the people it will.Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey.The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict. And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory.First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. Truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually.And my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?My brother Robert, and they should be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great.And also my late brother Fred, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky.Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don and Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough.This was tough. This political stuff is nasty, and it is tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group.You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people.And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special.I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. Where is Rudy. Where is he?Gov. Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get. Sen. Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy?Up here. Really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats, Dr. Ben Carson. Where's Ben? Where is Ben? By the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family Sarah, thank you very much. Gen. Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? And Gen. Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and they are special people.We have 22 Congressional Medal of Honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is ... that's right, how did you possibly guess? Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar. I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win it. Like Secretariat. He would not have that bust at the track at Belmont.Reince is really a star and he is the hardest-working guy, and in a certain way I did this. Reince, come up here. Get over here, Reince.Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's about time you did this right. My god. Nah, come here. Say something.Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.The Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service.And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately. We appreciate them. So it's been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job, and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you. You will say that --  you will say that that was something that you were --  really were very proud to do and I can — thank you very much.And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people, and we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your President. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor.It's an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period, and I love this country. Thank you.Thank you very much. Thank you to Mike Pence.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/post-election-2016-transition-launch/index.html	"In the 73 days between now and the inauguration, Trump will have plenty to do. From 4,000 appointments -- 1,100 of which require Senate confirmation -- to delivering on campaign promises to completing a budget, the previous few months before a president-elect takes office are a whirlwind of activity.  ""We used to kid we didn't know how fast warp speed was, but the transitions were faster than warp speed,"" said Clay Johnson III, who managed the transition for President George W. Bush.While Tuesday night was a time for celebration, Wednesday morning brought the reality into focus for team Trump, led by transition Chairman Chris Christie. If history is a guide, the next two months and change will be a mad dash.The day after his election in 2008, then President-elect Barack Obama held meetings with his team and spent time with family. But the day after, two days after the election, he made his first appointments, naming Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff and David Axelrod as a senior White House adviser. Obama had mostly filled out his top White House staff in less than two weeks, and names of Cabinet officials also began to surface. Less than a month later, the core of his Cabinet -- especially on national security -- was taking shape.The days after the election are a frenzy of meetings, vetting and coordination, all of which the transition tries to keep a tight lid on until they're ready to make names public. What is a transition? Johnson experienced a unique version of transition. In 2000, the election wasn't finalized until a Supreme Court decision in December on the winner of Florida, leaving only about a month for the normal transition period. But he said his experience of getting ""teary-eyed"" out of sheer exhaustion on the way home every night was something that all transition officials he's compared notes with have also felt.  His counterpart in 2008 was Christopher Lu, executive director of the Obama transition and now deputy secretary of labor. Asked to give advice to the 2016 transition chiefs before Election Day, Lu told CNN that banking sleep will be essential. ""I will tell anybody who's planning a presidential transition, as busy as it is now, make sure you get a little bit of sleep because once the day after Election Day comes, it is going to hit you so fast,"" Lu said. ""It's a special moment. It is something that is unique really in all of government. The fact that we've had peaceful transitions for the last 200 years really is what makes our democracy so special -- but trust me, get some sleep now because you won't be getting a lot during the transition time.""While building and vetting a Cabinet and developing policy are primary focuses of the transition, the effort also has to work on preparing that new administration to lead from day one -- no matter what circumstances are thrown at it.An effective transition should run table-top exercises to run through simulated emergencies of a variety of types, from terrorism, to public health, to natural disasters, the hope being that when the first crisis hits the presidency, it won't be the first time principals have gathered into a room to respond.  The transition period is one of the most vulnerable in American democracy. In addition to a new president taking office, only a few hundred of the 4,000 appointed officials are usually in place by August recess, meaning agencies are operating without permanent leadership or brand new leadership.The Trump transition beginsThat's one of the reasons that past transition chiefs and good government experts at the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service have emphasized the importance of starting transitions early. Both Clinton and Trump began thinking about transition last spring and set up their offices in earnest in August. Traditionally, the transition also enjoys some bipartisan support that stands in stark contrast to the pitched partisan fight of the general election. Obama signaled Wednesday he was ready to ensure a smooth handoff to Trump, calling ""the peaceful transition of power ... one of the hallmarks of our democracy."" Obama met with McCain in 2008, and emails hacked from Obama's transition chairman, John Podesta, who now chairs Hillary Clinton's campaign, revealed that McCain's transition's head of personnel wrote Obama's team a few after the election to offer his services and research into top administration positions, according to emails released by WikiLeaks. Partnership for Public Service recommends Trump set an ambitious goal of having roughly 100 appointments confirmed by the Senate shortly after inauguration and 400 to 500 positions by August recess. If the President-elect is to meet that goal, it will require tireless work before January 20. Johnson recalled Bush's first meeting in the West Wing, at 8:30 a.m. on January 22, 2001. The first order of business was getting official nominations out the door to the Senate for confirmation. Johnson swelled with pride as he recounted how the half-hour meeting went exactly according to plan, with all of his team's preparation paying off. ""I said (to the team), 'I guarantee you the President will never have a better meeting, a more productive, on time, matter of fact, boom, boom, boom meeting than he just had with you all in however long he's going to be president,'"" Johnson said. ""It was true. We were so proud. It was just so exciting. It's the launch of the rocket ship. I think the people at NASA will tell you something like 80% of all the energy required to put a satellite in orbit is required to get the rocket about 100 feet off the launchpad. This is the launch, the transition, in the first days and weeks of an administration is that rocket ship."""

We understand the way to that will be difficult, taking into account the current state of degradation of relations between the US and Russia,"" Putin told Russian state television.""As I have repeatedly said, that is not our fault that Russia-US relations are in that state. Russia is ready and wants to restore the fully fledged relations with the US. I repeat we understand this will be difficult, but we are ready to play our part in it.""But not all Russians were convinced. Garry Kasparov, the Russian chess grandmaster and fierce Putin critic, tweeted his reaction to Trump's victory: ""Winter Is Here."" Kasparov wrote a critical book about Putin called ""Winter Is Coming.""Diplomatic headaches The uncertainty about what a Trump presidency will mean for diplomatic relations was reflected in anxious statements from other parts of the world, particularly Europe. European Council President Donald Tusk said: ""While respecting the democratic choice of the American people, we are at the same time aware of the new challenges that these results bring.  One of them is this moment of uncertainty over the future of our transatlantic relations.""""The events of the last months and days should be treated as a warning sign for all who believe in liberal democracy,"" he said. ""This means that we should finally get our act together and bring back a sense of direction, bring back confidence, bring back a sense of order. Also in the global context whether we talk about trade, migration or security.""French President François Hollande's reaction was also far from enthusiastic.""The people of America have spoken. I have congratulated Mr. Trump, as it is usual in this situation. I thought of Clinton, with whom I worked during the Obama administration. This result leads to uncertainty,"" he said, adding that the United States remained an ally of France's. ""I also urge vigilance because of statements made by Donald Trump,"" he said.Meanwhile, Cuban President Raul Castro sent a congratulatory message to Trump. The President-elect also heard from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with whom he spoke by phone.Global headaches: The 10 biggest issues for TrumpTrump may have to smooth out his relationship with China after he painted the Asian powerhouse as a threat to American jobs during his campaign, making statements such as the United States ""can't continue to allow China to rape our country.""Nonetheless, Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated him in a phone call and later told state-run China Central Television that the two countries ""shoulder a special responsibility"" as the world's largest developed and developing nations.""China pays high attention to the Sino-US relationship and hopes to develop a sound, long-term and stable relationship with the US,"" Xi said. He added he hoped to ""settle all disputes with the US in accordance with the principle of nonconfrontation."" The United States under the Obama administration has built up its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. It regularly carries out military exercises with countries in dispute with Beijing over territory and resources in the South China Sea.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had this to say about the election: ""The stability of the Asia-Pacific region, which is a driving force of the global economy, brings peace and prosperity to the United States. Japan and the United States are unwavering allies tied firmly with the bond of universal values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights and the rule of law.""Issue of US-Mexico wallTrump sparked outrage from Mexico during his presidential bid, describing Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers, and proposing a wall between the two countries at Mexico's expense to stem the flow of migrants.  Former Mexican President Vicente Fox told CNN he was ""shocked by the news"" and said his country would never pay for Trump's proposed wall on the US-Mexico border.""Of course Mexico will never pay for that f***ing wall,"" Fox told CNN's John Defterios at the Global Business Forum on Latin America in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ""He's been very ignorant about the difference between being a mediocre businessman and running a nation, especially a nation like the United States.""But the current Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, struck a more conciliatory tone. ""Mexico and the US are friends, partners and allies and we should continue to collaborate for the competitive development of North America,"" he wrote on Twitter.Peña Nieto said he has agreed to a meeting with Trump, possibly during the transitional period. The Mexican leader said: ""Mexico and the US are allies, associates, and neighbors. When Mexico does well, the US does well.  And when the US does well, Mexico does well. With this in mind, we've agreed that our teams will be in touch to start designing a new work agenda, one that incorporates themes of common interest such as security, cooperation, and our societies' prosperity.""Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro and US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on the phone in a scheduled call on Wednesday, and Maduro asked Kerry to pass his congratulations to Trump, Venezuela's foreign ministry announced. Maduro underlined the need to ""establish a positive work agenda for the next administration.""Trump has also proposed a blanket ban on Muslims entering the country. British Prime Minister Theresa May was diplomatic in her congratulations, saying the two nations shared a ""special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise."" ""We are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defense,"" she said. Far-right parties celebrateEurope's far-right party leaders are cheering Trump's win, including Britain's Nigel Farage, the outgoing leader of the UK Independence Party, and France's Marine Le Pen, who sent Trump a congratulatory tweet early Wednesday, adding a pat on the back for the ""free"" American people. Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the National Front, took to Twitter to say, ""Long live President Trump!"" -- and claim Trump as part of a worldwide populist wave. ""The American people want Donald Trump to be the people's president. Today the United States, tomorrow France. Bravo!"" Le Pen wrote.  Far-right leaders in the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Serbia, among other places, also have voiced support for Trump.

""Probably 2008 would've been a better time for her to run for president. But it's just right time, right place. And again, you've got to give Donald Trump a ton of credit.""Clinton did run for president in 2008 and lost to Barack Obama in the Democratic primary.Asked by host Rich Zeoli why Clinton had the support of the establishment of the Democratic party during this year's primary, Rendell replied it was because of her emotional ties with those in the party.""Because she was someone who had friends that were longtime friends and associates of the party and there's a great feeling,"" he said. ""There's an emotional tie between a lot of Democrats around the country and Hillary Clinton. But you know, that doesn't mean that she was the right candidate for a general election.""He continued, ""And it would be interesting to think of how Bernie Sanders would've done. Bernie Sanders would've lost a few Republicans who voted for Hillary because of some of his economic views but he would've fought Donald pretty hard for those disaffected, angry, and frustrated workers.""Earlier in the interview, Rendell praised President-elect Donald Trump as a ""great campaigner"" and for turning out voters that Mitt Romney did not in 2012.""We can say all we want about Donald Trump and a lot of us have said negative things,"" he said. ""Myself included. But boy he turned out to be a great campaigner. He understood what people were feeling better than anybody else in the race and he hit it right on the head and just got people out to vote who almost never voted before.""Rendell also said in the interview that Clinton's loss in Pennsylvania was not a result of a lack of resources put into the state, criticizing the campaign's strategy in two other usually Democratic states that Trump won. ""Unlike Wisconsin and Michigan, where I think the Clinton campaign didn't put enough resources in and spend enough time, certainly the resources were put in here and the time was spent here and the campaign on the ground was terrific,"" he said.Rendell further criticized some Pennsylvania voters, male and female, who he said were reluctant to elect women to prominent positions, saying that it was one of the reasons Clinton was the wrong presidential candidate.

""I have always felt that Russia and the United States should be able to work well with each other towards defeating terrorism and restoring world peace, not to mention trade and all of the other benefits derived from mutual respect.""One statistic that sums up the Russia issuePutin has been increasing military spending for more than a decade as he modernizes Russia's creaking Soviet-era armed forces. Billions of rubles have flowed into new generation battle tanks, strike aircraft and cruise missiles. Russian troops even have new uniforms replacing the outdated Soviet outfits.One of the most controversial areas of Russian military spending has been nuclear weapons. Russia recently released a first image of its new heavy thermonuclear intercontinental ballistic missile, dubbed by NATO as the ""Satan 2.""Moscow says the missile has a range of over 10 thousand kilometers, can strike the east and west coasts of the United States, and destroy countries the size of France with a single strike. What should be Trump's top priority in the first 100 days?The immediate concern is the conflict in Syria, where Russia is militarily backing Bashar al-Assad, the country's president. The US wants Assad gone and is supporting some anti-government rebels.While past attempts to reach a deal between Washington and Moscow have failed, avoiding a direct confrontation between US and Russian forces - two nuclear superpowers - should be a priority.Trump has repeatedly called for US and Russian forces to work together to destroy jihadist groups in Syria like ISIS, an approach that has been welcomed by the Kremlin.Can Trump fix relations with Russia in the first term?It's theoretically possible, but politically unlikely. The Kremlin wants a grand bargain that would see the US lift economic sanctions on Russia, recognize as legitimate its annexation of Crimea, and accept Moscow's interests in Ukraine and Syria.Putin also wants NATO to roll back its post-Cold War expansion into Eastern Europe, and to abandon current missile defense plans.Progress on any of these issues may help to ease tensions between Russia and the US, but is likely to be painstakingly slow.  How big a priority is Russia for CNN readers?Russia is the number three international priority (behind Syria and China), according to a very unscientific poll of CNN readers who took part in our interactive feature on the 10 biggest global challenges facing the next President.

We do waterboarding on our own soldiers in the military,"" Cotton argued with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""Blitzer interjected, ""But the US doesn't do it anymore."" ""If experienced intelligence officials come to the President of the United States and say we think this terrorist has critical information and we need to obtain it and this is the only way we can obtain it -- it's a tough call. But the presidency is a tough job. And if you're not ready to make those tough calls, you shouldn't seek the office. Donald Trump's a pretty tough guy, and he's ready to make those tough calls,"" Cotton said. Blitzer reminded Cotton of his colleague Sen. John McCain, who himself was tortured as a POW during the Vietnam War, and says that torture is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and International Law.""On this one, I disagree,"" Cotton said, ""Anything that American troops volunteer for, and radio DJs volunteer for, is not torture. If it has to be done to save American lives, that's a tough call."" On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly advocated for waterboarding terror suspect and wants to ""broaden"" existing laws to allow interrogators to use the tactic.""We have to play the game the way they're playing the game. You're not going to win if we're soft and they're, they have no rules,"" Trump told CBS' ""Face The Nation"" in an interview taped in March."	Sen.
