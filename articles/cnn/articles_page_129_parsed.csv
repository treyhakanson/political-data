""Russia and the (Syrian) regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities and children and women.""He added, ""These are acts that beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes. And those who commit these would, and should, be held accountable for these actions.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault joined Kerry in his condemnation, saying the conflict has reached a ""moment of truth"" for the UN Security Council, and dismissing the Syrian regime's assertion that it is targeting terrorists in the besieged city of Aleppo, a stronghold of opposition forces fighting the Assad regime.""These are indeed war crimes,"" Ayrault told reporters Friday .""Bombing access to clean water is not against terrorism,"" he said. ""When you bomb a hospital it is the same. We need a ceasefire as soon as possible.""Kerry has been increasingly harsh in his criticism of the Russian government in recent weeks for its intervention in Syria, where Moscow is backing President Bashar al-Assad in the brutal, five-year-long civil war. Last month, after a brief US and Russian-backed ceasefire agreement fell apart and airstrikes resumed, the secretary of state delivered a blistering address to the UN Security Council, accusing the Assad regime of targeting civilians and Russia of targeting a UN aid convoy.""How can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and acts with impunity?"" Kerry asked at the time. ""You're supposed to sit there and have happy talk in Geneva while the regime drops bombs?"" On Friday, Kerry said attacks on medical professionals in Syria are ""way beyond"" accidental. ""This is a targeted strategy to terrorize civilians and to kill anybody and everybody who is in the way of their military objectives,"" he said. Ayrault said he plans to travel to New York ahead of a UN Security Council meeting Saturday, where the French are expected to put forward a resolution that will call for a ceasefire in Aleppo, including a halt to Syrian and Russian air attacks. Russia is expected to veto the measure, but says it is willing to support a separate UN proposal to escort rebel fighters from the al-Nusra terrorist group out of Aleppo."

Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.""And in closing, Trump added ominously: ""We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.""While Trump refuted the lewd terms in which he discussed women in the 2005 tape, the Republican nominee did not apologize for or address the behavior he said in that conversation that he engaged in toward women, including that he could ""grab them by the pussy"" and that he would sometimes ""just start kissing them.""He later tweeted Saturday morning: ""Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!""Trump's foreshadowing that he will raise Bill Clinton's affairs and sex abuse allegations from the 1990s ""in the coming days"" suggest that the Republican nominee is switching gears after suggesting as recently as Thursday night that he would not raise those scandals in the debate on Sunday.""I think we're all better off if we can do that,"" Trump said at a town hall event in New Hampshire on Thursday night.But the bombshell 2005 recording has now put Trump on his heels -- with Republicans warning of his demise -- and the brash billionaire appears prepared to do what he does best: punch back.Shocking remarksTrump is heard discussing women in vulgar terms during off-camera banter during the taping of a segment for ""Access Hollywood,"" footage which was obtained by The Washington Post.During the lewd conversation captured by a microphone Trump was wearing on his lapel, Trump recounts how he tried to ""fuck"" an unidentified married woman before bragging that he is ""automatically attracted to beautiful (women)"" and just starts ""kissing them.""""Access Hollywood"" later identified the unidentified woman as Nancy O'Dell, who used to work for the show. CNN has attempted to contact O'Dell's manager but has not heard back. In the video, Trump uses the name ""Nancy.""  The conversation came months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania.The 'p-word' problem: Trump's comments pose issue for news outletsHe also said: ""When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.""The jaw-dropping description of uninhibited sexual assault as a benefit of his celebrity poses a substantial setback to Trump's attempts to overcome his deficit with female voters with just a month until Election Day. Clinton and her campaign have repeatedly sought to portray Trump as disrespectful and demeaning toward women, bringing up a slew of rude and vulgar comments Trump has made about women during and before his run for president.House Speaker Paul Ryan, saying he was ""sickened"" by Trump's comments, announced Friday night that the GOP presidential nominee would no longer attend a Republican event in Wisconsin at which the two were slated to appear on Saturday. Multiple sources told CNN that Trump was asked not to come by Ryan, and one source said the message was delivered via intermediaries.Can Trump recover from this?Trump's campaign said vice presidential nominee Mike Pence would represent him instead while the real estate magnate focuses on debate prep.Trump campaign advisers were huddling together in Trump Tower Friday night trying to figure out how to react. Among the options being considered was whether Trump should make a public appearance Friday night.Stakes raised for debateThe comments immediately raised the stakes for Sunday's highly anticipated debate between Trump and Clinton, and the remarks could hand her -- and viewers in the town hall audience -- more evidence to make that point.Trump's lewd comments about women from 2005And the remarks prompted Trump -- for the first time in his nearly 16-month campaign -- to apologize.""This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended,"" Trump said in a statement released Friday.Clinton's campaign tweeted a link to the story and said simply, ""This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.""Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, campaigning in Las Vegas, said Trump's comments ""makes me sick to my stomach.""""I don't like to say the words that he's used in the past when he calls women, 'pigs, dogs and slobs' ... but this is behavior that's just outrageous and so that there would be a news story that would have more statements like this of this kind, I mean, gosh, I'm sad to say that I'm not surprised,"" Kaine said. ""I should be surprised and shocked. I'm sad to say that I'm not.""A Clinton campaign source told CNN the campaign strategy in the wake of the tape will be to press Republicans to say if they still think Trump should be president.Member of 'Central Park 5' blasts Trump""Not just condemn what he said -- but that he should be POTUS,"" the source said.Two people close to the campaign told CNN the former secretary of state was unlikely to speak about the controversy Friday night. But it has become a new subject of her debate prep, and the campaign will pressure Ryan and other Republicans to disavow Trump throughout the weekend.'You can do anything'The hot mic conversation captured in 2005 begins with Trump recounting to ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush how he tried to have sex with a married woman.""I moved on her and I failed. I'll admit it,"" Trump says in the newly-released audio. ""I did try and fuck her. She was married.""""I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married,"" Trump adds, after saying he took the woman -- who is identified only by her first name -- out furniture shopping.WikiLeaks posts emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta""Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look,"" Trump says of the woman.The conversation took place as Trump arrived in a tour bus on the set of ""Days of Our Lives,"" the soap opera where he was set to make a cameo appearance.Before Trump stepped off the bus, he and Bush appear to see an actress from the soap opera who greets Trump and Bush.""Whoa!"" Trump says. ""I've gotta use some tic tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.""""And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,"" Trump says.""Whatever you want,"" says another voice.Priebus condemns remarksRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus condemned Trump's remark in a briefly, tersely-worded statement.""No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever,"" Priebus wrote.Journalists covering a Toledo, Ohio, campaign stop by Pence were ushered out of a restaurant soon after the story broke. The press was supposed to cover Pence looking at a wall of signed hot dogs, including one by Trump, but were later told they couldn't record the moment.Trump's women problemA campaign staffer later told CNN the decision had ""nothing to do with the news.""Pence declined to answer a question about the matter when asked by a reporter following a campaign event in Rossford, Ohio.Some of Trump's old political foes rushed to slam the GOP nominee.""As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump's reprehensible comments degrading women,"" Jeb Bush tweeted.""Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world,"" Mitt Romney said on Twitter.In Colorado, suburban women are key vote""Make no mistake the comments were wrong and offensive. They are indefensible,"" John Kasich added.Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a Republican who recently said he would vote for Trump, called for Trump to drop out of the race.Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who over the summer had said he would vote for Trump, withdrew his support Friday night. So did House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican.Even Terry Gainer, a former US Senate sergeant at arms who rarely makes political comments, emailed CNN to say, ""It is not just woman who should shun Trump. Any gentleman, every husband, each father of a daughter, bother of a sister and sons must be outraged.""How do I explain this to my granddaughters? If only a Republican leader would stand and exhibit a profile in courage.""Staffers shockedReactions from GOP staffers and advisers to Trump ranged from astonished to apoplectic.A close adviser to Trump told CNN the story is ""flat out appalling"" and at this point, they can't even begin to guess whether Trump can come back from this.""This should have never happened. I wish it had never happened. I think I know that men talk this way sometimes, but it's nothing I would ever want to hear or condone or approve of,"" the adviser said. ""My reaction is -- it's appalling. It's just flat out appalling.""The adviser also said Trump's apology does not go far enough.Where Donald Trump gets the 9.7% unemployment rate""Doing anything other than to say it was a grievous error and he apologizes would be a mistake,"" the adviser said. ""I would take it a step further and own to the words as being offensive -- not 'if.'""The adviser, clearly exasperated, added: ""Another day in Trump world ... I hate it.""Asked about the reaction at a campaign field office, a Trump field staffer told CNN there were ""gasps. Collective gasps. We're trying to get our heads around it right now, but there's no way to spin this. There just isn't.""The staffer, who is also paying close attention to Senate efforts, also added, unsolicited: ""Just think of the down-ballot effect. Brutal.""A GOP operative in Ohio voiced similar sentiments.""This is bad. I think this thing is over,"" the staffer said.Reached for comment, a top battleground state staffer told CNN he was ""picking (his) chin off the floor.""Democrats seek to punish GOP Senate candidates over Trump audio""We want every suburban woman's vote in America. This doesn't help with that,"" the staffer said.And a Trump campaign source said they were ""dumbfounded,"" saying the remarks ""could be a death knell.""The source had no predictions on how the article will impact the race, saying the next two days will be critical.""I think the next 48 hours will be the most consequential of the entire election. Right here, right now, this is game time,"" the source said.One senior Trump adviser said simply, ""Ugh.""A stunning apologyThe seriousness of Trump's remarks could be gauged by his apology, the first time he has offered such a concession as a presidential candidate. He has offered ""regret"" on several occasions, notably in August when he acknowledged he sometimes says ""the wrong thing"" and in April when he said retweeting an unflattering picture of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, was ""a mistake.""Previously, Trump has said that he would only apologize for something if he was ""wrong.""""I fully think apologizing is a great thing. But you have to be wrong,"" Trump said in a September 2015 appearance on ""The Tonight Show.""And in a March CNN town hall, Trump could not recount the last time he had apologized for something but said that ""if you're not wrong, I don't believe in apologizing.""Pressed again on specific times when he's apologized for anything in his life.""Yes, I mean -- apologized -- I apologized to my mother years ago for using foul language,"" Trump said. ""I apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion."" Trump and womenTrump has repeatedly bragged that ""nobody respects women more"" than him and has vowed to ""cherish"" and ""protect"" women as president.But the newly unearthed recording is just the latest revelation that shows the crude and at-times sexist terms Trump has used to describe women.During his run for president, Trump suggested that his GOP primary opponent Carly Fiorina, a former Fortune 500 CEO, was too ugly to be elected president, shouting ""look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?"" during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. And Trump also suggested that Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly asked him tough questions during the first GOP debate because she was on her period, saying there was ""blood coming out of her wherever.""Trump most recently stoked controversy after he defended his belief that former Miss Universe Alicia Machado had ""gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem."" He was also accused of calling her ""Miss Piggy"" back in the 1990s.In his numerous appearances on ""The Howard Stern Show,"" Trump also frequently engaged the show's host in lewd and objectifying conversations about women, including discussing his sexual encounters.Head of Trump's religious advisory board dismisses vulgar remarksTrump on the show frequently ranked women on a scale of 1 to 10 and discussed everything from oral sex to anal sex to whether he could get an erection for certain famous women.""A person who is flat-chested is very hard to be a 10,"" Trump said in one segment with Stern.Discussing a famous actress's recent breast augmentation, Trump said: ""The boob job is terrible, you know they look like two light posts coming out of a body.""Trump most recently defended some of the crude comments he has made about women by telling local Las Vegas news station KSNV that ""a lot of that was done for the purposes of entertainment.""""There's nobody that has more respect for women than I do,"" Trump said."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/us-blames-russia-for-targeting-election-systems/index.html	"The announcement marks the first time the US administration has officially accused Russia of hacking into US political systems. Earlier in the week, the two countries broke off formal talks about a ceasefire in Syria.""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. ""The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,"" the statement added. ""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow -- the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.""The announcement was referring to the breach of Democratic National Committee emails and the sites of other Democratic Party-linked organizations disclosed over the summer.RELATED: How Russian hacking has tied US government in knotsOfficials told CNN that Friday's announcement follows long deliberations within the Obama administration as to whether and when to take this step. They have had confidence on the assessment for some time, with the only question being whether to go public. Previously law enforcement and intelligence officials had pointed to Russia anonymously, with lawmakers among the few to go on record accusing Moscow of being behind the intrusions.Russia, however, rejected the US accusations.""This is some kind of nonsense again,"" said Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to the Russian Interfax News Agency.He added, ""Putin's website is attacked daily by several tens of hackers. Many of the attacks are traced to US territory. However, we don't blame the White House or Langley each time this happens.""The administration's decision to finger Russia came amidst the collapse of the US-Russian relationship in other areas, such as Syria, removing incentives for the White House to remain silent on the matter.On Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry went so far as to call for Russian and Syrian military strikes against civilians and medical facilities in Aleppo to be investigated as ""war crimes.""In a further sign of the deteriorating US-Russia relationship, the Wall Street Journal reported later in the day that Moscow deployed nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad. The Russian enclave sits next to US allies Lithuania and Poland, further boosting tensions between Russia and Eastern European countries now in the Western fold.The administration, however, disputes that there was any delay in naming Russia, saying the announcement was made public as soon as the proper evidence to make an official attribution of responsibility was gathered.""We also worked as quickly as possible to release as much information as possible in order to provide state and local officials sufficient time to fortify their infrastructure,"" a senior administration official told CNN.Another senior administration official said that the major focus of making the announcement at this time was an effort to reassure the public that government is on top of the situation, that officials know who carried out the hacking and that the US political system can withstand the attacks. The joint announcement Friday from the two agencies said the US wasn't yet ready to attribute blame for a series of additional hacks and attempted hacks of voter registration websites in several states.But US intelligence and law enforcement officials told CNN that there's strong evidence Russian intelligence services are also behind the cyberattacks against state voter registration websites. There has been debate within the intelligence community about whether to ""name and shame"" the Russians for the cyberattacks. Some in the FBI and Justice Department felt the evidence was strong enough to point the finger, but others in US intelligence agencies and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence felt it could encourage retaliation or the exposure of US intelligence operations.Others in the White House worried about the political overtones over naming Russia, fearing it would be seen as an effort to help Democrat Hillary Clinton given the warm exchanges between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.RELATED: Kerry calls for probe of Russian, Syrian 'war crimes'The attack on the Democratic National Committee exposed emails appearing to favor Clinton over opponent Bernie Standards exchanged between senior staffers and the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was eventually required to step down following their disclosure.Hackers thought to be working for Russian intelligence have also carried out a series of cyber breaches targeting reporters at The New York Times and other US news organizations.Democrats on Congress' intelligence committees were ahead of the administration by a few weeks in deciding to publicly point to Moscow, releasing a statement on September 22 that said they had ""concluded"" that Russian intelligence agencies were responsible for the intrusions.Trump has voiced skepticism about whether the Russians are to blame for the hacks, saying at a recent debate that it could also be ""somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.""The Clinton camp on Friday sought to turn the latest conclusion into a broader attack on Trump's friendly posture toward the country.""The world now knows, beyond the shadow of any doubt, that the hack of the Democratic National Committee was carried out by the Russian government in a clear attempt to interfere with the integrity of our elections,"" said John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chair, in a statement. ""The only remaining question is why Donald Trump continues to make apologies for the Russians.""RELATED: WikiLeaks posts emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John PodestaPodesta himself became the latest Democrat to be a victim of hacking, when Wikileaks published his personal emails later Friday. He ascribed the attack to ""the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,"" though US authorities have yet to determine who was behind the breach.Some Republicans on Capitol Hill who have called for a tough stance against the Kremlin applauded the Obama administration decision but pressed for more confrontation. ""We cannot allow such actions to go unanswered,"" said GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""Vladimir Putin's regime has crossed a line, and he should know that the United States will not allow our political process or our future to be dictated by foreign adversaries.""""Today was just the first step -- Russia must face serious consequences,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. ""The United States must upend Putin's calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, cyber, and economic response.""One Democrat offered a less hawkish response.Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for the US to work with European allies to ""develop a concerted response that protects our institutions and deters further meddling.""His counterpart on the Senate intelligence committee, Dianne Feinstein, called the hacking ""intolerable.""She said that the administration's decision to officially acknowledge the Russian role after she and Schiff came forward to point the finger at Russia last month ""conveys the seriousness of the threat.""CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Interfax is not a state-owned Russian news agency."

Rick Scott said his state wouldn't extend voter registration deadlines, after a Hillary Clinton spokesman said they should consider it. The Republican governor said ""people have had time to register.""The deadline to register in Florida is Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Thursday that the campaign's ""hope would be that a little bit more time will be given for people who were expecting to be able to get registered before the election.""Hurricanes can upend politicsSouth Carolina, which is also in the path of the storm, originally had its voter registration deadline Saturday. But the state election commission on Thursday extended that deadline to Tuesday, given Post offices and government buildings being closed for the storm and for Monday's Columbus Day holiday.  Swing state North Carolina is also in the path of the storm and is a hotly contested state in November. But its voter registration deadline in that state isn't until next Friday.Democrats have been outpacing Republicans in early voting measures in both Florida and North Carolina. After Scott's decision, Democrats and election experts piled on the governor, saying it was a poor decision.  ""Gov. Scott is awful.  Is disenfranchising voters really the GOP's only strategy to try to win?  Sadly it seems so,"" wrote Democratic campaign lawyer Marc Elias on Twitter. ""A sign of dying party is the belief that less people exercising the right to vote is key to victory,"" wrote Dan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to President Barack Obama.University of Florida Research Foundation political science professor Daniel A. Smith also criticized Scott's decision, saying it would have a public safety benefit. ""Seriously, ‪@FLGovScott? ""Everybody has had plenty of time to register.""?? In 2012, 50k citizens reg'd in last 5 days before Oct 8 deadline,"" Smith tweeted. He added: ""Had @FLGovScott extended voter registration deadline, Floridians could focus solely on lives/family/property and do VR in coming weeks."" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, along with Deputy FEMA Administrator Joe Nimmich, briefed Clinton and Trump on Hurricane Matthew's expected impact and the federal response over the phone, DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron said in a statement."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/politics/donald-trump-town-hall-new-hampshire/index.html	"And after fielding a dozen softballs for just a half-hour from a hand-picked group of voters inside the small, sweltering wood-paneled room, it seemed Trump was right: the forum had ""nothing to do"" with the upcoming debate, despite Trump campaign sources telling CNN earlier Thursday that the evening's town hall event would serve as a practice run.If it did, Trump's performance Thursday night and his repeated mocking of the importance of debate prep raised serious questions about how Trump will perform at the debate Sunday just two weeks after he botched his first debate appearance due to what aides described as a lack of preparation.Hurricane politics, on The Daily David Chalian""They were saying this is practice for Sunday. This isn't practice,"" Trump said. ""We're just here because we wanted to be here.""And with a touch of bravado, he repeatedly mocked Clinton for taking time off the campaign trail to prepare for the debate, stating multiple times that she was ""resting,"" in keeping with his past critiques of Clinton's health and stamina.""Do you really think that Hillary Clinton is debate prepping for three or four days?"" Trump asked mockingly. ""It's not debate prep. She's resting, she's resting. She's resting and I want to be with the American people.""But as Trump prepared to field questions from voters on Thursday, it appeared as though the event had been set up to prepare Trump for his next showdown with Clinton.Howie Carr, a talk radio host supporting Trump, would serve as moderator, and he announced to Trump that he would man a clock timing his responses to two minutes each. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a town hall aficionado who has been helping Trump prepare for the coming debate, stood just a couple yards away, carefully observing Trump's performance.National poll: Independents help Clinton build leadAnd as Carr read questions from the voters in the room, each would stand up to identify themselves, giving Trump a chance to interact -- with pleasantries or an exchange of glances -- with them.But Trump revealed little interest in participating in a mock debate.Rather than working the room, Trump remained standing in the same spot, just a few feet from Carr who read off the questions Trump's supporters had submitted.And while he offered some jokes in an effort to connect with the crowd, Trump made little effort to answer specific questions posed to him and frequently went off on tangents as if he were delivering a speech at one of his rallies.When asked how he would define the middle class, Trump offered up a platitude that ""the middle class has been forgotten in this country"" before pivoting to his tax plan and proposals to cut regulations. He did not offer a definition.And when asked whether he would fire FBI Director James Comey -- who recommended no charges against Clinton after investigating her use of a private email server -- Trump demurred, saying simply that he was ""very disappointed.""New Hampshire poll: Clinton holds 2-point edge While Carr followed up a couple of times to press Trump further on a question, the supportive radio host did little in the way of offering Trump a preview of the tough-minded journalists who will moderate Sunday's debate.New Hampshire voters pride themselves in posing tough, thoughtful and well-informed questions to their candidates -- they believe it is part of their role in testing a candidate's fitness to be commander in chief. All of the questions were handpicked on Thursday night, and many of them were laughably soft -- including one asking Trump about his most important early childhood memory. (He recounted playing with blocks at his father's feet in his office, a memory that his daughter, Ivanka Trump, also recalled in her speech at the Republican National Convention). Trump also opened the forum by delivering opening remarks comparable to those he would offer up at a rally, addressing everything from his standing in various polls to mocking Clinton's decision to take time off from the campaign trail to prepare from the next debate.Trump also read from prepared remarks extending his prayers to those living in the path of Hurricane Matthew, a Category 4 storm set to make landfall in Florida on Friday.""To all of my friends in Florida, please know that we are praying for you and everyone in the path you've got to take care of yourself, you've got to get out of the area, you've got to listen. You've got to listen because it could be a really bad one,"" Trump said, adding that he spoke with Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a supporter of his, earlier in the day.Still, Trump offered some insight into the performance he may deliver on Sunday -- one peppered with jokes and his knack for storytelling, time permitting.And Trump also showed that he can effectively interact with voters as he delivers his responses.Dismissing any concerns about Republican holdouts on his candidacy, Trump suggested Republican officials endorsing Clinton this cycle were doing so because he would ""never use these people."" ""So then, they announced in a group they're going to Hillary,"" Trump said, prompting a man near the front row to begin shaking his head.""You, you understand,"" Trump said.In the lead-up to Thursday night's town hall, Trump aides would not say on the record that the New Hampshire event was a mock forum to prepare Trump for Sunday.Boris Epshteyn, a senior Trump campaign adviser, insisted the forum was not a practice session for Sunday, but still added that the town hall would help showcase why Trump will be effective in Sunday's town hall format.Epshteyn said Trump can ""relate to the American people like no other candidate since Ronald Reagan"" and suggested Clinton would struggle on Sunday because ""you can't be scripted in a forum."""

""There is no other solution to Syria other than involving Russia.""Similarly, he said, ""There is no solution to North Korea without joining hands with China to achieve that diplomatically.""He spoke soon after Secretary of State John Kerry blasted Russia for committing war crimes alongside the regime of its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, after several rounds of intensive diplomacy with Moscow gave way to further violence in the besieged city of Aleppo.The Syrian civil war has caused problems for Johnson in his bid to win the presidency as a third-party candidate after he appeared not to know what Aleppo was.The former New Mexico governor then suffered another foreign policy gaffe when he struggled on MSNBC last week to name a foreign leader he respects. He later told CNN's ""New Day"" he didn't answer because he's met ""a lot of empty suits"" in politics that he previously placed on pedestals, a point he reiterated when asked about the incidents at the Chicago event.Johnson said that the US shouldn't go to war with Russia over Syria, nor over the contested islands in the South China Sea.US allies in the region have been troubled by China's construction of islands in the disputed waters, around which it then claims air and maritime rights, and the US has frequently sent military planes and ships to patrol the area. Johnson, however, said it was only a matter of time before China occupied the rocky shoals.""We don't want to go to war over uninhabited rocks in the South China Sea,"" he said. ""They're there now,"" he added, referring to China, ""so this would require military action on our part."" Johnson said he plans to honor NATO treaties and is confident that Russia knows that the US will come to the aid of countries if attacked. America's nuclear weapons and military strength are deterrents, he said.RELATED: Why is Gary Johnson still in the race?""Russia knows that we have NATO alliances. They know that we will come to the aid of those countries if they are invaded. And they will not invade those countries because they know that. And we will honor those treaties and obligations,"" Johnson said. The presidential candidate also told a questioner that he is not a supporter of expanding the government's surveillance capabilities to prevent terrorism and that if elected, he would make some major changes to current policies.""As president, I believe I can do this by executive order. I would turn the satellites away from you and I as US citizens,"" he said. ""There is due process. If there is a suspected terrorist, you can go to a judge, you can get a warrant to tap that individual's information.""But Johnson said he is not a supporter of collecting the private information of millions of citizens.""And based on what I know, I would pardon Edward Snowden,"" he said to applause, referring to the NSA contractor who leaked details of extensive government surveillance programs.

But her aides are quick to point out that the former president was not attempting to condemn the entire Obamacare system, just the ways it has failed certain people.""I probably would have chosen different words,"" John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign and a former White House chief of staff to Bill Clinton, told CNN's Jeff Zeleny following the vice presidential debate. ""But I think what he was saying is: the law has been a success, but there's still more to do."""	Bill Clinton's 'crazy system' Obamacare gaffe lands in RNC mailer	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/cuyahoga-ohio-critical-counties/index.html	Things don't look great for Hillary Clinton in Ohio — and her campaign shows it.Clinton has visited this battleground state a lot less than others. Although she had a banner week in Ohio  — grabbing the endorsement of the one and only LeBron James, star of the Cleveland Cavaliers — her husband, former President Bill Clinton, put a damper on things with his criticism of Obamacare.And Republicans have made plain their intention to go after the vote in the heart of an area Clinton should reliably win: Cuyahoga County. With its principle city of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County is a more urban, African-American and impoverished area than much of the rest of Ohio. Google Trends data show above-average interest in police brutality, race and guns. Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was shot and killed by a police officer-in-training in 2014 in Cleveland, which could explain the county's high interest. Polling consistently has shown Donald Trump's poor performance in areas like this, and the Republican nominee keeps controversial stances on those search topics. If Clinton can get Cuyahoga County to turn out, it could help her keep Ohio in play. But if the Republican Party's extensive efforts in the battleground state are effective and Cleveland opts to stay home on Election Day, Trump will win Ohio.Bear in mind, Ohio is extremely likely to make or break Trump's chances at the White House. Without a win in Ohio, he would almost certainly lose.PopulationWho's who, what's whatAlso, did we mention LeBron James?Clinton clearly seemed to appreciate his endorsement.Trump, who has some basketball supporters of his own, has had kind words for the NBA star in the past.RepresentationPopularityTop searchesWho's searching?TrendingSearches by candidate	Critical counties: Cuyahoga County, Ohio, could be Hillary Clinton's bright spot	['Clinton', 'Trump']	['guns']

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/politics/had-abraham-lincoln-lived-counterfactual/index.html	"No wonder that, a century-and-a-half later, today's White House candidates continue to argue about what Lincoln would have done, how Lincoln might have led and whose agenda Lincoln might have endorsed. He remains both an inspiration and an aspiration.But what if Booth had misfired on that April evening at Ford's Theatre? What if Lincoln had lived to lead? Would we still be exalting him as the greatest American president?In a word, yes. True, post-Civil War Reconstruction proved too much for Lincoln's White House successor, the hapless and bigoted Andrew Johnson. And the same period would have tested even the politically savvy and sensitive Lincoln. But unlike Johnson, Lincoln had already sealed a preeminent reputation.As he was signing the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, Lincoln had confided to eyewitnesses at the scene: ""If my name ever goes into history, it will be for this act."" And he was right. Black freedom, along with solidifying national authority and making the union permanent and powerful, would have stood as legacy achievements even if peacetime unity had unraveled during a second Lincoln administration.That said, Lincoln would have been required to summon all his skills of persuasion to forge what he called, in the inaugural address he delivered just six weeks before his death, ""a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."" Had Lincoln lived, the punitive Republican supermajority in Congress would have been just as reluctant to readmit Democratic Southerners to their pre-war seats, just as determined to disenfranchise Southern whites as they enfranchised Southern blacks.It's of course impossible to predict whether Lincoln's survival might have meant a cleaner path to reunion and reconciliation, and toward the truly equal biracial society that has eluded us ever since.One thing is certain: In what proved to be his final speech three evenings before his death, Lincoln had become the first president ever to support black voting. John Wilkes Booth, who lurked on the White House lawn that night as Lincoln spoke from a second-floor window, muttered, ""That means n----r equality. That's the last speech he'll ever make."" And he soon made good on his threat. We should take Lincoln at his word.He would have fought for and perhaps secured black voting rights in the postwar North and South.He would surely have taken up cherished and deferred domestic priorities, too, particularly ""internal improvements"" as they were called: roads, canals, bridges, and railroads -- projects he had long championed. Lincoln might well have become ""the infrastructure president.""Free college for all? Lincoln had signed the law authorizing the first land grant colleges, schools that evolved into today's state universities, not to mention Cornell. Count on his becoming the ""education president,"" too.Above all, had Lincoln lived to continue the second American Revolution that ended slavery by the 1860s, the third revolution --the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- might not have been necessary. He was that gifted.We will never know any of this for sure, but one thing is certain: Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and even Libertarian Gary Johnson (via a bizarre five-minute TV spot featuring a top-hatted Lincoln re-enactor) have all tried evoking Lincoln this year. One of them will be elected in November to continue what Lincoln once called the nation's ""unfinished work"" of uniting us. Without Lincoln, the right to choose our next national leader might have been lost altogether. With him, however -- had he lived -- we might not be facing half the nagging crises that still plague us."	What if Abraham Lincoln had lived?	['Black', 'Trump']	[]
