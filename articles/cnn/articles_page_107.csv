Coupled with Democrats' advantage in the Electoral College, the slate of polls suggests that only an extremely narrow path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency remains for Trump, who has staked his candidacy in part on flipping some traditionally Democratic states. Additionally, a Republican National Committee source told CNN's Sara Murray Thursday that the Trump campaign decided to pull resources from the swing state of Virginia, essentially conceding the state to Clinton. According to CNN's latest battleground map, Trump would need to win one of these states -- Michigan, Wisconsin, or Pennsylvania -- to get more than the 270 electoral votes needed for victory, even if he also captured Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, and every other state Mitt Romney won in 2012. A new North Carolina poll shows Clinton and Trump running neck-and-neck and a Utah survey shows Trump with a narrow lead over Clinton.PennsylvaniaA Bloomberg Politics poll released on Thursday found Clinton leading Trump by 9 points in Pennsylvania. According to the poll, Clinton is ahead of Trump 48% to 39% in a four-way race in the Keystone State. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson draws 6% support, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein gets 3%. Clinton's lead in Pennsylvania is driven by a significant advantage in the Philadelphia suburbs, a crucial area where some of the state's swingiest voters live. The poll found Clinton leading Trump across four suburban Philadelphia counties, 59% to 31%, with a broad range of demographic advantages.  The poll also surveyed Pennsylvania voters' opinions on the tape of Trump bragging about groping women during a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" appearance. Sixty percent said the tape bothered them ""a lot,"" a number that climbs to 80% in the suburban counties.The poll, which was also conducted after the second presidential debate, found that Trump's performance on Sunday helped stabilize his numbers. According to Bloomberg, Trump showed ""more strength on Monday and Tuesday than on the two previous days of polling.""The Bloomberg poll of Pennsylvania was conducted between October 7-11 and surveyed 806 likely voters across the state and 373 likely voters in the four suburban Philadelphia counties. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 points for the state, and plus or minus 5.1 points for the suburban counties. MichiganA Michigan poll released on Wednesday showed an 11-point lead for Clinton, though a large bloc of voters remains undecided.According to the poll from the Detroit News/WDIV, Clinton leads Trump 42% to 31%, while Johnson receives 10% and Stein trails at 4%. Twelve percent say they don't know who they'll support.As was the case in Pennsylvania, the Michigan poll found that likely voters were turned-off by the Trump tape. One-quarter of Republicans said Trump should drop out of the presidential race as a result of the recording, and the poll showed Clinton's lead expanded from 7 points in late September largely because of a collapse in Trump's support, rather than a surge for her. Clinton's lead in Michigan is powered by a major advantage among women voters -- Clinton gets 48% to Trump's 27%. She also has an edge in ""vote-rich southeast Michigan,"" the Detroit News reported, where she leads by 18 points. Still, a majority of voters have unfavorable opinions of both candidates, though Clinton's favorability rating is 13 points higher than Trump.The Detroit News/WDIV poll was conducted between October 10-11, and surveyed 600 likely Michigan voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 4 points. WisconsinA poll from the Marquette University Law School showed a large Clinton lead in Wisconsin, where Trump actually held an edge before the release of the damaging ""Access Hollywood"" recording.  The poll, which was released Wednesday, had Clinton 7 points ahead of Trump, 44% to 37%. Johnson received 9% support, while Stein drew 3%. But while the Marquette poll was conducted amid the fallout from the tape, it was completed before the second presidential debate, which other polls found had improved Trump's numbers. According to the survey, Trump led Clinton 41% to 40% among likely voters polled on Thursday. On Friday -- the day the Washington Post released the lewd tape -- Trump's numbers began to fall, and Clinton led 44% to 38%. Trump's numbers really cratered over the weekend. Likely voters polled on Saturday and Sunday drove Clinton to a 19-point edge, 49% to 30%, a dramatic reversal from the one-point edge Trump held days earlier. The shift was evident across all demographic groups, even those that favor Trump. Among men, who have heavily backed Trump, Clinton turned a 16-point deficit into a 1-point advantage by the end of the poll. And Republican support for Trump fell below 80% by Sunday, while Democratic support for Clinton settled around 90%.Additionally, Wisconsin voters were more likely to say they were ""very or somewhat comfortable"" with the idea of Clinton being president than Trump (46% to 35%); more likely to say that Clinton ""cares about people like me"" (47% to 35%); and more likely to say Clinton ""shows good judgment"" (48% to 28%). However, Clinton is viewed as slightly more dishonest than Trump -- 29% say Clinton is honest, compared to 35% for Trump. The Marquette University Law School poll was conducted between October 6-9, and surveyed 839 likely voters. The margin of error for the entire poll is plus or minus 3.9 points; the margin of error for Thursday is plus or minus 5.9 points and plus or minus 7.8 points for Friday and the Saturday and Sunday samples.North CarolinaIn the Tar Heel State, a Suffolk University poll released Thursday shows Clinton is leading with 45% support, Trump with 43% and Johnson with 5%. The poll is consistent with results from surveys taken after the first presidential debate and before the released of the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape.The poll surveyed 500 likely voters between October 10-12 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.And a NBC/WSJ/Marist poll out Thursday shows Clinton is leading Trump by four points in the state.In the poll, 45% of likely voters in North Carolina said they support Clinton, while 41% support Trump and 9% support Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. Green Party candidate Jill Stein didn't qualify to make the ballot in the state.The new NBC/WSJ poll of North Carolina was conducted Oct. 10-12 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.UtahA Monmouth University poll of Utah published Thursday showed Trump with the support of 34% of likely voters, Clinton with 28%, independent Evan McMullin with 20% and Johnson with 9%.  A Y2 Analytics poll, published Wednesday by Mormon church-owned Deseret News, found both Clinton and Trump at 26%, with McMullin at 22% and Johnson at 14%.The Monmouth poll surveyed 403 likely Utah voters between October 10-12 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.OhioAnother NBC/WSJ/Marist poll out Thursday shows Trump is leading Clinton by one point in the state of Ohio. In the poll, 42% of likely voters in Ohio said they support Trump, while 41% support Clinton, 9% support Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 4% support Green Party candidate Jill Stein.The new NBC/WSJ poll of Ohio was conducted Oct. 10-12 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points."

In response, they have pledged ""war"" on the Clinton campaign, hoping that an increase in negativity will turn off so many Americans that turnout will be dramatically low.Clinton's campaign, while nodding to the fact that they are concerned about the strategy, have said made a concerted effort to push that their ground game -- and early voting that is already taking place in a number of battleground states -- will render the strategy moot.""All of the data that we are seeing is reinforcing that this will be the biggest election and biggest turnout in our history,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said on a conference call about turnout with reporters Thursday.Mook went state by state highlighting turnout numbers that hint at not only a high turnout election, but one that favors Clinton.Mook highlighted higher-than-normal expected turnout among Hispanics in Florida, North Carolina and Nevada. Hispanic voters overwhelmingly back Clinton and Mook stressed that in each swing that registration numbers and early vote figures -- some of which are proprietary to the campaign and not specified to the media -- refute Trump's strategy.John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, said this week that Trump's strategy is to ""disgust everyone with our Democratic dialogue so that they won't come out to the polls.""Trump's aides have backed up that comment. On Thursday, a Trump aide described their strategy towards Clinton as ""war.""Early in the campaign, Clinton's campaign believed that Trump's comments about Latinos, African-Americans and women would boost turnout in those communities, surpassing whatever gains the Republican nominee enjoyed with white, working-class voters. And aides said Thursday that, for now, that theory still holds.But as Trump goes more negative, there is a fear that the tenor of the debate could depress day-of voting."

It's unclear which specific case Trump is referencing in the clip. ""Well, I don't think the male students have been hurt by it,"" Trump replies. ""In fact, they're going around bragging about it as I understand it.""""Wow,"" the reporter says.""I don't see a lot of damage done,"" Trump continues, before adding, ""But it's a very unusual situation. I would say her husband cannot be happy.""The Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment.Several reports have surfaced in recent days of Trump making vulgar comments about women or alleging inappropriate touching by him.  CBS unearthed 1992 footage from the show ""Entertainment Tonight"" wherein Trump suggests to a 10-year-old girl that he is ""going to be dating her in 10 years."" Trump's comments on women and sex in general has come under renewed scrutiny after last Friday, when The Washington Post published an audiotape of Trump  bragging about how he can grab a women's genitals because he's a star.""And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,"" Trump said in the 2005 hot mic comments. The New York Times on Wednesday published a report featuring two women who accused Trump of groping them. A Trump campaign spokesperson called the report ""fiction.""""This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,"" said Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller.

Third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein received 7% and 3% support, respectively. Clinton held a wider lead over Trump in a head-to-head matchup, where she received 49% support to Trump's 41%. The poll showed Clinton gaining since the last Fox News survey released, which had her up only by 2 percentage points, within the poll's margin of error.Thursday's poll was largely taken before a series of revelations surfaced Wednesday night from several women alleging Trump had touched them inappropriately. It was also taken as WikiLeaks had continued releasing thousands of emails apparently hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's personal email account.Clinton held a 19-point lead among women, a 16-point lead among young voters and a whopping 62-point lead among non-white voters. Trump's performance among likely-voting males was at 5 percentage points higher than Clinton.The majority of respondents said they did not believe Trump was qualified to be president, while 68% of them said Clinton was either ""somewhat"" or ""very"" qualified for the job.On matters of trust, the gap between the two had narrowed to the point that both were now viewed by only a third of voters as trustworthy.Additionally, a slim majority said Clinton was a ""good role model,"" while only one-in-five said the same for the Republican nominee.The poll was conducted October 10-12, using landlines and cell phone interviews, and was based on responses from 1,006 randomly chosen registered voters.

According to the Times, the first incident happened nearly three decades ago and the second in 2005. Jessica Leeds told the Times that Trump ""grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt"", while they were traveling together on a flight. The second accusation came from Rachel Crooks. She claimed that while working as a receptionist at a real estate investment development company, Trump began kissing her, according to the New York Times.CNN has yet to independently confirm the accounts in the New York Times article. Burnett pressed Falwell on whether he would still support Trump if the allegations in the Times report are true. ""I'm not going to say anything to besmirch the character of any of these women,"" Falwell Jr. said. ""The New York Times is very anti-Trump."" The Trump campaign released a statement, blasting the Times for trying to undermine the election.""This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous.

The speech was an uncharacteristically direct attack from the first lady, who said she eschewed her ""normal campaign speech"" because it would have been ""dishonest and disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.""The first lady never addressed Trump by name, referring to him only as a ""candidate."" She began the speech by reflecting on what she called a ""rough week in an already rough election.""Trump defends himself against allegations of groping womenObama lamented the ""hurtful, hateful language about women"" throughout the campaign, saying it was ""painful"" to those who expected leaders should meet ""basic standards of human decency.""Her voice quivered as she recalled a meeting with young women at the White House on Tuesday.""I told them they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect,"" Obama said. ""I wanted them to understand that the measure of any society is how it treats women and girls."" Obama said the comments made by Trump in the video, which was recorded in 2005, had left her ""shaken.""""I can't stop thinking about this,"" she said. ""It has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted.""She added: ""I know this is a campaign but this isn't about politics. It's about basic human decency.""In the 2005 video, Trump can be heard describing in graphic terms how he uses his star power to force himself upon women. Since the footage was published last week by The Washington Post, several women have come forward to say that Trump had touched them inappropriately. Trump has denied those allegations, and has dismissed the remarks made in the video as ""locker room talk.""At the rally on Thursday, Obama rejected that explanation.""This was not just a lewd conversation,"" she said. ""This wasn't just locker room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turned on the TV.""Referring to the spate of allegations levied against Trump, Obama said ""it now seems very clear that this wasn't an isolated incident.""Trump faces more groping allegations""This is not something that we can ignore,"" Obama added. ""It's not something that we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season.""Obama also cautioned against a ""protest vote"" and urged the supporters gathered to do ""everything possible to elect Hillary Clinton."" ""If you vote for someone other than Hillary ... you are helping to elect her opponent,"" Obama said.""We need to recover from our shock and our depression,"" she added, referring to the sordid campaign developments, ""and we need to do what women have always done in this country: we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work.""Clinton praised the first lady's support during a campaign event in San Francisco. ""If you haven't seen it, I hope you will see Michelle Obama's speech today in New Hampshire,"" Clinton said. ""And once again, she gave a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election, but about who we are as Americans. And we cannot let this pessimism, this dark and divisive and dangerous vision in America take hold in anybody's heart. We have to keep lifting up this campaign.""President Barack Obama later told a crowd of Ohio Democrats that his wife's speech in New Hampshire reminded him again of why he married her.""She was pretty good,"" he joked. ""That's why you get married. To improve your gene pool.

Trump World is angry, resentful and in no mood to hear the Washington consensus that the GOP nominee is driving his party over a precipice just 26 days before America chooses its next president. As he faces the toughest crisis of his campaign -- battling a growing number of stories about harassment of women and fighting a war with his party's leader -- Trump is serving up a brew of the hard right's most enduring obsessions. Speaking before adoring crowds, he lambasts the ""crooked"" Clintons, calls out the ""liberal"" media and torches the elites of his own party, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan.Every Trump supporter who is asked believes that their candidate crushed Hillary Clinton in the brutal, scorched earth debates. They are certain that polls suggesting he will lose the election are missing hordes of true believers who will show up on November 8.Trump: Clinton 'has to go to jail'""I think he burnt her up. She deserves to be burned up anyway and he did a very good job of it,"" Roger Coon, a 70-year-old Trump supporter in Ocala, Florida, said as he waited for his candidate to show up for a rally on Wednesday.No concern about tapeThere's no concern among the supporters at Trump's recent rallies about the video tape released last Friday revealing Trump talking about women in extraordinarily crude terms. New allegations in The New York Times that Trump groped women surfaced after he had left the trail for the day. Trump denied the claims and they are almost certain not to dent his support among his core loyalists.If the reaction to Trump's lewd ""Access Hollywood"" tape is a guide, Trump's backers are forgiving and view such transgressions as something that happened well in the past.""That has nothing to do with whether or not he can lead this nation,"" said Joy Giles, a Trump supporter at a rally in Panama City, Florida on Tuesday night. ""I think Hillary Clinton has done a lot worse in her lifetime as a politician (including) Benghazi. Trump didn't kill anybody.""The overwhelming feeling at a Trump rally is that the United States is 26 days from some kind of cultural and political apocalypse.""We are on the edge of a cliff, we are about to see the end of America,"" said Dennis Baxley, a Florida lawmaker serving as Trump's warm-up act before his Ocala rally on Monday.The impending doom is taken in stride. Trump in 2012 on female teachers accused of statutory rape: 'I don't see a lot of damage done'In Ocala, one man had a tee-shirt reading ""Bill Clinton is a rapist"" while, nearby, an elderly couple danced, resplendent in head-to-toe suits made up of the Stars and Stripes.But there's no mistaking the seething anti-establishment anger under the surface. One woman was speaking to a CNN reporter Wednesday about why she likes Trump, when a couple came up to her and ordered her to clam up because journalists twist the truth and can't be trusted.The woman tried to carry on but finally stopped talking when the woman started screaming ""Trump, Trump"" to drown her out -- an example of the anti-media hysteria that the GOP nominee whips up at his rallies.One Trump supporter, PH Culver, of Marin County explained that the hostility is so acute because Trump supporters sincerely believe the media is biased against them.""Over and over and over again, the media does not represent conservative America,"" Culver said, complaining that reporters had done too little to probe the Clinton marriage and had no interest in traditional family issues.For his part, Trump is giving his crowds exactly what they want.Hailed at ralliesHis enthusiastic reception during campaign swing across the Sunshine State this week underscore the grass roots enthusiasm that no previous GOP nominee has conjured in years. His vitriol might offend media commentators -- and the establishment of his own party -- but Trump is hailed at rallies as a kind of secular prophet by a lost political tribe that has finally found a champion with the guts to say what he thinks.""They have a problem with the fact that he's real that he talks to us, that he gets us,"" said Sharon Day, a RNC co-chair and fervent Trump supporter, said at a Trump rally in Ocala Wednesday that boiled with anger at political elites.But giving his army what it wants is one thing. Winning the election is another.Trump's refuge in politics of resentment won't likely help reverse the slide he's suffered over the last two weeks that has all but closed off his path to the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House.Donald Trump threatens to sue New York Times over sexual harassment report If campaigns at this late stage are about broadening appeal to try to piece together a plurality of voters, Trump seems to be doing the exact opposite, a strategy that may hint at what he really thinks of his prospects of victory.Since his debate showdown on Sunday when he tried to eviscerate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's character and revived long dormant scandals over Bill Clinton's infidelities, Trump has stepped it up another notch.""She has to go to jail,"" Trump warned in his second rally of the day Wednesday, referring to Clinton's email controversy.Adding to the sense of surreal unreality, Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Brianna Keilar Wednesday that Trump's words should not necessarily be taken at face value.""You're talking it literally,"" Conway said on ""The Situation Room."" ""What a lot of Americans want to know, why this woman wasn't punished and why news outlets think this is ok.""Intimate connection with the audienceDespite the vitriol and negativity, there is no denying the intimate connection between Trump and his audience. In some ways, his rallies are an opportunity for his supporters to vent long pent-up frustrations. They also reflect the gaping cultural and political divides opened by the 2016 campaign, which will be almost impossible to close whoever wins the election.Trump relishes his role at the rallies as he joyfully climbs into his attacks on the Clintons and the media, clearly gaining affirmation from the adulation. His humor comes across far more easily in a live setting than on television when he often seems harsh. Paul Ryan facing threats to speakership over Trump flapNow deprived of his go-to boast, about his winning poll numbers that carried him through the primary race, Trump now seeks solace in the size of his crowds, telling his audience on Tuesday that a famous, unnamed musician complimented him about his drawing power.I ""get the biggest crowds in the world for a guy without a guitar, which is an interesting way of looking at it,"" Trump said.Trump's companion on the trail, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has taken to to citing a metric that always tempts troubled campaigns — boasting about crowd size.""Hillary Clinton wishes she could draw a crowd like this. She even had to drag out Al Gore, remember him!"" Giuliani said Wednesday.Donald Trump's GOP civil warBut now and again, an almost wistful feeling seems to overcome Trump, in a possible sign that though his army of supporters will never desert him, he may not be as confident as they are about the destiny of the election. On Wednesday afternoon, for instance, Trump admitted he was baffled that he was doing so poorly with women voters in the polls.""I don't understand. Every place I go, I see hundreds of women for Trump and then I see a poll: he's not doing well with women. I don't know. I don't get it,"" Trump said. And at the end of a long day on Tuesday, Trump even appeared close to admitting his stunning, uproarious political journey could be nearing its end.""You better make sure we win or there will be no more Trump rallies — the Hell with that,"" Trump said. ""To Hell with the rallies."""	Trump's most enthusiastic supporters stand by their man

Rescuers had faced delays during medical emergencies while on the bridge, according to a letter obtained by CNN.

Two senior government officials -- former Christie Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly and Port Authority Deputy Director Bill Baroni --  were indicted in May 2015. Both were indicated as part of the Bridgegate scheme, receiving charges of conspiracy and fraud, among others. The case against Kelly and Baroni was taken to court late September, where federal prosecutors alleged in their opening statements that Christie, along with his confidants, had knowledge of the closures.
