We're not playing games, right?"" Trump said taking the stage here. ""We'll call this the midnight special speech.""But his aggressive five-rally schedule on Sunday that didn't begin before noon in Iowa -- with a 20-minute delay -- also caused the Republican nominee to keep supporters waiting for hours.By the time he arrived in suburban Detroit for his third rally of the day after a lengthy drive from the airport, the billionaire was more than an hour behind schedule. A packed house of nearly 8,000 greeted him there, setting up local news reports before Election Day for talk of a possible Trump upset in the reliably blue state, even though Hillary Clinton maintains a solid advantage there.In Moon, Pennsylvania, where Clinton is also leading, Trump showed up more than two hours late to raucous cheers from a crowd of supporters in an airport hangar who just moments earlier appeared weary and frustrated as they waited, some sitting on the cold floor of the dark hangar.One woman who was waiting with her elderly mother told reporters that Trump had lost her vote because of how late he was, which prompted a group of women Trump supporters nearby to begin shouting at her, accusing her of being a ""traitor.""There, the Republican nominee, who has strived to stay on message and stick to his prepared remarks, began to drift, taking a bit more pleasure in his media-bashing than usual as he called out the ""corrupt media"" as ""bad, bad, bad liars.""By the time Trump reached his Virginia rally, he was nearly three hours behind schedule -- taking the stage nearly 15 minutes into Monday even though he was scheduled to take the stage at 9:30pm on Sunday.But just as in Pennsylvania, Trump was greeted here by a packed crowd of supporters who cheered on their candidate, unbothered by his delay -- even though several attendees said they had arrived more than six hours earlier. ""We've got stamina!"" one man shouted when asked by CNN whether he had considered leaving.Trump too had ""stamina"" on his mind as he knocked his Democratic rival for being ""fast asleep"" as he rallied energized supporters -- contrasting his aggressive schedule with Clinton's, who held just two rallies on Sunday.""She's sleeping so beautifully,"" Trump said, picking up on his repeated suggestions during the campaign that Clinton lacks the ""strength and stamina"" to serve as president.Other than delivering a shortened stump speech in Pennsylvania and Virginia, the Republican nominee showed little signs that he was tired from the long day even as he acknowledged the day's grueling pace. But Trump did slip into a reflective mood as he crossed into Monday, his last day of campaigning before voters head to the polls on Tuesday.The billionaire grew wistful as he recalled his expectations-defying primary victories, even as he eyed the possibility that he could be decisively defeated for the first time in his political career. ""One day, I can't believe it,"" Trump said as he remarked on how far his improbable campaign has come. ""We're one day away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.""His last full day of campaigning will be equally aggressive as the Republican nominee again barnstorms through five states. He will rally supporters one last time before Election Day at 11 p.m. -- at least according to the schedule. "	Trump's aggressive campaign swing creeps past midnight

""This is Barack Obama, now we're at the end of what has felt like a really long election season. It's time to make the final decision about who we should elect to represent us. Unfortunately some Republicans are gearing up to do everything they can to stop any progress in Washington,"" Obama says in the spot. ""They've said they would stop any future Democratic Supreme Court nominee and spend their time on endless investigations. And believe it or not there are even some Republicans in Congress who have already said they want to start the impeachment process,"" Obama says.He continues: ""Regardless of what political party you're in I think we can all agree that the gridlock and obstruction needs to stop. Republicans running for Congress are promising more gridlock and inaction. If you want to get things done in Washington vote for Democrats for Congress. Send a message by sending leaders to Washington who will work for you and won't just put there party over progress. Vote for Democrats for Congress.""As CNN's KFILE first reported, several GOP congressman asked about the possibility of a Clinton impeachment, have warned a Clinton presidency could lead to a ""constitutional crisis"" should the FBI's acquiring of emails from top aide Huma Abedin lead to an indictment. Last week, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson told a local newspaper Clinton could be impeached and Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson said last weekend a Clinton presidency could be headed for impeachment."

Our journey begins from the dates the two major party candidates amassed enough delegates to secure their nominations. At that point, we consider the general election campaign to have begun. Here are our highlights -- or is it lowlights?Clinton and her email serverHillary Clinton on whether the FBI backed up her story regarding her use of a private email server for State Department business: ""As the FBI said, everything that I've said publicly has been consistent and truthful with what I've told them,"" she said in an August interview just days after her original claim had been shown by a number of fact-checkers to be false.Trump and the Iraq WarDonald Trump is convinced he was against the Iraq War from the beginning. No one else seems to be. No matter how many times it was pointed out that this statement, ""I was against the Iraq War from the beginning,"" wasn't true, he kept repeating it.  Trump and the unemployment rateTrump says the unemployment rate is 42%. That's higher than it was at the height of the Great Depression, when it hit nearly 24%. ""Our real unemployment rate -- in fact, I saw a chart the other day, our real unemployment -- because you have 90 million people that aren't working,"" he said in an August interview with Time magazine.""Ninety-three million to be exact. If you start adding it up, our real unemployment rate is 42%,"" he said.Trump 'stalking' Clinton Clinton said Trump stalked her all over the debate stage last month, a claim she repeated several times after the second debate. It wasn't true any time she said it.Trump: 650 million immigrants may move to USSure, if everyone in the Western Hemisphere decides to move here. Pence: The Clinton Foundation gives 'less than 10 cents on the dollar' to 'charitable causes'He made this claim during the vice presidential debate. It's wrong.Pence: 'Well, he never said that'When Pence's rival, Tim Kaine brought up things that Trump had said, Pence repeatedly denied that he did. Well, he did.Trump: Clinton's immigration plans will bankrupt Social SecurityFact is they might save Social Security.Trump: 'Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio'""They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore,"" Trump said during the first debate. Trouble is those states are gaining jobs.Trump on the state of black AmericaAt a rally in North Carolina in September, Trump said: ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worse shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever."" Worse than slavery? Jim Crow? Worse than the 50-year period when at least one black person was lynched every week?"	Reality Check: Whoppers of the campaign
7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/donald-trump-message-misrepresentations/index.html	"But even as he hews closely to the script his aides have urged him to follow, the Republican nominee isn't abandoning the lies, misrepresentations and hyperbole that he has turned to time and again to bolster the arguments driving his presidential campaign. And this time, many of them are built into the teleprompter.As his narrow path to victory has begun to widen, Trump in his final week on the campaign trail has leaned heavily on the FBI's review of new emails that may be linked to Hillary Clinton's private email server, highlighted the stark contrast between his policies and those of his Democratic rivals, and criticized the strategy underpinning the US's fight against ISIS.While those arguments might be enough, Trump has also mixed in doses of innuendo, fear-mongering and outright inaccuracies to create a potent cocktail he hopes will drive his supporters to the polls and convince late-breaking independents to side with him.The real estate mogul quickly pounced on the FBI's announcement late last week that it had discovered new emails that might be tied to its investigation into Clinton's email server, which ended last summer with the FBI recommending against filing any charges. But Trump has both exaggerated the scope of the FBI's review and suggested Clinton is facing a separate investigation altogether.Trump has repeatedly called the FBI's review of new emails -- found on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner that he shared with his estranged wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin -- a ""criminal investigation,"" going beyond the FBI's characterization of the review. He has also argued that emails with classified information were discovered on Weiner's computer, even before the FBI had secured a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails -- meaning there's no way of knowing if any emails contain any classified information.And then Trump dropped what appeared to be a bombshell based on a false Fox News report. ""They're also conducting a second criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's pay for play corruption at the State Department,"" he said Friday night in Hershey, Pennsylvania, even though law enforcement officials have told CNN the Clinton Foundation probe hasn't advanced in months.Even after that report was debunked and Fox News anchor Bret Baier retracted the report, Trump continued to tell his supporters that Clinton was ""likely"" to be indicted in the case.""The FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment,"" Trump incorrectly told his supporters Friday in New Hampshire.A 'rigged system'Trump has blended those mischaracterizations with his charges that there is a ""rigged system"" at work, stating his theories that the Justice Department is ""protecting"" Clinton as though they were fact -- theories that took on added meaning as reports surfaced in the last week of disagreements between the FBI and Justice Department over whether to publicly announce the review of new emails.Though the Republican nominee has frequently jumped ahead of law enforcement's conclusions about investigations and terrorist attacks, his words have gained new weight as the election draws nearer.Trump has also inserted his penchant for misleading and flat-out false statements into his efforts to pitch his hardline immigration and terrorism policies, as well as his efforts to paint current US government leadership as inept and in dire need of the change agent he purports to be.Embarking on his final campaign swing, Trump has sought to play to voters' fears of terrorism and illegal immigration, wildly mischaracterizing Clinton's policies to suggest that she would erase the US' borders, allow hundreds of millions of people to flow in and falsely blamed her for undocumented immigrant criminals being released from US prisons.""You could have 650 million people pour in and we'd do nothing about it. Think of it. That's what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week. Once you lose control of your borders, you just have no country folks, you have no country,"" Trump said last Sunday during a rally in the border state of New Mexico. There is no basis for the number.He has also repeatedly suggested in the last week that the US government is the highest-taxed country in the world -- it isn't -- and warned that Clinton would burden the middle class with ""massive"" tax increases even though Clinton's plan only calls for tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans.Through it all, Trump has continued to decry a ""rigged system"" and argued the media is colluding with the Clinton campaign as he's stressed his campaign offers voters a change from the status quo.Questioning Mosul offensiveHis criticism of the political status quo has also extended to denouncing the US-backed military offensive to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from ISIS.Once again, his arguments here have been rife with inaccuracies and baseless statements as he's suggested the offensive has been ""disastrous"" even though US and Iraq military officials -- as well as impartial observers on the ground -- have said forces are making significant gains.And while the offensive is aimed at unclenching ISIS' grip of a key Iraqi city, Trump has questioned the merits of the offensive -- which, if successful, would undoubtedly serve to further US strategic goals -- from arguing the US is ""not going to benefit"" from successfully ousting ISIS from the city on Friday to arguing the offensive was conducted for ""political reasons"" on Saturday.Trump has also spun misleading tales about Obamacare, his position in the polls and even the pace of Clinton's campaign schedule.Early on in his improbable run for the Republican nomination, Trump leaned on his penchant for hyperbole -- from his wealth to the size of his crowds -- and unapologetically misled voters about his own past positions on certain issues as well as his opponents', all while painting a gloomy picture of a country headed for doom unless voters elected him to set the country on the right track. His wild disregard for the truth quickly surpassed that of any presidential candidate in modern history, prompting news outlets to begin calling Trump's statements out very simply as ""lies.""Since the dawn of his campaign, Trump has become more polished, and in the final months of his bid, has used a teleprompter at each of his rallies -- an attempt by his new guard of campaign advisers to erect bumpers that would keep him on message -- although Trump often gets sidetracked by off-script tangents.Sensing the critical importance of this last week to convince voters he should be the next president, the Republican nominee has fastidiously followed the remarks his aides prepared for him to read at nearly every rally."

Clinton will headline events in Pittsburgh, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Philadelphia and Raleigh, North Carolina.The Democratic nominee's campaign has leaned heavily on its ground game to turn out voters early in key swing states, trying to ""bank"" votes before Election Day. The campaign has particularly seen early voting gains in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. Some aides are quietly confident that, given the turnout figures in Nevada so far, the state could already be in Clinton's column.But states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, early voting is primarily limited to special circumstances, meaning turning out voters on Election Day is key.Clinton's top aides hope late visits to these states -- by both Clinton and her top surrogates -- will help spur that turnout.In addition to Clinton's visit, President Barack Obama will campaign in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Monday.""We have tried to calibrate our schedule to be in states at the peak time for voting,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said Saturday. ""So, Michigan, almost all voting happens on Election Day, same with Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and even Ohio, and so our schedule is calibrated around that.""Clinton's campaign is also keeping a close eye on internal polling in Midwestern states, where aides said Saturday they had seen some tightening.This is especially true in Michigan, where Clinton's internal polls are currently in low single digits.""The numbers there have tightened,"" Mook said. ""We're taking that seriously.""In New Hampshire on Sunday, Clinton will look to avoid the issue former vice president Al Gore ran into in 2000: Ignoring the state.Gore lost New Hampshire by a mere 7,211 votes in 2000, a fraction that infuriated Democrats in the state given how little he campaigned there during the race.Gore, according to those Democrats, held one event in New Hampshire as the nominee, canoeing with Jeanne Shaheen on the Connecticut River in July.A Clinton aide said this weekend that one of the reasons Clinton was visiting the state less than 48 hours before Election Day was the lessons learned from Gore."

In an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, the Virginia senator recalled an April 2014 conversation with Clinton, who he said had not yet decided whether she would run for president. He cited the reality that Clinton would be the first woman elected president. ""I said, 'No matter what the polls say and no matter what you see in that editorial, consider yourself the underdog. You're trying to do something that's never been done.' I said, 'If it had been easy for a woman to be president in this country, we would have had a woman president of the country. So consider yourself the underdog until they call you the winner,'"" Kaine told host John Dickerson. ""That's what I say to myself, John, in every race I've ever run in Virginia, which until recently has been pretty tough real estate,"" Kaine said. ""I tell myself I'm the underdog until they call me the winner. And that gives me the discipline to do what I need to do until the polls close right at the very end."" The underdog line is one he consistently uses on the campaign trail as well, ending most of his events with it."	Tim Kaine says Hillary Clinton is the 'underdog'
