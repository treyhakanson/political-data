The ceremony came amid a political controversy roiling the department and the FBI over the handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation. It would be times like this that Margolis, a fierce defender of the Justice Department, would play key roles to help lead efforts to protect the department from political tempests. Tuesday was the first time Comey was in the same room as some of his critics, including former Attorneys General Eric Holder and Michael Mukasey, and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, who sat across the aisle far opposite from Comey. Several of the former prosecutors who, along with Holder and Gorelick, recently signed a letter criticizing Comey were also in the room. There was no mention of the current controversies, and Comey didn't respond to reporters' questions after the ceremony.But Comey, Lynch and several of the other speakers mentioned the department's ideals of pursuing the rule of law no matter which political party is in power. ""We feel his absence in these hallways every day,"" Lynch told the audience in speaking about Margolis.Before and after the ceremony, the current controversy was discussed only on oblique terms. Many in the room were veterans of the Bush administration, including some who helped manage the department's most serious and damaging crisis in recent years: the controversy over the firings of US attorneys. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who was forced to resign in that scandal, didn't attend. "	Comey sits with critics at ceremony for late colleague	['Clinton', 'Lynch']	[]

""Again, you know, I'm not running the campaign by any means, but I wouldn't do that. I agree with you.""Earlier in the interview, when the host said he thought that the strategy of attacking Comey was a ""mistake,"" Rendell replied, ""I generally do as well."" Clinton campaign accuses FBI of 'blatant double standard'""Although I will say the more that comes out about this, the stranger it is,"" he said. ""Like the agents had this material or knew about the existence of the material at the beginning of October and didn't tell the director until the end of October. That makes no sense at all. So the more that this comes out, I think the more facts that come out, the better it is for Secretary Clinton but I agree with you, I wouldn't attack him."" Rendell added that Comey should clarify where the investigation stands. On Friday, Comey sent a letter to members of Congress saying that new emails pertinent to the FBI's investigation of Clinton's use of a private server as secretary of state had been discovered in an ""unrelated case,"" later revealed to be the one involving Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Republicans and Democrats have attacked Comey over his decision to publicly announce details of an investigation so close to Election Day. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said the decision showed a ""blatant double standard"" on the part of the FBI for sending Friday's letter but not publicly commenting on potential Donald Trump campaign ties to Russia.Rendell added in the interview that the resurrection of the email controversy would encourage Republicans to turn out for Trump.""I think the FBI stuff gave a boost to Trump, not because it changed anyone's mind but because I think it took a couple of Trump voters who were pretty discouraged last week with all the news about the polls and stuff and probably weren't gonna vote and now they're on fire and they're gonna vote, so I anticipate, as I said last week, but I even anticipate it more so that it's gonna be a close election here in Pennsylvania,"" Rendell said.In the interview, Rendell also expressed concern about public transport workers striking in Philadelphia, saying that if the strike was not resolved by Election Day, it could hold down turnout and be ""a real plus for Donald Trump."""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/obama-white-house-records/index.html	"On Tuesday, the White House began the laborious process of transferring all of President Barack Obama's records -- his memos, his letters, his schedules, and, yes, his emails -- to the National Archives, which under federal law takes ownership of the documents when Obama leaves office.At the downtown Washington Archives headquarters on Tuesday, uniformed US service members were busy loading palettes of cardboard boxes stuffed with Obama administration records onto orange forklifts. The boxes, which were carefully catalogued with green slips of paper and wrapped in clear plastic, were shuttled from a loading dock and into the back of a white Ryder moving van, which departed the building destined for a secure warehouse. Like presidents before him, Obama is leaving office with the story of his presidency boxed and ready for the history books -- at least the parts that aren't declared top secret or otherwise unsuitable for public consumption. George Washington had his diaries and letters hauled off in wagons to Mount Vernon, where he could consult them in the privacy of his own study. The National Archives got involved after Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, managing the deceased chief executive's papers at his library in Hyde Park, New York. The Presidential Records Act in 1978 declared all presidential and vice presidential records property of the federal government, with ""custody, control and preservation"" of the records delegated to the National Archives when a commander-in-chief leaves office. That means hundreds of millions of records must be transferred from the White House to the Archives before Obama finishes his term. The physical material will go from Washington into temporary storage at a secure warehouse in the greater Chicago area, before eventually being moved into Obama's presidential library, due to be erected on the city's South Side.In past administrations, that handover involved secure 18-wheeler trucks -- pulled directly to the White House South Portico -- to load up boxes upon boxes of carefully filed material. Ronald Reagan's administration established a computer cataloguing system that allowed officials to quickly access any records they needed while the president remained in office. Because the Reagan library was situated across the country in Simi Valley, California, military cargo planes were employed, packed full of records and emptied at air bases in Southern California. Trucks escorted by police deposited the records at the storage site. Also included in the handoff: the tens of thousands of gifts Obama has received over his eight years in office, which, like the documents and records, officially remain in the ""complete ownership, possession and control"" of the government. For Obama, that includes millions of dollars in jewels from the Saudi royal family, a surfboard from the prime minister of Australia, and several ceremonial weapons from various world leaders. Officially, Obama isn't allowed to receive gifts unless they're small and inexpensive. But diplomatic protocol disallows him from turning down, say, a floor-length cape from a Saudi prince. Unless Obama is willing to cough up the $40,000 pricetag for that cape, it remains US government property, packed up along with his other records and sent to the National Archives.Some gifts remain at the White House -- like the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, which was a gift from Queen Victoria. The vast majority (including, probably, that cape) are packed away and kept with museum-like care by the Archives staff. Every administration finds itself confronting a new type of record that must be catalogued and kept for posterity. Reagan's White House was the first to use email. Bill Clinton's administration developed a website whose 1990s-era simplicity can still be enjoyed today. What happens to the tweets?For Obama, the advent of social media -- by its nature, an ephemeral take on a certain moment in time -- means new ways of preserving records. On Monday the White House's deputy chief digital office wrote that all of the administration's social media posts -- ""From tweets to snaps"" -- would be maintained for posterity. ""All of the material we've published online will be preserved with (the National Archives) just as previous administrations have done with records ranging from handwritten notes to faxes to emails,"" the official, Kori Schulman, wrote in a post on the White House website. She also said President Obama's twitter handle, @POTUS, would automatically transfer to his successor, but that his own previous tweets would live at the handle @POTUS44. Similar archived accounts will be set up on Instagram and Facebook, and the White House said it would make all of their social media content available in a downloadable file."

Clinton will overnight in Florida and head to Arizona and Nevada on Wednesday, meaning it is likely Abedin will not travel with Clinton for a fifth day.Karen Dunn, Abedin's lawyer, said Monday night that she had not been contacted by the FBI as part of its probe.""From the beginning, Ms. Abedin has complied fully and voluntarily with State Department and law enforcement requests, including sitting for hours-long interviews and providing her work-related and potentially work-related documents,"" Dunn told CNN in a statement. ""While the FBI has not contacted us about this, Ms. Abedin will continue to be, as she always has been, forthcoming and cooperative.""A Clinton aide said Tuesday that Abedin was working from the campaign headquarters in Brooklyn.""She is there in Brooklyn and happy to cooperate if they ever want to talk to her. She has been very cooperative throughout the process,"" the aide said. ""We don't see any reason, though, that they will need to. But, you know, there is a lot to wrap up this last week or two.""But asked if she is staying away from the campaign plane because of the optics, the aide demurred.""I wouldn't draw too many conclusions,"" the aide said.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the day Dunn issued her statement."

Trump reportedly called Machado ""Miss Housekeeping"" and ""Miss Piggy"" when she gained weight after winning the beauty pageant.Clinton's argument against Trump on Tuesday was that he is not someone who would be a role model to boys and girls.""When I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he has been doing for 30 years, he sure had spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting women,"" Clinton said. ""And I have got to tell you, some of what we have learned, some of this stuff is very upsetting.""Machado told the audience in Florida that Trump was ""overwhelming"" and that she was ""scared of him.""""He made fun of me and I didn't know how to respond. He told me I looked ugly and I was massive. He even called me names,"" she said. ""Soon, it became a joke. Alicia Machado was the fat Mrs. Universe.""Clinton's campaign also unloaded on the Republican presidential nominee in a new ad out Tuesday that features a slew of Trump's off-color comments about women's looks, role in the work place and sexuality. RELATED: 'Miss Universe' tearfully thanks Clinton for defense against Trump's 'Miss Piggy' remarksThe new Clinton ad -- titled ""What He Believes"" -- features white lettering on a black background with ominous music mixed with comments Trump has made about women throughout his life. The ad opens with the slate ""He really believes this,"" followed by Trump saying, ""Putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing.""The ad also features a clip from the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" video, where Trump casually talks about sexual assault.""Grab 'em by the p----. When you are a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,"" Trump says in the spot, after the screen says, ""He really said this.""The ad ends with this slate: ""Anyone who does what he does is unfit to be president.""These women have accused Trump of sexual harassmentTrump apologized for the remarks heard on the ""Access Hollywood"" video, but he also used the incident as an opportunity to attack Clinton's husband. Clinton's campaign also looked to change the subject Monday, when they turned to the young girl featured in the iconic 1964 ""Daisy"" ad in order to question Trump's ability to handle nuclear weapons.The ad -- which features Monique Luiz, the same actress who at age 3 played ""Daisy"" in the ad for Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign -- was part of the campaign's closing argument against the Republican Party's presidential nominee. The campaign hopes to cast Trump as too reckless and unhinged to be trusted with the country's nuclear arsenal.Clinton's campaign has been forced to deal with new questions about her use of email after the FBI announced Friday that they were looking into emails connected to her private server.Clinton's aides have launched an all out offensive against the FBI, calling Director James Comey's decision to disclose the updated investigation a ""blatant double standard.""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-james-comey/index.html	"Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook slammed Comey in the wake of reports that the FBI director refused to publicly comment on potential Donald Trump campaign ties to Russia's alleged efforts to meddle with the US election, but did weigh in on an updated  investigation involving Clinton's email server. ""It is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard,"" Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said on a call with reporters. ""That Director Comey would show more discretion in a matter concerning a foreign state action than one involving the Democratic nominee for president is nothing short of jaw-dropping.""Comey propelled himself into the 2016 election on Friday when he sent a letter to Congress announcing a renewed probe into emails tied to Clinton. The move has drawn scorn from Democrats, but also Republican former Justice Department officials, who argue Comey has violated protocol.Clinton's FBI investigation: What you need to knowClinton's campaign held a call with reporters Monday jumping on reports from CNBC and Huffington Post that Comey argued privately against naming Russia as the state actor carrying out hacks on Democratic officials, citing the election.CNN reporters have no sources corroborating the story and the FBI has declined to comment. The reporting stands in contrast to what CNN reported in September concerning the deliberations about Russia's role. At the time, CNN reported that the FBI and Justice Department officials believed there was strong evidence to warrant naming Russia, but there was caution from the broader intelligence community (which was concerned about potential retaliation) and the White House, which was concerned about the political overtones so close to the US election. According to sources CNN talked to both around the time of the actual decision and Monday: The FBI was supportive of the intel community putting out the statement pointing a finger at Russia. The intention was always for it to come from the intel community and the Department of Homeland Security, to project their role in defending critical infrastructure. Congressman: This could cost Clinton the electionThe FBI was never going to have its name on any announcement, sources said. Instead, the plan was for it to be an intelligence community statement coming from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which represents the FBI on these matters. The FBI is part of the intelligence community. But the FBI was not ready to make a legal case trying to prove how Russia may have passed the material to WikiLeaks and if there was coordination. That was not a case they could make at the time of the statement being released.FBI discovered Clinton-related emails weeks agoMook called Comey's comments about Clinton ""not the hallmarks of a responsible investigation,"" especially when compared to his reported caution about fingering Russia.Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, said it was ""time for Director Comey to disclose as much information as possible about these investigations.""Comey, meanwhile, stands by his decision despite the backlash, and believes he did the right thing, according to a source familiar with Comey's thinking. ""He's doing OK,"" this person said. In Comey's view he was faced with two bad options: not be upfront with Congress and risk the news leaking out or violating Justice Department protocol and living up to his word to Congress to provide any updates related to the investigation. He chose the lesser of the two bad choices in his mind. He was trying to reach the delicate balance of providing just enough information to fulfill his obligation to Congress. ""He doesn't have a partisan bone in his body,"" the source said, adding Comey didn't want to do anything this close to the election, but felt he had no choice given the development with the new emails."

He knew there would be false headlines.""The FBI director sent a letter to Congress Friday saying the agency was reviewing newly discovered ""pertinent"" emails to see if any of the them would be relevant to an investigation Clinton's use of a private email server.Mook said that the FBI is quick to publicize investigations linked to Clinton but has been silent about investigations into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.""Director Comey felt it was incumbent upon him to announce that the FBI had some information he'd never even looked at, but they won't reveal connections to Russia,"" he said.""We're told they're investigating one of Trump's former campaign managers,"" Mook added. ""We're told that they're investigating a gentleman that Trump himself said was one of his foreign policy advisers for meeting with sanctioned officials in Russia.""Mook both on Tuesday and during a call with reporters Monday pounced on reports from CNBC and Huffington Post that Comey argued privately against naming Russia as the state actor carrying out hacks on Democratic officials, citing the election as well as other stories about Trump's alleged ties to Russia. CNN reporters have no sources corroborating the story and the FBI has declined to comment. CNN has also reached out to the Trump campaign for comment and not yet gotten a response. The Clinton campaign said they simply want Comey and the FBI to end this ""double standard"" when it comes to the Clinton campaign.""Every time people asked questions about investigations pertaining to Donald Trump, they are tight lipped and silent,"" Mook added. ""We didn't cause this problem. James Comey opened this door and we're just asking for him to make this right and treat everybody the same.""Trump supporter Rep. Chris Collins responded to Mook's calls for fairness immediately following Mook's appearance, telling CNN's Alisyn Camerota that ""Democrats are living in a cesspool"" so they're ""deflecting"" criticism.""The irony is it's their bad behavior that is coming forward and now they're beside themselves because America knows they're a bunch of cheats and liars,"" the New York Republican congressman said."

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/presidential-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-abc/index.html	The latest ABC News/The Washington Post offering showed Trump barely edging Clinton among likely voters, 46%-45%, well within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error. Support for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, meanwhile has fallen to a new low, according to the poll, plunging to just 3% nationwide. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is at 2%. Although Trump's single-point advantage over Clinton is statistically negligible, it is his first lead in an ABC/Post poll since May -- perhaps giving hope to the Republican presidential nominee's supporters, who believe their candidate's prospects were bolstered last week with the revelation that the FBI is reviewing new emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the former congressman and estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Still, it may be too early to gauge the electoral impact of that development, which broke on Friday. Clinton still leads Trump in the CNN Poll of Polls, an average of the five most recent national phone polls, including Tuesday's ABC/WaPo tracking survey, 46%-42%. The latest ABC/Post poll showed a lack of enthusiasm among Clinton supporters. Only 45% of the Democratic nominee's backers say they are very enthusiastic about supporting her, down 7 percentage points since the start of the tracking poll and eight points lower than the share of Trump supporters who say they are very enthusiastic about supporting their candidate.The latest ABC/Post tracking poll was conducted October 27-30 using phone interviews with 1,128 likely voters. It has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.	US election poll: Trump, Clinton in tight race	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
