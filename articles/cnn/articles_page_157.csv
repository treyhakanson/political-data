""He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety.""Trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach""He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities,"" added the mayor, a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton for president. If elected, Trump said Wednesday at a Fox News town hall that he hopes to take the controversial policy nationwide to help stem ""violence in the black community.""""One of the things I'd do ... is I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to,"" Trump said. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" Trump's comments came in response to an audience member's question about reducing ""black-on-black crime."" But many people in New York's black community have opposed the practice arguing that New York's police disproportionately used the policy to target and harass people of color.After ongoing protests of the policy, a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy violated citizens' constitutional rights. However, the judge did not order an outright ban on the practice, but called for outside oversight and reform. The city under Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de Blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated whether New York City is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. The city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process."	NYC Mayor: Trump wrong on 'stop-and-frisk'

The tactic was designed to pressure Democrats to accept what McConnell called a ""clean"" government funding bill.   ""There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that's what I've just offered. It's the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle,"" McConnell said when he filed the GOP bill. ""It's a fair proposal that funds all current government operations through December 9.""The GOP proposal was immediately panned by Democrats because it left out funds for Flint, Michigan, where the drinking water supply was poisoned by lead in the past year. If the chamber's 46 Democrats stick together, they can block the bill from advancing. ""We are now down to a handful of issues, but they are down to the real issues. Now the Republican leader, the majority leader, has filed a Republican-only bill,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. ""We Democrats cannot vote for that.""House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the Republican proposal, saying ""it falls very short.""Pelosi said Democrats objected to the way Republicans offset the money directed at Zika and said the riders Republicans were pushing showed they have ""a tin ear.""On Thursday night, however, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson became the first Democrat to publicly say he will support the bill because it offers Zika funding, a priority for his state.The turn of events was somewhat unexpected as leaders in each party had signaled for days they were close to a deal and didn't anticipate a real threat of a government shutdown, just weeks before the election.With the balance of power in the Senate at stake, GOP leaders are anxious to complete their work and send their vulnerable members home to campaign. They also want to demonstrate to voters they can govern effectively and deserve to remain in power. House Speaker Paul Ryan downplayed the back-and-forth between the parties over the must-pass bill to avoid another re-run of the 2013 shutdown, saying ""our members realize that we want to get our work done. We don't want to have high drama around here this time.""Ryan said members aren't necessarily pleased that they will have to vote for a short-term funding bill, but recognize that is the option they ultimately have to back to avoid a shutdown. ""There's never no drama around here -- we're going to have low drama and our members want that,"" Ryan said.In addition to funding the government at current levels for the next three months, the measure offered by McConnell includes $1.1 billion to combat Zika, $500 million to respond to flooding in Louisiana and elsewhere, and $37 million to tackle the widening opioid epidemic through the recently enacted Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.   McConnell called the $500 million for flooding a ""down payment"" suggesting additional money would be approved soon. Democrats dispute the bill has that much money in it for opioids.A handful of unresolved and controversial riders were dropped from the bill. One would have forced a delay in turning authority over Internet domain names to an international consortium -- something Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, oppose. Others dealt with how the Export-Import Bank functions and truck driver fatigue. The decision to drop the riders had immediate implications as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said he would not vote for the measure without the Export-Import Bank provision, which is important to his state.Despite moving forward without Democrats, a top Senate GOP leadership aide said Republicans are still open to continuing talks to resolve differences. McConnell said there would have the next four days to consider the bill before any votes take place. In the meantime, neither chamber is expected to be in session until next week.

Pence referenced recent police shootings of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, saying, ""It's a very troubling time for us."" The Charlotte shootings, which led to violence and unrest in that city this week, have sparked discussions of lethal police force against African-Americans.Pence mentioned faith as his first means to reunite the country and reduce violence, but then said he thought there was too much talk of how law enforcement officers conduct themselves. ""Donald Trump and I believe there's been far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement. That police officers are human beings. In difficult and life threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account,"" Pence said.The governor reiterated his belief that it is a challenging time to be in law enforcement and doubled down that ""we ought to set aside this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias.""He finished his answer by saying it's time to ""move away from the rhetoric of division and embrace the rhetoric of unity.""The governor expressed his opinion that when tragedies happen, voices of division come forward instead of voices of unity, though he did not directly mention President Barack Obama's leadership.Asked Wednesday about the police shootings in Charlotte and Tulsa, Trump did not address the Charlotte incident but said he was ""very, very troubled"" by the shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, in Tulsa on Friday night."

Joe Donnelly brought the issue up amid growing talk by military commanders about using Kurdish and Arab forces to push ISIS out of Raqqa, the terror group's stronghold in Syria and self-declared capital.The US believes several of the US hostages murdered by ISIS likely were killed in the Raqqa area and their bodies have never been recovered.""When we go to Raqqa, we lost some young men and women there who were killed by ISIL, and we want to have them come home, "" said Donnelly, an Indiana Democrat, using another word for ISIS.""We don't want to leave anyone behind. And we would ask for your cooperation and assistance,"" he said to Carter.Donnelly specifically mentioned Peter Kassig, an aid worker killed in November 2014, and Kayla Mueller, another aid worker ISIS held, tortured and then claimed died in an airstrike. The US believes the American hostages, including journalist James Foley, were killed by the now-dead ISIS operative known as Jihadi John.""All the parents and all the folks back home, we want them all to come home. And we'd sure appreciate your assistance in making that happen,"" Donnelly said. Carter answered ""noted.""The military is aware of the families' desires, but also knows how very tough that job may be, one defense official told CNN.The US military has a long history of trying to recover the remains of dead Americans. Recently the bodies of two American civilians who fought and were killed with militia groups fighting ISIS were returned to the US. And fallen service members missing on foreign battlefields are still being searched for from the Vietnam and Korean wars, as well as World War II.The US also searched for years in Iraq for the Scott Speicher, a downed Navy pilot from the first Gulf War, until his remains were recovered in 2009.But whether the remains of the hostages can be located, identified and brought home may be very difficult the defense official said. It's widely believed there are a number of burial sites around Raqqa and without some confirmation of where the Americans are buried it may be too sensitive to begin removing remains."

In a story published Tuesday, Fahrenthold reported that the real estate mogul had used money from the Trump Foundation to purchase a $10,000, four-foot-tall acrylic painting of himself at a charity fundraiser. Fahrenthold had already reported that Trump used the foundation's money to buy another portrait of himself, one that was six-feet-tall and cost $20,000. Experts say each purchase was possibly illegal. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Following the report Tuesday, an eagle-eyed Twitter follower notified Fahrenthold that a photo on TripAdvisor showed the portrait hanging at the Trump National Doral Resort near Miami.The resort happens to be mere blocks from Univision's studios. Acevedo, who said he's been following Fahrenthold's reporting for weeks, reserved a room late Tuesday night at the hotel using points from his personal credit card. ""I didn't want to give Univision's money to one of Trump's businesses,"" he said. Acevedo eventually located the painting at the entrance of the Champions Bar & Grill insider the resort, marking the latest triumph in Fahrenthold's intrepid and collaborative reporting. ""I consider it a very small contribution to David's phenomenal reporting,"" Acevedo told CNN in an email.Fahrenthold, for his part, disagrees.""Enrique deserves 99.9 percent of the credit for that find, since it was he who figured out how to get on the property (by booking a room), and then how to find the photo itself,"" he told CNN in an email.Fahrenthold's reporting was cited in a speech last week by President Barack Obama, who compared the Clinton family foundation with Trump's foundation.""One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world,"" Obama said. ""The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself.""When he learned of the President's comment, Fahrenthold put in another request to his readers.""Reminder,"" he tweeted, ""I am still looking for this portrait."" The next day, he had a lead from a Washington Post reader who had shipped the painting to another one of Trump's golf clubs in Briarcliff Manor, New York.""This all happened because of social media,"" Fahrenthold told CNN in the email, saying he hoped the TripAdvisor photo would motivate a Florida reporter to track it down.""Enrique did just that -- although, it turns out, I had underestimated how much work this would actually take,"" he said.

""For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy. I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for.""The tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it ""disgusting"" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane. But Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet.Mars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.""Trump said he didn't ""want to be a distraction"" to the campaign, but that the negative response was being driven by partisan attacks. ""I understand that running as conservative, there is a different standard,"" he said.""If a metaphor offends someone then maybe that's the world in which we live today, but I'm not comparing someone to candy,"" Trump said. ""It's a statistical thing. We have to be careful about who we let into this country.""But the statistics don't actually back up the contention made in the tweet. According to a recent Cato Institute report, the odds ""that an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year.""Still, Trump said Thursday that it was his broader point was what mattered and that it was part of a discussion that needed to be had and one that tracked closely with the key components of his father's campaign strategy.  ""He's created some good dialogue that needed to be had that wasn't being had because PC culture sort of forced real issues off of the table,"" Trump said of his father's campaign. ""The way he's been able to approach that and do that has forced people to actually have a dialogue and that's what this country is about, having that dialogue."" That dialogue -- about race, about refugees and about immigrants -- has been harshly criticized by Clinton and Trump detractors as racist, but Trump countered that it has been the driving force behind Trump's success. ""We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,"" Trump said. ""That's not what built this country, that's not what made this country great and that's why my father is resonating so well with working class, hard-working Americans. He's giving them a voice again."""	Trump Jr. defends Skittles tweet: 'I don't deal in microaggression'

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a major criminal justice reform bill. But at his weekly news conference he made it clear he didn't want to comment on the GOP nominee's proposal saying it wasn't an area where he had expertise, referring reporters to Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte."

Adam Schiff, the ranking members on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively, released a joint statement on Thursday calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government.""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the US election,"" the Democrats said. ""At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election -- we can see no other rationale for the behavior of the Russians.""Unlike past hedged comments from US lawmakers and officials, the statement was definitive and more forceful than any previous assertions about Russian hacking from top-level government sources. And in tying the hacking directly to Putin and/or senior levels of Russian government, the Democrats were more forceful than the administration or Congress has been in the past.""We believe that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government,"" Schiff and Feinstein said. ""We call on President Putin to immediately order a halt to this activity. Americans will not stand for any foreign government trying to influence our election. We hope all Americans will stand together and reject the Russian effort.""Kerry delivers blistering attack on Russia at UNExperts have pinpointed Russian government-affiliated hackers as the source of cyberattacks on a number of Democratic political groups, including the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Communications and documents stolen in those hacks have been selectively leaked online since, by a hacker claiming to be unaffiliated with the Russians going by ""Guccifer 2.0."" But analysis by private-sector cybersecurity firms have concluded that the character is most likely a front for the Russians to cast doubt on their culpability.Two other hacks -- both of state election boards -- have also been loosely tied to potential Russian hackers. In Illinois, thousands of voter role records were accessed, and Arizona was also targeted. Though nothing was done to influence elections in those states, experts believe Russian hacking is designed to cast doubt in the security and validity of the election. Schiff and Feinstein did not explain what in their briefings led to their conclusion. Intelligence Committee members receive classified briefings they can't speak about in public.They also broke with the administration in their condemnation of Russia. The White House has referred to the beliefs of experts on the hacks, but have not discussed any conclusions drawn by US government investigators. The administration has also been navigating a tense relationship with Russia over the conflict in Syria, with both sides pointing fingers over a fraught ceasefire agreement.""No Republicans joined their statement. The hacks have been perceived as a benefit to GOP nominee Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump has spoken favorably of Putin in the past, and Democrats have tried to paint him as friendly to the authoritarian leader. The hacks have been damaging to the Democratic Party, leading to the resignation of then-Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz on the eve of the Democratic convention in July. In return, Democrats have asked Republicans to not use material from the hacks due to the suspect Russian involvement. "	Russian intelligence agencies behind US election hacks, lawmakers say

He said the following morning that his comments were in regards to how to stop gun violence in Chicago.In light of recent police shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Charlotte, North Carolina, Scott said while relations between law enforcement and community members are increasingly fraught, those who want to see change must partner with police to delineate a clear path for the future.""Part of the pain and the suffering that happens without clarity is that people jump to conclusions and sometimes it's the wrong conclusion,"" he said. ""The faster the information jumps to the surface, the more information that provides clarity, hopefully the greater the calm will be.""Scott cited how publicizing video footage of police shootings -- as in the case in Oklahoma, as well as following a 2015 fatal police shooting in Scott's home town of North Charleston -- gives communities more clarity about the incidents.""I'm simply here to suggest that there are some solutions that will provide greater clarity and provide a more panoramic view of the situation,"" he said. ""Body cameras (are) a part of that.""With protests surrounding recent police shootings cropping up around the country -- with some turning violent -- Scott said the most appropriate response would be to forge a path allowing the community to come together with law enforcement to draft key policies.""There is never a reason for violence in response to the situation,"" Scott told Tapper.
