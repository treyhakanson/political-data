Meeting with national security experts in September, Clinton said an area of deep focus was ""what it would take to surge our intelligence, to help us detect and prevent attacks before they happen."" In Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Clinton's running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, said the pair would work to strike ""great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence."" But the reliance on technology deepens legal and ethical concerns that civil liberties groups and other natural allies of the Democratic Party have about law enforcement's use of data and technology, and its monitoring of social media. The Justice Department's announcement Wednesday of the arrest of a National Security Agency contractor for allegedly stealing classified intelligence only underscored the challenges and sensitivities of boosting such surveillance. The expanding uses of technology and new capabilities in particular have raised alarm bells at the American Civil Liberties Union. ""There really hasn't been an adequate discussion of this or adequate appreciation in the broader public or attention by legislators for the consequences on our political discourse or our democracy writ large,"" said Hugh Handeyside, a staff attorney for the ACLU's National Security Project. He continued, ""It's just beginning to dawn on us that just because this capability exists, doesn't mean it should be used."" Predictive analytical toolThe analytic tool, called ""graph technology,"" isn't about sucking up more data; it's about being able to more efficiently sift through it. Experts say it can be used to spot signs of imminent cyber attacks, such as the theft of Democratic National Committee emails or other hacking attempts on voter registration systems in 20 states.  They maintain that graph technology, initially released about seven years ago, would work equally well in hunting down terrorist cells. ""We think in the next few years, tech will be able to help in a much greater way"" with national security work, said Mark Testoni, president of SAP National Security Services. ""We've doubled the entirety of digital information in the entire world in the last two or three years,"" said Testoni, who added that when you apply high-speed analytics like graph technology to this mass of information, ""It offers great promise."" ""It's not just the traditional data,"" he explained, referring to social media and data on individuals, but resources like ""geospatial information, too."" That includes mapping data and images collected by satellites, drones and aircraft, as well as GPS waypoints, census information and other data tied to specific locations. ""This is the great promise and hope,"" Testoni said. Clinton's call for more intelligence capabilities -- human and cyber tools -- to deal with terrorism includes better cooperation between local, state and federal agencies within the US; more robust intelligence sharing among US allies, particularly in Europe; and improved intelligence gathering in the Middle East, including surveillance, reconnaissance and collecting information from both data and human sources. Jim Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that a cyber surge could be crucial as ISIS loses ground in Syria and tries ""to slip more into the West."" ""The way we used to protect ourselves may not work so well in the future,"" Lewis said. ""In some areas we're going to have to increase what we do, and big data may be a part of that."" The newer capabilities of graph technology can be used to find patterns by looking at how data is connected and the nature of those connections. For example, an investigator could use a graph to find everyone who went to high school with an individual or shared the same address. It's a very sophisticated version of the technology that Facebook uses to send ""friend"" suggestions. Those connections can be used to build algorithms that can spot anomalies or flag certain activities based on previous patterns. If a bank has ever contacted you because of suspicious activity on your account, you've experienced the power of these algorithms. Experts say that this resource could help identify patterns of activity that preceded past terror attacks or cyber hacks. By programming the software to search data for those patterns, investigators can then look more closely to see whether other hacks or plots are indeed underway. ""We're starting to see strong adaption of the technology"" by national security agencies, said Emil Eifrem, CEO of Neo Technology, the San Mateo, California, firm that invented the approach and coined the term ""graph technology.""Preventing cyber attacksWhile Eifrem said that the technology isn't yet being used in ""predictive ways"" for national security, he said it could easily help point to imminent cyber intrusions of the kind seen on voter registration systems and the DNC. Using graph technology, for instance, you could identify the network of IP addresses used in attacks, the central server the addresses link back to and the way these addresses were used.  ""What isn't being done yet,"" said Eifrem, ""is that you embed all that in the graph database, so you can start predicting it ahead of time,"" and say, ""based on network traffic that we've seen before, we suspect we're going to see a breach attempt."" The technology ""translates identically, completely, into national security"" for investigators looking for connections between terrorists or other plotters, according to Eifrem. ""The tension is with civil liberties, but in terms of efficiency, the more data you have, the better,"" he said. The data collection is already well underway. Security and intelligence agencies already collect a great deal of data, even if they might not yet be applying graph technology analysis to it. National security agencies have added ""socmint"" -- or social media intelligence -- to the traditional ways of collecting intelligence: ""humint,"" or human intelligence, the information collected by people; and ""sigint,"" or signals intelligence, information pulled from electronic signals such as radar or weapons and communications systems. US security agencies are now using and investing in social media monitoring tools like SocioSpyder, Dataminr, Geofeedia and PATHAR that scrape the web for information.Civil liberties concerns""The way the government is doing this amounts to surveillance,"" said Handeyside of the ACLU. Neo Technology's software is already being used by US agencies. It's also been bought by a foreign equivalent of the US State Department that's trying to merge databases across its government to create a single view of its citizens. ""There tends to be a great deal of faith in the capacity of technology to ferret this out and basically predict the future,"" said the ACLU's Handeyside. ""But we're getting into very dangerous territory if we're talking about gobbling up more and more information about what people are saying, who they're communicating with, and where they're praying, and using that as the raw intel for making these kinds of judgments,"" he said. There are some limits on government agency's access to data, of course. Beyond the publicly available streams of information on sites like Twitter and Facebook, law enforcement agencies like the FBI have to go through certain steps to gain any kind of access to a suspect's private accounts. They're first required to send the suspect's email provider a National Security Letter asking, for example, for the suspect's search history. If that yields enough information to warrant further investigation, then they have to issue a search warrant to look more closely. RELATED: DOJ: Government contractor stole secret intelligenceUS intelligence agencies operate under different rules internationally, with more stringent limits on its approach to US citizens as opposed to non-citizens. Clinton has said there's a need to tackle the ""thorny challenge"" of navigating security concerns and civil liberties, particularly surrounding encryption of mobile decides and communications. She has expressed a preference for more targeted data collection over bulk data collection and supports the USA Freedom Act, the 2015 law that scaled back bulk collection of US citizens' telecommunications data by US intelligence agencies. In the wake of 2013 disclosures by the NSA contractor Edward Snowden of the extent of surveillance, lawmakers believed creating the new law would restore Americans' trust. Even so, distrust about the extent of collection and the reach of intelligence agencies persists. And even if a potential Clinton administration did succeed in moving forward with such an ""intelligence surge,"" the graph technology is no panacea. Lewis of CSIS said these new tools ""probably could have predicted the attacks in Europe"" that were larger, such as the Paris attacks or the March attack in Belgium. He and other security experts say that French intelligence agencies were hampered because they haven't updated their capabilities. ""The French didn't keep up, didn't invest in data analytics,"" Lewis said. ""If you aren't looking at the data, you aren't going to find people.""But there are limits, he said. ""How do I create a program that's good at predicting who will be a lone wolf?"" he asked. ""It's harder to predict who's going to be a terrorist than it is to predict credit card fraud. We're not very good at that."""	Clinton calls for intel surge as predictive technology gathers steam -- and critics

Spokesmen for the NSA, Booz Allen, the Pentagon and an attorney for Martin all declined to comment on his employment. Martin was posted in a variety of positions under the Defense Department contract, including doing work on some of the government's most secretive cyberprojects operating from Fort Meade in Maryland where the NSA is headquartered. The officials say Martin's removal from the NSA contract did not affect his security clearance.US intelligence officials are now scrutinizing Martin's work history and whether the nature of his removal at NSA should have prevented him from getting a new position that required a security clearance. The intelligence officials are trying to determine whether Martin slipped through the cracks as he shifted jobs and whether reforms to the government's security clearance system in the wake of the Edward Snowden disclosures worked as they should have, US officials said. What can the government do?The arrest of Martin raised new questions about what the government can do to mitigate the risk of leaks by insiders. Investigators believe that for years, Martin illegally took home highly sensitive material, some of which was found on dozens of computers and hundreds of hard drives and thumb drives that FBI agents seized at his residence when he was arrested. Paper copies of highly classified documents were also found. So far, investigators haven't found evidence to suggest Martin stole information for a foreign government or had political motivations. Officials say that makes the Martin case different from that of Snowden, who has said he acted to expose what he believed was excessive government surveillance. The leaks of classified US information by Snowden -- and the earlier leaks by Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning -- prompted the government to spend hundreds of millions of changes to government security practices to protect classified information.Among the changes made: the use of thumb drives were eliminated in the intelligence community, there's more monitoring of systems and wider use of encryption.Much of the material Martin is accused of stealing predates the Snowden disclosures. A US official who helped oversee some of the post-Snowden security changes tells CNN that the US intelligence community has to balance the need to protect secrets with allowing employees a measure of privacy. ""The people that we are monitoring are the most trusted people in America,"" the official said. ""How far do we want to go in terms of Big Brother watching what you do?""The official declined to discuss the Martin case because it is an ongoing investigation. Intelligence officials are still waiting to see the conclusions from the Justice Department's investigation to see whether any security measures require changes. ""We need to wait to see what the evidence bears out in this case,"" the official said. ""Don't automatically put this guy in the same bucket as Edward Snowden.""US intelligence officials said there aren't any additional concerns about contractors or about Booz Allen.Josh Earnest, White House press secretary, said he wasn't aware of any wrongdoing on the part of the employer.""If there are lessons that we can learn and reforms that can be implemented to prevent something like this from happening again, we certainly want to do that,"" Earnest said. ""But as long as we are sharing information with government employees, sensitive national security information that is critical to protecting the country, this kind of risk exists. But the risk of not sharing that information is even higher."""	Possible security gap allowed NSA contractor to shift highly sensitive jobs

And taken together, Obama's approval ratings in 2016 average 51% so far in CNN/ORC polls, his best mark since that first year in office.Read the complete CNN/ORC poll resultsA year ago at this time, Obama's approval rating was about 10 points lower than it is today. The improvement in his numbers has come across age groups and gender lines, and from all geographic regions. There are partisan differences, however. He's up 12 points among Democrats to 89% approval and 14 among independents to 56% approval, but his numbers have barely budged among Republicans, 11% approved in September 2015 and 13% approve now.And there's a racial gap as well, with improvement coming among whites and Hispanics, but ratings of Obama holding steady among blacks. Among whites, his approval rating remains in negative territory but has climbed from 32% a year ago to 47% now. Non-whites have held mostly steady -- 68% approved then and 70% do now. Among black voters, 86% approve in the new poll, combining last year's data for both September and October, the number was identical among blacks a year ago. Among Hispanics, Obama's approval rating stands at 68%, up from 60% in the combined data from last fall. And in a further measure of the education rift among whites that's been highlighted by this year's presidential race, 55% of whites with college degrees say they approve of Obama's work as president vs. just 44% of whites who do not have degrees.Obama's approval rating is well above President George W. Bush's numbers at this point in his term in office, and about on par with Ronald Reagan's numbers at this time in 1988. He is just a hair behind Bill Clinton's 58% measure in October 2000. Both Clinton and Reagan saw their numbers rise above 60% after their successor had been elected and the transition had begun.The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 28 through October 2 among a random national sample of 1,501 adults.
