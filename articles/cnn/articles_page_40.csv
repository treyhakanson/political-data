The overwhelming majority -- 92% -- had either negative messages or focused on differences between the two candidates. Only 3% focused on positive messages about Clinton, and 5% were built around positive messages about Trump.  The ads -- 69,500 spotted by Kantar Media between November 1-5 -- reflect the closing arguments made by the presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs. Over the course of the final week, about $110 million will be spent on television advertising, according to data from the ad tracking firm.  In this year of divisive rhetoric, it appears that's how the candidates have chosen to end it.  The pronounced trend toward negativity largely bore out in the battleground states that are expected to decide the election. In Florida, which has seen more spent on general election advertising than any other state, only 3 percent of ads supported Clinton and 7% supported Trump.  Ads critical of Trump were far more prevalent than those critical of Clinton. Nearly 47,500 of the 69,500 spots identified by Kantar Media, an advertising tracking firm, in this period were critical of Trump. About 16,400 were critical of Clinton.  And it wasn't just outside groups, like super PACs, driving the negativity. Ninety-six percent of ads run by Clinton's campaign were negative towards Trump, and 83% of the Trump campaign's spots were negative towards Clinton.  Ads were rated as positive if they focused on casting one candidate in a positive light and negative if they focused either entirely or mostly on criticism of the opponent.  The data include spots that ran on national cable, national broadcast networks and local broadcast stations. There are more than 100 distinct advertisements, ranging between 30 seconds and two minutes, produced by two dozen groups, including the presidential campaigns and super PACs.  There is some good news:  While the trend towards divisive politics may be here to stay, the ads will be gone as the sun sets on Election Day.   	Negative ads dominate in campaign's final days

""I don't think either one of them are capable of running a country correctly without prejudice and I believe that the experience is what counts.""In wrapping up his conversation with the conflicted couple, Marquez had one simple question:""Do you guys actually love each other?"" he joked.For Jackie, their love ""trumps"" politics.""Oh yeah.

Clinton conceded to Trump in the early hours of Wednesday morning.Speaking at a victory party in New York, Trump was gracious toward Clinton and called for unity.""We owe (Clinton) a very major debt of gratitude to her for her service to our country,"" Trump said. ""I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.""He added: ""I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.""Trump won with 289 electoral votes compared to 218 for Clinton, according to CNN projections. Latest election resultsTrump's supporters embraced his plainspoken style, assault on political correctness and vow to crush what he portrayed in the final days of his campaign as a corrupt, globalized elite -- epitomized by the Clintons -- that he claimed conspired to keep hard-working Americans down.His winning coalition of largely white, working-class voters suggests a populace desperate for change and disillusioned with an entire generation of political leaders and the economic and political system itself.Now, Trump faces the task of uniting a nation traumatized by the ugliest campaign in modern history and ripped apart by political divides exacerbated by his own explosive rhetoric -- often along the most tender national fault lines such as race and gender.Trump is sure to follow his own playbookTrump will be the first president to enter the White House with no political, diplomatic or military executive experience. His victory will send shockwaves around the world, given his sparse foreign policy knowledge, haziness over nuclear doctrine, vow to curtail Muslim immigration and disdain for US alliances that have been the bedrock of the post-World War II foreign policy.His promises to renegotiate or dump trade deals such as NAFTA and to brand China a currency manipulator risk triggering immediate economic shocks around the globe. Global markets already began tumbling late Tuesday.Trump, 70, will be the oldest president ever sworn in for a first term and will take the helm of a nation left deeply divided by his scorched-earth campaign. His victory was built on fierce anger at the Washington establishment and political elites among his grass-roots voters, many of whom feel they are the victims of a globalized economy that has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs.His victory ends Clinton's crusade to become the first woman to ever rise to the nation's highest office. It's a humiliating chapter in the long political career of Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.Trump's win also deals a painful rebuke to President Barack Obama, whom he pursued for years with his birtherism campaign built on the false premise that Obama was born outside the United States. Now Trump will have the power to eviscerate Obama's political legacy -- including the Affordable Care Act, the latter's proudest domestic achievement.But there are deeper, more fundamental questions about Trump's presidency that will be key to his capacity to unify a deeply divided country and appeal to Americans who will feel outraged and disgusted by his victory.He's got the attention of the whole worldTrump's campaign was built on rage, falsehoods and singling out culprits for the ills of modern America, including undocumented migrants, foreign nations such as China and Muslim immigrants.He mocked a disabled New York Times reporter, vowed to use the power of the presidency to put Clinton in jail and pledged to sue women who accused him of sexual assault.Trump has promised to build a wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it, and to deport undocumented migrants. He has vowed to reintroduce interrogation methods for terror suspects that are more extreme than waterboarding.So the demeanor that Trump will adopt as president and the manner in which he will behave will be closely watched -- not just in the United States, but among nervous leaders abroad.One of the many uncertainties about Trump's coming presidency is how his White House will interact with Republicans in Congress â€” and whether he and GOP leaders will heal their rift from the campaign.Republicans repelled a Democratic bid to recapture the Senate, giving the GOP control over Capitol Hill and the White House.That means it would fall to the GOP either to rubber stamp policies likely to mark a break from conservative orthodoxy or to provide a check on the power of Trump, who has shown every sign he will use executive power aggressively.House Speaker Paul Ryan will face intense pressure from pro-Trump members of his own coalition to cooperate with the new president.Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are likely to hold Trump's feet to the fire to ensure he lives up to his promise to appoint justices who could ensure a generational conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.Clinton apparently failed to reassemble the diverse coalition that helped Obama win the presidency in 2008 and 2012.The events of Clinton's terrible final week on the campaign -- the revival of her email controversy by FBI Chief James Comey and a damaging drip, drip, drip of revelations by WikiLeaks which her campaign says was orchestrated by Russian intelligence -- could have helped consign her to defeat.There also is the question of Trump's temperament. Clinton repeatedly warned that he was unfit to control the nuclear codes because he could be baited with a tweet.Obama passionately denounced Trump as intellectually and temperamentally unfit to succeed him in the Oval Office.But now, he will be forced to greet his successor on the morning of Inauguration Day in January, and look on while he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States."

His family told police that he had been heavily using cocaine and that they left to get away from him on Monday night. On Tuesday afternoon, the man opened fire in his neighborhood and began shooting at random cars and passersby, killing his 77-year-old neighbor and wounding a woman, police said. He later ambushed police when they arrived on scene, said Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The third victim may have been hit during the ensuing gunfire -- leaving two women, ages 65 and 59, in critical condition. One of the women was shot in the face, and the other in the torso. Police said they had no identities for the three victims.Hours after the shooting began, the unidentified suspect was found dead in his home, police said. He appeared to have been shot by police. The shooting happened near a polling place, triggering a lockdown at the Memorial Park North Recreation Center, where voters had come to cast their ballots. Investigators have ruled out any connection between the shooting and Tuesday's elections, Corina said. LIVE: Election results and coverage""It was a coincidence, I think,"" he said. ""There was an elementary school nearby, it didn't involve the school either."" Three victims Officers responded to calls about gunshots being fired and found several victims on the street, said acting Azusa Police Chief Steve Hunt. The suspect, who was wearing military-style gear, walked up and down the street shooting people and was heavily armed, carrying a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun, authorities said.""The suspect shot at officers when they arrived on scene, causing them to return fire,"" Corina said. Five Azusa Police Department officers and one officer from the neighboring city of Irwindale fired back, he said. The suspect was formerly in the military and had been a city employee in Orange County, police said. Earlier, Azusa police said they were looking for a female suspect, but Corina told reporters at a late news conference that there was no evidence of another shooter. Police searched yards in surrounding homes just to be sure there were no other victims or suspects. The shots rang out in a working-class neighborhood, with well-kept front yards at mostly single family homes. The shootout happened right across from Memorial Park.""It's a nice neighborhood,"" said resident Jason Jonasson. ""My wife, myself and the kids walk our dogs every night. My daughters play basketball here. It's safe.""Frightening scene for votersTwo schools were locked down for hours following the shootings, and the polling center, along with another nearby, were ""impacted,"" authorities said.Two voters who were inside the Memorial Park North Recreation Center when the shooting occurred spoke to CNN, but didn't want to give their names. One voter said he was inside when he heard a bunch of shots ring out and people from outside rushed in before officials locked the doors.Another voter told CNN she also heard the shots. ""At first, I thought it was construction but people came running into the room saying they see a guy with a bulletproof vest and a white shirt,"" she said. Officials later evacuated the building and some voters were directed to other sites to cast their ballots."	California shooting: 1 dead, 2 wounded near LA-area polling station

Plus, the pantsuit is a subtle way to make a statement within the bounds of not wearing candidate paraphernalia to the polls, which is restricted.Latest 2016 election resultsDonald Trump supporters, on the other hand, are bringing out a trademark accessory of their own: the ""Make America Great Again"" hat.The slogan harkens back to an idealized past that resonates with many voters.
