""Likely to get questions on State Department emails.""""Another filing in the (Freedom of Information Act) case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails,"" he added.Tim Kaine: James Comey's actions are 'making our folks mad'The exchange is one of tens of thousands of emails stolen from Podesta's Gmail account and published by WikiLeaks in recent weeks. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of any of the emails, and the Clinton campaign has so far declined to verify individual emails.The Department of Justice declined to respond to questions regarding the email, and Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri, who was among the officials to whom Podesta forwarded the email in 2015, also declined to comment when asked by a reporter aboard Clinton's campaign plane.The email plays into Republican candidate Donald Trump's long-running narrative that Clinton and her entourage belong to a corrupt political elite seeking to exert influence at the Justice Department. Over the summer, days before the FBI announced it had completed its investigation into the private server, Bill Clinton met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch aboard her government plane, sparking accusations of a conflict of interest.Trump was quick to raise the Kadzik email during a campaign rally in Florida Wednesday afternoon, calling Kadzik ""a close associate of John Podesta.""""These are the people that want to run our country, folks,"" Trump said to a chorus of boos. ""The spread of political agendas into Justice Department -- there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history -- is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country.""The legal filing referenced in the second part of Kadzik's email had been submitted to the court a day before Kadzik sent it, and had already been reported on in the media. But Kadzik's phrasing, and his decision to write from his personal email account, gives the impression he was passing the information along as an informal tip, not knowing whether it had been filed.Read more: Turmoil in the FBIInformation about the congressional hearing was also publicly available.Podesta later forwarded Kadzik's note to Clinton's other senior campaign staff with the comment, ""Additional chances for mischief,"" though it wasn't clear to whom or what he was referring.The conversation suggests Kadzik may have felt inclined to keep Podesta informed about developments at the Department of Justice that related to the fledgling campaign. The FOIA case in question involved the State Department, not the campaign, and Podesta was not directly involved in the legal proceedings.Kadzik previously worked for Podesta as a lawyer, and additional emails released by WikiLeaks suggest the two men were friends.For example, in January, Kadzik and his wife emailed to wish Podesta a happy birthday and invite him to dinner next time he was in town.Kadzik's wife, Amy Weiss, worked in the White House in the late 1990s when Podesta was then-President Bill Clinton's chief of staff.It's unclear how Kadzik learned of the FOIA filing, which was submitted by Department of Justice attorneys representing the State Department in ongoing lawsuits.Despite Trump's assertions to the contrary, Kadzik was not directly involved in the FBI's investigation into Clinton's private email server, nor is he involved in its current review of emails found on a computer belonging to the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.The stolen email is one of several published by WikiLeaks in recent weeks that raise questions about the coziness between the Clinton campaign and government officials.Last month, the group published an email in which Brian Fallon -- a former spokesman for the Department of Justice now working for the Clinton campaign -- indicated he has spoken with ""DOJ folks"" about pending FOIA litigation.And on Wednesday, an email emerged showing communication between a State Department spokeswoman and top Clinton aides about how the State Department would respond to reports about the former Secretary's emails. This particular exchange was from March 1, 2015 -- one day before Clinton's private server was first revealed by The New York Times, and about a month before the official launch of her presidential campaign.The spokeswoman outlined the State Department's response to the upcoming report, indicating that the press office had incorporated input from the Clinton aides.The email was forwarded to Palmieri, who in turn forwarded it to Podesta.""You may have already heard from other channels, but NYT will have a story tomorrow on HRC's Benghazi emails,"" Palmieri wrote, along with speculation about how the reporter learned of the server.""Better now than April,"" she added."

Clinton is also putting money on the airwaves in blue states, seeking to deny her rival inroads into her so-called blue wall of defense.  At the same time, the Republican National Committee has made its first ad buy in support of Trump, putting up $2.9 million in five states -- Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Iowa -- and a new ad referencing news of a Clinton-related FBI probe. ""Now, the FBI has launched a new investigation. After decades of lies and scandal, her corruption is closing in,"" the narrator says, explaining how ""pay-to-play politics"" made her ""filthy rich.""  Clinton's new reservations follow Trump's pledge to spend $25 million on advertising this week, although he is about $5 million short of that target. He would need to increase his spending by about $15 million to honor his pledge to spend $100 million on TV from late September through Election Day.Future45, a GOP super PAC funded by the Adelson and Ricketts families, also plans to spend $10 million on a television campaign in the closing days.All told, the candidates' campaigns and outside groups supporting their bids will spend nearly $75 million on TV ads this week.Clinton's additional funds grow her reach in several key battlegrounds, such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  But she is also buying time in blue states in what her campaign described as an effort to block any Trump efforts to expand the electoral map.  For example, Clinton's campaign is going up in Colorado, where it last advertised in late July, and Virginia, where it last ran ads in early August. She is also running her first ads of the general election in Michigan and New Mexico.  Both campaigns have announced plans to run ads during Game 7 of the World Series Wednesday night."

Kaine was responding to reports from The New York Times and CNBC that cited sources who claimed Comey was against publicly disclosing Russia's role in election year hacks of Democratic Party officials and committees.""Really, there are two protocols that law enforcement officials follow that were both broken in that letter Friday and we don't really understand why. Why would you break them? So the first one is not talking about a pending investigation and the second one is not releasing controversial information right before an election. Now, we know that these are strong protocols that have been in place for a long time. We know that Director Comey believes in these protocols.""Kaine said the burden was on Comey to explain his reasoning.""When he testified before Congress at the end of September, and he was asked repeatedly about concerns about Russia engaging in these activities, over and over again he said, 'I will not comment upon any pending investigation even to say whether or not there's an investigation going on,'"" Kaine said.""And then on the seventh of October, when the national intelligence community released the letter saying that Russia was engaging in these activities, the reporting yesterday suggests that he agreed with the evidence, but did want to sign on to the letter because he didn't believe the FBI should be commenting on something controversial right before an election.""So, if he understands that these are the protocols, and has been acting in accord with these protocols up to just recently, why issue this vague letter Friday that violated both of the protocols? It seems like a double standard and I really think the burden is on him to explain why."""	Tim Kaine: James Comey's actions are 'making our folks mad'

They were released early to allow the court to handle some legal issues, according to a staff member for US District Court Judge Susan Wigenton. Attorneys went inside the courtroom multiple times on Wednesday, but media was not permitted to enter.The case focuses on two former officials who worked in and with the administration of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former Port Authority deputy executive director who is a political appointee, are each charged with nine criminal counts, including conspiracy and fraud.The charges stem from their alleged involvement in the 2013 lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. Prosecutors allege that the closures were part of a plot to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, who declined to endorse Christie, a Republican, in his re-election campaign. The charges are based on a tranche of emails and text messages released in January 2014. In one email sent a month before the closures, Kelly wrote to former Port Authority official David Wildstein, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" Wildstein replied: ""Got it."" Kelly has said that those messages displayed ""sarcasm and humor"" and she testified that she had told Christie about a traffic study potentially resulting in traffic problems a day prior to sending that email.Baroni testified that he believed the lane closures were an extension of an actual traffic study because that's what he was told by Wildstein, the admitted mastermind behind the incident.Wildstein avoided trial by pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation.Christie, meanwhile, insisted he had no knowledge of the closures and fired Kelly. A report put out by lawyers who were retained by Christie's office exonerated the governor a couple months following the release of the emails. But Christie, once viewed as a potential standard-bearer for the GOP, has seen his image and political prospects tarnished by the scandal.Baroni and Kelly each face a maximum sentence of 86 years, according to Paul Fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case, though it is more likely that they would receive up to three years if convicted."

""I think that we have to just get through this election and just see what the casualties are along the way.""The former House speaker said Comey had made a ""mistake"" by sending a letter to Congress about the new review of emails potentially related to Clinton's private server after not recommending prosecution earlier this summer. She alleged that he had a ""double standard"" given reports that Comey at other points did not want to use his agency to interfere in the election, adding that the new investigation is interfering in the race.Pelosi also declined to criticize Huma Abedin, the close Clinton aide who is estranged from former Rep. Anthony Weiner. The probe into Weiner's alleged sexting with an underage girl sparked the new review of emails.Asked if Clinton had exercised bad judgment in keeping Abedin so close, Pelosi turned the question on her husband.""I think Huma used bad judgment in marrying Anthony Weiner,"" she said.

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/gop-congressmen-constitutional-crisis/index.html	"Several Republican congressmen have been asked this week about a potential Clinton impeachment if she were indicted as a result of an FBI investigation into her emails; all of them warned of a ""constitutional crisis"" if Clinton were to be elected. Their answers mirror what Donald Trump has being saying on the campaign trail. At a rally Monday, Trump warned of the ""very possibility of constitutional crisis"" and said if Clinton were elected, she would face criminal investigations and possibly a trial. Texas Rep. Michael McCaul ‏on Fox News Wednesday explicitly mentioned the possibility of impeachment. ""Assuming she wins, and the investigation goes forward, and it looks like an indictment is pending, at that point in time, under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial,"" McCaul said. ""They would go to the Senate and impeachment proceedings and removal would take place.""""I would hate to see this country being thrown into a constitutional crisis because of Hillary Clinton's behavior,"" he added.‏Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes Tuesday that there would be a ""constitutional crisis"" if Clinton was indicted, and when asked about impeachment, answered, ""I think that is something that is speculative in nature. I'm speculating, what I can say is that I think Richard Nixon would have been indicted and he would have been impeached. He stopped the impeachment by resigning as a result of Watergate and he stopped the indictment by President Ford pardoning him.""New York Rep. Peter King offered a similar response when speaking on Long Island local radio Tuesday morning.""There's been nothing like this where you can have potential criminal charges,"" King said on ""L.I. in the AM."" Asked about impeachment, King responded investigations could drag on into Clinton's term as president. ""You really could have a constitutional crisis here,"" King said. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show Monday, where he agreed that a potential Clinton administration is heading towards impeachment and investigations. ""You put your finger on it: we would really have a constitutional crisis,"" Gohmert said after Hannity said a Clinton presidency would likely be headed towards impeachment. ""We've never had anyone under this type of investigation at the top of the election. There's nobody to blame but Hillary.""  Republican Sen. Ron Johnson from Wisconsin also said Clinton could be impeached in an interview Tuesday with a local newspaper, and Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson said in a radio interview over the weekend that she may be headed for impeachment.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/new-hampshire-battleground-2016/index.html	"""He really has to win New Hampshire,"" said Andrew Smith, a pollster with the University of New Hampshire survey center. ""Trump doesn't have much margin for error at all in this race.""While the race is tightening here, recent FBI revelations about a review of additional emails potentially tied to Clinton's private server don't appear to be changing voters' minds -- at least not yet. Smith said it usually takes three to five days before any big campaign issue is realized in polling data.  The latest UNH poll has Clinton up by 7 points in a poll taken October 26-30, capturing opinions of only some likely voters who had heard about the email issue. In a previous UNH poll from mid-October Clinton's lead was 15 points. Smith says such tightening is typical in most races. Republicans, sensing an opportunity to turn the tide, are hammering away at the email issue.  ""There's a culture of corruption that she's brought to the Democratic Party"" says former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who backs Trump. ""It oozes into our elections even here in New Hampshire.""Hillary Clinton's challenge: Shift focus back to TrumpSome Democrats, perhaps hopefully, say the email disclosure may be only hardening support for Clinton. Campaign workers report an increase in volunteers over the weekend -- after news of the email issue was made public. Trump, whose campaign was revived when he decisively won the New Hampshire primary, has visited the state nine times since clinching the nomination. His running mate, Mike Pence, has been here four times.  In recent days, the Clinton campaign has deployed some of its most powerful surrogates. Bernie Sanders -- who handily beat Clinton in the New Hampshire Democratic primary -- is launching his cross country tour for Clinton with two rallies in New Hampshire. And last week, Elizabeth Warren campaigned here with the Democratic nominee in a powerful bid for female voters. New Hampshire, with more female than male voters, has for several years trended Democratic and tends to elect more women. The state's current governor, senators and one of its two representatives are female. Clinton is pushing her advantage over Trump directly with women but also looking to cut into his lead among men by targeting New Hampshire fathers who have daughters. Clinton campaign workers say they are digging through voter notes and records back to July trying to identify fathers who have daughters. Campaign aides say they are looking at that ""persuasion universe"" of men who may be predisposed to support Clinton.  ""There are an awful lot of men out there, particularly those that have daughters,"" said Clinton adviser Terei Norelli and former speaker of the state House. They ""understand women being able to live to their full potential.""For Republican campaign worker Paula Tarta, Trump's lewd behavior and disparaging remarks about women are just ""men talking."" She believes Trump is the right candidate to ""drain the swamp"" -- short-hand for bringing widespread change to current politics. ""I think it's gonna take a tough personality to get in there"" she says, ""he's a strong guy.""Clinton camp insists it can't be thrown off courseBoth campaigns are showing a high degree of enthusiasm and support. Republicans say they've knocked on 1.4 million doors and made 1.3 million phone calls.  Democrats counter their 12,500 active volunteers have knocked on nearly 600,000 individual doors and made over 2 million phone calls. New Hampshire's entire population is only 1.3 million.Television campaign ad spending has been heavy and will get heavier in the final few days.  Kantar Media, which tracks ad spending, shows Clinton and her super PAC collectively spent around $11.9 million so far in the general election and have reserved time for another $1.8 million in ads through Election Day.  Trump and his super PAC have spent $3.9 million and have reserved $1.7 million in ad time for a blitz in the closing days. Smith, the pollster, said Trump has to do better with women here and increase his support even among Republicans, where he's running with only 80% support. ""He needs to have 90% plus the Republicans voting for him"" says Smith.Sununu puts it more bluntly.  ""The Electoral College map is in a mess,"" says the former governor with his trademark grin. ""You have Hillary going to red states. You have Trump going to blue states. Unless (Trump) gets another surprise state to fill the gap, New Hampshire may be the difference."""

Obama approval hits new highObama's victories in the 2008 and 2012 elections were propelled in large part by his advantages among a broad and diverse coalition, including a mammoth margin of victory among black voters.But there are signs that this year's Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton might suffer from lower turnout among black voters, something that Obama addressed Wednesday. The ""African-American vote right now is not as solid as it needs to be,"" he said.Early voting numbers from key swing states and a state Clinton is hoping to flip to the blue column show that African Americans have not been voting early in the same numbers as they have in past elections. In North Carolina, blacks account for 23% of the early voting electorate, compared to 28% at this point in 2012. In Georgia, blacks so far make up 31% of the early voting population compared to 36% at this time in 2012. In Florida, blacks accounted for 15% of the early vote at this stage in 2008 -- the most recent year for which statistics were available -- compared to 12% this year.""And I know that there are a lot of people in barbershops and beauty salons, you know, in the neighborhoods who are saying to themselves, 'We love Barack, we love -- we especially love Michelle, and so, you know, it was exciting and now we're not as excited as much.' You know what? I need everybody to understand that everything we've done is dependent on me being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in,"" Obama said.The pitch was similar to remarks Obama made in September at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner, when he said that he would consider a Trump victory to be ""an insult to my legacy."" In an attempt to drive home the point that the black community could be particularly affected by a Clinton loss, the President said Wednesday the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, support for historically black colleges and universities, civil rights, voting right and even the first lady's garden would be at risk under a Trump presidency.He said progress made on criminal justice reform could also be stalled, citing the case of the Central Park Five, a group of black and Hispanic youths whose wrongful conviction in a 1989 New York rape was later overturned.""Donald Trump is somebody who after the Central Park case was recognized as having convicted young African American men who were innocent today still insists that they should be in jail and what - this is the guy who's gonna suddenly help to make sure that folks have fair treatment in the criminal justice system?"""
