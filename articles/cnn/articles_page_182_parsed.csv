According to the announcement from CHAI, all five members of its board will step down if Clinton wins in November. That includes the former president and his daughter, Bruce Lindsey, Ira Magaziner and Maggie Williams. Lindsey is the chairman of the Clinton Foundation and all three have been top aides to the Clintons in public office. The organization will retain its acronym but remove ""Clinton"" from its name and separate from the Clinton Foundation. Other steps include amending CHAI's bylaws to remove the Clinton Foundation's role in appointing board members and appointing a new board if Clinton wins the election. What is the Clinton Foundation and why is it an issue?CHAI's announcement follows similar decisions from the Clinton Foundation. The organization announced last month that it would stop accepting corporate and foreign donations if Clinton wins, and Bill Clinton wouldn't give paid speeches. But Chelsea Clinton would continue her work with the organization.The family's charitable organizations, which work on issues including public health and gender equality around the world, have drawn scrutiny in the election cycle for its donors. Though no explicit conflict of interests have been found, Clinton interacted with many of the donors to her organization in her role as secretary of state. Emails released in Freedom of Information Act requests also revealed her staff fielding requests related to foundation donors, such as job leads or meetings. The Clintons and State Department have denied any impropriety.The Clintons have been asked why they will make changes only after Clinton is elected and whether they will shutter the charity entirely. Clinton has said the process of winding down the group while continuing the charity's missions will take time, and that the foundation is looking for ""partners"" to help with the effort. The Trump campaign on Wednesday called the move a ""PR gimmick.""""This proposal is a P.R. gimmick designed to distract from the mounting Clinton Foundation controversies and amounts to the Clintons launching a fire sale on influence-buying before the November election,"" said campaign spokesman Jason Miller. ""To completely eliminate the prospect of undue foreign influence, the Clinton Foundation and its affiliates should not only cease accepting these donations immediately, they should return every penny they have received from other countries.""

DiLorenzo of Richmond, Virginia, released a statement Tuesday that doesn't mention Kaine specifically but makes clear, from his view, there is no chance of the church ending its long-held policy.""More than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on marriage, and despite recent statements from the campaign trail, the Catholic Church's 2,000-year-old teaching to the truth about what constitutes marriage remains unchanged and resolute,"" he said.LGBT advocates lauded a speech Kaine, who is Catholic, delivered at the Human Rights Campaign's annual gala over the weekend. In that speech, Kaine suggested that the Catholic Church -- for which he once served as a missionary -- could change its position.""I think it's going to change,"" Kaine said to cheers. ""Because my church also teaches me about a creator who, in the first chapter of Genesis, surveyed the entire world, including mankind, and said, 'It is very good.'""The Clinton campaign declined to respond to the Bishop's statement. Kaine's commitment to the Catholic Church often comes at odds with his progressive politics. Abortion rights activists have often been skeptical of Kaine because he describes himself as personally opposed to abortion like his church but believes in a woman's right to choose like his party.Kaine's Catholic faith and specifically his home church on Richmond's Northside play prominently in his narrative as a candidate. He even mentioned his church in his first speech after Clinton announced she had selected him as her running mate and attended Mass there the following Sunday.Like Clinton, Kaine has only relatively recently become an ardent supporter of same-sex marriage. He did not announce that he officially supported the legal rights of gay couples who wanted to marry until 2013. Kaine supported civil unions as early as 2001 and in 2006 opposed an amendment to Virginia's constitution that banned same sex marriage in the Commonwealth.DiLorenzo is known as a conservative bishop but rarely weighs in on political fights.

""Anything he might do with this, I would encourage him to promote the expansion of families because if we don't have more babies than we have funerals, we're going to end up like Europe.

When Trump couldn't keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim,"" Powell wrote in an August email.The messages, the existence of which were first reported by BuzzFeed and The Intercept, were posted to DCleaks, an organization affiliated with other recent hacks of high-profile figures.Peggy Cifrino, an aide to Powell, told CNN: ""The emails are accurate. No further comment at this time."" The emails are notable for their candor about Trump. Powell, who oversaw the State Department during the beginning of George W. Bush's administration, hasn't endorsed Trump and has largely sidestepped questions about his thoughts on the controversial GOP nominee. Powell also lampooned Trump's proposal that he could win over the African-American population.""For him to say yesterday that within four years he would have 95% of blacks voting for him is schizo fantasy,"" Powell wrote, adding, ""And (former Fox News chief Roger) Ailes as an adviser won't heal with women.""READ: Roger Ailes picked wrong women to mess withMoreover, the former secretary of state tore into Trump as an embarrassing figure to represent the United States. ""Trump is a national disgrace and an international pariah,"" Powell wrote in June. ""He appeals to the worst angels of the GOP nature and poor white folks,"" Powell wrote in another email.As Trump's lead in the Republican primary solidified, Powell complained to CNN's Fareed Zakaria about the network's political coverage. READ: Why the 2016 presidential debates really matter""You guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,"" Powell wrote in December.On Wednesday night, Trump tweeted his disdain for Powell.""I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster. We can do much better!"" Trump said.Clinton 'kind of screws up with hubris'But the messages also showed Powell angry with Hillary Clinton over her handling of her personal emails as secretary of state. As The Intercept reported, Powell wrote in 2015, ""Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris.""The FBI released information from its investigation of Clinton's email practices in July and August, and the notes it released showed Clinton indicating her practices came from Powell.Powell pushed back against this publicly, telling People magazine in August that Clinton's people were trying to pin it on him.He said as much in his email, writing on August 23: ""(Clinton) didn't need any advice or ok from me; she was already doing it. I gave her written guidance on why and how I had been doing it.""Clinton appeared on CNN shortly thereafter and told Anderson Cooper that the blame rested with her. Cheryl Mills, a former staffer for Clinton, forwarded the transcript of Clinton's CNN interview to Powell, a leaked message shows. He responded to Mills, calling the comments ""very nice."" ""The only thing I would add is to simply say she had a private account on a public server before becoming SecState and continued to use it when she became SecState. On the other hand this might to lead to questions about the basement,"" Powell said. On August 28, he said that Clinton ""could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it. I told her staff three times not to try that gambit.""Wednesday's email leak was not the first time Powell's private thoughts were revealed. In 2013, a hacker known as ""Guccifer"" infiltrated Powell's email. The Romanian hacker, Marcel Lazar, also managed his way into the digital spaces of some members of the Bush family and Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal. Lazar was sentenced to 52 months in prison on September 1.These leaks came from DCleaks on the same day a hacker by the alias ""Guccifer 2.0"" released more information from the Democratic National Committee. Experts have pointed to Russian state elements as the actors behind the DNC leaks.Powell, Rice talk Iraq WarAn exchange in 2015 showed Powell and his successor, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, critiquing some of their former colleagues in the Bush administration.Rice forwarded a link to story about Bob Woodward slamming former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's recent commentary on the Iraq War.  Rice praised Woodward and added: ""First, we didn't invade Iraq to bring democracy --- but once we overthrew Saddam (Hussein), we had a view of what should follow. If Don and the Pentagon had done their job ... things might have turned out differently.""Powell criticized ""Doug and Paul,"" presumably Douglas J. Feith and Paul Wolfowitz, for their plan on Iraq and praised his former boss, President George W. Bush.""43 (Bush, the 43rd president) knew what had to be done,"" Powell wrote to Rice.

That's the largest disparity since Trump began running general election advertisements in mid-August.  Before that, Clinton and her super PAC outspent Trump by even larger margins. In one early July week, his forces put up less than $1 million in ads to the nearly $13 million spent by Clinton and her primary super PAC, Priorities USA.  Trump's efforts to narrow the gap have been focused largely on four battleground states: Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. He has also invested $2 million in Virginia, although his advertising habits in that state and others have been sporadic.  His $2.1 million buy this week will air a new ad criticizing Clinton for calling many of his supporters ""deplorables.""  It features images of Trump supporters while a narrator explains Clinton was describing ""people like you, you and you.""  Clinton responded with her own advertisement, a minute-long spot that mashes together various Trump insults.  There is a dose of good news for Trump, however small:  Rebuilding America Now, the best-organized pro-Trump super PAC, will return to buying television time this week after three weeks off the airwaves.  It is launching a $100,000 buy in Pennsylvania, a media buying source told CNN.  Clinton's campaign has spent more than $110 million on general election television advertising, while Trump's campaign has spent less than $19 million.

Frank Pandolfe, assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.""It's a country that counts and we are working to fashion a relationship that works with them,"" Pandolfe said at a security conference arranged by the Institute for the Study of War. He cited areas where Washington and Moscow have cooperated -- on the Iran nuclear deal, on sanctioning North Korea and most recently on the ceasefire arrangement in Syria.    ""And yet,"" Pandolfe said, ""there's another side to this relationship and that's the transgressions.""Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's assistant for Homeland Security, on Wednesday addressed one of the most recent suspected transgressions -- the apparent role of Russian hackers in a breach of Democratic National Committee emails. ""Look, we know Russia is a bad actor in cyber space, just as China has been, just as Iran has been,"" Monaco said in remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She said that ""folks will have to stay tuned"" as to whether Russia would be ""named and shamed"" for the attacks.She added a warning: ""Nobody should think that there is a free pass when you are conducting malicious cyber activity, just like they shouldn't think there is a free pass on terrorists.""Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who has repeatedly expressed skepticism about Russia's intent in Syria, offered a measured response when asked about the ceasefire plan Wednesday in Austin, Texas. ""We've got a ways to go to see whether it will be implemented,"" Carter said, ""but if it is, it will mean that the suffering of the Syrian people is eased. It will mean that Russia gets on the right side of things in Syria, not on the wrong side, and that's good news.""Some of the military's highest-ranking officers, speaking at the Institute of War's security conference, were less circumspect about Russia's role in the ceasefire, a deal reached Friday between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. RELATED: Syria: Temporary ceasefire begins amid skepticismUnder that agreement, if calm holds until Monday, the US and Russia would establish a joint operations center to target ISIS fighters in Syria. It would require the US military to share information with Russian forces and has drawn some resistance from the Pentagon.

And I think we all understand why that is.""The top US military commander in the Middle East, Gen. Joseph Votel, described himself as ""very realistic"" about the prospects of US-Russian cooperation and also pointed to ""a trust deficit.""""It is not clear to us what their objectives are,"" said Votel, commander of US Central Command, who praised the agreement for providing an opportunity to reduce the violence in Syria. The Russians ""say one thing and then they don't necessarily follow up on that.""The Centcom commander explained that the arrangement was taking the military into relatively new territory.""We don't have lot of experience with this,"" he said, adding that they would have to start very deliberately, establishing a process and ""ways of passing information back and forth.""It remains to be seen whether the cooperative effort will work, he said.

It was 1988, and a six-figure contract was huge. Businesses could pose conflicts of interest for a President Trump""It was a big job. It was great. We were all excited,"" says Forest's son Steven Jenkins. Jenkins spent a month working at the Taj. ""I had the fuzz from those carpets on the wheels of my dolly for months after that job.""But what seemed like a winning ticket soon turned into a nightmare when the paycheck never came. ""We weren't this big company,"" remembers Rosser, who now runs the company with her brother, Steven. ""We didn't have tons of money in an account somewhere to cover things.""Jenkins says his dad, who built the company from nothing, nearly lost everything. The Taj Mahal, the most expensive casino ever built in Atlantic City filed for bankruptcy in 1991, just two years after its glitzy grand opening. The bankruptcy meant companies like Triad Building Specialties didn't get paid. After years of fighting through bankruptcy court, the Jenkins ended up with just 30 cents on the dollar. Their company was owed $231,000, according to the bankruptcy claim filed in the case. The Jenkins family received $70,000.The Jenkins family realized they weren't alone. Dozens of contractors who had worked on the construction were also getting stiffed.""It's 27 years later. I grit my teeth every time I see him on television blustering about what a wonderful businessman he is,"" Rosser says. ""He stepped on a lot of people.""CNN reached out to the Trump campaign about each of the business deals mentioned in this story. Those calls went unanswered. 'I tried to stand up to him ... but it's exhausting'Nat Hyman also knows what it's like to lose money at the hands of Trump.  ""When he's nice, he's very, very nice. And when he's nasty, he's immensely nasty. He is as rough as they get,"" says Hyman, who claims he spent years buried in litigation with Trump. In 1996, Hyman was a young entrepreneur who thought he landed a great deal when he secured a kiosk inside the Trump Tower lobby for his costume jewelry company, Landau Jewelry. His nascent business flourished and, eventually, the jeweler was able to negotiate deals with Trump to open additional kiosks inside his Atlantic City casinos.But then Hyman's success was stymied. He claims his kiosk inside Trump Tower was in a prime location, so Trump tried to force him out of the spot. Trump's lawyers sent letters citing ""the poor quality of the merchandise"" -- a claim Hyman says was unfounded. When Hyman wouldn't move, he says Trump retaliated against him by canceling his leases for the Atlantic City casinos and burying him in legal paperwork.""I think I spent over a million dollars in litigation with him,"" Hyman says.Hyman eventually left Trump Tower after 14 years. Trump replaced the jeweler's kiosk with his own merchandise that bore his name.If he had to do it all over again, Hyman says he would have never gone into business with the real-estate tycoon. ""I tried to stand up to him everywhere I could but it's exhausting, and it's silly. To him, it's a sport. To him, it's fun.""A family business that was 'blackballed'On the campaign trail in June, Trump promised the crowd that his business experience would create thousands of new jobs.""We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country,"" Trump pledged.But Paul Friel says his dad's small business went under at the hands of the billionaire.The Edward J. Friel Company built cabinets for Trump's first Atlantic City casino in the early 1980s. The company was awarded a $400,000 contract to build cabinets for the slot machines at Trump Plaza.After the work was completed and approved by the general contractor, Friel expected a payment of $84,000, which would have covered the final expenses and all of the profit. But Friel says Trump bought out the construction contract from the general contractor, Perini Corporation, and then refused to make the payment.It was a shock to his father, Friel remembers.""We had already worked for three (general contractors), and every single one of them lived up to their word until Donald Trump came to Atlantic City,"" Friel says. Friel's father tried to recoup the money he was owed but eventually gave up. Friel believes Trump used his enormous influence to block his father's company from working on any future Atlantic City projects. ""I think it surprised him the most that Donald Trump had blackballed him ... even though we had an excellent name in Atlantic City,"" Friel says.After struggling to stay afloat, the Edward J. Friel Company filed for bankruptcy several years later.""He was devastated. The fact that we had seen such a huge future in Atlantic City for his business that all of a sudden because of one deal ... his business in Atlantic City was done,"" Friel says.At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland Trump promised to prosperity for America, saying: ""I have made billions of dollars in business making deals. Now I'm going to make our country rich again.""Friel says he's speaking out on behalf of his father, who died in 2006.

The TV appearance might give the appearance of transparency, but the summary by Bornstein will likely fall far short of experts' calls for detailed information about Trump's health and medical history. The campaign says it will release detailed information from the exam later in the week.Wednesday's interview comes as the health of both Trump and his opponent, Hillary Clinton, have taken center stage in the 2016 election. The Clinton campaign revealed on Sunday that she was recently diagnosed with pneumonia -- a development that has led to calls for more transparency and information on both nominees' medical records and histories. Trump's interview was scheduled prior to Clinton's health incident.Here is what we learned about Trump's health, according to the audience members who were inside ""The Dr. Oz Show"" taping:Trump would like to lose some weight. ""Trump said he should lose 15 to 20 pounds,"" said audience member Sheldon Hosten.So how much does Trump weigh, anyway? He's 6'3"" and weighs 236 pounds, according to Villa's recollection (some other publications said the weight mentioned at the taping was 267 pounds).Trump is on Statins -- drugs that help to lower cholesterol.Presumably thanks to the drugs, Trump's cholesterol level is now normal.We all know Trump loves to play golf. Well, he wishes he were doing it more: ""He said 'yes,' he would like to play golf more -- he used to play more golf,"" audience member Giulia Trojer said.Trump also claimed he's good enough to play with the PGA, according to audience member Kelly Platt.Trump proudly eats a fair amount of fast food when he's out on the road.
