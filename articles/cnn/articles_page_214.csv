""All fundraising has ceased and the only thing being done is the distribution of blankets, personal care kits and related items in the warehouse.""In CNN's original report, the watchdog group Charity Navigator gave the Foundation zero out of four stars. According to its public tax returns, called 990s, the Foundation took in $29 million over a four-year period but nearly all of it went to telemarketers and fundraisers. In one year, the charity also paid a parking garage bill of nearly $8,000.Michael Thatcher, the CEO of Charity Navigator, said the foundation deserved is zero rating.""If one really cared about Vietnam veterans, is this an effective way of making a difference? I don't think so. I can't justify it. I can't explain it.""When CNN's Drew Griffin approached the charity president outside his home in suburban Washington and tried to ask questions, Burch sped away in his vintage Rolls Royce rather than stopping to answer.The VA, through a spokesman, said it had been unaware of Burch's job as the president of the charity. In an email, VA spokesman James Hutton said Burch was still employed as a staff attorney but that an internal investigation, conducted by the agency's Office of Inspector General, was still in progress.Attempts to reach Burch for comment both by phone and email were unsuccessful."

Many also poked fun at Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has agreed to meet with Trump and whose popularity has been tanking.""An advanced look of what we'll see tomorrow,"" one person tweeted Tuesday night, posting an image of the lead characters from the 1990s cartoon ""Beavis and Butt-head.""Mexican actress Ana Brenda tweeted an idea, encouraging Peña Nieto to block Trump at the border.""You will be a national hero,"" she wrote.Mexico City's Museum of Memory and Tolerance, which includes exhibits on the Holocaust and the US Civil Rights Movement, offered Trump free admission.""We invite you to visit us to remember history and not repeat it,"" the museum said on Twitter.It's no surprise that Trump, who launched his presidential bid with a speech referring to Mexicans who illegally cross the US border as murderers and rapists, isn't popular in Mexico.Here's a look at ways some in the neighboring country have responded to the US presidential candidate and his proposals:Pounding piñatas Trump has already been in Mexico for months -- as a piñata.Just a few days after the billionaire businessman announced his campaign, an artist in Reynosa, Mexico, started making piñatas of a man in a suit with wispy orange hair. It wasn't long before similar models were for sale across the country.The idea quickly caught on in the United States as well, with stores in Texas and California selling out of the popular items.And tweets mocking Trump's Mexico visit Wednesday picked up on the trend, imagining what the presidential hopeful might say when he sees the piñatas.Making a mask factory great againOwners of a Halloween mask factory in Jiutepec, Mexico, told CNN's Rafael Romo earlier this year that they were busier than ever, thanks to Trump.Trump's fame in the United States -- and infamy in Mexico -- drove demand for an unflattering Trump mask, which picked up last fall when it became clear that the Republican presidential candidate was a serious contender.""We weren't making this mask with hair at first,"" co-owner Ricardo Esponda told CNN, ""but some of our customers asked for it. It's got to have hair.""Families fear impactBut for some Mexicans, Trump's proposals are no laughing matter.Several families told CNN's Rosa Flores last month they were terrified by Trump's proposal to cut off money transfers from the US to Mexico.""It's not right,"" Martha Mendoza said as she cooked tortillas at her home in the town of Francisco Villa.Town leader Jaime Leon said he was worried about the future of his small village.""Francisco Villa, without money transfers (from the US), will drown,"" he said. ""It will downward spiral.""Ex-Presidents slam wall proposalWhile Peña Nieto seems to have extended an olive branch, several former Mexican leaders have made it clear they'll never see eye to eye with Trump.Former President Vicente Fox didn't mince words when a reporter asked earlier this year about Trump's proposal to make Mexico pay for a wall at the border.""I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall. He should pay for it,"" Fox told Fusion's Jorge Ramos in a interview.Since then, Fox, who led Mexico from 2000-2006, has continued to slam the Republican candidate. ""Trump is using Mexico, is using President Peña to push his sinking poll numbers,"" Fox told CNN ahead of Trump's trip.And former first lady Margarita Zavala joined the fray on Wednesday, sending a tweet to Trump.""Even though they have invited you, know that you are not welcome,"" she wrote. ""Mexicans have dignity and we repudiate your discourse of hate."""	Mexicans respond to Trump with jokes, jeers

And a Marquette University Law School poll finds Clinton's lead with likely voters is 45% to Trump's 42%. In a four-way matchup, it's 37% Clinton, 32% Trump, 11% Johnson, 7% Stein and 13% undecided. Those results are much tighter than the findings from the last Marquette poll in early August. That one found Clinton ahead by 15 points among likely voters. What it means: Clinton's post-convention bump in Wisconsin is gone. Trump's strongest spot is with white men, with whom he leads 51% to 29%, the Monmouth poll found. But he trails 50% to 33% among white women, and Clinton leads 67% to 12% among black, Hispanic and Asian voters. ""The current presidential election race in Wisconsin is looking a lot like the 2012 contest right now,"" said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University Polling Institute.

Anything but Hillary Clinton. Because I think Hillary Clinton means war. Hillary Clinton means devastation. It means world instability.""Le Pen said she supported Trump for president back in July in an interview with the French paper Le Parisien and similarly criticized Clinton at the time. Like Trump's campaign, Le Pen's has been a lightning rod for political controversy during her leadership of the National Front. The party, founded by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, is staunchly opposed to cross-border migration in the European Union, has warned against the dangers of accepting refugees from the Middle East and loudly cheered the result of the Brexit referendum.

(Tim) Kaine will dispense with normal campaign activity on 9/11, including ceasing to run campaign advertisements.""Trump spokesman Jason Miller confirmed the Republican nominee would also suspend normal campaign activity on Thursday.Johnson's campaign announced Tuesday that it would not campaign on September 11 either. 9/11 Day sent a letter to each campaign asking them to pledge to suspend all campaign activity.The letter requested that the campaigns ""dispense with normal campaign activity on that day, including ceasing to run campaign advertisements, to enable the 9/11 community and the nation to solemnly and peacefully pay tribute to the 9/11 victims, rescue and recovery workers, and those who rose to defend our nation after 9/11.""The letter also asked that rather than work on normal campaign activities, campaign staff will ""dedicate time on 9/11 to remembrance and prayer, and participating in charitable service events and activities in support of the federally recognized September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance.""Clinton was New York's junior senator during the September 11 attack and occasionally references the day and its fallout when urging Republicans and Democrats to work together.""I remember how it felt on the day after 9/11,"" Clinton said during a June event in Cleveland.

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/politics/congress-zika-funding/index.html	"After consulting with public health officials, the White House sent Congress a $1.9 billion funding request in February to help fund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's efforts to combat the virus, which can cause serious birth defects. But Congress left for summer recess without agreeing on legislation, as Democrats objected to riders that blocked funding for Planned Parenthood.""We're hopeful that when they do return, that Republicans in Congress will have had an opportunity to rethink their priorities and will once again put the health and safety and well-being of the American people back at the top of the list where it belongs,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday.The Senate is set to vote on a $1.1 billion Zika bill Tuesday, when Congress returns, but that bill includes the same Planned Parenthood rider that has angered Democrats. Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said that while Puerto Rico will get new funding for contraception and health care under the bill, that money would go to hospitals and community health centers, but not necessarily to Planned Parenthood.""They would rather have no funding than have funding that goes to hospitals and community health centers but not guaranteed to Planned Parenthood‎,"" Stewart said. An aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Democrats would continue to block the bill. ""Democrats have been calling for bipartisan negotiations for months, but instead of coming to the table, Republicans are holding a vote on a bill they know will fail,"" Adam Jentleson said. ""Once this partisan exercise is over, we hope Republicans will finally engage in real negotiations to address this critical issue.""Zika spreading in USThe additional funds are taking on new urgency as two areas in Miami deal with nearly 50 cases of locally-transmitted infections. Heavy rains and flooding in other parts of the south such as Louisiana and Texas could also help the virus spread as mosquitoes take advantage of standing water. There are more than 2,500 travel-related cases of Zika in the United States, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""That's how you get local transmission, because when mosquitoes bite those people and then bite people who never left the United States, that's how you get local transmission of Zika,"" Fauci said during a Twitter town hall. Fauci echoed the administration's call for the $1.9 billion already requested to fund efforts to fight the virus.The Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in early August in Puerto Rico, where officials reported 10,690 laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika as of August 12, including 1,035 pregnant women. The actual number of people infected with Zika likely is higher because most people with Zika infections have no symptoms and might not seek testing, the agency said.Earlier this month, HHS also redirected $81 million from elsewhere in the department to continue efforts to fight the Zika virus. HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a letter to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi that she was exercising her authority to transfer $34 million from within the National Institutes of Health and $47 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to keep ""Zika-related activities"" going. Without that, she said, the unused Ebola money they have been using since April will run out by the end of August and prohibit phase II of a Zika vaccine trial.CDC warns of consequencesCDC Director Thomas Frieden is warning of dire consequences if there is not enough money to battle the virus, which causes only mild symptoms in most people but can be particularly harmful for pregnant women who risk giving birth to babies with microcephaly, a condition that causes a small head, brain damage and hearing loss. It has also been associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth and serious neurological problems, according to HHS. ""We don't have the resources we need to mount the kind of robust fight against the disease,"" Frieden said in the Twitter town hall Tuesday. ""Without additional funding, we will not be able to fully understand the impact of Zika on pregnancy and newborns. We won't be able to develop better diagnostic tests as rapidly as we could and we won't be able to improve mosquito control to protect ourselves from Zika and other mosquito born illnesses."" The CDC awarded $6.8 million to national public health organizations to help battle the virus through mosquito surveillance and epidemiology, vector control and communication and outreach programs and has provided states, cities and territories more than $100 million to date to fight Zika.Frieden said a vaccine is still at least two years away.""We hope Congress will fully fund the request,"" Frieden said. ""That way, we can robustly and rapidly protect American women and their babies against Zika. It's important that his funding includes reimbursement authority and the authority that allows us to spend money efficiently and rapidly."""

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/politics/donald-trump-immigration-speech/index.html	"The Republican presidential nominee on Wednesday re-upped the harsh immigration rhetoric that electrified his primary campaign, vowing ""no amnesty"" for undocumented migrants living in the United States and promising to build a ""beautiful"" and ""impenetrable"" border wall that Mexico would pay for -- hours after that country's president vowed that it wouldn't.""This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better,"" Trump said in Phoenix at the end of a dizzying day in which he made his first foray into international diplomacy with a visit to Mexico City, then baited a fired-up crowd with red-meat rhetoric.On what might have been one of the most important days of his presidential campaign, Trump appeared to be recommitting his electoral fate in November to the white conservative base voters who swept him to victory in the GOP primary rather than seeking to broaden his base to a wider coalition of Americans.Still, adding to the uncertainty that has clouded his immigration plan in recent days, Trump did not give a definitive answer about what he would do with most of the 11 million undocumented people who are not criminals, leaving open the possibility they would have to continue to hide in the shadows.But it was the tone of Trump's speech that was most notable.""This is it. We won't get another opportunity -- it will be too late,"" he said in a speech that recreated the vision of a dystopian, crime-riddled nation on the edge of an existential crisis that he deployed in his convention speech in Cleveland in July.He vowed to create a ""deportation task force"" within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division ""focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens in America."" He said he would boost the ranks of enforcement agents to enforce existing laws. He vowed that any undocumented immigrants who are caught crossing into the US will be ""detained until they are removed from our country"" and sent back to their country of origin. And he promised to repeal President Barack Obama's executive orders shielding some younger undocumented people, including those born in the United States -- so called Dreamers, from deportation.Fate of 11 million undocumented immigrants uncertainTrump left the fate of most of the 11 million undocumented people who are not criminals in the country murky.He did not commit to deporting every undocumented immigrant living in the US as he previously had, but vowed that immigrants living in the US illegally would never have a path to legal status under his presidency.What Donald Trump has said about Mexico and vice versa""For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system.""But later, Trump said that once a new immigration system is in place, ""we will be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain.""In his speech, the billionaire repeatedly called attention to the crimes of some undocumented immigrants and drew on stories of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants, bringing parents of some of those victims on stage to share their graphic and heart-wrenching tales of loss.Consistent with the law-and-order theme he has emphasized, Trump vowed a ""zero tolerance"" policy toward criminals living in the US illegally.As he painted a picture of a country besieged by ""illegal alien"" crime, Trump accused Washington politicians and the media of underplaying the dangers posed by illegal immigration and warned voters that the stakes this election will never be higher.""If we can save American lives, American jobs and American futures, together we can save America itself,"" Trump said.A quieter Trump in MexicoTrump's hard-line speech contrasted strikingly with his more moderate tone in Mexico City hours earlier when he put on a restrained and respectful performance, even as he publicly disagreed with President Enrique Peña Nieto, who had invited him and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to Mexico for talks.The visit was an apparent attempt to portray Trump in a statesmanlike light and to counter Clinton's claims that he is temperamentally unfit to be President. Trump's campaign will likely be pleased that he got a photo-op with a foreign leader and appeared to avoid any damaging gaffes as he stood soberly on stage, beside an interpreter.But the risks of such a visit -- Trump's first official encounter with a foreign leader -- were underscored when the stagecraft began to unravel over the issue of the wall on the Mexican border.Mexican president disputes Trump over border wall payment discussionTrump had told reporters that he and his host did not discuss the cost of who would pay for the multibillion-dollar project -- a statement that the Mexican president did not contest while alongside Trump. But he quickly said on Twitter that the wall came up, and there was no way Mexico would be paying.""At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,"" Peña Nieto tweeted.The confusion and apparent contradiction between the two men was quickly seized upon by the Clinton campaign, which mocked Trump, arguing the disconnect undercut his image as a great dealmaker.""Trump just failed his first foreign test. Diplomacy isn't as easy as it looks. --H"" Clinton said in a personally signed Tweet.Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, called the meeting ""the first part of the discussion and a relationship builder"" between the two men.""It was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate. It is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation,"" Miller said in a statement.Peña Nieto twice stressed the ""responsibility"" he has to defend Mexican people around the world and said Trump has made ""assertions that regrettably had hurt and have affected Mexicans.""Former Mexican President apologizes for Trump invitation""The Mexican people have felt hurt by the comments that have been made. But I am sure that his genuine interest is to build a relationship that will give both of our societies better welfare,"" Peña Nieto said.The Clinton campaign also argued that Trump's performance in Mexico proved that his tough guy image was just an act.""Donald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign. But at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked,"" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in a statement.The many versions of a Donald Trump meeting""What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate 'deal maker' is that he doesn't have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he's not in front of a friendly crowd,"" Podesta said, before accusing Trump of wanting to build a costly wall at American taxpayers' expense.Podesta later added: ""It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.""But Trump was adamant in his speech in Arizona that Mexico would indeed finance the wall if he becomes President.""Mexico will pay for the wall. 100 percent,"" Trump said.""They don't know it yet, but they are going to pay for the wall.""

We didn't discuss,"" Trump had said when asked by a reporter during a news conference following their meeting in Mexico City. ""We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date.""But Peña Nieto later claimed the two had discussed the wall and who would pay for it -- and he had ""made it clear"" to Trump it wouldn't be Mexico. ""At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,"" Peña Nieto tweeted, after their meeting Wednesday.He added that his conversation with the Republican nominee then moved on to other topics in a respectful fashion.Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, called the meeting ""the first part of the discussion and a relationship builder"" between the two men, after Peña Nieto tweeted.""It was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate. It is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation,"" he said in a statement.In subsequent interviews in Mexico, Peña Nieto reiterated his version of events. He told CNN affiliate Televisa in an interview late Wednesday some of the positions Trump has taken ""are a threat to Mexico."" He also told the outlet he was very clear with Trump about the subject of a wall at the border and insisted Mexico would not pay for it and he made Trump aware that the people of Mexico had been ""very insulted.""Peña Nieto, speaking alongside Trump during their joint appearance, twice stressed the ""responsibility"" he has to defend Mexican people around the world and said Trump has made ""assertions that regrettably had hurt and have affected Mexicans."" ""The Mexican people have felt hurt by the comments that have been made. But I am sure that his genuine interest is to build a relationship that will give both of our society's better welfare,"" Peña Nieto said.Trump apparently left his tough deal-making persona at home as he received a presidential-style news conference on foreign soil while on a high-risk trip to Mexico on Wednesday.The visit appeared to be an attempt to bolster Trump's credentials as a potential world leader, following searing attacks on his temperament by his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The spur-of-the-moment trip also came hours before Trump was due to deliver a speech in Arizona meant to clarify his murky immigration policy amid signs he is softening his prior promise to deport 11 million undocumented migrants. Trump's claim that they didn't discuss who would pay for the wall -- despite his call for Mexico to finance it being a central theme of his campaign and one he frequently uses to fire up his supporters -- appeared to be a noteworthy omission from Wednesday's conversation when he mentioned it at their joint appearance.The cost is one that Peña Nieto has previously refused to shoulder, just one of many issues where the two men have clashed. Peña Nieto, who has previously compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, greeted him courteously and said he was committed to working with whomever Americans elect as their next president in November.But turning the tables on Trump, he gave the billionaire an earful on trade, said illegal immigration from Mexico to the US peaked years ago and complained of the torrent of guns that he said crossed the border and worsened Mexico's drug wars.Nieto said in an interview late Wednesday that some of the positions Donald Trump has taken ""are a threat to Mexico."" He told CNN affiliate Televisa that he made Trump aware that the people of Mexico had been ""very insulted"" by his comments. Trump's backers were left to defend his decision not to mention his demand that Mexico pay for the border wall after the visit. Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio told CNN's Jake Tapper: ""What difference does it make? The wall's important no matter who pays.""While Trump's decision not to raise who would pay for the wall appeared to undercut his deal-making swagger, it could also reassure some wavering Republican voters who dislike Clinton but are not yet convinced Trump possesses the restraint and sobriety required of a US president.The sight of Trump alongside the Mexican president provided the photo-op that the campaign appears to have banked on despite not knowing how the candidate would be received.Still, the Clinton campaign came out swinging, accusing Trump of failing to make good on his pledge to make Mexico pay for the wall by not raising the issue.""Donald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign. But at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked,"" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in a statement.""What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate 'deal maker' is that he doesn't have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he's not in front of a friendly crowd,"" Podesta said, before accusing Trump of wanting to build a costly wall at American taxpayers' expense.Podesta later added: ""It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.""Peña Nieto began his remarks alongside Trump by saying the two held a constructive exchange of views even though ""we might not agree on everything."" He then launched into a detailed defense of US-Mexican trade and its benefit to both countries delivered by the North American Free Trade Agreement -- a common punching bag for Trump on the campaign trail. The Mexican leader told Trump that both the US and Mexico had benefited from NAFTA, saying more than six million US jobs rely on exports to Mexico.""I don't think that commerce must be considered a zero sum game, so that only one wins and the other one loses,"" he said, though added he was prepared to make the two-decades-old deal, which also includes Canada, better for both nations.Trump was also told by his host that Mexicans deserve everybody's respect wherever they are, in an apparent reference to the GOP nominee's harsh rhetoric towards undocumented migrants.Trump, who listened to his host's long remarks with a somber look on his face while a woman stood beside him at the podium translating for him, said that Mexicans were ""spectacular"" people when it was his turn to talk.But he laid bare disagreements between the two men when he said it was imperative to stop the ""tremendous outflow"" of jobs from the United States over the southern border, and that NAFTA had benefited Mexico more than the US. And he stood up for America's right to build a ""physical barrier or wall"" on its territory to stop illegal immigration and drug traffickers. Trump warned that NAFTA would have to be renegotiated.Trump's calls for deporting all undocumented workers, labeling many Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and ""criminals,"" and plan to build a wall along the border -- that Mexico would pay for -- have earned him withering criticism from Peña Nieto, as well as many independents and moderate Republicans.But they are central pillars of his campaign, which has galvanized his white working class base behind his White House bid. Those most fervently opposed to immigration have pushed back against the rumored ""softening"" in his stance that he could articulate on Wednesday night.Trump, speaking from prepared remarks, was far more metasured than in his campaign trail appearances. Though he mostly stuck his positions on renegotiating NAFTA and halting illegal immigration, he was also conciliatory. He referred to illegal immigration from Central America rather than just from Mexico. He said a secure border barrier would benefit both nations. And he spoke of the flight of jobs not from the United States but from also from Mexico and Central America to overseas economies.It is not unusual for presidential candidates to venture abroad during a campaign. Both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney made trips to bolster their foreign policy credentials in 2008 and 2012.But Trump's approach -- like the rest of his campaign -- is highly unorthodox. Presidential candidates do not typically show up in foreign capitals for talks with leaders without intense preparation and highly choreographed game plans. Often, the parameters of a meeting are settled in advance. This trip was announced Tuesday night.In addition, they usually visit strong allies where they are assured of a warm reception that will make for positive media coverage rather than sitting down with a leader who has compared them to Hitler and has disparaged their policy proposals.Trump's style, however, is more impulsive and unpredictable. He had never before met a foreign leader in an official capacity. So his trip represented something of a risk. Even though the meeting with Peña Nieto was private, he has no control over how the Mexican leader will address the public and how his officials will brief journalists about it afterward.RELATED: What is Donald Trump's immigration plan -- and when will we see it?The trip was also unusual for not including his traveling press corps and coming against the advice of US diplomats. The campaign's decision to travel to a foreign country -- one rife with security risks for a candidate who has stoked tensions with his rhetoric on Mexican immigrants -- without reporters following close behind marks an unprecedented moment in the coverage of major party presidential nominees. In addition, staff at the US Embassy in Mexico advised the Trump campaign against making such a hastily arranged trip, suggesting it would be logistically difficult to organize on such short notice, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

John Hinckley Jr. -- who shot President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and was found not guilty by reason of insanity -- had spent most of the past three decades locked away inside St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C. -- except for supervised visits to his mother's house in Williamsburg.""Even to work odd jobs is very difficult for a person who has not picked up a hammer in 35 years,"" said church president Les Solomon, who has been mentoring Hinckley, 61, for more than a year and a half. Hinckley was 25 years old when he stood outside a Washington hotel on a rainy day, armed with a gun and a delusional plan to impress the object of his obsession, actress Jodie Foster.The college dropout emptied his .22-caliber revolver at Reagan. A bullet penetrated within an inch of the president's heart. Other rounds wounded a Secret Service agent and a police officer. But the gravest injuries belonged to White House press secretary James Brady, who was shot in the head and partially paralyzed. Brady died two years ago. His death was ruled a homicide.Over the past 10 years -- in the face of ardent opposition from government prosecutors who worry whether Hinckley remains a threat to society -- a federal judge allowed the would-be assassin to take increasingly longer breaks away from the hospital to visit his mother, Jo Ann, in Williamsburg.In late July, the judge granted Hinckley's full release from the hospital, allowing him to live with his mother full time -- albeit with many conditions. Hinckley has been to Williamsburg on a visit since. He will end his time at St. Elizabeths on September 10, his lawyer said this week.It has been a struggle for Hinckley to build a life outside the protective walls of his mother's house and find acceptance in a community that in large part still views him as a leper. At the James City County Recreation Center -- where Hinckley has been spotted using the treadmill and watching TV -- one resident who did not want to be named said, ""I don't know how you shoot a president and get out at all -- ever. But, I'm sure the police and Secret Service know where he is, so he's not going very far if he tries something.""Jack Garrow, who lives five doors down from the Hinckleys in a gated community, was on active duty as a captain in the U.S. Navy when Hinckley tried to kill his commander in chief.""I will never be able to personally forgive him for what he did,"" said Garrow. ""What he did was horrendous. I remember it vividly. It was shocking.""But Garrow's feelings are complicated by his affection for Hinckley's mother, and his brother and sister, who both live out of state. ""You have some sympathy for the family, for sure. They're very nice people. His mother is a fine lady and if him being here full time is a help to her, so be it.""John Hinckley Fast FactsCommunity rejection and disdain Another challenge for Hinckley as he endeavors to insert himself into the Williamsburg community is finding anyone willing to give him a job, even as an unpaid volunteer -- which is a condition of his release. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman said he wanted to ensure Hinckley does not become isolated, lonely and depressed, as he was in 1981 when he shot the president.While Hinckley has been doing some work for the Unitarian Universalists, and volunteering in the cafeteria at Eastern State Hospital, a mental health facility in Williamsburg, he has been turned away by numerous businesses and charity organizations.Attempts to get a job in the law library at the College of William and Mary, a grocery store and with Colonial Williamsburg failed; none wanted him, according to court records. The pastor of a Methodist church turned down Hinckley's request to volunteer; so, too, did the managers of a local food pantry for the hungry, a program for poor elderly people and a local animal shelter.Hinckley was supposed to volunteer at a bowling event hosted by the Arc of Greater Williamsburg, an organization that provides support for individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities. But the organization rescinded its offer when staff members refused to participate if Hinckley showed up, court records show.Hinckley's case manager, Jonathan Weiss, said the boards of several nonprofit organizations in town have turned down Hinckley's requests to volunteer for fear they would lose benefactors, according to court records.Hinckley seems acutely aware that most in the community treat him like an outcast. A review of Hinckley's case file revealed he complained to one of his therapists, ""Working at the William and Mary Law Library would have been a great gig for me. But, when it gets to a certain level and my name gets brought up, my reputation gets in the way, and I hit another roadblock.""The one job Hinckley was not disappointed to be rejected from was working at a fast-food restaurant. He told his therapist, ""I'm too old and decrepit to stand on my feet for eight hours with 20-year-old kids.""He's grateful for those who accept himFor now, Hinckley will continue to work at the Unitarian Universalists church, where members are helping find tasks that suit him. Solomon, in the soft, supportive voice of a grandfather, explained he realized even routine yard work was beyond Hinckley's abilities and interest, so he instead asked him to help build simple birdhouses.""That was a real challenge for him, too -- even though we were using pre-cut, pre-drilled birdhouses,"" said Solomon, who is now helping Hinckley sell donated books online to benefit the church. ""He loves books, especially history books, so we thought that might be something he could do for us.""But Hinckley's decades in a psychiatric institution under extremely strict rules meant he had no idea how to navigate the internet. ""We quickly found out he did not know about sites like Amazon, eBay and Craigslist,"" said Solomon. ""So we began working to train him how to use those sites.""Solomon said Hinckley recently told him, ""I'm so thankful for what this congregation is doing, for helping me out.""Hinckley has been to Solomon's house many times to visit and learn about the internet. In recent years, he has been allowed to obtain a Virginia driver's license and usually drives himself to Solomon's. And, he always shows up with a cold bottle of Pepsi.""He's been in my home, been with my family and I'm very comfortable,"" said Solomon. Garrow notes that there have been no issues during Hinckley's stays in Kingsmill Resort. ""I've never felt ill at ease or threatened.""He likes Elvis, Bowie and catsSince 2014, Hinckley has spent two weeks every month of the year living at his aging mother's house, under close monitoring by the Secret Service and a team of mental health professionals in Williamsburg.Mother and son share a 2,500-square-foot home inside the upscale golf community Kingsmill, where the world's best women golfers play in an annual LPGA tournament.""I just miss him so much when he leaves and can hardly wait for him to come back,"" Jo Ann Hinckley told John's therapists after one of his 17-day visits. ""No one has tried harder than him. I'm in awe of him and he is just the nicest person to have in the house.""Hinckley often is seen standing on the back deck, staring out over the 13th hole or feeding the swans in the pond behind their house, neighbors say. He also enjoys morning walks along the neighborhood's private tree-lined streets after breakfast. His brother, Scott, and sister, Diane Hinckley Sims, often come from out of town to visit.Very few pictures of the stocky Hinckley have been published in recent years, so he's able to largely move about without being recognized.A study of hundreds of court documents pertaining to Hinckley's treatment shows he spends time driving about town in his mother's Toyota, shopping for cat food at PetSmart, dropping by Sweet Frog for frozen yogurt or attending a lecture or art exhibit at the prestigious College of William and Mary.He loves to play the guitar and listen to music -- some of his purchases include ""Duets"" by Barry Manilow, ""50's Hits"" by Elvis Presley and records by John Denver, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. He also likes photography and bowling.He spends hours walking around Colonial Williamsburg, where visitors step back in time to the beginnings of the American Revolution. But, Hinckley's past also can be a dark shadow he can't shake.He is forbidden from contacting Jodie Foster or seeing her movies. That became a problem during one visit home in 2013. Hinckley went to the theater with his brother to see the film ""Elysium,"" according to notes from one of his therapists. Just a few minutes into the movie, Foster appeared on screen. Hinckley leaned in to his brother and whispered, ""We have to leave.""For all the difficulties Hinckley has faced adjusting to life outside the psychiatric hospital, he has found a few pockets of acceptance.Hinckley has known love -- and rejectionHinckley has enjoyed getting to know people at his court-ordered group therapy sessions in Williamsburg, telling one of his therapists as noted in court documents, ""It's really refreshing to be in a group of people who aren't completely out of their minds."" He went on to say, ""The people in this group have normal lives and normal problems. They have to worry about getting their kids to soccer and what to make for dinner.""And, despite living in a government psychiatric facility for 35 years, Hinckley has had quite the love life, even dating two women at the same time for several months last year, his case file shows.A fellow patient at St. Elizabeths, a bipolar drug addict who was in a relationship with Hinckley, offered to move to Williamsburg after release, but was rebuffed. ""I cannot factor in all your dramatics,"" Hinckley told her.Describing himself as ""Type A and athletic"" to one of his therapists, Hinckley has occasionally invited women over to his mother's house to watch TV and listen to music. And he's generous, buying them earrings, shoes and CDs, including Taylor Swift's ""Red"" and Kelly Clarkson's ""Greatest Hits.""He also has known heartbreak. He received a ""Dear John"" letter from a girlfriend who abruptly broke up with him in 2014, according to court records. Asked by a therapist if he would ever like to get married, Hinckley replied, ""Definitely not.""Visits cost up to $10,000 a month and include a limousineJo Ann Hinckley has been footing the bill for her son's visits to Williamsburg since they began in 2006, including the whopper of a bill she gets from his team of therapists here -- $5,000 to $10,000 a month, according to court documents.His mother, who is 90, has drawn from the family's shrinking fortune amassed during her late husband's years as a wealthy Denver oil man to cover Hinckley's treatment costs. She also has paid for a limousine every month since 2014 to fetch him from the hospital in Washington and drive him two and a half hours to Williamsburg.She has complained only mildly about how her son often brought with him the feral cats he has fed for years on the grounds of the hospital in Washington.Hinckley told one of his therapists he would miss some of the people at the hospital when he got out. ""Something else I'm going to lose is my cats,"" he remarked, according to court documents. ""These cats mean a lot to me. I have to cut ties with them, too.""Restrictions, GPS tracking and surveillanceHinckley may have finally won his freedom from the psychiatric hospital, but he is not free of the 34 court-ordered restrictions that will rule his life for the next year -- or the Secret Service agents who will continue to track him.He must stay within a 50-mile radius of Williamsburg and carry a GPS trackable cell phone any time he leaves his mother's house. The Secret Service must have access to his phone and any online and email accounts Hinckley establishes and must always know what car Hinckley is driving. He can never go near any current or former president, vice president or member of Congress, or the families of any of his victims. Neither Hinckley nor his family members are allowed to have contact with the media. And, he must continue with outpatient therapy. If Hinckley violates any of these conditions -- or shows signs of deteriorating mentally or emotionally -- he can be sent back to St. Elizabeths.Resident Jim Gorham complained, ""I think they are being too generous to him. Since they let him out, I guess he can go wherever he wants. They just shouldn't have let him out, shouldn't give him that privilege."" But Jim Hall of Williamsburg Unitarian Universalists said Hinckley has paid his debt to society and would be welcome at services.Experts told the court that Hinckley's depression and psychotic disorder are in remission. His attorney, Barry Wm. Levine, said his client has profound regret for his actions.Levine said, ""The very carefully considered decision to release Mr. Hinckley should give great comfort to a concerned citizenry that the mental health system and the judicial system worked and worked well."" In a statement Thursday, Levine said, ""People of goodwill should feel good about Mr. Hinckley's recovery and wish him well.""Court records indicate Hinckley knows he was not in his right mind in 1981: ""I was living a very depressed, isolated life, out of touch with reality, despairing, estranged from my family. All of these things led me to this despair and being delusional about Jodie Foster.""Hinckley: 'The family will get through it'One area of great concern for prosecutors is Hinckley's dependence on his mother, who has been a source of unwavering emotional and financial support, and a critical part of her son's rehabilitation. They question what will happen when she passes away or is no longer able to live at home with him.Assistant U.S. Attorney Colleen Kennedy told Judge Friedman, ""Nothing in the plan is clear-cut at this particular point. The hospital's attitude is that we'll deal with it when it happens."" She went on to argue, ""It was exactly this type of scenario when Mr. Hinckley was out of touch with his parents, he had stopped therapy, he was not on medication and he had no supervision when he shot President Reagan and the others. Again, too much risk.""Hinckley's brother and sister, who said they've become very close with their brother in recent years and seen his general mood and mental health improve during his time in Williamsburg, according to court records, have promised to help their brother when their mother is no longer able to.His sister, Diane, has testified that when their mother dies, she will immediately fly to Virginia to stay with him until a permanent living plan can be worked out. And both siblings have pledged to assist their brother in paying his bills when their mother's money runs out.Hinckley himself tried to allay any fears of what will happen when he is faced with the devastating loss of his mother. ""I'll get through it. The family will get through it,"" he told the judge. ""It will impact my life because she is such a large part, but I have this team and friends that will certainly be supportive."""	John Hinckley Jr.: Would-be assassin tries to gain acceptance

Trump told the press in Mexico City that while he and Peña Nieto discussed plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, they did not talk about Trump's pledge to make Mexico pay for it.Peña Nieto did not refute Trump's comment during their press conference, but he tweeted hours after that he told Trump that Mexico ""will not pay for the wall.""""Trump just failed his first foreign test. Diplomacy isn't as easy as it looks,"" Clinton tweeted, signed with an ""H"" to indicate she personally blessed the message.A campaign tweet a short time later followed up: ""We are not going to criminalize, profile, round up, and deport 16 million people.""John Podesta, her campaign chairman, said in a statement: ""It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.""The Clinton campaign also released a web video on Wednesday that accused Trump of lying about his trip to Mexico and sarcastically called him the ""Great Negotiator.""And after Trump delivered a hardline immigration speech, the Democrat's campaign quickly condemned it.""In his darkest speech yet, Donald Trump doubled down on his anti-immigrant rhetoric and attempted to divide communities by pitting people against each other and demonizing immigrants,"" said Lorella Praeli, Clinton's national Latino vote director, in a statement. She added: ""He showed us, very clearly, what's at stake in this election by painting a picture of his idea of America: one in which immigrants are not welcomed and one in which innocent families are torn apart.""The Clinton campaign's tough language about Trump came after the former secretary of state on Wednesday urged veterans at an American Legion conference to reject the mogul's view of the world, arguing he doesn't have what it takes to build and maintain alliances.Though Clinton was more subtle in her attacks on Trump in front of the audience of veterans, she did blast the businessman-turned-politician for what she said were his insults toward the military, attacking the family of a soldier killed in action and being too cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Building alliances and trust with other nations, Clinton said, takes ""more than a photo op, it takes consistency and reliability."" ""You don't build a coalition by insulting our friends or acting like a loose cannon. You do it by putting in the slow, hard work of building relationships. Getting countries working together was my job every day as secretary of state,"" Clinton said. ""It's just like building personal relationships -- people have got to know they can count on you -- that you won't say one thing one day and something totally different the next.""Clinton then added that building those relationships ""certainly takes more than making up for a year of insults by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and flying home again.""The former secretary of state pledged on Wednesday that, as president, she would ""never, ever disrespect Gold Star families who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation or prisoners of war who endured so much in our name.""Trump blasted the Khan family after they spoke at the Democratic National Convention this summer. Khizr Khan, a Pakistani-American lawyer and the father of the late Humayun Khan, powerfully hit Trump during his speech and Trump responded by questioning his family's motives. Earlier in the campaign, Trump also downplayed the heroism of Arizona Sen. John McCain, a POW, citing his capture during the Vietnam War.""To insult them is just so wrong,"" Clinton said. ""And it says a lot about the person doing the insulting.""Clinton continued her outreach to Republican voters as well Wednesday, pledging before a somewhat muted crowd to ""be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for people who vote for me, for people who don't, for all Americans.""Trump's campaign responded to the speech by saying that Clinton has proven that she is ""fundamentally unequipped to further the national security interests of the United States and stand up for our veterans.""""Those who have served and wear the uniform today deserve to have a commander in chief who is looking out for them rather than donors and corrupt bureaucrats,"" said Matt Miller, director of Veterans for Trump. ""Only Donald Trump and Mike Pence have a detailed plan to fundamentally improve both the (Department of Veterans Affairs) and the way veterans are treated in this country."""
