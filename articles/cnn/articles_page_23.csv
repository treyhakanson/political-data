But the former secretary of state's stunning losses in the Rust Belt spoke to deeper problems facing a Democratic Party that has become unmoored from its roots. Most stark in the results was the party's disconnect from white working-class voters. The primary exposed the deep divide between the progressive and centrist wings of the party, which clearly have not healed. And strategists learned the hard way just how difficult it is to replicate the Obama coalition without the President at the top of the ticket. Baffled DemocratsAs they sift through the results, most baffling to some Democrats was how some voters who supported Obama in 2008 and 2012 ended up backing Trump.As Clinton retreated to private life in Chappaqua, New York, and the President prepares to leave office, it was clear that there was no consensus about who should lead the party, or even lead the discussion about where the party needs to go after Tuesday.Trump calls Obama 'a very good man' Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will play leading roles. But there are broad policy disagreements among them, as well as competing objectives.  Schumer, for example, must keep his eye on the 2018 races when he will have slew of Democrats up for re-election in conservative states.Clinton's unexpected losses in industrial states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- as well as the razor-edge race in Michigan, which CNN has not called — underscored the view of Democratic strategists who privately complained throughout 2016 that Clinton hadn't found a message that connected with working-class Americans.Though polls showed many Latinos and women were repelled by Trump before Election Day, Trump actually slightly outperformed Mitt Romney among Latinos. And Clinton drew a slightly smaller share of women to the polls than Obama did in 2012, according to exit polls. She won the lowest share of union households of any Democrat since 1980 -- notching 51% of union households to Trump's 43%, according to exit polls. By comparison, Obama won 59% of union households in 2008.Trump's campaign was vacuous. Many of his policy proposals were unachievable, even in the eyes of his supporters. Yet his populist message struck a chord with voters across the ideological spectrum.""Clearly what this election demonstrated -- from the primaries through the general election -- was that the centrist, more moderate wing of the (Democratic) party has no standing with working class and middle class voters in this country,"" said Jeff Weaver, who was campaign manager for Clinton's Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.""It's time for the progressive wing to reassert themselves and offer a bold agenda to the American people,"" Weaver said. ""The real losers in this campaign were the Democratic and Republican establishments. People clearly wanted change. Trump became the vehicle for that change in the general election. I think many people voted for him in spite of his outrageous positions, as opposed to in favor of them. So we need to demonstrate to people that we stand with them, not with the wealthy and powerful.""Donald Trump's AmericaThough Clinton was raised in a middle-class household familiar with economic struggles, she never managed to find a message that connected with struggling working class families. That was particularly ironic considering she ran against a billionaire who lives in the penthouse of a gold plated tower.Long before Trump was viewed as a real contender, Bill Burton, a former adviser to Obama, recalled discussing the message challenges facing Democrats in 2016 as far as two years ago. Obama coalitionHe argued then that no one would be able to recreate the Obama coalition, because Obama was simply a uniquely talented candidate and ""special guy."" Democrats already knew at that time, he said, that they had a problem with middle-class white voters ""that we're not paying attention to."" He believed that if the party didn't fix that, they couldn't win. ""And that's what happened,"" Burton said in an interview Thursday. ""We couldn't win a race where we didn't have enough white voters to make up for the gaps in the Obama coalition. There's any number of reasons for that -- from (FBI Director) James Comey to Donald Trump having a message that appealed in middle America.""Kaine: 'This isn't a time to give up'""There's going to be a lot of soul searching, and there's no one answer for it -- anyone who suggests that there is, is just wrong,"" he said. ""In 2020, we've got to be thinking about a coalition of voters that builds on the Obama coalition to the best that we can, but also reaches out to a big group of voters in the middle of the country who feel like they've been left behind.""The conversation about how to do that will unfold over many months, after operatives and activists have time to digest the data and missteps from this campaign.One early proxy for the internal struggles of the party will be the election of the party's chair next year. On Thursday, Sanders said he would back Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota as the next chair of the Democratic National Committee and attributed Tuesday's losses to a lack of enthusiasm.Bernie Sanders on if he would have won: 'What good does it do now?'Former DNC Chairman Howard Dean pointed to what he views as party infrastructure problems Thursday, as he also threw his hat into the ring for party chair.""The Dems need organization and focus on the young,"" Dean tweeted. ""Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.""Donna Brazile is currently serving as the party's interim chair through March 2017 after stepping in replace Debbie Wasserman Schultz in July when Wikileaks released emails showing that Democratic officials tried to help Clinton clinch the nomination, instead of playing the role of neutral arbiter in determining the nominee.Democratic strategist and CNN commentator Hilary Rosen noted that the margins in battleground states where Clinton lost were relatively close, making the discussion about what to do even more complex. Many Democrats were stunned by the fact that Clinton and Trump were separated by only about a percentage point in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—and the race in Michigan still looks even closer than that.Sanders supporters noted it was hard to imagine him losing states like that in the Industrial Midwest. (Obama won Michigan, which is still too close to call, by 9.5 percentage points in 2012).""What I don't think even a win would have masked, though it would have masked it more easily, is the divide between center left and left"" in the party, said Rosen, a Clinton supporter.She noted that many Sanders supporters will argue he might have done more to galvanize young voters and the Democratic base, but that could have come at the expense of votes from independents and centrists that Clinton won.Team Trump is already filled with Washington insidersIn the annals of history, the election may be remembered as having been decided by Pennsylvania, Wisconsin -- which nudged Trump over 270 electoral votes -- and Michigan, where the vote count continues.When Trump's advantage in those three states is tallied, it currently amounts to close to 110,000 votes out of tens of millions that were cast (the final turnout figure may not be known for some time).  ""By virtue of those 110,000 votes, we're now going to have the conversation in the Democratic Party that we thought the Republicans were going to have in their party,"" Rosen said."	Democrats try to pick up the pieces

Even if it's 500 bucks or 15 hours on a bus,"" Emerald said.Protests have spread across the country after Trump was elected, with large crowds rallying in cities like New York City, San Francisco and Seattle the past two nights.Garry Sitarski said outside the White House that he was afraid of a Trump presidency. He was protesting in New York on Wednesday and he came to protest in front of the White House in time for Trump's visit.Some of those present voiced support for Trump, including Zack Parente, 31, and Cletus Pippin, 29.""Hillary's idea was continuing the eight years of Obama."" said Parente.The importance of change was what moved Pippin to vote for Trump, his first ballot cast in a presidential election, though he said he didn't agree with everything the president-elect said and hopes ""he simmers down a little bit."" He doesn't think Trump is serious about building a wall that Mexicans will pay for. ""I think we're going to end up paying for it,"" he said.Pippin's mother, Brenda, was with him and said she was annoyed at the surrounding protesters, who she said must accept the outcome.""You know, take it day by day, accept he is president, and stand behind him,"" she said, adding that she was not offended by Trump's infamous comments surfaced on the ""Access Hollywood"" tape last month.Some protesters, however, cited the tape as to why they were there Thursday.Deborah Klaus, a 48-year-old nurse from Arlington, Virginia, was telling her fellow protesters that she's concerned for her daughter. ""I can't let her think it's OK. It's not healthy,"" said Klaus, referring to the sexual assault claims against Trump.As Trump's motorcade left the White House, guards pushed protesters away, who chanted, ""Love trumps hate,"" a common slogan among Clinton supporters."

He repeatedly cast doubt on Russia's involvement in cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee, despite the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security issuing a joint statement saying the Russian government was to blame.A Russian official told CNN Thursday that that the Russian Foreign Ministry had offered to establish contact with both the Clinton and Trump teams in the run up to the US election. It's a move which the Ministry says is normal diplomatic practice ""to maintain relations with the two obvious candidates.""The official said members of Clinton's team visited Moscow unofficially and held meetings with high-level representatives from both the Kremlin and the Foreign Ministry."

AF1, the designation given only when the president is on board, is equipped with special security features to protect the commander in chief while in flight. For example, AF1 is equipped to evade and distract surface to air missiles. Also, in the event of a nuclear blast AF1 has special shielding that would prevent the plane's components from being destroyed. The plane also has a special communications package that allows the president to receive classified information while in flight. RELATED: Donald Trump's AmericaWhile Trump has significant security around any airport he flies in and out of, Trump's private jet does not have this specialized equipment and the official said it would be ""cost prohibitive to install all of that on Trump's own plane and he would have to foot the bill for that.""The official added, ""No one tells the president he can't do something. Instead, you lay out all the reasons it's functionally impossible.""  Swapping out Air Force One for Trump Force One is exactly that, the official said -- nearly functionally impossible.The official added Trump's plane would not be big enough to carry all the staff he would need to travel with. But don't feel bad for the President-elect. Air Force One is decked out with bedroom, kitchen, offices, full communications and even TVs in case he wants to watch cable news."

The former Democratic vice presidential nominee said it is time for supporters to ""strengthen our resolve to fight against injustice, break the gridlock in Congress, and use government to make people's lives better."" Congratulating President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence on their victory, Clinton's running mate called on all elected officials to ""put this divisive election behind us"" and work with the new administration, a task he will now have a direct role in as a Virginia senator.""We need to do all the good we can and serve one another.

Maybe there was a hidden Trump vote.A town ignoredMoscow is a liberal town in a conservative state; Hoyt is at once a political minority and surrounded by like-minded Republicans. And like the small communities of the rust-belt and Middle America, Moscow doesn't get paid much attention by people of power.""We never get politicians out here,"" Hoyt said.

""During the brief call, President Clinton congratulated Mr. Trump and wished him well.""Bill Clinton has spent years helping to position his wife to run for president, and when Trump became her sole adversary, the former president regularly laid into Trump, calling him unfit and unqualified to be president and accusing him of feeding his supporters nothing but negativity.""This is what is the matter with politics,"" he said last month about Trump. ""When other people pour poison down your throat, don't drink it.""Trump, likewise, made accusations of sexual impropriety against Bill Clinton a key part of his campaign and regularly called Clinton's presidency a failure.Before the second debate, Trump invited three women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to attend the event.But the fraternity of former presidents has regularly kept cordial relationships with each other, even if they vehemently disagreed with one another.

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/donald-trump-clinton-foundation/index.html	"Investigators at the FBI's New York office, who unsuccessfully argued for months that they should be allowed to open a full-blown investigation of the foundation, could find a more friendly audience in a Donald Trump administration Justice Department.The President-elect railed during the closing weeks of the campaign against the relationship between foundation donors and Hillary Clinton's work in government as ""corrupt.""He promised there would more investigations of the Clintons if he were elected.Soon, top officials he appoints at the Justice Department will have the power make that happen.And the FBI investigators may have more ammunition to make their case with stolen emails from Clinton aides released in recent weeks by WikiLeaks.The emails showed internal fights over the foundation between Chelsea Clinton and a top aide to her father, Doug Band, who helped run the foundation. Chelsea Clinton, according to the emails, was concerned about possible conflicts of interest and problems related to Bill Clinton's paid speech-making business, dubbed ""Bill Clinton Inc."" The dispute prompted the foundation to conduct an internal audit of its activities. Band hit back at Chelsea Clinton, according to the emails, suggesting she used the foundation to pay for her wedding. Rudy Giuliani, considered a contender for attorney general or other top cabinet post, according to people familiar with Trump transition planning, said Thursday that the new president will have to make a decision on what to do about his promises to hire a special prosecutor to investigate matters related to Clinton.""It's been a tradition in our politics to put things behind us,"" Giuliani said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""On the other hand, you have to look at how bad was it? Because suppose somebody comes along a year from now and is alleged to have stolen $50,000 from a charity -- and (Clinton) was never investigated for hundreds of millions.""Messages left with the Clinton Foundation seeking comment were not returned.Career prosecutors at the Justice Department's criminal division and the public integrity section, as well as lawyers at the FBI, reviewed the requests earlier this year from FBI investigators to launch a full probe of the Clinton Foundation, according to law enforcement officials briefed on the discussions. The agents were told that they didn't have enough evidence to use more overt investigative methods, including seeking subpoenas, to open a full probe, the officials said. They were also told they could continue to gather information and revisit their requests if they found more evidence.The genesis of the FBI efforts date, in part, to allegations published in the 2015 book ""Clinton Cash"" by conservative writer Peter Schweizer. Agents were unhappy at being told they didn't have enough evidence, and that fed some of the tensions over Clinton-related matters inside the FBI in recent months between the New York field office and FBI headquarters, law enforcement officials say.Trump repeatedly referred to the WikiLeaks emails -- in particular the issues raised by Band -- as proof that investigators should take a deeper look.""Mr. Band called the arrangement unorthodox. The rest of us call it outright corrupt,"" Trump told an October campaign rally. ""In fact, the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS.""Trying to use the stolen emails released by WikiLeaks to try to build probable cause for further investigation could present legal hurdles for the FBI and the Justice Department.At least some of the emails are labeled as ""attorney-client privileged,"" meaning they have the legal protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client.And then there's the fact the US government has declared that the emails were stolen by Russian intelligence in a cyber-hack of the email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Earlier this year, prosecutors in Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara's office used revelations from the Panama Papers, stolen and leaked legal documents from a law firm in that country that helped the rich create offshore financial shelters, as cause to issue subpoenas to individuals and firms named in the documents. Other lawyers at Justice Department headquarters debated whether the stolen materials could be used predicates for an investigation.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/pentagon-donald-trump-illegal-orders/index.html	"There is civilian control of the military, and there is unquestioned loyalty to any president. But Trump comes into office with a series of campaign promises that include the possibility of ordering illegal action by the US military.The issue getting perhaps the most attention is Trump's campaign statements he might institute waterboarding of terrorism suspects. Waterboarding is considered torture, which is illegal under US and international law. Other Trump campaign promises that worry some commanders and troops include the notion of bombing with little regard for civilian casualties or taking Iraq's oil supplies, also potential violations of international law.Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook noted on Thursday that all US troops have an obligation not to follow illegal orders. And he made clear the decades of expectations by troops and commanders that they wouldn't be asked to do so.""I don't think this is something we should even be discussing,"" Cook said in response to a question from CNN. ""They're not going to get an order in violation of the law.""But CNN has spoken to several current senior officers who have given thought to whether they could confront this issue in a Trump administration.Each has said the plan will be to explain in detail why it's a violation of the law, and to get military lawyers directly involved in any discussion so that's made clear.If a commander were still to get an illegal order, the challenge would then be whether to resign.One senior military official said, though, that the most senior commanders on a four-star level would never resign.It would be seen as leaving their troops behind to deal with the problem. Instead, the official said, a four-star commander would make a President Trump publicly fire them.Violations of the Geneva Convention, or any war crime by US troops, would be disastrous, a senior retired US military officer told CNN.While the US is not a member of the International Criminal Court at The Hague, if there were illegal orders given and followed, then US military personnel would be discredited around the world and US standing would be hurt with other nations the US military must work with.In addition, those military members engaged in Geneva Convention violations would find they could not travel to countries that are members of the court because they would risk arrest and tried before it.The official added there is a longstanding view in the US military that American troops and commanders do not engage in activities that are torture or illegal because if US troops are ever taken captive, it gives the the country little leverage to challenge enemy forces engaging in similar activities against US personnel.Waterboarding, for example, is illegal under both US law and the Geneva Conventions because it is defined as torture.But that's not how Trump or all the Republicans who endorsed him see it, though.""Waterboarding isn't torture. We do waterboarding on our own soldiers in the military,"" Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, himself a veteran, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.Some US troops undergo training for survival by practicing what would happen to them if they are waterboarded. Cotton also insisted that the law could be changed.The Pentagon, however, reiterated Thursday that waterboarding is not lawful.""You know the policy position of this administration, the law in fact, with regard to this. That is not something the US military is going to be conducting,"" Cook said."	What would the military do if Trump gave illegal orders?
