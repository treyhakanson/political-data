Majorities of voters say they are frustrated (57%) and disgusted (55%) with the campaign, dwarfing those who say they are interested (31%), optimistic (15%) and excited (10%). Those lukewarm attitudes even extend to backers of the two major party nominees. Only 25% of Clinton supporters say they would feel excited if she were to win. There was little more enthusiasm among Trump supporters; just 28% would be excited if the GOP nominee triumphs in November. But many more Clinton supporters, 68%, say they would feel relieved if she were to win. Ditto for Trump supporters, 61% of whom say they would also feel relief if he wins. According to Pew, a mere 11% of voters overall say they would feel excited if Trump were to win, virtually the same number (12%) who would be excited if the former secretary of state is victorious. The race between Clinton and Trump represents a battle between two of the least liked major party candidates in history, and Pew's findings are hardly the first to show that voters are largely disappointed with both. A Washington Post/ABC News poll last month found Clinton and Trump to be the two most unpopular presidential candidates in decades. The Pew Research Center report is based on a random sample of 3,941 registered voters who are members of the Center's American Trends Panel. Respondents took the survey between August 16 and September 12 online or by mail, and were originally recruited via nationally representative telephone surveys. Results among registered voters have a margin of sampling error of 2.6 percentage points.	Pew poll: Most voters 'frustrated,' 'disgusted' with 2016 election

""I'm not interested in a symbolic candidacy. I would've run to win.""A few hours later, the Democrat who is challenging Isakson instead of him, Jim Barksdale, tried to evince that same optimism speaking to a group of supporters at a Tex-Mex restaurant in Gwinnett County.""This is a winnable election. Don't let anyone tell you anything else,"" said Barksdale, a 63-year-old soft-spoken investment manager and political newcomer. ""I wouldn't be in it if I didn't think it was winnable.""Barksdale, however, trails Isakson by 16 points in a Monmouth University poll released Monday, even though Donald Trump is up only 3 points ahead of Hillary Clinton. Georgia is looking increasingly like a missed opportunity for Democrats trying to win back the Senate -- and many fault Barksdale himself.""We were giving a godsend, I believe, with Donald Trump,"" said Barksdale supporter Leonard Ware as he waited for the candidate to speak in Gwinnett. ""If we had a stronger candidate, we could've taken that Senate seat.""Georgia poll: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton in tight raceFor national Democrats, Barksdale's disappointing bid is part of a broader trend facing the party that came into 2016 with a favorable map of Senate races.In Ohio, Ted Strickland has been hampered by repeated gaffes and fundraising woes that have led national Democrats to essentially abandon a once-top candidate in the homestretch. Democrats have begun to make similar moves in Florida, where Patrick Murphy -- once a young, impressive recruit poised to flip a GOP seat -- has suffered dearly for embellishing his background and given Republican opposition researchers a trove of material.And here in Georgia, a half-dozen prominent Democrats passed on challenging Isakson, a decision that some in the party now rue.Even with the tight presidential race, Barksdale isn't trying to capitalize on any anti-Trump sentiment in Georgia. He didn't mention the GOP presidential candidate when meeting supporters campaigning Friday and barely addressed it until CNN asked him about the top of the ticket in an interview.That's a far cry from the Democratic playbook that has proved to be moderately successful in other Senate races. Democrats have tortured GOP incumbents like Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Richard Burr in North Carolina for their embrace of the nominee, and the poll numbers show it.Part of his reticence is that Barksdale, a former Bernie Sanders-backer, says he believes there are issues where he agrees with Trump. And he predicted a slew of Barksdale-Trump voters this November.""It's hard to imagine how somebody can pull the lever for Donald Trump on the Republican side -- who is so anti-the-establishment and anti-the-trade-things -- and then pull the lever for Johnny Isakson,"" Barksdale said. African-American gapGeorgia Democrats have long seen their political viability as resting on the state's booming minority population, and Barksdale's campaign agrees. If he can consolidate the black vote and win 85% of the community's 2.1 million voters, Barksdale aides say, he can win.The problem, revealed in a walk along this city's historically African-American Sweet Auburn neighborhood: People don't know who he is.""Black dude?"" asked Paul Jones, a registered Democrat sitting on a ledge outside an abandoned park here, asked about the white Barksdale. ""Oh, no, I don't know him.""Some here do know Isakson, and he is a revered figure in some pockets of Georgia's middle class. At a major Republican call center in Isakson's home base of Cobb County last week, nearly everyone calling on his behalf have some personal relationship with the two-term senator -- whether they teach his granddaughter at Sunday school or write to his personal email every few weeks.And a trio of prominent Democrats, former US Sen. Sam Nunn, former Gov. Roy Barnes, and current US Rep. David Scott have all publicly backed Isakson, snubbing their own nominee.  Despite Trump's struggles -- especially among independent women in the suburbs -- Isakson's team is calm and confident, thanks primarily to the caliber of the man they are facing.Their main concern is how much Barksdale himself plans to invest his campaign. He has invested $3 million so far, and he declined repeated questions about how high that total would go.""No question that our Democratic friends are kicking themselves, given how volatile the electorate has become, for not having recruited a candidate with a higher profile with a better set of policies and messages,"" said Heath Garrett, Isakson's chief strategist said at their campaign office. ""The flip is -- they have a candidate that's willing to write a check,"" added campaign manager Trey Kilpatrick.Man in the hatAside from not going after Trump, Barksdale has had other missteps that have cost him.The list of grievances among Georgians against Barksdale is long: the time conservative radio ridiculed him for misspelling 'judgment' on his campaign website; his sparse public event and interview schedule, stripping him of needed exposure; and his inability to effectively consolidate the Democratic base.Barksdale is further to the left than the centrist Senate bid waged by Michelle Nunn in 2014, who was thought to be a good ideological fit for Georgia despite being walloped in an open-seat contest. His calling card -- the cotton Bailey flat caps that he wears each day -- has drawn criticism as well from Georgia power brokers. ""I get a lot of compliments on it,"" he said. ""Everybody was worried that it wouldn't appeal within the, let's call it, minority communities -- but it really does.""The cap has emerged as the signature emblem of Barksdale's laggard campaign, with one soft-focus television ad featuring Georgians securing his cap over their hair (""Could I give you a good look here?"" he told one grade-schooler here before revealing his balding head.) His office in littered in cap imagery, with supporters imploring Republicans to ""send the hat"" -- not Barksdale, or as some call him more forgivingly, ""the man in the hat"" -- to the Senate.National Republicans don't send trackers to his events and have barely advertised against him as well.Republicans concede that Isakson would have faced a stronger test if Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed, or rising star state Rep. Stacey Abrams, or presidential scion Jason Carter, had not so strongly resisted overtures from party leadership to run a race seen as winnable. ""I had conversations with folks who were thoughtful about their request, and I was speedy in my response,"" said Abrams as she awaited a flight. ""I was very unequivocal about the fact that I had no interest in running for the Senate.""""I thought seriously about it and I came this close to running,"" said Warnock, who said he wanted to remain at his church. ""This was not my time.""Several Democrats pointed to trends that explained Democrats' candidate problems nationally -- poor showings in 2014 sapped ambition from some red-state hopefuls, while others made their decisions well before Trump's struggles. Democrats did not land their first-choice recruit in North Carolina, and others have not lived up to the hype that came with their entrances into the race.""When you look at states like North Carolina, Missouri and Indiana -- which were places that no one thought were going to be competitive this time last year -- I think it speaks to the quality of the candidates that came forward,"" said DSCC spokesman Lauren Passalacqua, who would only characterize Georgia as ""another area that we think is competitive in a year when Republican have struggled.""Isakson, for his part, takes some credit for the Democrats' A-team declining to challenge him. ""I've made a lot of friends. And I try to represent all the people when I'm in office,"" he said in an interview. ""I'm grateful they decided to stay where their careers were.""Run-off in January?The biggest challenge for Isakson at this point is getting to 50% -- the number he needs to avoid a run-off in January. The Monmouth poll has him at exactly that mark -- with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.Isakson aides predict a runoff would cost each side more than $20 million, and it could become a national spectacle should control of the Senate hang in the balance.""If Johnny gets into a general election runoff, there will be money from all over the country that's going to pour into Georgia,"" said Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime Republican fundraiser and power player here in the state. ""If Hillary Clinton were to win the White House, does she come down here to campaign for Barksdale?""But that may be the Democrats' best hope at this point.""I was not the likeliest candidate,"" Barksdale said. ""If anyone else had gotten involved that I thought I was credible, I would've certainly let them carry the water instead of me."""

This isn't the first time ""West Wing"" -- the plot of which centers on a Democratic presidential administration -- clashes with real life. Janney, who played White House press secretary C.J. Cregg, made an unexpected appearance in the White House press briefing room in April. The surprised press corps had been expecting actual White House spokesman Josh Earnest for their usual press briefing. The Emmy Award-winning show has been off the air since 2006, but remains popular even a decade later."	'West Wing' cast to campaign for Hillary Clinton

I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.""Be careful what door you open, Mrs. Clinton, because you're not going to want people to be talking about the Clinton Foundation and comparing it to anything that Donald Trump has done in his life, including giving away tens of millions of his own personal money,"" Christie, who is chairing Trump's transition efforts, told radio host Laura Ingraham.Koskinen was on Capitol Hill on Wednesday fielding a barrage of questions from House Republicans at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. House conservatives are pushing articles of impeachment to get rid of the commissioner over his handling of allegations that agency members targeted tea party groups, but it's unlikely any vote will happen before the fall election.Trump, meanwhile, has broken with decades of modern presidential politics in refusing to release his personal tax returns, saying that he is being audited by the IRS."

""So she's going to have to spend some time probably correcting the record and making sure voters understand the facts.""The Democratic candidate is visiting only two battleground states this week and took off Tuesday to prepare for Monday's debate at Hofstra University.""She wants to make sure that when she gets to that debate that she will clearly lay out the plans that she has developed to make a difference in people's lives,"" Mook said. ""And all we're asking is that Donald Trump do the same thing."" ""I would hope that he goes to the drawing board and puts together some plans,"" he added. ""As of right now, we haven't seen real specifics. And we haven't seen serious plans.""Mook said the campaign has noticed that Trump is someone who is easily offended.""This is someone who can be triggered very quickly. He can get set off by a tweet,"" he said. ""That is why I would argue he's unfit and unprepared to have our nuclear codes and lead our men and women in uniform as commander in chief.""""You never know what's going to set him off and she's going to be prepared for whatever comes,"" he added."

Trent Franks told CNN Wednesday. ""Therefore they are betraying this party. They are betraying the Constitution."" Franks had endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the primary. The rancor comes after Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that if Trump opponents don't ""get on board,"" it's not ""going to be that easy for them"" to run for office again. The remark appeared to be directed at former presidential candidates like Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who all have refused to endorse Trump after signing a pledge to do so during the primary campaign.Priebus' comments prompted pushback, including from top Kasich strategist John Weaver, who retorted that Kasich ""will not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs.""  The GOP's next civil war is brewingBut House Republicans had Priebus' back. While none discussed explicit penalties for future candidates based on their opposition to Trump, they warned that there would be political consequences. ""Having on your resume that you were all in against the nominee -- (with a) record number of votes won fair and square -- having on your record that you were against the nominee is not a positive for future political aspirations,"" said Nevada Rep. Mark Amodei. Several prominent Republicans in addition to the former candidates have publicly said they won't back Trump. On Tuesday, sources said that former President George H.W. Bush had told Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend that he would be voting for Clinton.Sources: Bush 41 says he'll vote for ClintonClinton has also been endorsed by Republicans including HP CEO and former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman; a top adviser to Arizona Sen. John McCain, Mark Salter; and former George W. Bush administration Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. Former GOP nominee Mitt Romney has also spoken forcefully against Trump, though he has not endorsed Clinton. And current sitting lawmakers -- including Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo -- have said they will not vote for the brash real estate mogul. Kirk and Curbelo are both facing reelection.On Wednesday, Curbelo brushed off the idea that he is hurting his party. ""Every American has to make the best choice for their country,"" Curbelo told CNN. ""Jack Kemp said you serve your party best by serving your country first, that's what I do here every day.""But Curbelo's colleagues maintained he will have to face the voters' reaction to his opposition to the party's standard-bearer. ""There's already some unrest among Republicans that there are some who have chosen not to get behind their nominee, the person they picked,"" said Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta. ""I can sense that as we travel around, and I think that will be lasting.""""I do anticipate there will be some type of reaction to that,"" said Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, referring to Priebus' threat.Trump has been endorsed by the Republican leaders in the House and Senate, but the relationship has been strained. Though they support voting for Trump, both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have continued to on occasion criticize him publicly.The House's No. 2 Republican didn't fully back Priebus' comments on Tuesday, saying threats were not good motivation to come together. ""There's a better way to unite people. I'm not a big believer that punishment unites people,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters. ""If Hillary (Clinton) can't unite Republicans, I don't think anything can."""	Hill Republicans frustrated with GOP disunity over Donald Trump
6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/cuba-newspaper-us-election-announcement/index.html	"But a surprising story was on the pages of Granma on Wednesday. The newspaper, which bills itself as ""the official organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba,"" published an announcement about US elections and how Americans in Cuba can vote.Beneath a headline that says ""Information for US citizens that are residents in Cuba,"" the piece explains how to vote in the US presidential election by sending an absentee ballot to the US Embassy in Havana. The information was provided by the embassy.A paragraph on page 4 of a newspaper might not sound like a big deal, but the announcement is striking. Here's why:-- Until now, voting wasn't possible for US citizens in Cuba, because America's embassy just reopened in 2015 after 54 years of broken relations. -- Cubans themselves don't have the ability to vote in multiparty elections. -- It's another notable sign of changing times as relations between the two countries thaw.No matter who they support, the Americans-in-Cuba vote isn't likely to sway the election. Other than the 50 or so US diplomats stationed here, a handful of journalists, returning Cuban-Americans, some medical students and airplane hijackers left over from the 1960s, there aren't many Americans living on the island -- at least not yet. But the November 8 election could have a big impact on Cuba's evolving relationship with the United States.Hillary Clinton is the first major presidential candidate to advocate lifting the US embargo on Cuba. Donald Trump has vowed to roll back the improved relations with Cuba, until the island's leaders improve their record on human rights.Cuban officials have said the new relationship with the US won't impact the fundamentals of their revolution. But the recent opening to the US has led to several recent major changes on the island:• Diplomacy: There's now a US Embassy in Havana• Travel: While there is still a travel ban on Americans visiting Cuba as tourists, President Barack Obama has loosened restrictions and for the first time in over 50 years, US airlines have reestablished routes to the island.• Commerce: American-run hotels are reopening, US cell phone providers are offering roaming service and some US credit cards may soon work in Cuba. A long line of US companies want to help Cuba modernize its ailing, state-run economy."	Cuban newspaper prints US election announcement

""I wanted to have a say in my children's future.""The Latino vote has long been the subject of interest for presidential elections, and in 2016 it may be wise to look more specifically at the Latina vote.A study by the City University of New York commissioned by CNN shows that the growing trend among the nation's estimated 27 million eligible Hispanic voters is the increasing number of Latina women stepping up to the ballot box.For Montañez that makes perfect sense.Poll: White working-class Americans have complicated view of Muslim immigrants""The women, they work so hard, and I think they put more attention [on voting],"" she said, contending that more Latinas are acting as heads of household for family finances and family discussions on politics.Montañez works from home.

""I take it not only as a right, but to me it's a privilege to go out and vote.""Dominguez was 14 when she immigrated to the US in 1981. She became a legal, permanent resident eight years later and shortly after that, a US citizen. She's been voting for more than 20 years now.""As Latinas, we take a lot of time to talk about the complaints that we have,"" Dominguez said. ""We want better education for our kids. We want to be able to afford a mortgage. We want to afford an education. How are we going to do that if our voices are not heard?""Latinas are also registering to vote in greater numbers than Hispanic men, accounting for a margin of nearly 10% more from 1992 to 2012, according to the CUNY/CNN study.Political analyst Hernan Molina explained that a lot of this may lie in Latin culture.Trump: Black communities in worst shape 'ever, ever, ever'""Numbers-wise, it's a very important voting bloc,"" Molina said. ""But they also take voting very seriously. They want to make sure that they elect the next president, the next candidate, because they want to make sure that that person represents their values.""Growing up as undocumented immigrant, Mexican-American author Julissa Arce said she votes now because she wants to speak up for those who can't and give the undocumented community a voice.Arce came to the US when she was 11 years old in 1994 on a tourist visa to be reunited with her parents, who were already living here. When she became an American citizen in 2014, she says she looked forward to this election year, when she will cast her ballot for president for the first time.""The thing I was looking most forward to was being able to vote,"" she said. ""And finally be a part of our country's democracy because at the very core of what our country is about is the ability of people, of its citizens, to be able to participate in the political process.""But Arce said the idea that the voice in her vote is more than just her own, isn't something she takes lightly.""I feel like with my vote, I can give a voice to the millions of undocumented immigrants who can't vote who cannot be represented in this country the way that they should be,"" she said.Trump brags about using 'other people's money' amid questions over charity useMontañez, Dominguez and Arce represent three generations of Latinas from different backgrounds and socio-economic levels but with the same vision of the importance of their vote.""We really love our families. We want to take care of our families. We want to give them the best,"" Dominguez said. ""And in order to do that, we need better representatives. We need a lot of things to change. And if we want change, we need to go out and vote.""Arce agreed, saying: ""It's more than just our right to go out to vote, it's our obligation to go out and vote.""""This election is really about taking back our narrative and taking back who we are as Latinos,"" she said. ""This election is about taking back that narrative and showing the country who we really are as Latinos and what we believe in and what we stand for.""The next couple of months, these women believe, will be crucial, believing the power of what happens next lies in their own hands.""We'll define this next election by either going out and voting or staying at home and not voting.
