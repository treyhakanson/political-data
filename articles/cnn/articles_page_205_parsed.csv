Sidney Shachnow and Rear Admiral Charles Williams, praised Trump and declared that ""the 2016 election affords the American people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy.""Also included in the letter was Gen. Burwell Bell, a retired four-star general who commanded US forces in Korea from 2006 until his retirement in 2008, and a notable inclusion in light of Trump's rhetoric allowing for the possibility of nuclear proliferation in the Asia-Pacific region.  ""As retired senior leaders of America's military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world. For this reason, we support Donald Trump's candidacy to be our next Commander-in-Chief,"" the group wrote in their letter. RELATED: Obama suffers the slings and arrows of a restive worldThe former US military leaders were sharply critical of the Obama administration's national security and foreign policy, warning that ""enemies have become emboldened, sensing weakness and irresolution in Washington"" and that ""in our professional judgment, the combined effort is potentially extremely perilous."" ""We support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries, and restore law and order domestically. We urge our fellow Americans to do the same.""One of the letter's signers told CNN his endorsement for Trump was not unqualified, citing how the Republican presidential nominee's comments about torture and his suggestion that the military should target terrorists' families were cause for concern.""Yes, they did concern me and I'll tell you why: a lot of times people say things not really understanding the consequences of their statements,"" Brigadier General Remo Butler (Ret) told CNN's Carol Costello on the ""Newsroom.""  However Butler, who last worked as chief of staff at Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida, said his concerns were assuaged by the team of national security advisers Trump had assembled.""I would be a fool to give anyone my unqualified support,"" Butler said. ""I am listening to what he says. I am listening and watching his actions, and right now today, ... I am supporting him.""RELATED: Reconciler in chief: Obama appeals to the people on foreign visitsOther Republican nominees in recent election cycles have managed to secure a larger number of generals and admirals as public backers.Sen. John McCain, a former Naval Aviator, was endorsed by 300 generals and admirals in his 2008 contest with Barack Obama.An even bigger number backed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012 via a full-page ad in the Washington Times.Clinton has yet to release a full list of senior officers backing her presidential bid, but several former generals have made their support for her public, including the former commander of US forces in Afghanistan, US Marine Gen. John Allen, as well as US Army four-star generals Bob Sennewald and David Maddox.Some of the most high-profile generals from recent conflicts, like David Petraeus, Stanley McChrystal, James Mattis and Raymond Odierno as well as Adm. William McRaven have not publicly said who they are voting for this election.And former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Gen. Martin Dempsey, recently wrote an open letter lambasting generals for being overtly political.The other four-stars on the list, Gen. Alfred Hansen, Adm. Jerry Johnson, US Navy, Retired and Gen. Crosbie ""Butch"" Saint, all retired almost a decade before 9/11.Among the three-star generals on the list, Lt. Gen. Marvin Covault commanded the military's response to the Rodney King riots of 1992 in Los Angeles. Covault has also publicly advocated for Common Core education standards, something Trump has regularly slammed on the campaign trail.Lt. Gen. William Boykin a former officer in the Army's elite Delta Force encountered controversy when he expressed overt religious views while serving as a commanding officer during the Global War on Terror."

Ted Lieu, has called on the White House to withdraw the request for congressional approval for the sale until Congress can fully debate American military support for the Saudis. Among the lawmakers who signed the letter, which was sent to President Barack Obama, are several members of the House Armed Services Committee and House Committee on Foreign Affairs.""This military campaign has had a deeply troubling impact on civilians,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was first reported by Foreign Policy. ""According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 3,704 civilians, including 1,121 children have been killed during the conflict. 2.8 million Yemenis have been internally displaced by the fighting, with 83 percent of the population now dependent on humanitarian assistance for survival.""The United States has backed a Saudi-led coalition of Arab countries in an 18-month campaign against Shiite Houthi rebels and their allies in Yemen. UN-led peace talks to end the conflict broke down last month, and airstrikes resumed.The Doctors Without Borders group is pulling out of a half-dozen medical facilities in northern Yemen due to what the humanitarian organization described as ""indiscriminate bombings and unreliable reassurances"" from the Saudi-led coalition, after an attack last month hit one of its hospitals, killing 19 and wounding 24. Saudi Arabia was the top recipient of American-made arms from 2011 to 2015, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.Congress has 30 days to consider the sale, which was approved by the State Department on August 9, and the deadline is soon to pass, meaning lawmakers would not be able to delay the sale. The letter indicated that the lawmakers were frustrated that the clock began ticking in the middle of the seven-week summer recess, which just ended Tuesday.""Any decision to sell more arms to Saudi Arabia should be given adequate time for full deliberation by Congress,"" the letter said. ""We are concerned, however, that the timing of this notification during the August congressional recess could be interpreted to mean that Congress has little time to consider the arms deal when it returns from recess within the 30 day window established by law.""The most recent congressional effort to thwart the sale of armaments to Saudi Arabia came from Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who unsuccessfully pushed a resolution earlier this year that would make air-to-ground weapons and ammunition sales to Saudi Arabia subject to a certification process.""There's an American imprint on every civilian life lost in Yemen,"" Murphy told CNN's Jake Tapper last month. ""Why? It's because, though the Saudis are actually dropping the bombs from their planes, they couldn't do it without the United States.""State Department spokesman John Kirby told CNN that the US shares some of the lawmakers' concerns.""We have had some concerns with the conduct of some coalition operations in Yemen, and we've not been bashful about expressing those privately or publicly,"" Kirby said Friday. ""I can assure you that (Secretary of State John Kerry) raised those concerns with Saudi leaders when we were in Jeddah.""Kerry traveled to Saudi Arabia last month and met with Saudi King Salman. Kerry recently announced nearly $189 million in additional humanitarian aid for Yemen, bringing the total to more than $327 million since October 2015."

Each failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance. If an agreement is not reached, the government could shut down on September 30, just a few weeks before the presidential and congressional elections. However, several congressional Republicans suggested the Zika and government funding issues would be combined and resolved together ahead of the deadline.""It's hard to explain why -- despite their own calls for funding -- Senate Democrats decided to block a bill that could help keep pregnant women and babies safer from Zika,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor.  ""It's also hard to explain why -- despite the array of terror attacks we've seen across the world -- Senate Democrats decided to block a bill that could help keep the American people safer from threats like ISIL.""The Zika vote came as the mosquito-borne virus, which can also be transmitted sexually, spreads widely in the Puerto Rico and some US states. Democrats blocked the bill because they say it included a provision to prevent funding for Planned Parenthood and no longer included a provision in the House bill banning Confederate flags from veterans' cemeteries. ""Republicans were more interested in attacking Planned Parenthood and flying the Confederate flag -- can't make this stuff up, that's really the truth -- than protecting women and babies from this awful virus,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said.The raw politics of the standoff -- and the blunt language used by the two leaders -- speak to the maneuvering and positioning McConnell and Reid see as necessary as they fight for control of the Senate, which is be up for grabs this year. Republicans hold a narrow 54-46 advantage but have several vulnerable senators who could lose in November.  Reid applies pressureIn a related move Tuesday, Reid said Democrats would work to increase pressure on Republicans to confirm Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Garland's nomination has floundered for months because Republicans say they want the next president to make that life-long appointment. Reid said until the Judiciary Committee schedules confirmation hearings for the judge, Democrats would use the chamber's rules to hold up action in Senate committees.""To show the Americans' disgust with how the Republicans have treated Merrick Garland's nomination, we're objecting to the committees meeting,"" Reid said.Senate rules require all senators to agree for committees to meet for more than two hours after the Senate convenes. It was put in place originally to ensure senators don't stray for too long from their duties on the floor. Typically, extending that time is done with little fanfare or notice. It's not clear what the long-term practical impact will be, although there are several hearings Wednesday that might need to be canceled.  An Aging Committee hearing is planning to examine the Bipartisan Policy Centers recommendations to boost retirements savings. A Veterans Committee hearing is looking at ""best practices"" at the Veterans Health Administration. And the Foreign Relations Committee is examining the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Reid said he was open to allowing some hearings if there are ""extraordinary circumstances"" and McConnell requests it. Republicans predicted Reid's plan will backfire because it's just as inconvenient for Democrats as it is for Republicans. ""Every time he surprises me he comes back and outdoes himself and surprises me again,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican who is from Texas. ""I just think that's an unsustainable position."""	Senate resumes gridlock as Zika funding vote fails	['Reid', 'McConnell']	[]

It's been the mission of his whole campaign from the very first day -- to demonize immigrants, to call Mexicans rapists and killers, to do everything he could to stir up all kinds of bad feelings about hard-working people. And he didn't raise it -- so he did choke.""The Republican nominee met with Nieto last week and said during a joint press conference that the two did not discuss Mexico paying for the wall, but the Mexican president later disputed that account and said he told Trump during their private meeting that Mexico wouldn't pay for it.Clinton also accused Trump of ""choking"" Monday at a rally in Hampton, Illinois.""In just a few hours, he managed to turn his trip to Mexico into an embarrassing international incident. Just look at what happened. He got into a Twitter war with the president of Mexico. And why? Because the President of Mexico said, 'I told him in the meeting, we weren't paying for that wall',"" Clinton told the crowd according to pool reports. ""So not only did Trump mess up his first international gig, he choked. He couldn't even bring himself to tell the president of Mexico one of his very few policy demands."" Trump told Muir that he did not choke and that Nieto and he had not planned to discuss the wall in their meeting. ""It was discussed that it wouldn't be discussed, but they know my stance and I know their stance,"" he said. ""We had ground rules and that's okay. (We'll see) who wins in the end. We'll win 100%. They'll pay for the wall."""	Clinton: Trump 'choked' when meeting with Mexican president	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""But unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has experience in actual governance, a record of service and a willingness to delve into real policy,"" the editorial continued.The newspaper's formal endorsement of the former secretary of state comes a day after it published an editorial saying it would not back Trump in 2016, ending a streak of endorsing every Republican presidential nominee since 1968. In an editorial published Tuesday titled ""Donald Trump is no Republican,"" the paper's editors rebuked the GOP hopeful, advising Texas voters that Trump is ""not qualified to serve as president and does not deserve your vote.""They argued that Trump ""inexplicably"" won the primary despite being ""the one who thumbed his nose at conservative orthodoxy altogether. Trump is -- or has been -- at odds with nearly every GOP ideal that this newspaper holds dear,"" they wrote. ""Donald Trump is no Republican and certainly no conservative.""Poll: Nine weeks out, a near even raceThe Morning News, which backed Ohio Gov. John Kasich during the primaries, cited Trump's ""authoritarian streak that should horrify limited-government advocates"" and his ""open admiration of Russia's Vladimir Putin"" as ""alarming"" reasons to oppose his candidacy. They also criticized the real estate mogul's economic policies, saying that ""his protectionism would likely force the U.S. into trade wars, increase the deficit, and sink the U.S. economy back into a recession.""""His ideas are so far from Republicanism that they have spawned a new description: Trumpism,"" the editors wrote.How Donald Trump could winThe endorsement Wednesday said there ""is only one serious candidate on the presidential ballot in November.""  ""This newspaper has not recommended a Democrat for the nation's highest office since before World War II — if you're counting, that's more than 75 years and nearly 20 elections,"" the endorsement read. ""The party's over-reliance on government and regulation to remedy the country's ills is at odds with our belief in private-sector ingenuity and innovation. Our values are more about individual liberty, free markets and a strong national defense.""""Hillary Clinton has spent years in the trenches doing the hard work needed to prepare herself to lead our nation,"" it continued. ""In this race, at this time, she deserves your vote."" CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on the Morning News' editorial, but did not immediately receive a response.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-national-security/index.html	"So began the homestretch to Election Day, as both candidates on Tuesday put national security squarely at the center of the 2016 campaign in the belief that it gives them the advantage.Trump began by unveiling a list of 88 retired military leaders endorsing his candidacy, including four four-star generals and 14 three-star flag officers. Then, alongside retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn at an event in Virginia Beach -- where fighter jets could be heard whooshing overhead -- Trump said of Clinton that ""virtually every decision she's made has been a loser.""Russian President Vladimir Putin ""looks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles,"" Trump said. ""Boy, would he like to see her ... Because just look at her decisions. Look how bad her decisions have been.""In a split-screen moment, Clinton took the stage at the same time in Tampa to launch her own barrage of attacks. Clinton dismisses calls for another congressional probe""We are going to work with our allies, not insult them. We are going to stand up to our adversaries, not cozy up to them. We are going to have real plans, not claims and secret plans,"" said the former secretary of state. Trump argued later Tuesday during a rally that Clinton's email use and her handling of classified information is ""disqualifying.""""People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach -- nobody's even ever heard of it -- their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton aides' use of a software named BleachBit to expunge traces of deleted emails.The security back-and-forth comes as the campaign enters its final two months and reminders of terror poised to return to the surface in advance of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on Sunday.A new CNN/ORC poll found that both candidates have advantages on national security. Those surveyed said they trust Trump more on terrorism (51% to Clinton's 45%), underscoring his ability to connect with the fears of Americans in an age of ISIS-inspired domestic attacks. But Clinton holds an edge on foreign policy (56% to Trump's 40%), enabling her to point to a wider range of national security credentials. Dead heatOverall, the poll showed the two candidates in a statistical dead heat, with Trump leading nationally among likely voters, 45% to Clinton's 43%.Poll: Nine weeks out, a near even raceFor Trump and Clinton, Tuesday's security focus came in two Southern swing states -- Virginia and Florida -- with large populations of veterans and military families. Clinton aides, who asked for anonymity while talking about strategy, said the focus on national security is part of a confluence of important dates and forums with Trump.Early voting, which includes mail-in ballots traditionally used by active-duty military, begins in many states this month. In some states, like Florida, active-duty military are asked to send in ballots starting in late September and early October.Another factor is that Trump has given her material to work with, Clinton aides said. They described her as relishing going after Trump on this topic because she feels she knows it well and he doesn't. It also allows her to target Republican-leaning voters who have been turned off by Trump.""His whole campaign has been one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform,"" Clinton said on Tuesday in Tampa, just miles from MacDill Air Force Base, where 15,000 people work.Clinton's push also comes with another prize in mind: ""Security moms,"" or female voters who are concerned about terrorism -- particularly middle-class suburban women in must-win swing states like Pennsylvania. A late-August Franklin and Marshall poll found Clinton ahead by 15 points in Southeastern Pennsylvania -- largely Philadelphia's suburbs -- even as the Republican incumbent senator leads his Democratic challenger by 9 points in the same region. That margin would be close to insurmountable for Trump on Election Day. Clinton, press do awkward dance at 30,000 feet""Any viable path for him would require mitigating that damage somewhat,"" said Hari Sevugan, a former Obama campaign spokesman who's now a strategist for the Democratic firm 270 Strategies. Sevugan said timing is also at play, though the focus on national security isn't driven solely by the approaching September 11 anniversary.""People are starting to tune in and focus in a more concentrated way on the election after Labor Day, and it makes sense from the Clinton perspective to really home in on where they have a relative strength,"" Sevugan said. ""And from the Trump perspective, they need to shore this up."" But Bryce Reeves, a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Virginia in 2017 and a former Army Ranger, said national security is a concern across all demographic groups -- and one that can give a big boost to Trump.""It's a matter of time"" before another terror attack, he said. ""It's not a matter of it we get hit, it's a matter of when we get hit and how we respond to those threats. ... That's why you're seeing a renewed interest by the candidates.""Clinton: Trump 'choked' when meeting with Mexican presidentHe said the release of Trump's military endorsements earlier Tuesday underscores the qualifications of the people he'd listen to as president. ""The sign of a great leader is to surround yourself with phenomenal people, and if you look at Trump's record today -- who he put out supporting him -- he's got numerous flag officers who led troops in the field during some of our most heightened recent conflicts,"" Reeves said.National security focusNational security will be a focus all week. Clinton and Trump will participate in a joint forum Wednesday sponsored by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and broadcast on NBC and MSNBC -- their first joint appearance of the campaign. Clinton is also bolstering her national security push with a new television ad called ""Sacrifice,"" highlighting Trump's criticism of Arizona Sen. John McCain's war-hero status and his fight with the Muslim parents of an American soldier killed in combat. And her super PAC, Priorities USA, is launching a $5 million ad buy in the swing states North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Iowa and New Hampshire on Friday with a spot titled ""I Love War."" Featuring a mushroom cloud, it touts Trump's hawkish remarks about war and nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, delivered a security-focused speech Tuesday in Wilmington, North Carolina, accusing Trump of flip-flopping on how the United States should handle the war in Iraq. ""He says whatever he feels like at any given time because you can do that when you're a TV star. But you can't do that when you're president of the United States,"" Kaine said. Trump and Clinton themselves also fought Tuesday over remarks Trump had made in an interview that aired on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""""I just don't think she has a presidential look and you need a presidential look,"" Trump said of Clinton. ""I'm talking about general, by the way, she says things about me that are horrible,"" Trump said. ""As an example the single greatest asset I have, according to those that know me, is my temperament.""Clinton's camp seized on the comments, using them to highlight Trump's previous fights with the Gold Star Khan family, his criticism of Fox News host Megyn Kelly and his questioning of President Barack Obama's birthplace. ""This isn't the first time Donald Trump has had a problem looking at someone different from himself and actually seeing them,"" said Clinton deputy communications director Christina Reynolds. Clinton also continued to fight back criticism of her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She shrugged off calls for additional congressional inquiries into her email usage as nothing more than pandering to right-wing conspiracy theorists, suggesting that the FBI ""resolved"" all the questions into her email use during their investigation.Clinton, speaking with her traveling press corps aboard her new campaign plane on Tuesday, said she has ""just accepted"" the fact that Republicans will continue to call for investigations into her, whether they are warranted or not.Clinton added, ""I believe I have created so many jobs in the, sort of, conspiracy-theory machine factory. Because, honestly, they never quit. They keep coming back."""	Trump, Clinton open campaign season sparring on national security	['Love', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]

""Hillary Clinton will not bully me.""Bondi was pulled back into the spotlight after The Trump Foundation agreed last Thursday to pay a $2,500 fine to the IRS for a $25,000 political donation it made to Bondi's campaign for attorney general at the time. The donation came only days after Bondi's office said it was reviewing allegations against Trump University. A formal investigation was never opened.""We've recently learned that his Trump Foundation has been fined $2,500 for illegal activity when it made a political contribution to the attorney general of Florida at the time she was being asked by her constituents to investigate Trump University,"" Clinton said aboard her campaign plane Tuesday.Bondi has become a regular surrogate for Trump, taking on a high-profile position defending the Republican nominee.Trump, for his part, has said he never spoke with Bondi about Trump University. Bondi's office says there was never any recommendation of an investigation into Trump University.""Of course I asked Donald Trump for a contribution, that's not what this is about,"" Bondi said Tuesday. ""(Clinton) said he was under investigation by my office, at the time, and I knew about it. None of which is true. ""The Trump Organization alerted the IRS last week that the foundation had given a political gift of $25,000 to Bondi's committee in 2013 and agreed to pay a $2,500 fine because of it, Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. The foundation took back the check and Trump wrote a check from his personal account after discovering the error at the time, Hicks added.""The contribution was legitimate, it was sent to the wrong group after a series of errors. This has since been corrected,"" she said.The issue comes after Trump spent two weeks riding a wave of newly released emails to accuse foreign donors of buying special access to then-Secretary of State Clinton through the Clinton's family charity. The accusations against Clinton -- built off emails showing Clinton Foundation aides asking top State Department aides for special meetings for Clinton donors -- have contributed to a significant tightening of the race for the White House with just a little more than two months to go.As Clinton supporters accused Trump of paying Bondi to ignore accusations against Trump University, Trump's supporters took to the airwaves to defend him. Republican National Committee spokesman and chief strategist Sean Spicer noted that 48 other attorneys general decided not to pursue Trump University. ""The only one that did was (New York Attorney General) Eric Schneiderman, who is a Hillary Clinton supporter. Of all of the 50 states where this was brought up, only one state pursued it, New York,"" Spicer said Tuesday on CNN.Spicer called the political donation by Trump's charity -- which is against the law -- a ""clerical error that was made.""Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper if Trump's decision to donate to Bondi from his charity undercut his ability to criticize Clinton, former Republican candidate Ben Carson pointed the finger at Democrats and Republicans.""One of the things that I learned during my run is that the depth of corruption on both sides is unimaginable,"" Carson said Tuesday. ""Donald Trump has admitted that he knows how the system works and that he has worked with both Democrats and Republicans and that money has been exchanged. You know, he has not tried to hide the fact that has occurred."""	Pam Bondi says she won't be 'bullied' by Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump donation	['Carson', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-election-2016/index.html	"The Republican nominee is rebounding from a summer of repeated stumbles that threatened to undermine his candidacy, underscoring his ability to claw his way back and stay competitive despite controversies that would sink any other politician.Poll: Nine weeks out, a near even raceTrump and Hillary Clinton enter the critical post-Labor Day phase of the campaign in a dead heat. A CNN/ORC national poll released Tuesday finds Trump ahead of Clinton by two points -- 45% to 43% -- among likely voters. The race is also tight among registered voters, where Clinton has a three point advantage. Both findings are within the margin of error.The narrowing of the race is a remarkable feat for Trump, who was down 10 points a month ago in CNN's Poll of Polls.Trump still faces serious hurdles that strong poll numbers can't mask. He's alienated much of the electorate, especially minorities who showed up in droves over the past two cycles to support Barack Obama. He's doing poorly among college-educated women, who are typically a Republican stronghold, and his rudimentary organization is dwarfed by Clinton's political machine in swing states where he still lags in most polls.Narrow path to the White HouseBut if Trump can spend the next 63 days shining a relentless and unforgiving spotlight on Clinton's vulnerabilities and avoid more self-inflicted wounds, there could be a path -- however narrow -- for him to reach the White House.""Can he fundamentally alter the focus of this election right now  — which is on him?"" asked Bill Lacy, a GOP veteran who ran presidential campaigns for Bob Dole and Fred Thompson. ""He needs to make this election about Secretary Clinton.""Trump's best chance for altering the race lies in the presidential debates, which begin September 26 and will serve as critical tests of his temperament and knowledge. In front of a vast television audience, the GOP nominee could reshape perceptions of his character and readiness -- if he can avoid being drawn into gaffes and personality clashes by Clinton.He will benefit from rock-bottom expectations, given controversies whipped up by his tempestuous personality and the vast gulf in experience between Trump and Clinton.But the formal one-on-one presidential debates -- which personify the ""commander-in-chief test"" many Americans ponder as they select their next president -- are a far stiffer test for Trump than the crowded free-for-alls of the Republican primary race.Trump's minority outreach off to rough startThere will be no space for the billionaire to relax and regenerate his energy while rivals spar or networks cut to commercial breaks. The intensity of the questioning and his confrontation with a prepared and experienced candidate like Clinton will leave no place to hide.Still, there is much for him to gain in the three scheduled televised showdowns and he will get an unfiltered chance to raise Clinton's political vulnerabilities before the American people.Clinton's liabilitiesThose liabilities, and the historic challenge Clinton faces in seeking a third consecutive White House term for her party and the nation's sour political mood, also help explain why Trump is still alive.In recent weeks, the Democratic nominee has yet again been hounded by the controversy over the private email server that has revived questions about her character and honesty. Her campaign has also been forced to deny claims of influence peddling between her family's philanthropic Clinton Foundation and the State Department while she ran US diplomacy.In an interview Monday with CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Clinton's struggles with questions about honesty.""The truth is Hillary knows it's a problem and she's trying to figure out how to remedy it,"" Biden said. ""My advice to her: The best way to remedy it is to talk about what you care about and talk about it with some passion and people will see through it.""For his part, Trump needs to do more than simply disqualify Clinton. He must show he's ready to lead the nation.Trump campaign uses Sanders' words to knock Clinton over foundation tiesTo mount an authentic comeback, Trump must finally forge an emotional connection with voters outside his natural base, who have yet to embrace his vision of a nation under siege from terror and crime.""His appeal to the base Republican vote that won him the nomination in effect has turned many swing voters and Democratic voters against him,"" said Lacy. ""He has to address it by being presidential and doing so constantly.""The Clinton campaign doubts Trump has it in him.""He would have to do things in the last eight weeks that he appears to have been incapable of doing in the last 16 months,"" said Clinton's chief strategist Joel Benenson, citing Trump's need to build a ground game, court swing voters and improve his appeal to suburban women.Clinton is banking on a huge turnout from minority voters who helped Obama win the presidency in 2008 and 2012. So far, Trump's attempts to improve his paltry standing among voters who are suspicious of him has been halting and awkward. Last week, for instance, his trip to Mexico had clear presidential overtones. But hours later, he delivered an angry speech on immigration that further alienated Latino voters and prompted some Latino GOP leaders to take back their endorsement of Trump. And on Monday, he refused to rule out granting legal status to undocumented immigrants.And on Saturday, Trump met an African-American congregation in Detroit in a bid to counter claims he is a racist. He was politely received but didn't seem to change many minds, according to interviews by CNN afterward.Still, signs of life in Trump's polling and his energetic performance last week cheer some GOP operatives.'The wind is at our back'""It's not just the crowd size, and the enthusiasm and the rallies, but it's (that) all of these polls are now closing in major ways,"" Republican National Committee Chief Strategist Sean Spicer told CNN. ""Look at the wind right now ... the wind is at our back.""Still, Trump has fewer routes than Clinton to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. He must start by taking solid red states such as Arizona and Georgia, where Clinton is unusually competitive, off the table. He must also lock down North Carolina, a swing state in recent elections without which he may lack a credible route to 270 electoral votes.House Republicans find success separating from TrumpThen Trump must close in on Clinton in all the swing states, in Iowa and Virginia and New Hampshire, as well as Ohio and Florida. Then, to win a narrow victory in the electoral college, Trump must turn at least one state that went for President Barack Obama in 2012.Possible candidates include Pennsylvania, where he currently trails Clinton by between three and nine points in polls released over the past month. Another possible target is Michigan, where recent polls have Clinton up by 11 points.Pennsylvania is a must-win for Trump. If Clinton adds just the Keystone state and Virginia -- home to her running mate, Tim Kaine -- to states considered solidly Democratic, she will be only 10 electoral votes short of the presidency. That will happen even if Trump wins perennial bellwethers Ohio and Florida.A recent Pennsylvania poll by Monmouth University shows Trump is dangerously weak in the populous Philadelphia suburbs that are often decisive -- a position he must address if he is to compete in the state. Clinton leads 62% to 29% in seven congressional districts around Philadelphia, an area that typically accounts for 40% of statewide turnout. Obama won the region 62% to 37% over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012.Trump does better than Romney in less populous and diverse western and central Pennsylvania -- but not by enough to make up for his deficit around Philadelphia. He also trails Clinton among white voters with a college degree by 10 points. Romney won that subset by 15 points in 2012.Unless Trump can turn those voters around, his hopes in Pennsylvania, and in key suburban districts in other swing states such as Columbus, Ohio, look remote.Alienating moderate RepublicansThat's why it surprised many analysts when Trump ditched a plan to soften the hardline on immigration that alienated many moderate white Republicans.According to CNN exit polls of the Republican primary in Pennsylvania, only 12% of voters said immigration was the most important issue to them. But 60% of Trump voters said it was -- suggesting that the billionaire's position on the issue locks in his base but hurts him among less ideological Republican voters.Trump's fiery immigration speech last week suggested he has given up on broadening his coalition and instead is betting that the pool of voters marginalized by globalization and the loss of blue-collar jobs is much larger than pollsters believe.""This speech is directed at those people living in Ohio, who have thought for whatever reason that their country is not what it was when they grew up,"" Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told CNN after his immigration speech last week.Trump supporters are also predicting that Democrats have underestimated the size of the GOP nominee's support.Race and racism in the 2016 campaign""There's a factor in this election that the media is just ignoring and that is that Hillary Clinton is the most unlikeable person who has ever run for office. Her support is ten miles wide and a half of an inch thick,"" said Wayne Allyn Root, a conservative commentator from Nevada and author of the recently published ""Angry White Male."" ""I think Hillary Clinton's number of voters will be down 30% versus Obama's four years ago, and I think Trump's share of the white electorate will be up dramatically. He'll gain 4 million extra votes, most of them (from) the white community.""Trump's best bet may be to target the Rust Belt where his anti-trade rhetoric resonates.Kathleen Hartnett White, a member of Trump's economic advisory council, says the billionaire should relentlessly stress growth, expanding energy production and the slashing of regulations.""I hope after Labor Day, and I think that is a good day to pivot, that these should be issues in those Rust Belt states,"" she said. ""I would reiterate them over and over again.""October surpriseIf all else fails, Trump could benefit from an October surprise.A stunning news event, such as a terror attack at home or abroad, could prompt some fearful voters to fully embrace Trump's call for curbs on Muslim immigration and warnings that Clinton just does not understand the scale of the threats facing Americans.Why I'm voting for TrumpOr a sudden global crisis, economic shock -- or even a smoking gun suggesting a hidden Clinton scandal -- could also shake up the race.Unless he starts making headway soon, with early voting only weeks away, it may take something that jarring for Trump to win. And it's always possible that Trump has already sown the seeds of his own defeat simply by alienating so many voters on the way to the Republican nomination.""Even if they ran a miracle comeback campaign,"" Lacy said, ""at this point I honestly don't know if it is starting soon enough."""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/politics/hillary-clinton-election-2016-press/index.html	"The first 48 hours of this arrangement produced two lengthy mid-flight gaggles in as many days. But it was also clear that the former secretary of state appears less than entirely comfortable with having dozens of eager reporters in such close quarters, resulting in a handful of exchanges that at times felt as awkward as a blind date.The first time Clinton walked to the back section of the plane on Monday reserved for press, she said with an enthusiastic smile: ""I've been just waiting for this moment.""""I'm thrilled. No, really!"" Clinton added, as though to acknowledge the slight irony of her initial comment. ""I wanted to welcome you onto the plane. I think it's pretty cool, don't you?""Unsure of what to say, reporters remained silent.""You're supposed to say, 'yes!' "" Clinton quipped, before talking about Labor Day and the next few weeks of the campaign.The interaction underscored a reality about the new flying arrangement: Both Clinton and her pack of reporters are out of practice when it comes to casual interactions with each other. Reporters who have covered Clinton for months witnessed something similar when she launched her campaign in 2015 -- after four years of serving as secretary of state and then taking some time off, it took Clinton a bit to find her footing interacting with press and voters on the campaign trail.With just more than two months left until Election Day, members of the press have turned up the pressure on the Clinton campaign for the candidate to take more questions from reporters. There is an ongoing count among reporters on the number of days since Clinton's last news conference.Privately, aides chalk it all up to Clinton being more policy-wonk than political animal, not her lack of familiarity with the press. Clinton herself has said politicking ""is not easy for her"" and that she is not a ""natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama.""Her Republican opponent, meanwhile, has taken a drastically different approach in dealing with the press.Donald Trump frequently holds press conferences and impromptu gaggles (his traveling press corps still travels on a separate plane). But the businessman also publicly and frequently berates the press, going after reporters (sometimes naming individuals) in stump speeches and even barring some news outlets from his campaign events.To the surprise of some reporters, Clinton returned to the back of the plane on Tuesday. But she pointed out that it wasn't exactly her decision.""Good morning everybody, I will come back later. Jen has convinced me I need to,"" Clinton said in jest, a reference to her spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, who was standing close by.Clinton chatted casually for a few minutes, telling reporters that she was powering through the allergies that have strained her voice in recent days and even sharing that she had upped her antihistamines. One reporter wanted Clinton's reaction to Trump's campaign manager's comment that Clinton is ""allergic to media.""""I said I'm allergic to him, that's what I said,"" Clinton responded.After the plane took off Tuesday from Westchester County Airport en route to Tampa, Clinton returned as promised for another gaggle.""Hey, everybody. We had so much fun yesterday, I think we will do this again,"" Clinton began. ""Adventures on the plane.""Tuesday evening, as the Clinton plane was returning to New York from Florida, the traveling press corps tried its luck at engaging Clinton one more time with a campaign tradition: Rolling an orange with a question written on it down the aisle to the front of the plane. The question, written with a marker, asked who Clinton would rather have dinner with -- Trump or Russian President Vladimir Putin. Clinton's traveling press secretary Nick Merrill rolled the orange back, with the word ""Putin"" circled. But minutes later, Merrill informed the traveling press corps that Clinton was not responsible for marking the answer -- it was actually Merrill who had circled the orange, and Clinton never indicated her preferred dinner partner."
