Ted Cruz, who is leading the push to prevent it from taking effect Oct. 1. Congressional sources tell CNN that Trump's late effort to engage on this issue could throw the last-minute negotiations into flux.""The US should not turn control of the Internet over to the United Nations and the international community,"" Trump's national policy director, Stephen Miller, said in a statement. ""President Obama intends to do so on his own authority -- just 10 days from now, on Oct. 1, unless Congress acts quickly to stop him. The Republicans in Congress are admirably leading a fight to save the Internet this week, and need all the help the American people can give them to be successful.""Cruz has not endorsed his former rival for the GOP presidential nomination, but tweeted out his thanks for Trump's backing his efforts.""Appreciate @realDonaldTrump's support of our efforts to keep the internet free.""Democrats have been skeptical of Cruz's efforts, siding with tech firms like Google and Facebook who believe it will be better for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, based in Los Angeles, to take over domain names to improve information sharing across the Internet.The Internet issue is one of several matters that the two sides still are haggling over as part of the talks.They have until Sept. 30 to reach a government funding deal, which will also include funding for Zika. The Senate GOP had hoped to reach a deal this week in order to wrap up the session and let their vulnerable incumbents campaign. But business is expected to extend into at least next week."

But Clinton entirely ignored the Republican nominee during the event, never using his name in the roughly 30-minute speech.Wednesday's speech was Clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about Trump.Clinton's past ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families have been far more focused on Trump. Wednesday's address, instead, lived up to what Clinton's aides had hoped the series of speeches would be: More policy than politics.Clinton said people with disabilities are ""invisible, overlooked and undervalued"" and that the United States is ""falling short"" in protecting their rights.""We've got to face that and do better -- for everyone's sake,"" Clinton said. ""Because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans.""Clinton added that as president, she would do away with the subminimum wage, urge Congress to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and launch a program to help with autism in the workplace.""People with disabilities shouldn't be isolated. They should be given the chance to work with everyone else. And we're going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past,"" Clinton said of laws that allow employers to pay people with disabilities less than the minimum wage. Some advocates for the disabled, however, have feared that the elimination of the subminimum wage would diminish hiring of disabled workers.Jennifer Mizrahi, the president of Respect Ability, an advocacy organization for people with disabilities, said the speech was the first time a presidential candidate has dedicated an entire campaign event to the disabled.People with disabilities are usually the ""poorest of the poor,"" Mizrahi said, noting that around 400,000 disabled people work in ""sheltered work shops where they can pay subminimum wages, as little as 20 cents an hour.""The activist also suggested the Clinton's struggles would be helped by focusing on people with disabilities. ""We span every demographic,"" she said. ""A lot of white people with disabilities.""Clinton is beating Trump with Latino and African-American voters, but lagging behind the Republicans with white voters, especially those without a college degree."

Lewis said the 2016 presidential election is the first since 1965 that voters don't have the full protections of the Voting Rights Act due to a Supreme Court ruling three years ago. The lawmaker said it was a ""shame and a disgrace"" that Congress hasn't acted on the issue.In 2013, the Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 decision that key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are no longer valid. The opinion left it to Congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices.Chief Justice John Roberts explained the ruling saying ""our country has changed"" for the better. And that the conditions that moved Congress five decades ago to require certain parts of the United States to ""preclear"" changes to voting laws ""no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions."""

If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- I mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro,"" King said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. ""You're going to be a negro 'til you die.""Trump, who was already smirking as he listened to King, didn't change the expression on his face, but turned slightly uncomfortably to his special counsel Michael Cohen and the church's pastor, Darrell Scott, who head up Trump's diversity coalition.Trump, who said he personally invited King to introduce him, was sitting in a chair onstage just a few feet away from King when he uttered the word.Taking the stage moments later, Trump called King a ""phenomenal persona"" and said: ""Ah, there's only one Don King.""During his speech, King praised Trump as ""fearless,"" ""courageous and brave"" and said he believed Trump would ""take this system apart"" and ""create a whole new system.""""The system is corrupt, the system is rigged, the system is sexist, the system is racist,"" King said, arguing that Trump would bring the country ""back to inclusiveness.""King's mere presence at Trump's side is controversial: King was convicted of second-degree murder for stomping a man to death in 1966. The governor of Ohio later pardoned King for the crime in 1983.John Lewis calls for election observers at polling places this NovemberWednesday's moment came as Trump pitched himself as a president who would help bring jobs and safety to impoverished minority communities during the event at Scott's church. There, Trump was flanked by a number of his prominent black surrogates, including Ben Carson and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault.Later, as Trump fielded questions from Scott on a range of issues affecting religious and minority communities, King stood on stage by Trump, interjecting infrequently to shout about the ""system."" Warily eying King, Manigault suggested King take a seat, but the boxing promoter declined.Moments later, as Trump's supporters gathered around him to pray for Trump, King grabbed Trump's wrist and raised their arms above their heads, as he would with a champion boxer.Trump appeared to let his hand go limp, and then, unsure what to do, closed his hand to make a fist.Just a few hours later, King flew with the real estate mogul aboard Trump's plane to his rally in Toledo, Ohio, where he introduced GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence."

Threats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the White House and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif., and most recently after the attacks in New York and New Jersey. Polls generally show that voters trust Trump more than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism. Trump's tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the US-Mexico border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise. While a majority (63%) of white, working-class Americans say immigrants from Muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks.Members of this group, which exit polls had at around 44% of the US electorate in 2012 though the exact figure is difficult to quantify, also have a more negative view of immigration: nearly half (47%) of whites without a college degree view immigrants as a burden on the country.Even among those white, working-class voters who view immigrants as a burden, 50% say immigrants from Muslim countries are good people compared with 35% who say they are not.  There is also a partisan divide: White, working-class Democrats are more likely to hold positive views about immigrants from Muslim countries than their white, working-class Republican counterparts. 47% of white Democrats without college degrees say Muslim immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US compared with 83% of white Republicans with no college degree.Trump has made his hard line against Muslims a key component of his campaign, and his white, working-class supporters have strong views about the impact of immigrants from Muslim countries. Fifty-three percent of white voters without college degrees who are considering supporting Trump say immigrants from Muslim countries are basically good, but 82% say they increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US.'Under attack'More than 6-in-10 white, working-class Americans also say that Christian values are under attack in the United States. That viewpoint is more widespread among older working-class whites than among younger ones. Seventy-three % of white, working class adults 65 and older said Christian values are under attack, while just 41% of working-class adults under the age of 30 said the same.Trump backers were more likely to say that Christian values were under attack than those who support Clinton. Eighty-one percent of white, working-class voters who would consider supporting him in November said Christian values were under attack, compared to 31% who support Clinton.Candidate positioningIn the hours following the bombings in New York and New Jersey, Clinton and Trump tussled over who was better qualified to combat terrorism as well as its cause. Clinton cast herself as the candidate best prepared to combat terrorism and said that her opponent's positions are ""not grounded in fact"" and ""meant to make some kind of demagogic point.""""I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges,"" the former secretary of state told reporters on Monday, ""not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric.""Trump blamed Clinton and President Barack Obama for failing to keep the country safe and called for profiling to beef up what he sees as currently lackluster anti-terrorism efforts. Instead of treading lightly, Trump said on Fox News Monday morning, the better approach would be to ""knock the hell out of 'em.""""Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are,"" Trump told Fox. ""They are afraid to do anything about it, because they don't want to be accused of profiling. And they don't want to be accused of all sorts of things.""The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9 through September 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites -- white non-Hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 5 points for results among members of the white working class, 6 points for whites with degrees, 10 points for black working class respondents and 9 points for the Hispanic working class.

Trump Jr.'s lightly filtered Twitter account has at times appeared to be a clearinghouse for particularly unsavory media and commentary. On Tuesday, for instance, he retweeted a Breitbart story titled, ""Europe's Rape Epidemic: Western Women Will Be Sacrificed At The Altar Of Mass Migration.""  Here are a few the son's latest stumbles:Compared Syrian refugees to Skittles""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.""At least, that's how Donald Jr., among others, would describe it.While many Trump supporters offered their support, the tweet provoked a broader backlash. Mars Candy eventually chimed in to distance themselves from the message. ""Skittles are candy; refugees are people,"" the company said in a statement. ""It's an inappropriate analogy. We respectfully refrain from further comment, as that could be misinterpreted as marketing.""READ: What corporate America can learn from Skittles' response to Donald Trump Jr.The moral question aside, Washington Post reporter Philip Bump pointed out a math problem.According to a recent Cato Institute report, the odds ""that an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year.""As Bump explains, the tweet could -- with the framing only slightly altered -- be interpreted as an argument for letting in more refugees.Still, the campaign insists Trump Jr. has been ""a tremendous asset"" all the way through.""Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe,"" Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN in an email. ""But the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what's needed to protect us.""Gave a new reason why Trump hasn't shared his taxesDonald Trump is on track to be the first modern presidential candidate withhold his tax information. The candidate and the campaign have for months said their reason for keeping a lid on the returns was an ongoing audit.But in an interview last week with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Trump Jr. gave a very different explanation. The decision was made, he said, because Trump has ""got a 12,000-page tax return that would create ... financial auditors out of every person in the country,"" and have them ""asking questions that would distract from (his father's) main message.""While there is no law preventing Trump from making the returns public, audit or not, Trump Jr.'s comment reflected what critics have been saying for months: that this is and always has been a political calculation. 'Gas chamber' referenceComplaining about media coverage is part of almost every campaign's playbook. References to ""the gas chamber"" are not.During an interview with Philadelphia-based conservative talk radio host Chris Stigall, he first described the press as the Clinton campaign's ""number one surrogate."" But then, this: ""They've let her slide on every indiscrepancy (sic), on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the thing. I mean, if Republicans were doing that, they'd be warming up the gas chamber right now. It's a very different system -- there's nothing fair about it."" The campaign denied that Trump Jr. was making a Holocaust reference -- the Nazis used gas chambers as a tool of their World War II-era genocide -- and that the comment, a bit of hyperbole, was really about capital punishment more generally.  ""The liberal, dishonest media is so quick to attack one of the Trumps that they never let the truth get in the way of a good smear,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement.The Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish advocacy group, was less sure.""Trivialization of the Holocaust and gas chambers is NEVER okay,"" they tweeted at Trump Jr.Clinton's campaign was especially biting, turning its response into an attack on Trump the candidate, with chairman John Podesta saying the son's language is ""probably pretty consistent with the type of rhetoric he heard around the house growing up.""Posting image of alt-right mascot 'Pepe the Frog' with TrumpAs Clinton was feeling the fallout from her ""basket of deplorables"" comment -- in which she initially suggested that half of Trump's supporters fit in a group composed of the ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it"" -- Trump Jr. made headlines with a controversial Instagram post.The photoshop composition featured his father leading a band of ""deplorables,"" with political allies and the cartoon ""Pepe the Frog"" by his side. What Trump Jr. later said he did not know, was that ""Pepe"" has been appropriated as a mascot and preferred meme of the white supremacist alt-right movement.Asked about the post by ABC News on Sunday, Trump Jr. pleaded ignorance.""I've never even heard of Pepe the Frog,"" he said. ""I had no idea there was any connotation there.""Promotes anti-Clinton conspiracies His father's feed might get more attention, but Trump Jr. is just as active -- and sometimes more controversial. He often retweets the actor James Woods, who frequently shares suspect anti-Clinton media. ""What is wrong with her?"" Woods asked in a recent tweet, shared by Trump Jr., that quoted another user who wrote: ""BREAKING!!! Collapsing Hillary Clinton Heavily Sedated as she responds to Donald Trump comment & #Chelsea !! #Valium""After a recent NBC News forum, Trump Jr. retweeted a post from right wing radio host John Cardillo, who was among the conspiracy theorists saying Clinton had been wearing an earpiece during the event. ""Well look at that,"" Cardillo wrote. ""Last night #CrookedHillary gets caught with #HillarysEarPiece. Today a new ear covering hairdo.""Shared some choice thoughts on a 'herd of mothers'A look back at Trump Jr. in the pre-campaign days yielded some tasteless commentary on motherhood and a family employee.""Ever notice that if u get a herd of mothers together they aren't physically capable of talking about anything but birth pregnancy & diapers?"" he asked in July 2011.About a year later, he offered this gem on the devotion of a particular employee, who Trump Jr. said skipped a family wedding to be at work. ""At dinner w our greenskeeper who missed his sister's wedding 2 work (luv loyalty 2 us) ""No big deal hopefully she'll have another someday"";)"" Trump Jr. tweeted."

A 'Parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'The United States does not care about the global problems of human-caused climate change. You are on your own,'"" the group wrote on the website responsiblescientists.org.The use of the term ""Parexit"" is a reference to a political withdrawal along the lines of the UK's vote to leave the European Union, commonly called the ""Brexit.""They continued, ""The consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting -- for our planet's climate and for the international credibility of the United States.""  The letter is signed by a number of famous scientists, including Hawking and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, who served as Secretary of Energy under President Barack Obama. CNN reached out to the Trump campaign for a response to the letter, but did not immediately receive a response.The Paris Agreement was reached by 195 countries at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015, aimed at coordinating global efforts to combat climate change. Obama was a main proponent of the agreement, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton supports its ongoing implementation.

Such claims are inconsistent with reality,"" they wrote.Republican nominee Donald Trump opposes the agreement, and he has previously suggested that climate change is a hoax ""created by and for the Chinese.""

The reason for Trump's refusal is simple, Reid said.""Because Trump's tax returns would further destroy his presidential candidacy,"" said Reid, who made Mitt Romney's tax returns a major election issue four years ago.Trump has insisted for months that he cannot release his tax returns because he is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service; alternatively, his campaign has said that voters do not much care about the issue. It is not a requirement for presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, but it is an enduring tradition. For the last 40 years, virtually every major party nominee has released his or her tax returns. (Gerald Ford released a summary in 1976.)Tax experts have said that an audit does not preclude Trump from releasing his returns.On Wednesday, Reid dismissed Trump's explanation, saying the real estate mogul is ""not known for caution or restraint.""""He is the most unhinged and reckless presidential candidate ever,"" Reid said. Instead, Reid said the real reason for Trump's failure to disclose the returns is due to the political damage they would inflict on his campaign. ""Production of his tax returns would prove again that he is a fraud,"" Reid said. The retiring Nevada senator said the tax returns would show that Trump is ""not the billionaire he claims to be"" and a ""welfare king"" who is ""mooching off the American taxpayer."" Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to a request for comment.It was the second time in as many days that Reid has torched Trump over his taxes. And it's become a familiar role for Reid, who excoriated Romney for refusing to release some of his tax returns in the 2012 presidential race. Romney released a 20-year summary of his tax liabilities from 1990 until 2009, as well as his tax returns from 2010 and 2011, but he did not release the returns from previous years.  Reid, without proof, accused Romney of going a decade without paying federal income taxes. Four years later, Reid and Romney are now on the same side of the issue. In February, Romney speculated publicly that Trump's tax returns would reveal a ""bombshell.""Trump fired back on Twitter that month, claiming Romney ""didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R!"" On Wednesday -- four years to the day that Romney released his 2010 and 2011 tax returns -- Reid found himself with an unlikely ally.
