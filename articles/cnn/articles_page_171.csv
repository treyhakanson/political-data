""And this is a pattern that has been repeated over and over again, and I think this doesn't belong in any race, much less a race to be president of this country,"" Kaine said. The two vice presidential nominees jousted over what Trump had meant in separate Sunday show interviews. Kaine condemned Trump in an interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday."" And Pence defended his running mate on ABC's ""This Week"" with Martha Raddatz. Asked what Trump meant by that remark, Pence said: ""Well I think, you know, Donald Trump believes in the safety and security of every American, and any suggestion otherwise regarding Secretary Clinton is just nonsense. ""Pence then appeared to claim Clinton ""has had private security"" for the last 30 years, which is false. She's been protected but the US Secret Service since Bill Clinton's campaign for the presidency in 1992. The Secret Service is part of the federal government and protects presidential and vice presidential candidates in both parties, as well as their families, and visiting heads of state. It is not a private security force. ""I mean, the point that he was making is that Hillary Clinton has had private security now in her life for the last 30 years, but she would deny the right of law-abiding citizens to have a firearm in their home to protect their own families. I think what Donald Trump was saying is that if Hillary Clinton didn't have all that security, she'd probably be a whole lot more supportive of the Second Amendment,"" Pence said.Pence also complained about being pressed about Trump's comments, saying news media focus too much on the GOP nominee's controversial utterances. ""You know, I just joined this campaign a couple months ago. But, you know, to be honest with you, Martha -- I have a lot of respect for you. But a lot of people in the national media spend more time talking about what Donald Trump said in the last day than they do talking about what the Clintons have been up to for the last 30 years,"" Pence said. Kaine, meanwhile, pointed to Trump's history of appearing to raise the possibility of violence against Clinton. Trump had said last month in North Carolina that there would be nothing conservatives could do if Clinton was elected and could appoint her own Supreme Court justice, before adding, ""although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know."" ""What did that mean when he said that just three weeks ago?"" Kaine said. ""And when you look at a series of these comments that he's making, I do believe it is an (incitement) -- or at a minimum, an expression of indifference to whether violence would occur.""

Typically, national political figures use caution when describing unfolding situations and law enforcement actions.""Just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what's going on,"" Trump said at a campaign rally here.Two hours after Trump spoke, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the explosion ""was an intentional act.""But, he said, ""there is no evidence at this point of a terror connection."" And the city's police commissioner, James O'Neill, said the ""exact nature and cause"" of the blast ""has not yet been determined.""The Trump campaign did not respond to numerous requests for comment Saturday night on whether Trump had any evidence the explosion was a bomb or whether he was in contact with NYC officials.On Sunday, the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force began investigating the bomb in New York as possible terrorist acts, as well as a similar blast in New Jersey. The Minnesota FBI also said they were investigating a knife attack there as a possible terrorist act.Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, spoke to reporters in White Plains nearly two hours after the explosion and similarly called the incident a ""bombing.""Clinton said she had been in touch with various New York City officials. She declined to answer a question about what effect, if any, the explosion would have on the 2016 race.But asked about Trump's response, Clinton said: ""I think it is important to know the facts about any incident like this. ... It is always wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions, because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened.""After the news came Sunday that the incidents were being investigated as terrorist acts, Clinton issued a statement condemning the attacks and touting her plan to combat ISIS, which laid claim to the Minnesota attack.""I strongly condemn the apparent terrorist attacks in Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. I pray for all of those who were wounded, and for their families,"" she said. ""Law enforcement officials are working to identify who was behind the attacks in New York and New Jersey and we should give them the support they need to finish the job and bring those responsible to justice - we will not rest until that happens.""President Barack Obama, who spoke soon after Trump at the Congressional Black Caucus gala, made no mention of the incident. He was later briefed on the explosion, a White House official said. A law enforcement source told CNN that the explosion occurred around 8:40 p.m. ET -- about 30 minutes before Trump took the stage here -- at 23rd Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan. New York authorities said 29 people were injured in the explosion.""We've got to get very tough,"" Trump said. ""It's a terrible thing what's going on in our world, what's going on in our country, but we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant and we are going to end it.""Trump did not immediately exit his plane as he landed for his rally at an airplane hanger here. He was being briefed on the explosion in New York before he took the stage, a campaign aide told CNN.Trump did not return to the reports of an explosion in New York during the rest of his speech.But he also did not hold back his usual barrage of political attacks.The Republican nominee gave a standard stump speech during which he repeatedly attacked Clinton over everything from her controversial use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state to what he deemed her coziness with big moneyed interests.And he also suggested that former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who slammed Trump in an editorial earlier Saturday, ""probably has a problem we don't know about.""This story has been updated."

""Obviously, if you look at a number of these incidents, you can call them whatever you want -- they are terrorism, though,"" Christie said. The explosion in a New Jersey trash can appeared similar to one in nearby New York City on Saturday night. Nobody was killed in either incident. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a news conference Sunday: ""There is no evidence that this explosion was connected to any international terrorism.""""A bomb going off is generically a terrorist activity and ... that's how they are going to prosecute it,"" Cuomo said.""You don't want to jump to conclusions and you don't want to put information out there that you don't know is absolutely true,"" he said, though he defended Donald Trump against criticism he called the incident in New York a ""bomb"" too soon and before law enforcement officials did so.In the interview, Christie, a top ally of Republican presidential nominee and the chairman of Trump's transition committee, defended Trump's decision not to release his tax returns -- even those from 2008 and earlier, which are no longer under IRS audit. Christie told Tapper that ""it's the advice of his lawyers and his accountants not to release tax returns while he's under audit.""""I've never been under audit, so I don't know what advice I would get from my lawyers and my accountants if I was,"" Christie said. Christie also defended Trump's Twitter attacks on former secretary of state Colin Powell and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, both of whom worked under Republican President George W. Bush. He complained that Powell (whose criticism of Trump came in private, hacked emails) and Gates ""are allowed to hurl insults at Donald Trump, but Donald Trump's not allowed to respond.""""The American people are tired of that kind of political correctness, Jake. They want people who speak their minds. Donald speaks his mind,"" Christie said. This story has been updated."	Chris Christie: NJ and NY incidents 'are terrorism,' no connection 'at this time'

""A year ago, I think you remember, we had a small force that we were trying to put into Syria, and the opening of that was an abysmal failure,"" Kaine said. ""But now we are taking the fight to ISIS to defeat them and to destroy them. And if you look at what's happened in the last year, ISIS's territory has dramatically shrunk because of a significant uptick in cooperation between the US, the Iraqi military, the Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq, the Kurds in northern Syria and the Syrian opposition. We're shrinking their space on the battlefield,"" he said. Kaine blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for Syria waging ""a war against its civilians,"" creating an opening for ISIS, and said Russia will play a key role in the country's efforts to combat ISIS. Kaine also pushed back on questions about whether the United States' decision to pull troops out of Iraq under President Barack Obama allowed for the rise of ISIS, saying that leaders there didn't want the US to stay.""We pulled our troops out of Iraq because they didn't want us to stay. And yes, in Iraq, it spiraled downward,"" Kaine said. ""And then in Syria, where we didn't have troops, it spiraled downward because of the atrocities of Bashar al-Assad."" He added: ""We can't make governments govern wisely. But what we need to do is when terrorists pose a threat to allies of the United States, we need to engage in punishing activity to destroy them. We are now on track to defeat ISIS on the battlefield, but we have got to be sharing intelligence with our allies so that we can keep America and our allies safe.""The Trump campaign rebutted Kaine's comments, saying: ""The only thing that is 'dramatically improved' is ISIS's global reach, the frequency of deadly attacks, and the threat they pose due to the failed national security policies of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.""""Given that recently uncovered U.S. intelligence documents say ISIS is expanding the number of areas where they are fully operational, Hillary Clinton should say whether she agrees with her running mate's troubling assessment of the threat they pose,"" Jason Miller, a spokesman for Donald Trump said in a statement."

I've said it's a done issue for a long time, and Donald Trump has said it's a done issue now,"" Christie, a top Trump supporter and the chairman of his transition team, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" Though Trump had been asked whether he now believes Obama was born in the United States as recently as 2016 and hadn't affirmed that position, Christie refuted Tapper's questioning saying: ""It's just not true that he kept it up for five years."" Tapper: ""Sure he did.""Christie: ""It's simply not true.""Tapper: ""It is true.""Christie: ""No, Jake. It wasn't like he was talking about it on a regular basis ... And when the issue was raised, he made very clear the other day what his position is."" But of course, Trump for years elevated false claims that Obama wasn't born in the United States, raising it repeatedly in interviews and on Twitter. In 2011, Obama released a copy of his birth certificate to put to rest what many considered fringe conspiracy theories aimed at undermining his legitimacy as president.Trump had been asked whether he now believes Obama was born in the United States as recently as last week and hadn't affirmed that position, until Friday. Christie also said it was ""an issue that Mrs. Clinton also injected"" into the 2008 Democratic primary against Obama, which is false. Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, stuck to a similar line in an interview with ABC's Martha Raddatz on ""This Week."" ""This is not what the American people are talking about. Donald Trump put this issue to an end yesterday in Washington, D.C.,"" Pence said. He also declared birtherism ""over"" and denied Trump has any responsibility it. ""Throughout this campaign, he hasn't been talking about it,"" Pence said. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, blamed Trump for ""an incredibly painful five-year chapter."" ""When Donald Trump says the first African-American president is not a citizen, that is so painful to so many people who still have deep feelings about that dark chapter in American life,"" Kaine told Tapper later on ""State of the Union.""""And he either believed what he said for five years, which showed that he's either incredibly gullible or conspiratorial, or he didn't believe it, in which case he was just trying to prey upon people's darkest emotion,"" he said. And Kaine deflected questions about whether Hillary Clinton's friend Sidney Blumenthal pushed birtherism quietly on the 2008 campaign trail. ""Sidney Blumenthal has categorically denied that, but Sidney's not running for president. Let's talk about Donald Trump,"" Kaine said. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway deflected questions about Trump's history of birtherism Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Host John Dickerson asked: ""Donald Trump advocated something for five years that was a lie. Why did he do that?""Conway said: ""Well, you're going to have to ask him. But, again, I think that this is a sideshow now that the media seem obsessed with, John, respectfully. And, again, he put everything out on the table on Friday. Those are his words. He does things on his terms, on his time line."" "	Chris Christie falsely claims Donald Trump hadn't talked 'birther' for years
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/17/politics/hillary-clinton-birther-conspiracy/index.html	"He did not apologize or speak to his own role in spreading the falsehood, which many people see as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of America's first black president. Instead, Trump offered a curt admission tainted by yet another demonstrably false charge: that Hillary Clinton and her 2008 primary campaign ""started"" the racially charged smear. Both FactCheck.org (working with CNN's Jake Tapper) and PolitiFact have refuted the suggestion on multiple occasions. But the revisionist telling that Clinton was somehow involved persists, thanks in large part to Trump. He has peddled it for years and is now promoting it to deflect attention from his own leading role in advancing the lie.Here's a look at the underlying disputes:Did Trump just conjure this allegation against Clinton out of thin air?Not exactly. The claim predates Trump's interest in promoting birtherism. One of the first documented questions about Obama's provenance came in early 2007, when the right-wing Insight Magazine reported that researchers with ties to Clinton's campaign were trying to make hay over his schooling during the years he lived in Indonesia. The Clinton team denied this. The rumor was that Obama attended a madrassa, or Muslim religious school. The connotation, at least at the time, would be that he had been educated in Islamist or radical anti-American ideology. But even then, there was no suggestion Obama had been born outside the US.What have Clinton and her allies said publicly about birtherism?There is no evidence that Clinton in 2007 or 2008 bolstered, supported or much less ""started"" the birther crusade.And in recent years she has repeatedly blasted it, calling the movement ""insidious"" in a speech to supporters during an NAACP dinner in May. Last September, speaking to CNN's Don Lemon on the ""Tom Joyner Morning Show,"" Clinton called the idea that she created the birther rumor ""ludicrous."" ""First of all,"" she added, ""(the birther claims are) totally untrue. And secondly, you know, the President and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that."" Going further back, President Bill Clinton in May 2010 denounced birtherism as a ""myth."" During their primary battle and shortly thereafter, before Obama nominated her to be secretary of state, Hillary Clinton mostly faced questions about Obama's faith. Her denunciations of that whisper campaign weren't quite as robust as her current language about Trump and the birthers, but she never elevated either falsehood -- and certainly was not to blame for starting them. But what about claims that top Clinton aides were involved?Proponents of this allegation tend to point to a memo, written by Clinton pollster Mark Penn, and a conspiratorial email forwarded by a pair of campaign staffers in 2007.Penn's internal note was titled, ""Lack of American Roots,"" and painted media reports about Obama's time as a child in Hawaii and Indonesia as having exposed ""a very strong weakness for him -- his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited."" He wrote: ""I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values.""However unsavory the sentiment, Penn, who is not working for Clinton's current campaign, did not at any point address Obama's birthplace.Clinton never pursued Penn's notion as a line of attack. Later in the year, the campaign dismissed two staff members in Iowa who passed along an email that cast Obama as a Muslim agent bent on ""destroying the US from the inside out."" ""Our campaign does not tolerate this kind of activity or campaigning,"" spokesman Mo Elleithee said at the time. ""As soon as it came to our attention, we asked (the second emailer) to step down."" On Friday, Clinton 2008 campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, denied outright any role starting the movement. The campaign also responded in 2008 to allegations, made by Matt Drudge, that ""stressed Clinton staffers"" were circulating a photo of Obama wearing a turban with a blanket denunciation. On Friday, the former Washington bureau chief for McClatchy, James Asher, tweeted that in 2008, Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal told him ""in person"" that Obama was born in Kenya. Blumenthal denied the claim to CNN's Dan Merica, saying Trump ""is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and bears the responsibility for it.""CNN has attempted unsuccessfully to reach Asher for comment. He told his former employer, McClatchy, Friday that he met with Blumenthal in 2008, and that the newspaper chain dispatched a reporter to Kenya to investigate. Nothing came of it. He said there already had been stories published with the allegation before that meeting.Some 2008 staffers told CNN that Blumenthal was not officially part of the Clinton campaign, and a CNN check of Federal Election Commission records shows no payment to Blumenthal from the campaign.What did she say about the birther allegations -- and their forerunners -- back then?In 2007 and 2008, the birther conspiracy mostly took a backseat to another bogus tale -- one that suggested Obama, a Christian, was secretly a Muslim. During a March 2008 interview with ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Steve Kroft, Clinton said she had no knowledge of the rumor promoted by Drudge. Kroft then asked, ""You don't believe that Senator Obama's a Muslim?""  This is a transcript of their subsequent exchange:Clinton: ""Of course not. I mean, that's, you know, there is no basis for that. You know, I take him on the basis of what he says. And, you know, there isn't any reason to doubt that.""Kroft: ""And you said you'd take Senator Obama at his word that he's not a Muslim.""Clinton: ""Right, right.""Kroft: ""You don't believe that he's a Muslim or implying? Right?""Clinton: ""No. No. Why would I? No, there is nothing to base that on -- as far as I know.""Kroft: ""It's just scurrilous --""Clinton: ""Look, I have been the target of so many ridiculous rumors that I have a great deal of sympathy for anybody who gets, you know, smeared with the kind of rumors that go on all the time.""But Clinton's use of five words -- ""as far as I know"" -- prompted outrage from many Obama supporters. Critics argued that they left the door open for unsavory innuendo.Could Clinton have been more forceful in pushing back on the rumors? Yes. Is there evidence that she or top campaign officials stoked the fire that Trump and assorted right wingers have openly and gleefully fueled in public for years? No.So why is Trump trying to blame birtherism on Clinton now?Trump's decision to backtrack on the birther issue -- and pin it on Clinton -- is likely a campaign tactical move designed to improve his standing with moderate voters who might be susceptible to charges that Trump is racist.According a CNN/ORC poll from September 2015, 80% of adults said they believed Obama was born in the US. Less than half of the dissenters chalked it up more to their suspicions than the presence of any legitimate evidence.The same survey found that 61% of Trump's own supporters did not subscribe to birther rumors, so the campaign likely considered that it had more to gain than to lose by dropping this as a wedge issue in his race against Clinton.

Grenier is the co-founder of the Lonely Whale Foundation, which promotes ocean health through education and awareness for marine wildlife.""We want to bridge the disconnect we have with the ocean and to have empathy,"" Grenier said in an interview at the State Department. ""Not just for whales but for all marine wildlife.""Grenier joined Kerry and 60 foreign ministers and leaders from the private and non-profit sectors for the conference. Fellow actor and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio addressed the group Thursday.It may seem more likely for Vincent Chase -- the A-list movie star Grenier played in ""Entourage"" and who starred in James Cameron's (fictional) blockbuster ""Aquaman"" -- to be an advocate for ocean conservation, than Grenier, who grew up in New York City and spent little time by the water.""I lived in a concrete jungle, and I think most people have the same experience -- they don't live near the water or their access to the water is not readily available,"" he said. ""The reality is these are all of our oceans. We need to protect them because they're ours and we can't protect them unless we feel connected to them. ""The foundation's mascot is Lonely Whale, a solitary whale which migrates along the West Coast calling out at a frequency no other whales can understand.""Imagine what that would be like for us if we couldn't connect with others in our species,"" Grenier said. He said he hopes that through the Lonely Whale's story ""people will connect with one another and bond with the oceans.""The foundation has teamed up with Dell to create Cry Out: The Lonely Whale Experience, a virtual immersive experience to let people feel what it is like to live under water and to appreciate what marine wildlife face every day.Grenier hopes that once people feel more connected to the ocean, they will care about what they throw out into it, such as plastic that soon will be populating the ocean at a rate greater than fish. He is currently on a crusade to end the reliance on plastic straws, asking waiters to skip the straw with his drink order and starting a #strawless campaign on Twitter.Next week, Grenier and billionaire philanthropist Richard Branson will swim 3.3 kilometers in the open ocean on the coast of Sicily, Italy, as part of Grenier's foundation's #MakeASplash campaign to raise money for ocean conservation.""We spend more money on space exploration than ocean research.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/17/politics/donald-trump-surreal-friday-press-row/index.html	"Donald Trump on Friday pulled off his latest media stunt, scoring more than 20 minutes of free live TV time to tout the endorsement of more than a dozen veterans and to talk up his new hotel in Washington after he and his campaign had promised he would address his longstanding, controversial ""birther"" position.Then, he made a 67-word statement stating that he now believes President Barack Obama was born in the US, and quickly abandoned the podium -- leaving reporters bellowing questions into the ether. None of us were surprised.After all, Friday's circus was nothing short of standard operating procedure for the real estate mogul and his media-bashing campaign -- and just the latest example of how Trump fueled his political rise through his unparalleled mastery of the media.But this time, there weren't just a few shouted questions from reporters. Instead, Trump stepped away from the mic amid a cacophony of cheering supporters -- more than 100 of whom separated Trump from the press -- and reporters, some standing on chairs, shouting dozens of questions at the top of our lungs.""When did you change your mind about Obama being born in the US?"" I shouted.""What took you so long to make this decision?"" shouted another reporter.""Why won't you answer our questions?""And then, he's gone. Trump had just changed a signature position he's held for years with a few dozen words and no explanation of why he had suddenly changed his mind. And he also notched 51 days since his last news conference.The moment was emblematic of Trump's treatment of the press throughout the campaign -- particularly in the last 24 hours.Reporters covering this campaign -- as I have for the last 15 months -- have long grown used to Trump lobbing insults our way, shouts of ""scum,"" ""dishonest"" and ""disgusting"" reverberating as thousands of his supporters, many of them snickering at the spectacle, turn toward the press pen, booing. Some of us have even come to expect a call from the would-be-president every so often to hear the candidate gripe about a particular article and shame us as ""dishonest.""But on Thursday night, Trump took his mistreatment of the press to new lows, taking the stage at a rally in New Hampshire moments before the traveling press corps' plane touched down in the state, and proceeding to mock us. ""I have really good news for you. I just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane. They can't get there. I love it,"" Trump said, to his supporters' glee. We arrived for the last three minutes of his speech -- a circumstance caused by Trump's refusal to travel on the same plane as reporters covering his campaign, defying decades of precedent in the coverage of Democratic and Republican nominees.Trump boasts about dumping traveling press corpsThe event on Friday was his coup-de-grace.Having promised a ""major statement,"" via Twitter, Trump talked up his hotel -- ""under budget and ahead of schedule"" -- and invited a parade of military veterans to come to the podium and tell the world why they were supporting Trump's presidential bid. The event was no longer about a Republican presidential nominee reversing his position on an issue supported by a fringe slice of America. It was about brave military men embracing this controversial figure, flaws and all.All the while, the cameras continued to roll, the remarks carried live on cable news in anticipation that Trump would clarify his position on birtherism as he had promised that morning.It's the kind of free, unfiltered media coverage that every politician dreams of, but few will ever grasp.Finally, after 28 minutes, Trump lifted the suspense and got to the point. He falsely claimed that his opponent Hillary Clinton ""started the birther controversy"" in 2008 and stated, matter-of-factly, that ""President Barack Obama was born in the United States"" -- something Obama proved beyond a shadow of a doubt in 2011 when he released his long-form birth certificate.He spent more time talking about his hotel than explaining how he was changing his position on the issue that skyrocketed him to national political prominence and earned him his earliest notes of support from the far-right.Trump laid his media trap the night before when his campaign put out a statement hours after a Washington Post interview published in which Trump declined to disavow his birther views. The interview took place a day earlier, but the campaign waited another day, until 12 hours before the event in Washington, to blast out a statement.It remains to be seen whether Trump's move helped him. CNN and Fox News cut away at points in the presentation. Networks spent the day talking about Trump's history as a birther.The Trump campaign had also previously billed a March campaign event as a possible news conference, only for the candidate to not take any questions. The event, which had been scheduled earlier, came just days after his campaign manager was accused of grabbing a reporter.Before Friday, the campaign's most recent deception came Wednesday when campaign advisers told reporters that Trump would not be releasing results of his latest medical exam on the ""Dr. Oz"" program. And then Trump did just that, with a reality show-style surprise.   As we filed into the event hall for his rally Friday night, we were still nowhere closer to understanding why Trump had suddenly flip-flopped on birtherism. The campaign had ignored all our requests for comment. We hadn't had an opportunity to prod Trump on the when and why of his sudden change of heart, especially when he had declined to disavow the position just days earlier.But as we awaited the familiar sound of Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the USA,"" a more ominous tune played instead.It was a song from Broadway's ""Les Misérables,"" the words ""Les Deplorables"" flashing on the screen above the stage, harkening to Clinton's comment about his supporters from earlier this month.I flicked at my iPhone, and powered on the video recorder.But moments later, Trump wondered aloud what would happen if Clinton's Secret Service detail were disarmed. And that was the news."	Donald Trump's surreal Friday, from press row

""That is a politically driven categorical declaration of a sort no president (or candidate) should make, and it raises the question whether she would pull out the 5,000 U.S. troops now in Iraq. She has expressed no new ideas to deal with the boiling caldron that is today's Middle East.""But, he wrote, Clinton can still earn his vote.""Mrs. Clinton has time before the election to address forthrightly her trustworthiness, to reassure people about her judgment, to demonstrate her willingness to stake out one or more positions on national security at odds with her party's conventional wisdom, and to speak beyond generalities about how she would deal with China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, the Middle East -- and international trade,"" he wrote. ""Whether and how she addresses these issues will, I believe, affect how many people vote -- including me.""Republicans use Gates' new book to hammer Clinton, BidenGates, who worked for eight presidents for more than 50 years, said the best commanders in chief hire advisers who aren't afraid to contradict their boss.""All of the presidents I served were strong personalities with strongly held views about the world,"" he said. ""But each surrounded himself with independent-minded, knowledgeable and experienced advisers who would tell the president what he needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear.""Sometimes presidents would take their advice, sometimes not. But they always listened,"" Gates wrote."	Robert Gates: Donald Trump 'beyond repair'
