The accusations including meddling in the 2016 election.The FBI keeps showing up this electionBut the government has stopped short of accusing Russia of trying to swing the election in a particular direction, and has also not formally accused Moscow of involvement in a hack of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta or of attempts to hack voter registration databases that have been detected. The FBI has kept a close lid on any information related to its investigation of Moscow's connection to the Trump campaign. Democrats are crying foul, since the FBI has made public in the campaign's final days that it is reviewing new emails related to its investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. The additional emails were uncovered in a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, in connection to a sexting scandal. As CNN first reported, the FBI has been examining for well over a year allegations about former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his firm and their connections to pro-Putin figures in Ukraine. That probe has also touched on other lobbying firms in Washington that were involved in Ukraine political work -- including the Podesta Group, the firm of Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta. RELATED: US accuses Russia of trying to interfere with 2016 electionThe FBI also has looked into alleged meetings former Trump adviser Carter Page had in Russia related to individuals under US sanctions. Among those who suggested the FBI investigate this possible connection was Sen. Harry Reid, the chamber's Democratic leader, who has made public a letter he sent to the FBI on the matter. So far the investigation hasn't yielded much beyond the initial claim. Page has denied any connection, blaming Democrats for raising the issue.""That is just so false that I don't even know where to begin,"" Page told CNN. ""Again, most of the accusations that have come have been sort of a downward circle ... bouncing back and forth between media accounts and stories that are planted ... by the Clinton campaign against me.""The FBI is also looking into allegations against Roger Stone, a Trump supporter, about a possible connection to WikiLeaks, which has been undergoing a complex six-year investigation.The accusations against Stone hinge on Democrats' claims that he conspired with WikiLeaks' Julian Assange to coordinate the distribution of hacked emails from Democratic Party officials. In one case, a Stone tweet foreshadowed damaging information for Clinton's campaign coming from WikiLeaks. RELATED: No, the presidential election can't be hackedStone told NBC News in October that he and Julian Assange have a ""mutual friend"" and said he has ""back-channel communications with WikiLeaks"" but denied accusations he's conspiring or coordinating with WikiLeaks.""They certainly don't clear or tell me in advance what they're going to do,"" he said.WikiLeaks has been releasing thousands of emails hacked from Podesta's private email account daily for more than three weeks. While Russia and WikiLeaks have denied any coordination, a private security firm has linked the same Russian hackers who broke into the DNC to a phishing email received by Podesta.  The FBI and Justice Department have encountered difficulties with the WikiLeaks investigation in part because of First Amendment protections for the website's publication of emails it has received. Receiving and disseminating hacked materials is similar to what news organizations do.  The FBI so far hasn't been able to prove that WikiLeaks is conspiring with Russian intelligence to steal materials. WikiLeaks refuses to make public its sources. Democrats cry foul on ComeySince FBI Director James Comey notified members of Congress on Friday that the bureau had discovered emails on one of Weiner's electronic devices that could be relevant to the Clinton server investigation, Democrats have accused him of political motivations.Reid has intimated without evidence that the FBI is concealing information that would link Trump and Russia, and other Democrats are disputing the idea that Russia is not trying to tip the scales for Trump.  ""You have to be willfully blind to say Russia is not trying to help one side over the other,"" California Rep. Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told CNN. ""The leaks speak for themselves. They are uniformly damaging Clinton, not Trump. And it's an effort to damage one candidate's campaign and American democracy.""But sources told CNN that at no point did Comey attempt to withhold publicly naming Russia as behind of election related hacks to avoid influencing the election, as some media reported. Comey did at one point broach with a smaller group of administration officials concerns with naming Russia but for other reasons, the sources added. One was that the FBI was working with the Russian authorities on various criminal cases and arrests and they did not want to compromise those investigations.  Additionally, US investigators were not yet ready to make a specific link between the Russian spy services and WikiLeaks. But at no time, according to sources, did Comey mention the election as being a contributing factor to his reticence. And the White House was opposed to naming Russia, as CNN previously reported, in part because of concern about the election and appearing to show favoritism. By the time Russia was publicly named as the culprits by the government, top FBI cyber officials as well as Comey were not opposed to the move, according to the officials.In the end, the statement pointing to Russia came from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, not the FBI."

The visit comes as military tensions are high both with North Korea over its nuclear program, and China, over its moves in the South China Sea.The Navy is making the public statement about the Pennsylvania in part to show its presence to allies and adversaries in the region.""This specific visit to Guam reflects the United States' commitment to its allies in the Indo-Asia-Pacific, and complements the many exercises, training, operations, and other military cooperation activities conducted between the US and its partner nations,"" the Navy said in its statement. ""Ballistic missile submarines such as USS Pennsylvania are on patrol continuously, providing a critical, stabilizing and highly effective element of the US nuclear deterrence force.""The Pennsylvania, one of 14 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines in the US fleet, carries 24 Trident II D-5 ballistic missiles, according to the US Navy. Each missile carries multiple warheads which can be programmed to hit different targets. 37,000 Japanese and US troops in drillsThe amphibious landings, meanwhile, are part of Exercise Keen Sword 17, involving 11,000 US and 26,000 Japanese troops. They will take place around Japan, Okinawa, Guam and the island of Tinian in the Northern Marinas.""Significant training activities during KS17 will include air and sea operations, integrated air and missile defense and ballistic missile defense in order to keep pace with the growing ballistic missile threat in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region,"" said a statement from US Forces Japan.Keen Sword has been held yearly since 1986 but this is the first year that it will include amphibious landings.""Amphibious operation training offers an opportunity to build bilateral interoperability in this area, and it supports Japan's developing amphibious capabilities,"" the US military statement said.The amphibious exercise comes amid tensions between Japan and China over the disputed island chain off China's east coast that Japan refers to as the Senkakus and China as the Diaoyus.Both countries have put the islands in their Air Defense Identification Zones and flights over and ship transits around the islands by both countries have been contentious.Keen Sword has already drawn reaction from Beijing, with a report posted on the website of state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV.)""Okinawa will stage a scenario in which the US is at war with a third party and Japan offers its assistance,"" the CCTV report said.""Analysts say this is to prepare Japan's Self-Defence Forces for involvement in similar situations,"" it added.The Japanese Self Defense Force said along with their 26,000 troops, 260 aircraft and 20 warships will be involved in the exercises.US Marines have deployed on Japan's 13,950-ton helicopter destroyer JS Hyuga, the flagship of the four-ship Japanese task force involved in the exercise, a US Navy statement said."

Clinton runs music festivals across America, and Trump heads up a cancer institute in Virginia.Their names have always raised some eyebrows, they say, but in an election year, it's getting them a whole lot more attention.Hillary Clinton, festival organizerHillary Clinton, a fun-loving twenty something from New Orleans, Louisiana, is quick to point out that she was not named after Hillary Rodham Clinton.  ""I am from Louisiana, she was the first lady of Arkansas,"" Clinton says, referring to when she was born.Not surprisingly, her Louisiana parents hadn't heard of the other Hillary Clinton at the time.Her father, Phillip, not Phil, Clinton, confirmed to us that her name is indeed a coincidence.Shortly after Hillary Rodham Clinton moved into the White House in 1993, Hillary's mother wrote to the first lady about her namesake. ""How interesting to learn of another Hillary Clinton!"" The first lady wrote back, ""Perhaps we will meet sometime in the future.""Name recognitionIt wouldn't be until 1998, when news of the Lewinsky scandal broke, that sharing a name with the first lady would become a problem for Hillary Clinton, a seven-year-old in elementary school at the time.""I didn't really understand what the act was that had happened, so the jokes didn't make sense to me and the attention was not attention I was looking for, so I actually changed my name for a few months,"" Clinton explained to CNN, sitting in the middle of Suwannee Hulaween, a music festival she helped organize over the Halloween weekend in Northern Florida.Part of her job involves liaising with performing artists and their agents.""My emails sometimes get ignored and I have to send multiple follow-ups.

""I get tagged in so many Hillary Clinton posts,"" Clinton says. ""Positive and negative memes and photos.""Her Facebook account has been suspended on multiple occasions, with the social network giant thinking her name a fake. She sent Facebook officials her driver's license some years ago but her account was again subsequently blocked.

Trump picked up the phone to ask Dr. Trump for a favor. The son of a close friend of his was hoping to get into a clinical trial at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, where Dr. Trump was working at the time.""I'm happy to say that neither Mr. Trump nor I had any impact on that decision. That process and the entry of the young man on the clinical trial was well underway when I received the call,"" Dr. Trump told CNN during an interview at the Inova Schar Cancer Institute in Virginia, where he now serves as CEO and Executive Director.Never one to miss an opportunity, Dr. Trump used the contact from Mr. Trump to tell him about some of the work performed at Roswell Park and explained to him that they would soon be holding a ""Bald for Bucks"" fundraiser.The Donald politely declined to part with his famous locks, but sent a video message wishing Roswell Park well and made a ""generous donation,"" Dr. Trump said.Sometime after the fundraiser, the two Donalds met at Trump Tower in New York.

The ceremony came amid a political controversy roiling the department and the FBI over the handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation. It would be times like this that Margolis, a fierce defender of the Justice Department, would play key roles to help lead efforts to protect the department from political tempests. Tuesday was the first time Comey was in the same room as some of his critics, including former Attorneys General Eric Holder and Michael Mukasey, and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, who sat across the aisle far opposite from Comey. Several of the former prosecutors who, along with Holder and Gorelick, recently signed a letter criticizing Comey were also in the room. There was no mention of the current controversies, and Comey didn't respond to reporters' questions after the ceremony.But Comey, Lynch and several of the other speakers mentioned the department's ideals of pursuing the rule of law no matter which political party is in power. ""We feel his absence in these hallways every day,"" Lynch told the audience in speaking about Margolis.Before and after the ceremony, the current controversy was discussed only on oblique terms. Many in the room were veterans of the Bush administration, including some who helped manage the department's most serious and damaging crisis in recent years: the controversy over the firings of US attorneys. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who was forced to resign in that scandal, didn't attend. "	Comey sits with critics at ceremony for late colleague	['Clinton', 'Lynch']	[]
7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-2016/index.html	"With Democratic nerves jangling amid tightening polls and the fallout of the FBI's email curveball in the final days of the election, Clinton is fervently trying to make the race about Trump's character and foibles -- not hers.Clinton has spent months emphasizing a message that Trump is morally and intellectually unfit for the presidency. The hope was that the strategy would deliver in the last days of the election, with wavering voters struggling with their conscience over a vision of the volatile billionaire in the Oval Office.But revelations that the FBI is reviewing a new trove of emails found on a computer shared by Clinton confidante Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner severely challenged that plan.Voters are now facing a torrent of media coverage focusing on the emails that probes not Trump's greatest vulnerability but Clinton's — long simmering suspicions about her character, record on transparency and honesty.And for now, Clinton is getting no help from Trump, who has reliably managed to torpedo his own political interests for much of the general election. But over the past few days, he's found some measure of message discipline amid his rival's woes.Character in the spotlightIt's an enduring cliche of the 2016 general election race that whichever unpopular, polarizing presidential nominee finds their character in the spotlight tends to suffer in the polls. And though there is not yet conclusive evidence the FBI email bombshell is directly wounding Clinton, it's clear that the race nationally and in battleground states is narrowing as Election Day approaches.FBI investigations into Trump-Russia ties yield littleThat leaves the Democratic nominee increasingly desperate to escape the spotlight.Clinton's efforts to eviscerate Trump intensified Tuesday with the release of a new ad in battleground states savaging his attitude towards women.The spot includes footage from the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" video in which Trump boasted about his sexual advances on women, includes footage of him saying ""putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing"" and of the GOP nominee's past remarks about women being flat-chested, ugly and fat.The ad, which will run in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, ends with a kicker that makes the case that anyone who says, does or believes such things is unfit to be president.Clinton followed up by appearing Tuesday with pageant contestant Alicia Machado, with whom Trump feuded much to his political detriment after the Democratic nominee highlighted his treatment of her in the first presidential debate.""Can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?"" Clinton said.The new offensive represents an attempt to preserve Clinton's advantage among women voters, a constituency that has been especially outraged by Trump and is vital to her hopes in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania. Exploiting other weaknessesClinton's campaign is also seeking to exploit other weaknesses lurking in Trump's past. Her campaign chief, Robby Mook, is pushing claims that the real estate magnate has nefarious ties to Russia and President Vladimir Putin.This strategy is a twofer for the Clinton campaign, which is also lambasting FBI Director James Comey, who ignited the new email drama, by arguing that he was less interested in releasing information about alleged Russian interference in the election than he is in raising Clinton's emails. The Clinton case is such interventions that could sway elections are contrary to Justice Department practice and precedent ahead of elections.""Why is it important to hold back information about Russians and it's not important to hold back information about a Democratic candidate for president?"" Mook said on CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday.""It is mind boggling and Director Comey needs to answer this.""The FBI has been conducting multiple investigations of alleged connections between Russia and Trump, his presidential campaign or its backers. But none so far have yielded proof of criminal connections between the parties.Clinton campaign accuses FBI of 'blatant double standard'Clinton's allies are also ratcheting up scrutiny on Trump's character.Her Super PAC, Priorities USA, is also slamming Trump over his attitude towards women. It places Clinton in the context of female pioneers like Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks and Sally Ride, then juxtaposes those images with offensive remarks by Trump and asks ""How does he make you feel?""Vice President Joe Biden is also hitting Trump's character, saying in South Carolina Tuesday that the Republican nominee is the epitome of the abuse of power.""This is a guy who for 1,000 reasons is unfit to be president,"" he said.Biden's jab dovetails with a stark Clinton campaign ad released on Monday featuring Monique Luiz, who at the age of three played the young girl in the iconic 1964 ""Daisy"" ad that played on anxiety over nuclear war, to question Trump's ability to handle nuclear weapons.""The fear of nuclear war that we had as children, I never thought our children would ever have to deal with that again. And to see that coming forward in this election is really scary,"" Luiz said.Late Monday, Clinton fleshed out the theme at a rally in Ohio.""Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin,"" she said. ""I hope you will think about that when you cast your vote in this election.""Challenge for Clinton campaignThe challenge for the Clinton campaign, however, is penetrating the wall of coverage the email saga appears to be driving during the closing days of the general election campaign.Some Democrats argue that many Americans have already made up their minds about the controversy over her private email server, and anyone likely to be swayed now probably wasn't voting for her anyway.But the issue cuts to the heart of Clinton's campaign argument — that she and not Trump is fit to be Presidept, because it allows her rival to make the case that her judgment — as revealed by the handling of potentially classified information — is not all it's cracked up to be.Hillary Clinton ad grills Trump on women, characterA new Gallup poll released Tuesday suggested that Clinton will be pushing on an open door if she can get the attacks on Trump's fitness to lead to resonate among undecided voters.Fifty-one percent said that Clinton had the personality and leadership qualities a president should have. But only 32% said the same of Trump.Clinton used such perceptions to anchor her performance in three presidential debates over Trump and during her party's convention Philadelphia in July.But deprived of such mass viewership events, it is harder for her to drive the point home in the first week of November — especially with the frenzied media coverage of the campaign end-game focusing heavily on her email furor. Trump plunged in the polls after the presidential debates, where he often came across as uninformed, angry and disrespectful to Clinton. But his standing his recovered since. He's down just 4 points in the latest CNN Poll of Polls. Trump is also improving his position in some battleground states though still faces a steep uphill climb to amassing the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.But for once, Trump seems not to be hurting himself.Throughout their duel for the White House, he has repeatedly detonated controversies and stomped over his own campaign message to the detriment of his interests.Deep behind Democratic lines in Michigan Monday, Trump was relentless in driving his attack that Clinton was finally being held to account for her email server.He also painted a picture of a future Clinton administration mired in investigations, scandals and legal proceedings that would be familiar to anyone who lived through the 1990s.""If Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation, likely followed by the trial of a sitting president,"" Trump said in Michigan. ""Hey, this is just what we need. This is just what we need.""""She's going to have bigger problems than bringing your jobs back,"" he said."

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/obama-white-house-records/index.html	"On Tuesday, the White House began the laborious process of transferring all of President Barack Obama's records -- his memos, his letters, his schedules, and, yes, his emails -- to the National Archives, which under federal law takes ownership of the documents when Obama leaves office.At the downtown Washington Archives headquarters on Tuesday, uniformed US service members were busy loading palettes of cardboard boxes stuffed with Obama administration records onto orange forklifts. The boxes, which were carefully catalogued with green slips of paper and wrapped in clear plastic, were shuttled from a loading dock and into the back of a white Ryder moving van, which departed the building destined for a secure warehouse. Like presidents before him, Obama is leaving office with the story of his presidency boxed and ready for the history books -- at least the parts that aren't declared top secret or otherwise unsuitable for public consumption. George Washington had his diaries and letters hauled off in wagons to Mount Vernon, where he could consult them in the privacy of his own study. The National Archives got involved after Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, managing the deceased chief executive's papers at his library in Hyde Park, New York. The Presidential Records Act in 1978 declared all presidential and vice presidential records property of the federal government, with ""custody, control and preservation"" of the records delegated to the National Archives when a commander-in-chief leaves office. That means hundreds of millions of records must be transferred from the White House to the Archives before Obama finishes his term. The physical material will go from Washington into temporary storage at a secure warehouse in the greater Chicago area, before eventually being moved into Obama's presidential library, due to be erected on the city's South Side.In past administrations, that handover involved secure 18-wheeler trucks -- pulled directly to the White House South Portico -- to load up boxes upon boxes of carefully filed material. Ronald Reagan's administration established a computer cataloguing system that allowed officials to quickly access any records they needed while the president remained in office. Because the Reagan library was situated across the country in Simi Valley, California, military cargo planes were employed, packed full of records and emptied at air bases in Southern California. Trucks escorted by police deposited the records at the storage site. Also included in the handoff: the tens of thousands of gifts Obama has received over his eight years in office, which, like the documents and records, officially remain in the ""complete ownership, possession and control"" of the government. For Obama, that includes millions of dollars in jewels from the Saudi royal family, a surfboard from the prime minister of Australia, and several ceremonial weapons from various world leaders. Officially, Obama isn't allowed to receive gifts unless they're small and inexpensive. But diplomatic protocol disallows him from turning down, say, a floor-length cape from a Saudi prince. Unless Obama is willing to cough up the $40,000 pricetag for that cape, it remains US government property, packed up along with his other records and sent to the National Archives.Some gifts remain at the White House -- like the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, which was a gift from Queen Victoria. The vast majority (including, probably, that cape) are packed away and kept with museum-like care by the Archives staff. Every administration finds itself confronting a new type of record that must be catalogued and kept for posterity. Reagan's White House was the first to use email. Bill Clinton's administration developed a website whose 1990s-era simplicity can still be enjoyed today. What happens to the tweets?For Obama, the advent of social media -- by its nature, an ephemeral take on a certain moment in time -- means new ways of preserving records. On Monday the White House's deputy chief digital office wrote that all of the administration's social media posts -- ""From tweets to snaps"" -- would be maintained for posterity. ""All of the material we've published online will be preserved with (the National Archives) just as previous administrations have done with records ranging from handwritten notes to faxes to emails,"" the official, Kori Schulman, wrote in a post on the White House website. She also said President Obama's twitter handle, @POTUS, would automatically transfer to his successor, but that his own previous tweets would live at the handle @POTUS44. Similar archived accounts will be set up on Instagram and Facebook, and the White House said it would make all of their social media content available in a downloadable file."
