But he said Wednesday the results were clear and that Trump ""just earned a mandate"" from the voters.More than 70% of voters said the country was headed in the wrong direction, Ryan said, and they picked Trump and the Republicans to alter that course.""The opportunity is now here, the opportunity is to go big, go bold and do things for the people of this country,"" he said.  Ryan and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, another Wisconsinite, played a critical role in cracking the fabled ""Blue Wall"" that Hillary Clinton in the Rust Belt and subtly played up his own role in helping Trump Wednesday morning. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will return as the leader of the Senate after Tuesday's results, began fielding questions about the most pressing items likely to face lawmakers and Trump as they take control of the government in January. McConnell, who led a blockade against President Barack Obama's selection of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, would not say Wednesday how he would react if Senate Democrats used the same strategy against Donald Trump's pick for the high court. ""The new president will fill the vacancy, I expect it to be handled in the way these court appointments are handled and I would not anticipate any particular strategy the Democrats might employ,"" McConnell said. McConnell, like Ryan, had a frosty relationship with Trump throughout the election would not say Wednesday how he would vote on Trump's signature border wall if legislation was sent to the Senate. ""I want to try to achieve border security in whatever way is most effective,"" McConnell said. McConnell and Ryan also said repealing Obamacare was in their sights, and would be a top priority for the new Republican-led government. But McConnell also cautioned that the Democrats' push for health care and other priorities when they were in a similar situation eight years ago, is what led to them overreaching and, ultimately, a voter backlash beginning in 2010. ""I think overreaching after an election, generally speaking, is a mistake,"" McConnell said."	Paul Ryan says Trump will lead 'unified Republican government'	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'McConnell']	[]

Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too. Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country. But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. (APPLAUSE) I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them. (APPLAUSE) Now -- and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear; making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams. CLINTON: We've spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone -- for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone. (APPLAUSE) So now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. (APPLAUSE) It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate. (APPLAUSE) To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. (APPLAUSE) We -- we thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world. And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most -- even four-month-old Aidan who traveled with his mom. I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country. (APPLAUSE) You poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted. (APPLAUSE) And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites... (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) ... I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward. (APPLAUSE) To everyone who sent in contributions as small at $5 and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us. And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too. This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: It is -- it is worth it. (APPLAUSE) And so we need -- we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives. And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. (APPLAUSE) Now, I -- I know -- I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. (APPLAUSE) And -- and to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams. Finally... (APPLAUSE) Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. (APPLAUSE) Because, you know -- you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart."" So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do. I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.

""That bothers me.""Currently, only five allies meet the 2% threshold. NATO officials have long-called on the member states to boost their defense budgets, while also noting that NATO's European states have increased spending and that several countries plan to hit that target in the coming years.Stoltenberg agreed Wednesday that the issue of defense spending was ""fair to raise,"" though he noted that European countries are now ""stepping up and spending more on defense.""Trump has also hammered away at NATO because ""they do not focus on terror.""He said at September's presidential debate, ""I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us.""Stoltenberg was quick to push back on this notion Wednesday, saying NATO plays ""a key role in the fight against international terrorism.""He noted the only time NATO invoked its collective defense clause was after the terrorist attacks on September 11 and pointed to the NATO operation in Afghanistan, which he called the alliance's biggest, and the recent deployment of NATO's surveillance aircraft to aid the fight against ISIS.""We are in Afghanistan to fight terrorism to prevent Afghanistan becoming a safe haven for international terrorists,"" Stoltenberg said.And NATO announced Wednesday a new naval mission aimed at patrolling the Mediterranean Sea, with counter-terrorism of the core tasks.At the same time, in recent weeks, Trump has also struck a more conciliatory tone towards the 28-member defense alliance at points, saying ""I'm all for NATO,"" during September's debate.Stoltenberg alluded to the President-elect's recent praise of the alliance while speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, saying, ""Donald Trump has clearly stated that he is a big fan of NATO and that has been the case for all American Presidents.""But Stoltenberg's reference to the ""rock-solid"" American commitment to collective defense appeared to push back on comments made by Trump in July, where he seemed to imply that the US should not come to the aid of a NATO member that's attack if the country is not meeting its commitments.Trump was criticized by members of his own party for the comments.But Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally whose could play a role in the Trump administration, went even further.The former speaker of the US House cast doubt on whether Washington should defend some of NATO's eastern members, like Estonia, from Russia.""I'm not sure I would risk a nuclear war over some place which is the suburbs of St. Petersburg,"" Gingrich told CBS' ""This Morning"" in July.Perhaps as part of a bid to clear the air, within hours of Trump's victory, Stoltenberg said he looked forward to meeting Trump, welcoming him to Brussels for next year's NATO summit and to discussing ""the way forward.""But what is not clear is what such conversations will look like given Trump's past criticisms of the bloc.NATO has also made efforts to bolster its presence in Eastern Europe as part of an effort to deter Russia after Russian troops annexed Crimea in 2014.While these deployments, including a battalion of US troops to Poland, have been welcomed by the host nations, they have irked the Kremlin and Trump has made improved relations with Moscow a central theme of his foreign policy approach.On the other hand, Trump has praised some of NATO's more recent moves in bolstering its intelligence-sharing efforts, including the establishment of a new post, assistant secretary general for intelligence and security.""I think that's great,"" Trump said of the new post, saying that his criticism of the alliance helped drive its creation.NATO officials have long said the establishment of the new position was not tied to the US presidential campaign.Perhaps providing insight into Trump's thinking on NATO, Nigel Farage, one of the leaders of the UK drive to leave the EU who has appeared alongside Trump at rallies, told Britain's Express that while Trump was right to call on allies to boost defense expenditures, he backed the US staying in the alliance."

Roger Wicker also said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Hillary Clinton is victorious that President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland could get a vote before the end of the year, although top GOP leadership aides insist a nominee won't be confirmed until next year. In acknowledging Republicans would have to at some point allow a Clinton nominee to come up for a confirmation vote, Wicker also made clear GOP senators would not rush to embrace her first picks if the individuals were considered too liberal or out of the mainstream.""I think at some point a president puts a nominee forward that can be confirmed,"" Wicker told CNN in an interview. ""Maybe not the first one or the second one but at some point the president gets to put someone on the Supreme Court.""""That's why this race is so important, this race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,"" said Wicker, who as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee is a member of the Senate GOP leadership. Wicker was upbeat about the chances of Republicans, who currently hold a 54-46 seat advantage, to maintain their majority in the new Congress, although he declined to make a prediction about what the final numbers might be.  He acknowledged that some of his Senate candidates have been challenged by having Trump, the controversial Republican presidential nominee, at the ticket, and said he expects some of those senators to run ahead of the real estate mogul.RELATED: Viewers' guide: Who will control the Senate?""I think in some states there will be split-ticket voters,"" such as in Florida where GOP incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio is in a tight battle for re-election, he said. ""But for example the better Trump does in Florida the better Marco Rubio does. I think Marco Rubio will run ahead of Trump but their fates in many ways are tied together.""On the question of a long-term filibuster over Supreme Court nominees, three Republican senators -- Richard Burr of North Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Ted Cruz of Texas -- have in different forms mused about not filling the vacancy on the court over the four or eight years Clinton might be in office. But other GOP senators -- like Jeff Flake of Arizona and David Perdue of Georgia -- have said such a position would untenable. Wicker said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if top Republican leaders decide if Clinton wins to take up during a lame duck session the long-stalled nomination of Garland to the court.""I wouldn't rule it out as a matter the leadership might decide to take up,"" Wicker said. ""I haven't spoken to them about it.""There has been much speculation the GOP-controlled Senate could act on Garland after the election to allay fears Clinton might pick a younger and more liberal replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his aides have been resolute that a justice won't be confirmed until next year. There also has been speculation that if Democrats take control of the Senate, they might try to confirm Garland after the new Senate is sworn-in in early January but before Clinton takes the oath of office on January 20. Realistically, that could only happen if Clinton said she wanted Garland on the court. And such a fast-track move could anger Republicans who could take procedural steps to draw out the process, possibly until after Clinton is sworn-in.If that were to happen, Clinton would have to re-nominate Garland and begin the process anew.RELATED: Remember Merrick Garland?

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/congress-balance-of-power-2016-election/index.html	"In a year when the GOP was almost entirely on defense, the party's incumbents -- many outspent and hobbled by struggling campaigns -- managed to survive a political landscape that long appeared all but certain to cost them the Senate.Democrats believed they had the perfect mix: Near-locks in blue Illinois and Wisconsin. Top-grade recruits in red states Indiana and Missouri to get them close. And Donald Trump would drag down Republican incumbents in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and North Carolina.Then, on Tuesday night, everything went wrong for them. The biggest surprise is that Trump was no drag on the GOP ticket at all -- and might have even helped carry the party.Trump's margin of victory matched or exceeded those of Todd Young in Indiana and Sen. Richard Burr in North Carolina. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who embraced Trump despite expectations the GOP nominee lose his historically Democratic-leaning state, surged late in the race and benefited from Trump's stunning performance there. Incumbents Roy Blunt in Missouri and Pat Toomey won as well, CNN projects.As of 3 a.m. ET, Republicans held 51 seats to 47 for the Democrats.The Democrats' lone bright spots were knocking off Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk and holding retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's seat in Nevada with a victory by Catherine Cortez Masto. There is still a chance in New Hampshire, where GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democrat Maggie Hassan were neck-and-neck at votes were still being counted.But there's nothing that will lessen the sting for Democrats. The Republicans easily held the House, and on a night party officials were confident they'd tip the balance of power in the Senate, Republicans not only remain the majority party -- but appear to head into the 2018 midterms with a map so favorable that a filibuster-proof, 60-seat supermajority is within reach.Election results 2016The magnitude of the GOP's down-ballot victories was stunning. Its incumbents held seats most Republicans began the 2016 election cycle assuming were lost in some states and overcame weak campaigns in others.In Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio -- whose late decision to seek re-election after his failed presidential bid was a boon to the GOP's chances of keeping the Senate -- will best Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, CNN projects. Republican Sen. Rob Portman will also win re-election in Ohio, CNN projects. He ran what's likely the best Republican campaign of the cycle -- turning what was expected to be a close race with Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland into a likely blowout.Indiana delivered major a blow to Democrats' hopes. Former governor and senator Evan Bayh's late entry was expected to turn the state into a guaranteed pickup -- but scrutiny over his residency and lobbying work catapulted Republican Rep. Todd Young to victory, CNN projects.Democrats picked off one of the five seats they need when Tammy Duckworth defeated Republican Sen. Mark Kirk in Illinois. That race was always a challenge for Kirk, who won Illinois in the 2010 Tea Party wave in the mid-term elections.Control of the Senate will be key to the early successes of a Trump administration. In theory, controlling Congress and the White House will let the GOP swiftly pass legislation that reverses many of Obama's policies.Republicans holding their ownRepublicans faced a daunting task at the outset of the 2016 election cycle: They held 24 of the 34 seats on the ballot -- meaning many more to defend. But strong GOP candidates have helped the party pull some contests in presidential swing states off the board such as Florida and Ohio.In Florida, Rubio's loss in the presidential primary turned out to be the GOP's gain, as he held on to that seat. Two other former GOP presidential candidates also won their Senate re-election bids, CNN projects. Sen. Rand Paul won in Kentucky, as did 2008 nominee John McCain in Arizona.In Georgia, Sen. Johnny Isakson was struggling earlier in the year, but he will defeat Democratic challenger Jim Barksdale, CNN projects.Two more Republicans who were expected to be safe -- Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt and North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr -- found themselves in closer races than expected.In North Carolina, Burr's late fundraising start -- combined with the Clinton campaign's focus there -- allowed Democrat Ross to turn the state into a toss-up, but he won impressively.And in Missouri, Secretary of State Jason Kander has run one of the strongest Democratic campaigns -- punctuated by a TV spot that featured the military veteran rebutting attack ads from the National Rifle Association by assembling an AR-15 rifle while blindfolded. But it doesn't appear to be enough to defeat Blunt.Blame Comey?Clinton's recent troubles, including the late focus on her email server, may have hurt Democrats down ballot.House Democrats remain frustrated with FBI Director James Comey, who made a revelation 11 days before the election that the bureau was once again looking into emails potentially tied to its investigation of Clinton. Democrats believe his announcement provided down-ballot Republicans an opportunity to shift topics and attack Clinton, rather than defend Trump.Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that Comey ""became the leading political operative in the country -- wittingly or unwittingly.""Pelosi blamed Comey for costing Democrats a shot at winning Republican seats across the country, saying he created ""more of an obstacle that we hope to overcome"" but adding, ""it's difficult."""

Continetti, who is also a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard, said the voters who are now behind the real estate mogul's presidential bid are among the same supporters who backed Ross Perot in 1992 -- another political outsider who ran on a message of fighting free trade efforts.""They were the ones who were cheering Sarah Palin the loudest in 2008,"" Continetti said. ""They were there, the core of the tea party in 2010. And now they're for Donald Trump. So you just see a very populist movement at the heart of the Republican Party that is open to radical solutions to America's problems."" He said that a key moment that energized the voting bloc behind Trump was in reaction to the federal government's handling of an influx of migrant children from Central America in summer 2014. In November 2014, following losses in the midterms, Obama announced a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system based on executive action. Aspects of his plan have been blocked in federal courts.    ""I think for many voters, many Republican and many conservative voters, they said, 'What is this? The system is rigged. We need to look for an outsider to blow it up, because we don't like (where) our country is headed.'""
