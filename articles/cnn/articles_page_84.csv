""I will keep you in suspense,"" he added. The comment left many observers stunned, raising concern that one of the bedrock principles of American politics -- a peaceful, undisputed transfer of power based on the will of the voters -- could be undermined should Hillary Clinton win. Conway insisted there was nothing extraordinary about what Trump said, pointing to the dispute following the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George W. Bush as a precedent.""Everybody, including Al Gore in 2000, waits to see what those election results are,"" Conway said. In that instance, Gore's fate was in the hands of an automatic recount, according to Florida state law due to the narrow margin of Bush's lead. Gore did not question the integrity of the election before Election Day.Trump's recent rhetoric about the integrity of the election runs in contrast to other members of his campaign, including Conway, who said this week that she doesn't back the candidate's claims of widespread voter fraud. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, have also both said that Trump will accept the results.""His campaign manager, his running mate, his daughter, we've all said the same thing,"" Conway said Thursday on CNN. Pence told CNN's Wolf Blitzer before the debate, ""We'll certainly accept the outcome of this election.""Clinton's running mate Tim Kaine said Thursday that although he expects Trump ""to whine if he loses."" ""Whether or not he concedes is probably irrelevant. The question is, is the mandate clear on the 8th of November?"" Kaine told ""New Day"" host Alisyn Camerota.""Donald is still going to whine if he loses, but if the mandate is clear, I don't think many people will follow him. And you know, it's just this inability to accept responsibility is at the core of this. But that trait of our democracy is so critical,"" he said."

No puppet,"" Trump shot back. ""You're the puppet. No, you're the puppet.""Clinton had been seeking to deflect from the substance of hacked emails posted online by Wikileaks -- a theft US government says Moscow likely carried out -- by putting the spotlight on Trump's past praise of the Russian leader.""You encouraged espionage against our people,"" she said. ""You are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list: break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do. ""You continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race.""Trump didn't accept the conclusion that Russia was responsible for the hacks.""She [Clinton] has no idea whether it's Russia, China or anybody else,"" he said. ""I am not quoting myself -- I am quoting 17 intelligence [agencies]. Do you doubt 17 civilian and military intelligence agencies?"" Clinton asked Trump.""Our country has no idea, Trump said.Listen to the full exchange belowTrump's position is similar to what he said in the first debate: it could be Russia, China or a ""400 pound hacker"" -- among others -- could be responsible for the attack.Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable conflictRussian officials have publicly denied a role in the attacks.Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the accusations baseless in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour."

He was arrested in late August, but his case was only made public earlier this month. In its filing Thursday, the government said they may bring charges against Martin beyond those he currently faces, including violations of the Espionage Act. Before his arrest, Martin worked as a contractor to the National Security Agency through consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, which fired him after he was charged. He has a long history working with sensitive government intelligence, and served in the US Navy and Naval Reserves for more than 10 years, reaching the rank of lieutenant. In a filing from prosecutors Thursday arguing that Martin should be kept in custody until his trial, the government alleged there is ""overwhelming"" evidence that Martin committed the crimes. NSA contractor charged with stealing intelligence""Throughout his government assignments, the Defendant violated that trust by engaging in wholesale theft of classified government documents and property -- a course of felonious conduct that is breathtaking in its longevity and scale,"" prosecutors wrote. A hearing on Martin's detention is set for Friday.The filing contained more detail on the thousands of documents prosecutors say they found in Martin's home and vehicle -- which they say was parked in the open and used to drive around members of the public as it contained top secret documents. The information he had digitally, the feds said, was equivalent to approximately 50,000 gigabytes, enough to store 500 million documents containing images and text. Martin had classified information dating from 1996 to 2016, the government said, including a document ""regarding specific operational plans against a known enemy of the United States and its allies."" That document was not only classified but marked need-to-know only, and Martin should not have been privy to that information, prosecutors said.  Also found were files containing personal information of government employees, and an email chain with ""highly sensitive information"" on the back of which were handwritten notes ""describing the NSA's classified computer infrastructure and detailed descriptions of classified technical operations."" Prosecutors characterized the notes as seemingly intended for a non-intelligence community audience. Among the documents the FBI believes Martin stole were some detailing a hacking tool that the NSA developed to break into computer systems in other countries, law enforcement sources said when he was arrested. Documents detailing the tools were posted on the Internet in recent months, though no connection to Martin has been offered.  FBI investigators haven't concluded what Martin's motivation was for stealing the documents. So far, they don't believe he did it for a foreign country. The filing did note that Martin was skilled in internet anonymization, encryption and had used encrypted communications, though they did not say to what end. Prosecutors conclude that Martin is a serious risk if released. Not only is his alleged theft substantial, they wrote, but he represents a flight risk and would be a significant target for any adversary of the US now that his case has been made public. In a subsequent filing, Martin's attorneys argued he presents no flight risk, noting as the government does that he does not have his passport. Given that his wife and home are in Maryland and noting his military service, they said there was no reason nor legal basis to deny him bail. ""There is no evidence he intended to betray his country,"" they wrote. They also attached a list of individuals charged with similar crimes none of whom were detained prior to trial.

Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson received 2% support and the Green Party's Jill Stein, 1%.This latest survey was conducted from October 17-19, so it does not reflect either Trump or Clinton's performance in last night's debate.The majority of voters surveyed thought Trump and Clinton were dishonest and untrustworthy (Trump 51%, Clinton 59%). About 61% of voters believed the country was on the wrong track as opposed to 30% who thought the nation was heading in the right direction. Jobs and the economy were the most important issues among those surveyed (20%). Almost half (49% to 12%) felt less safe living in the US today than they were 5-10 years ago.The poll also found that Republican Sen. Rob Portman was 15 points ahead of Democratic opponent, Ted Strickland (46% to 31%).The Suffolk University poll surveyed 500 likely voters in Ohio from October 17-19 and has a margin of error of plus and minus 4.4 percentage points.

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/al-gore-george-bush-2016-election/index.html	"The Republican presidential nominee's top aides and surrogates, including daughter Ivanka Trump, running mate Mike Pence and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, have been less cryptic, stating clearly that the Republican ticket would accept the final decision.But the campaign, in an attempt to normalize Trump's unfounded claims of a ""rigged vote"" and ""large scale voter fraud,"" has begun to peddle an odd and misleading rationalization -- comparing Trump's promise during the debate to keep the country ""in suspense"" on Election Day and possibly after with the protracted 2000 recount fight.""Donald Trump has said, over time, if you take all his statements together, he has said that he will accept the results of the election,"" Conway told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day,"" ""but everybody, including Al Gore in 2000, waits to see what those election results are. You wait to see what the results are -- if they're verified, if they're certified.""But that comparison, as CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger put it later Thursday, ""is like an apple to an elephant. They are two completely different things.""To start, as Borger noted, Gore never suggested that the results were rigged before the 2000 election. Nor did he make the argument, as Trump has over and again and without a shred of evidence, that he was going to be or had been bamboozled by some amorphous band of electoral conspirators.The Trump camp has sought to deflect from that reality by claiming, as Conway did in her interview with Cuomo, that Gore in 2000 waited to see how the Florida tally played out before seeking to initiate the long recount.Gore did, in fact, withdraw his concession to Bush that night -- an entirely unbinding formality in any event -- after the gap between their totals dwindled, but he did not actively set off the crisis that followed. In fact, George Bush's own brother — then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush — wasn't sure that the television networks were correct in projecting Florida — and with it the presidency — for Bush.Karen Hughes, George W. Bush's communications director, told CNN in 2015, ""At the time (Al Gore) conceded, Jeb Bush was still over there on his computer and he was like 'I don't know what they're seeing. I don't know what numbers they're seeing. I think it's still too close.'""The younger Bush was correct, and the results got closer and closer.""It was an automatic recount at half of 1%,"" Borger explained. ""When Donald Trump talks about the legal suits and all the rest -- there was an automatic recount, but it was (top Bush recount adviser and former Secretary of State) Jim Baker who actually ended up taking this case to the Supreme Court.""And why did he do that?Because, as Baker explained in the 2015 CNN documentary ""Bush v. Gore: The Endless Election,"" the Florida Supreme Court was dominated by Democrats and more likely -- as they, in fact, did -- to green light a more extensive series of recounts.This would mean, in the parlance of the GOP, the Bush campaign had federalized a state issue, but as Baker says he asked uncomfortable Republicans at the time: ""Do you want to be ideologically pure or do you want to win?"" They chose the latter.In the end, Gore graciously recognized the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to put an end to the recount and effectively hand the White House to Bush, saying after the ruling in an address on December 13, 2000, ""I accept the finality of this outcome which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College. And tonight, for the sake of our unity of the people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.""And then, as CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash recalled Thursday, Gore carried out his duties as the outgoing vice president and president of the Senate by formally certifying the federal election results -- even as fellow Democrats pleaded with him to keep up the fight."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/presidential-debate-takeaways/index.html	"He'd gotten in some hits on Hillary Clinton and was well on his way to turning in his best performance of the three presidential debates. Then, he refused to say he'd accept the election's results. And he called Clinton ""such a nasty woman."" Any gains Trump had made were undone, and he blew his last big, nationally televised chance to broaden his base -- making a case to women, moderates and disaffected Republicans whose rejection has left him far behind in the national polls. Here are CNN's takeaways from the final debate of the 2016 presidential race: Trump refuses to accept election's outcomeThe integrity of the vote is the very foundation of American democracy -- and on Wednesday night, Trump was toying with it. Asked by moderator Chris Wallace whether he'd accept the election's results, he said: ""I will look at it at the time."" The answer was stunning -- and immediately became the one that would dominate all post-debate coverage. Trump repeatedly used the word ""rigged"" -- bemoaning media bias, inaccurate voter rolls and the FBI's decision not to charge Clinton over her use of a private email server. Pressed again on whether he'd accept the election's outcome, Trump revealed his motivations. ""I will keep you in suspense,"" he said. ""That's horrifying,"" Clinton shot back. It was the biggest moment of the night -- and perhaps of all three debates. By entertaining the idea that he'd refuse to concede the election if he loses, Trump guaranteed the topic would dominate in the precious few days he has left to catch Clinton. Bad spot for RepublicansTrump has put every other Republican on the ballot this November in yet another tough spot. This time, less than three weeks from the election, they'll be forced to decide between defending Trump and defending the integrity of the democratic process. They'll have to explain why Trump went somewhere even his running mate wouldn't go. Mike Pence told CNN's Dana Bash just an hour before the debate started: ""I've said before that we'll certainly accept the outcome of this election.""Afterwards, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump would accept the elections results ""because he will win,"" then left an interview when Bash continued to question Trump's statement.Trump's comments drew immediate rebukes from Republicans who have already rejected him. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Trump is ""doing the party and the country a great disservice."" Even conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, a reliably pro-Trump voice, wasn't having it. ""He should have said he would accept the results of the election. There is no other option unless we're in a recount again,"" she tweeted. Given Trump's propensity to fight with his fellow Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan, he may not care that conservatives are unhappy. But he needs Republicans to turn out on November 8 if he's going to win — and his party needs those same voters to keep control of Congress.'Such a nasty woman'Trump's biggest political challenge is his huge disadvantage with women.  But you wouldn't have known it when -- with minutes left in the debate -- he interrupted Clinton, leaning into the mic and saying: ""Such a nasty woman."" It was the culmination of a night of interruptions and asides that could alienate the very voters Trump needs most. ""Wrong,"" he said over and over. ""You can't,"" he said as Clinton described a plan. When Clinton attempted to interject during one of his answers, Trump held up his hand. ""Excuse me -- my turn,"" he said. Meanwhile, his insistence that the multiple women who have come forward accusing him of sexual assault since the second presidential debate left Clinton an opening to point out that his defense, used repeatedly at rallies, has been to suggest the women weren't attractive enough. ""Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like,"" she said. When Trump answered that ""nobody has more respect for women than I do,"" moderator Wallace had to admonish the crowd, which had started laughing. Trump always takes the baitEarly on, the debate resembled the policy battle you might hear in any other election — a surprising departure for the 2016 campaign. The two jousted over the types of justices they'd nominate for the Supreme Court. Trump defended gun rights; Clinton advocated for abortion rights.Trump landed some clean shots at Clinton, mocking her for turning a question about what a WikiLeaks hack revealed she'd said in a paid speech into ""a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders."" But Clinton poked and prodded Trump -- and once again, it worked. Over Trump's decision not to raise his proposed border wall in a meeting with Mexico's president, Clinton said ""he choked and then got into a Twitter war."" When Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin would rather deal with him than Clinton, she said: ""Well that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.""It was the beginning of Trump's slide. Soon, he made a big mistake -- telling Clinton she's ""been in a position to help"" solve problems for 30 years. ""The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't,"" he said. That teed up Clinton for a memorable answer. ""You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund, and I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings,"" she said. ""In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine,"" Clinton said. ""And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the 'Celebrity Apprentice.'""The results: A CNN/ORC instant poll found 52% of debate watchers viewed Clinton as the winner compared to 39% who felt the same about Trump.Trump's temperamentVoters' lack of faith in Trump's temperament and leadership capacity, polls show, are among his biggest political liabilities. On Wednesday he offered a glimpse at how he measures effective leaders. Trump praised Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad -- who has used chemical weapons -- as better than American leaders. ""He's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama,"" he said. He also continued to refuse to distance himself from Russian President Vladimir Putin -- or acknowledge that intelligence officials have said Russia is responsible for hacks into Democratic operatives' email accounts. ""This is not my best friend,"" Trump said. ""But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.""It was a window into Trump's thinking: Strength -- almost to the exclusion of all else -- is paramount, all challenges must be met and no slight can go without rebuttal.  It was the same thinking that led Trump to air his personal grievance with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the opening minutes of the debate -- and to weigh in when Clinton mocked him for complaining that when ""The Apprentice"" didn't win awards, Trump ""started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him."" ""Should have gotten it,"" Trump said. "	Third presidential debate: 5 takeaways
6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/supreme-court-2016-election-decision/index.html	"As things stand now, the suggestion seems remote. But with Donald Trump refusing to promise he will accept the results of next month's election, eyes naturally turn to the Supreme Court. The problem: there are only eight justices -- four nominated by Republicans, four by Democrats.So what happens if they split, 4-4?""That's the doomsday scenario,"" veteran Supreme Court advocate Carter Phillips told an audience this fall, responding to a hypothetical question about a candidate who suspected the election was rigged and went to the courts. Phillips explained that if the court were to deadlock it would mean the justices were left to simply affirm a lower court opinion.Election law expert Joshua Douglas of the University of Kentucky College of Law says that power could end up resting with the lower courts, including even a state supreme court consisting of judges who were elected in a battleground state.There are obviously a lot of ""ifs"" in the scenario, including the type of challenge and where it was filed. Douglas has written an entire law review article about the different mechanisms states use to resolve election contests. He makes the point however, that if high court were to split 4-4, they'd issue a slip of paper technically upholding a decision from another court.""So if 'Trump v. Clinton' came up in say, Florida, and the Florida Supreme Court decided it, and the Supreme Court of the United States took the case and deadlocked, the result would be affirming the decision of a state supreme court.""""At least with Bush v. Gore,"" he said, ""we had the highest judicial body in the country resolving the dispute and providing finality and certainty.""The 2000 Bush v Gore case was decided 5-4 along partisan lines, resulting in Al Gore conceding the race to George W. Bush later that day.Would Ruth Bader Ginsburg recuse herself?Here's another hypothetical. What if the issue were to go to a seven-member court?Supporters of Trump might ask the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to recuse based on comments she made last summer to journalists, which would leave only seven justices to decide the case. ""He is a faker,"" Ginsburg said in an interview with CNN's legal analyst Joan Biskupic. ""He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.""Ginsburg later issued a statement expressing regret for her comments.Stephen Gillers, a legal ethicist at New York University School of Law, told CNN in July that he thinks her comments would prevent her from sitting in the unlikely event of a Trump v. Clinton dispute.""A federal law requires all federal judges, including the justices, to recuse themselves if their 'impartiality might reasonably be questioned',"" Gillers said.Who would make the recusal decision? It would be up to Ginsburg.""It's her call"" Phillips said, noting there is no mechanism for anyone else to make that decision.Trump on Wednesday night called out Ginsburg at the final presidential debate. ""Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent,"" Trump said. ""And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.""He previously lambasted her in a tweet for her ""very dumb political statements.""  He added, in typical Trump Twitterese, ""Her mind is shot—resign!""Ginsburg didn't read the tweet apparently.""I'm not on Twitter, "" she told Yahoo's Katie Couric earlier in the month. Even if she were, she said, ""I think I would not have responded.""Spotlight on Garland nominationA 4-4 split would put the spotlight squarely on the fact that Senate Republicans have refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. Last term, the justices worked diligently to seek compromise in order to avoid splits.Would politics play a role in whether a Justice took up the case or ruled in favor of Trump? Would a justice, for example, hesitate to clear the path for a Trump presidency?""""We are not politicians,"" Justice Stephen Breyer said last term during a discussion at the Newseum. He was not speaking directly about 4-4 splits, but he said after 20 years on the bench he had not seen an opinion ""based on politics.""For what it is worth, Breyer, who dissented in Bush v. Gore, often talks about a silver lining in the opinion that might resonate with critics of Trump's comments.""I was in dissent,"" Breyer said on C-Span in 2008. ""I thought it was wrong."" But he added that what he thought was remarkable was that even though about half the country probably disagreed with the decision, ""everybody followed it.""""I consider that absolutely essential,"" he continued. ""We're 300 million people and we think 800 million things. If we are going to live together we better have a system of law."""	The Supreme Court's Election Day 'Doomsday scenario'

""Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them.""Obama also encouraged the crowd of about 1,800 at Florida Memorial University to take advantage of Florida's early voting, telling the audience in doing so they can reject what the President called Trump's ""dark, pessimistic fear-mongering."" ""Our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people,"" Obama said. On Wednesday night's debate Trump, answered, ""I will look at it at the time,"" when asked whether he would concede if he loses on November 8. ""I will keep you in suspense.""Trump also doubled down on Thursday in Ohio saying he will accept the results of next month's election as long as wins. Obama also used the opportunity while in Florida to weigh in on the close Senate race in Florida between Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy. ""Even Marco Rubio says there's no rigging of the vote,"" Obama said, ""Which I'd like to give credit for, except he's refuting the dangerous, unprecedented claims of a candidate he says he's still going to vote for!""Earlier this week, Obama released a new ad for the Democrat in the Sunshine State, the same week it was announced the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was puling money for ads for Murphy."
