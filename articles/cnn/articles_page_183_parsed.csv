The man who entered politics by leading the ""birther"" movement accused Clinton -- falsely -- of starting the narrative that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States.The Republican nominee has gotten plenty of attention for his trash-talking and bare-knuckle style. But he's also developed a sub-specialty: Rather than running from the words his opponents hurl at him, Trump seizes them, shakes them up and turns them around. It's a strategy that muddies stark differences between Trump and his rivals, and helps neutralize political vulnerabilities.""Whatever he does, he accuses everyone else of doing,"" Ted Cruz, whom Trump relentlessly attacked as a liar during the Republican primaries, said at a fiery press conference the morning of the Indiana primary in May. ""In a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying. He accuses everybody on that debate stage of lying. And it's simply a mindless yell."" Trump's birtherism culminated in 2011 when Obama produced his ""long form"" birth certificate showing he was born in Honolulu. But it didn't end there, as Trump still refused to recognize Obama was born in the US. On Friday, Trump tried to change the conversation.14 of Trump's most outrageous 'birther' claims -- half from after 2011""President Barack Obama was born in the United States,"" Trump said at the end of an event at his new Washington hotel. The boomerang: saying Clinton started the birther issue during her 2008 primary campaign against Obama.""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean,"" he said. Clinton slammed Trump's statement.""The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten,"" she tweeted Friday.Trump's GOP primary opponents also relentlessly pegged the brash billionaire with the same accusation as he sketched out, with little specificity, grandiose promises to rid America of all undocumented immigrants, send the economy roaring and force other countries to bend at the knee -- all while lowering the federal debt. And like with Clinton, Trump threw the attacks back.""Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions and only hatred and derision,"" Trump said Tuesday during a rally in Clive, Iowa.Businesses could pose conflicts of interest for a President TrumpAnd on a call with reporters Tuesday morning previewing a new policy proposal, a Trump campaign official accused Clinton of ""basically running a completely idea-free, issues-free campaign.""The attack is one Clinton has lobbed time and again at Trump.""Donald Trump offers no real solutions for the economic challenges we face,"" Clinton said in June. ""He just continues to spout reckless ideas that will run up our debt and cause another economic crash.""While Trump has delivered an increasing number of policy speeches offering more specifics on a range of issues, including one Tuesday night on paid family leave, Clinton and her running mate Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine last week released a 256-page policy book and the Democrats' campaign website lays out policy proposals to address 38 issues compared to eight on Trump's website.""Like a schoolyard bully who can't rely on facts or issues, Trump has only one way of responding to legitimate criticism of his own vulnerabilities: 'I know you are, but what am I?'"" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement to CNN. ""You could dismiss these actions as insecure schoolyard behavior but this man is running to be President of the United States.""The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.Over the past few weeks, Trump and Clinton have exchanged a volley of attacks on everything from the ""bigotry"" of each other's candidacies to the other's temperament to serve as commander-in-chief.Just a day after Clinton said in an interview that jihadists were praying, ""Oh please Allah, make Trump president of America,"" the Republican nominee fired back at his rival with ricochet-like reflex.""Oh boy would they (ISIS) dream of having her as president,"" Trump said Friday during a speech in Washington. ""Can you imagine? They dream about it every night having Hillary Clinton.""Hillary Clinton was not a birtherWhile Clinton has pointed to Trump's vitriolic rhetoric and quickness to fire off insults whenever he feels slighted, he has offered little evidence to back up his boomerang attack.This week, the real estate mogul repeatedly slammed Clinton as ""trigger-happy"" and ""unstable"" as the two sparred over national security and each other's fitness to be commander-in-chief -- returning a frequent attack of Clinton's.""Imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal,"" Clinton said during a speech in June in San Diego.""Do we want him making those calls -- someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism?"" Clinton continued. ""Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?"" One of Clinton's most persistent criticisms of Trump is his fitness to serve as commander in chief: that he lacks the ""temperament"" to be president.""I have the best temperament,"" Trump has said repeatedly at rallies raising Clinton's attack. ""She has bad temperament.""Trump, meanwhile, has returned the attack by pointing to Clinton's support for military interventions, including her vote for the Iraq War and her push for the US to intervene militarily in Libya -- both of which Trump publicly supported.As Clinton prepared to deliver a speech eviscerating Trump for legitimizing white supremacists and cozying up to far-right extremists, Trump responded in kind.""From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia,"" Clinton said last month in Reno, Nevada, slamming Trump for his ""steady stream of bigotry.""Trump's retort came just hours after the Clinton campaign released snippets of the biting speech.""Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future,"" Trump said during a speech in Jackson, Mississippi.Clinton, a Democrat who has forged deep ties with African-American leaders over her decades on the national political scene, has the support of more than 90% of black Americans, according to the latest polls.Trump's support with black voters is in the single-digits.

Prior to her role as Librarian of Congress, Hayden most recently served as the CEO of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore. ""The Library of Congress is our national treasure and with Dr. Hayden at the helm I know it is in excellent hands,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said at the swearing-in ceremony. Ryan also noted the praise that Hayden received for keeping the library open during times of unrest in Baltimore. Hayden was confirmed by the Senate on July 13 with a 74-18 vote after being nominated by President Barack Obama in February. Hayden's confirmation was among a number of nominations by Obama that has been stalled. Hayden's sat for weeks despite the Senate committee's unanimous vote recommending the Senate confirm her nomination, according to The Washington Post. Hayden is the 14th Librarian of Congress and has a 10-year term. ""Michelle and I have known Dr. Carla Hayden for a long time, since her days working at the Chicago Public Library, and I am proud to nominate her to lead our nation's oldest federal institution as our 14th Librarian of Congress,"" Obama said in a statement issued in February."

But I'm sick of pundits because they don't always have their ears to the ground. They don't always have their finger on the pulse of America. Many of them are getting their talking points directly from the campaigns. (That's great -- we need to know what each candidate is thinking/doing/arguing each day.) But oftentimes, these pundits are not sitting around the dinner tables, the laundromats, the pharmacy checkout lines and listening. I wanted to listen to real Americans with real issues.I wanted to specifically focus on the impact of the black vote. In 2012, African-Americans voted at a higher rate than non-Hispanic whites for the first time since the Census Bureau started reported voting rates for the eligible citizen population in 1996. I wanted to find folks with different political perspectives but who would feel comfortable to speak freely. I didn't want talking points. No sugarcoating. I wanted a smart, substantive conversation. So a few weeks ago, I made a single phone call -- to rapper/activist Michael ""Killer Mike"" Render.Killer Mike (because he likes to ""kill microphones"") and I met a few years back in our hometown of Atlanta. We were introduced by a mutual friend, and after Ferguson happened, I invited him on my show. He talked about being a black father in this country (and his police officer dad), why his rhymes intersect with politics and the reason he and his wife Shay bought a barbershop. (He wants to give back to his roots in Atlanta, employ young black men and empower them to achieve more.)Back to Mike and that phone call a few weeks ago. I knew Mike had access to a fun, fiery and somewhat sacred space in his community: a barbershop. And I had a feeling he had friends -- from diverse political backgrounds -- who wouldn't be camera shy.Our group included: Taj Anwar Baoll, a firefighter and urban farmer; Shelly Winters, a Harlem native who is wholeheartedly supporting Donald Trump; Jamida Orange, whose father marched with Dr. Martin Luther King; Kalonji Changa, a grassroots activist and local leader who won't be voting on the national level this year; and Christine White, an attorney who is all in for Hillary Clinton. And, of course, Mike, a former Bernie Sanders supporter who (and I don't think he'll mind my saying this) shed tears when Bernie bowed out.My takeaways -- this group is wary of both Trump and Clinton. They believe the Democrats do sometimes take their votes for granted. And despite the fact that photos of the first family proudly hang in their homes, as one woman put it -- ""we've absolutely given President Obama a pass!"" Our conversation ended with all six explaining to me why they feel empowered -- or as Taj put it, ""woke"" -- in 2016. Our conversation on (and off) camera was informative -- not to mention refreshing. No pundits or politicos here. Just Americans with a real responsibility: pulling the levers in less than eight weeks."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/paul-ryan-super-pac-donald-trump/index.html	"""There is uncertainty at the top of the ticket and we have a significant group of donors who want to make sure that the House is a firewall,"" Mike Shields, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund told CNN.Senate Republicans lean on Ryan to keep majorityAlmost doubling the amount they spent in the 2014 midterms, the group announced that so far it has invested $20.7 million in efforts to protect the majority during the 2016 cycle, including $10.7 million this month reserving for a second round of television and digital ad buys by the group in about a dozen House races. ""We're not done yet,"" Shields said.Multiple Republican sources told CNN the reason the outside group is pulling in more money this year is because donors are more comfortable with the wonky House speaker than the unpredictable billionaire nominee and want to ensure Ryan keeps his gavel. Some contributors who previously focused their attention on the presidential ticket are sitting out that contest and helping congressional candidates because of worries about the party's chances this fall. Since it was created in 2011 to support then-Speaker John Boehner, the House GOP super PAC has badly trailed its Democratic counterpart -- the House Majority PAC -- in fundraising. In the 2014 midterms House Majority PAC raised $38 million to CLF's $11.6 million. Earlier this summer the House Majority PAC announced it was already near the $20 million mark so these latest numbers show that CLF is trying to stay competitive.Shields said that the group has also benefitted from its close ties to Ryan. Those who have given to Ryan's own political entities have also given money to the speaker's super PAC because the group bolsters his ability to remain the party's top agenda setter. The speaker's work on his policy agenda, dubbed ""a Better Way,"" helps with attracting support from donors, who want some real answers to what the party will do and are frustrated with Trump's lack of specifics.    The new numbers announced by the GOP super PAC will be welcome news to the National Republican Congressional Committee, which was outraised nearly 3-to-1 by the House Democrats' political arm in July.Many of the districts included in the latest ad buy are places where the Congressional Leadership Fund has already spent some resources. They include several open seats: in a district north of New York City where GOP Rep. Chris Gibson is retiring, in the suburban Philadelphia district where Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick is retiring, and likely the seat of retiring Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, who is running for Senate. The group is also investing in efforts to oust a couple of Democrats -- California Rep. Ami Bera and Nebraska Rep. Brad Ashford.They are also helping some Republican incumbents who Democrats are working hard to frame as Trump backers, like Texas Rep. William Hurd, New York Rep. Lee Zeldin, and Iowa Rep. David Young.The group's latest cash infusion will use micro-targeting to customize the messages in about a dozen House districts. Data gathered by two outside firms will allow the super PAC to craft ads that remind voters that whatever they think about the battle for president, there is a Republican candidate in their district who is speaking to the issues they care about.Despite some Republicans fretting Trump could hurt House Republicans, especially those with significant numbers of Latino voters, internal party polling in many competitive races shows that while Clinton is ahead of Trump, GOP candidates are outperforming their own nominee.Shields told CNN the goal is to invest enough money into districts where existing support can be reinforced closer to voting time and remind voters about congressional races, which haven't received as much attention as the presidential race. Referring to those Republicans in swing areas he said ""we can help them survive whatever happens at the top of the ballot and that's our mission.""Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told donors this summer that the Republican nominee is putting more seats in some suburban areas in play. The DCCC spent $1 million dollars in July in digital ads that argued several swing district GOP candidates were on board with controversial comments by the business mogul. But Shields argued that the Democratic presidential nominee is as much of a factor, and told CNN ""Hillary Clinton is a very easy target and we will tie her and her policies to the Democrats who are running for Congress."" It's also likely new ads will link Democratic candidates with their current top leader, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a tactic used regularly in recent House contests.House Republicans are dismissive of recent assertions from top Democrats, including last week from Pelosi, that Democrats could ride Clinton's coattails this fall to win back control of the House. But Shields acknowledged the public debate about the chamber being at risk -- something no one seriously believed was possible at the outset of the cycle -- is helping his group bring in more money."

After spending $13 million on television, the PAC has not been airing advertisements for almost three weeks, per advertising records.The group did not respond to a request for comment on their advertising plans. It has purchased nearly $100,000 in four Pennsylvania markets so far: Pittsburgh, Wilkes Barre-Scranton, Harrisburg and Erie.Rebuilding America Now, led by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, has struggled to win over high-dollar donors ever since the departure of Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chief, who endorsed the group. And Mike Pence's campaign, who once praised the group ""one of the best ways"" to back Trump, has told CNN that he is now not assisting their efforts, though he did not explain why.Any revival of the PAC will be closely watched by Trump donors and Republicans eager to see a group that can support Trump on television, where he is still being badly outspent by Hillary Clinton's campaign. And the new ad campaign will shed light on how his main big-money group plans to portray the candidates in the final eight weeks.The group said in a strategy memo to donors earlier this month obtained by CNN that it now plans to focus on positive messaging, rather than the negative ads it had spent the summer blasting on the airwaves.The group did polling and found that spots stressing Trump's background and plans tested better than traditional attacks on Clinton, the memo said.""We can't burn down the same house twice: Both Clinton and Trump have unfavorable ratings we've never seen before,"" the super PAC's strategists wrote. ""If this campaign remains one in which we only match our negative ads against their negative ads, we will conduct WWI: Trench warfare where both sides struggle to move a few inches.""A rival Trump super PAC has largely taken that tack already: Great America PAC, which has concentrated on biographical, soft Trump spots and is beginning a $2.2 million television campaign this week.And there are signs that it is that group -- which originally had an ally in former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski -- is on the rise. Eric Trump, the candidate's son, attended a Great America fundraiser Tuesday held at a bar in Trump Tower, according to a source familiar with the event, perhaps signaling that Great America is now the super PAC of choice."

Early voting 2016: Where voting has already begun	[]	[]
6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/presidents-candidates-health-secrecy/index.html	"The Democratic nominee's pneumonia, diagnosed on Friday, wasn't disclosed for two days until questions swirled about her early exit from a 9/11 commemoration ceremony and a bystander in Manhattan tweeted footage of her stumbling.That's a big change from the pre-social media age, when presidents and White House hopefuls were able to keep their maladies under wraps -- or at least muted -- for considerably longer stretches of time. In 2016, it's a particularly sensitive issue in an already-raucous campaign featuring two candidates who are grandparents. Donald Trump, 70, would be the nation's oldest incoming commander in chief. Clinton, 68, would be a shade younger than Ronald Reagan was when he first took the oath of office.Which makes the Clinton campaign's non-disclosure about the pneumonia conspicuous.In the modern media age, ""Every time with an illness of a president -- or in this case a candidate -- the immediate reflex is to put out a reassuring statement,"" said John Milton Cooper, biographer of President Woodrow Wilson, who nearly a century ago spent his final year-and-a-half in the White House largely holed up from public view after suffering a stroke. Concerns over presidential health are so familiar that they've been fodder for popular culture, memorably dramatized on television in ""The West Wing."" Character questions about fictional Democratic President Jed Bartlet -- otherwise depicted in the series as a paragon of moral rectitude -- are laid bare by his cover-up of ongoing multiple sclerosis, including complicity by his physician wife.Back in the real world, not all presidential candidates have been fully coy and deceptive about their medical conditions. In 2008, Republican nominee John McCain gave select members of the media a limited glimpse at his medical records. Based on that, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta found the Arizona senator former prisoner-of-war in Vietnam, then 72, to be in good health. Here are highlights -- or arguably lowlights -- of less-than-candid approaches to health by presidents and would-be White House occupants.President Chester A. Arthur, 1883-84The 21st President was elevated to the nation's highest office from the vice presidency in 1881, with the assassination of President James Garfield. Expectations were low for Arthur, known primarily as a machine hack who had grown wealthy in a series of GOP patronage jobs. Arthur, though, surprised many once ensconced in the presidency. He reversed course and moved to assign government jobs to the most qualified applicants, not party insiders. He also held reasonably enlightened views for the day on treatment of minority groups and immigrants. But his probity didn't extend to health matters. In 1884 Arthur sought, unsuccessfully, the GOP nomination. He omitted that he had Bright's disease, a kidney ailment. By that point rumors about his health had already circulated. He had lost weight, appeared older, and struggled to keep up with the pace of the presidency, even in those more languid days. ""He's essentially dying, and he doesn't live very much longer,"" said David Pietrusza, author of numerous books about the presidency, White House races and other historical topics. Arthur died in 1886, about 20 months after the start of the presidential term he sought. President Grover Cleveland, 1893The only president to serve non-consecutive terms, Cleveland and his minions undertook one of the most brazen, but little-known, cover-ups of health in White House history.A former Erie County sheriff, mayor of Buffalo and New York governor, Cleveland won the presidency in a close 1884 contest but was booted from office four years later. He won back the prize in 1892, and Inauguration Day was likely his best moment in office. ""In the spring of 1893, just after he began his second term, Cleveland noticed what he called a 'rough spot' on the roof of his mouth,"" said Matthew Algeo, author of ""The President Is a Sick Man: Wherein the Supposedly Virtuous Grover Cleveland Survives a Secret Surgery at Sea and Vilifies the Courageous Newspaperman Who Dared Expose the Truth.""""His doctor diagnosed it as a cancerous tumor,"" Algeo said, via email. ""But Cleveland didn't want the public to know he was ill. At the time the country was mired in a depression that came to be known as the Panic of 1893. So Cleveland decided to have the surgery performed secretly, on a friend's yacht as it sailed from New York to Cleveland's summer home in Massachusetts. That was in early July 1893. The surgery was a success. It's also worth mentioning that Cleveland guarded his privacy very jealously, and he was loath to have the newspapers discussing his health.""Most disturbing, in hindsight, is the way Cleveland and supporters suppressed the news, Algeo said. ""There were rumors that the president was ill. But Cleveland's surrogates insisted that the president was suffering from nothing more than a toothache. They said he had had minor dental surgery. It took Cleveland several weeks to recuperate at his summer home.""""But at the time it was not all unusual for the president to leave Washington for the summer, so his absence from the White House aroused few suspicions. After he was fitted with a prosthetic device in the roof of his mouth, his normal speaking voice returned and he began appearing in public again. By the time he returned to DC in September, the story had more or less blown over. The truth wouldn't come out until one of the doctors wrote about the surgery in the Saturday Evening Post in 1917 -- long after Cleveland was dead.""President Woodrow Wilson, 1919-21Wilson was riding high in September 1919. One of the only Democratic presidents of his era, Wilson had led the nation through victory in World War I and hailed in Europe as a hero. Yet while on a grueling, 8,000-mile, 22-day domestic tour to promote formation of the League of Nations, Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke, in Pueblo, Colorado. He returned to Washington and was never the same physically. During the waning period of Wilson's presidency, his wife, Edith, kept close guard over visitors, and helped conceal the true extent of his illness and incapacitation. But she wasn't operating alone. Dr. Cary T. Grayson, was a constant presence at the president's side — at a time that attending physicians didn't trail presidents 24 hours a day. ""They isolated him. That was medical wisdom at the time,"" said Cooper, the Wilson biographer and professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin. ""Now, of course, it's exactly the opposite. You try to get stroke victims back into social interaction as soon as possible."" Wilson regained some of his health, but the stroke's lasting effects -- he remained partially paralyzed on one side -- made him a less effective president. The League of Nations proposal didn't get through Congress, controlled by Republicans. Wilson died in early 1924, less than three years after leaving office. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1944-45FDR's public career was, in a sense, a case of less-than-leveling with the American public about his health issues. Having contracted polio at age 39, his inability to walk was well, but not universally, known.But on his way to winning the presidency -- and through his dozen years in the White House -- Roosevelt's handlers were careful to prevent the president from being photographed in a wheelchair. In a more gentile age of press relations -- through the national crises of the Great Depression and World War II -- journalists largely went along. Roosevelt's health situation, though, became more acute as the Allies marched toward victory. In early 1945, he delivered the State of the Union speech sitting down, said Pietrusza, the presidential historian. Then conferring with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at the Black Sea port of Yalta, many observers commented on the president's ill state of health.Having traveled more than 7,000 miles and already in physical decline due to what his personal physician diagnosed as hardening of the arteries, FDR used his dwindling energy tying to cajole Stalin into joining the US in the Pacific war against Japan. ""At Yalta he's turning literally green,"" Pietrusza said. Departing the conference in February, Roosevelt died of a stroke two months later. Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, 1960Though hiding health conditions by would-be presidents can hurt, sometimes excess candor is even worse. Vice President Richard Nixon learned this in 1960 when seeking the White House himself. The Republican nominee injured his knee while exiting a car in North Carolina, a condition that subsided briefly but then flared up during a bowling excursion at Camp David. Then in an unfortunate bit of timing Nixon stumbled again while traveling to Chicago for one of four televised debates against his Democratic rival, Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Nixon played through pain that night but the knee injury contributed to the perception among many that he lost to telegenic opponent JFK. The Nixon campaign didn't try to hide the extent of his injury -- including a week-long hospitalization. It gave Kennedy, only a few years younger, a crucial opening to exploit. ""Losing a week in a campaign, under any circumstances, is troublesome,"" Pietrusza said.JFK ended up winning that race, in the closest popular vote result in American history. But he was hardly a figure to emulate when it came to candor about his health. Though not revealed until years, often decades, after his assassination in 1963, the President suffered from a series of physical maladies. Frequently in the hospital as a child and teen, Kennedy had been hospitalized in 1954 -- and was deemed so ill that he was actually administered last rites by a priest. The Kennedy White House would go on the be arguably the least transparent in modern history about the president's health. A 2003 Kennedy biography by historian Robert Dallek -- conducted with a medical consultant -- found that the president suffered from ailments far more extensive, was in deeper pain, and took a larger array of medications, than was previously revealed. Paul Tsongas, 1992 Democratic presidential candidateIt's one of the most iconic pieces of presidential campaign footage in recent decades. A 50-year-old man in seeming robust health swims butterfly strokes in a pool. The candidate, presidential hopeful Paul Tsongas, wasn't just showing of his aquatic moves. The campaign of 1992 Democratic primary candidate sought to portray him as an exemplar of stellar health, after a cancer bout forced him to retire from the Senate in 1985, after only a single term. Tsongas made his survival from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a slow-growing cancer of the lymph system, an issue in his presidential campaign. Tsongas, though, lost that race to then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. Still, Tsongas became known as much for his health condition as policy prescriptions. On the campaign trail Tsongas, under questioning, revealed that he had been treated in 1987 for a recurrence of the lymphoma. Months after exiting the race Tsongas said he had erred in not disclosing the recurrence.He pledged that if he ever ran again, he would submit his medical records to independent experts.Tsongas passed away in January 1997, two days before the end of the White House term which he was seeking."

Former President Bill Clinton will fill in for his wife on Tuesday at two fundraisers in Los Angeles, per an aide, as well as on Wednesday in Las Vegas. On Monday, Clinton's call was introduced by California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom.""We have got to work to heal the divides in our country,"" Clinton told donors, just days after she told New York donors on Friday that half of Donald Trump's supporters fell into a ""basket of deplorables.""The remark drew a rebuke from Republicans and some Democrats.""We have got to see one another, hear one another, help one another and I want to be a president who inspires that,"" Clinton said.According to a Clinton aide, 2,500 people attended the fundraiser.But donors in the room told CNN that the event was partially empty, a fact they attributed to Clinton's absence."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/pew-research-center-presidential-poll-election-2016/index.html	Amid changes fueled partly by demographic shifts in the United States and partly by increasing polarization within those groups, a new report from the Pew Research Center finds America's two major political parties look almost nothing like they did a quarter century ago when Democrat Bill Clinton was first elected to the White House.As voting age population has grown increasingly non-white, older, and better educated, so too have the two major parties. But the analysis finds that the country's changing demographics have made the two parties farther apart rather than closer together even as the share of Democrats and Republicans in the nation's voter pool holds fairly steady.Overall, more Americans say they are Democrats or Democratic-leaners (48%) than that they affiliate with the Republican Party or lean toward it (44%). Those figures have held roughly steady since 2008, but reflect a more Republican-friendly electorate than in 1992 (then 51% were Democrats or Democratic-leaning vs. 41% Republican/Republican-leaning).The demographic groups that make up those coalitions have shifted sharply in the last 24 years. Among those who identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, 57% are white, down from 76% across Pew's surveys in 1992. Among Republicans and Republican-leaners, that change has been far less drastic, from 93% white in 1992 to 86% now.Black (21%) and Hispanic (12%) voters make up about one-third of the Democratic voter pool, compared with just 8% among Republicans (2% are black and 6% Hispanic).Within those racial and ethnic groups, Republicans have been gaining ground among white non-Hispanic voters, and now hold a larger advantage over Democrats in terms of party identification among whites than at any point since 1992, according to Pew's analysis.That long-term shift toward the Republican side among whites comes almost entirely from shifting partisan views among men. In 1992, 48% of white men considered themselves Republicans or leaned toward the Republican Party. Now, 61% do. Among white women, the share who are Republican or Republican-leaning has tilted from 44% in 1992 to 47% now.At the same time, the increase in non-whites among the Democratic coalition over that time stems largely from the growing numbers of blacks and Hispanics in the voter pool more than an increase in support for Democrats among those groups.The yawning chasm between white voters with college degrees and those without them has been a central focus of the 2016 election, and that divide reflects the changing core of each party. While a majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaners in 1992 were whites without college degrees (59%), they make up just one-third of the party now (32%). And Democrats are actually now more apt to be college graduates than are Republicans, a reversal since 1992.College graduates have grown as a share of the population over that time, and have shifted increasingly toward the Democrats, according to the Pew analysis. While 45% of college graduates considered themselves Democrats or leaned toward the Democratic Party in 1992, that stands at 53% today. Among those with a high school education or less, the figures are almost exactly reversed, from 55% Democratic in 1992 to 46% today.That divide has widened especially in the last eight years, driven by a steep increase in Republican affiliation among whites with no more than a high school education. Among that group, 59% say they are Republicans or lean that way, while just 33% are Democrats or Democratic-leaners. As recently as 2007, the Democrats narrowly outnumbered the Republicans among this group, 46% to 42%.On the opposite end of the scale, those who have completed at least some postgraduate coursework have gone from a slight-Democratic tilt in 1992 (50% leaned Democratic, 45% Republican) to a wide 59% to 36% chasm now.The population overall is aging, and both parties have aged accordingly. The Baby Boom generation has tilted the GOP older, while Millennials are helping to minimize aging among the Democrats. Boomers now tilt slightly Republican (49% to 45%), and members of the silent generation (those age 71 to 88) are increasingly Republican, according to Pew's data (53% GOP or GOP-leaning vs. 40% Democratic). At the same time, Gen X'ers and Millennials are tilting a bit more toward the Democrats in recent years, helping to offset the overall aging of the population.Although Millennials are a broadly Democratic-leaning group, with 57% saying they see themselves as Democrats or lean that way, they are also more apt than older voters to consider themselves political independents and merely lean toward a party, suggesting their partisan ties are weakest.The Pew report is based on the results of 253 surveys conducted by telephone by the Pew Research Center from 1992 through 2016. The 2016 results reflect interviews with 8,113 registered voters through August of this year. The margin of error for overall results in the 2016 data is 1.2 percentage points, it is larger for subgroups.	Partisan gap widens as demographics shift	['Black', 'Clinton']	[]
9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/bill-clinton-foundation-hillary-trust/index.html	"""All this stuff has been dragged out, and not one example -- not even one -- of something wrong has been cited,"" the former president said in an at-times contentious interview with Charlie Rose aired Monday night on PBS. ""But millions of dollars have been spent, and look what you're doing, Charlie,"" Clinton said, criticizing Rose's line of questioning.The interview also touched on Hillary Clinton's recent health scare, with Bill Clinton saying, ""She just got dehydrated yesterday."" Hillary Clinton's departed early from a commemorative ceremony at Ground Zero in Manhattan on Sunday, and a video revealed her wobbling before stumbling as she was assisted into her campaign van. Her campaign revealed hours later Sunday that she'd been diagnosed Friday with pneumonia, and said she'd become overheated that morning. Bill Clinton said nothing more serious is happening.""Well, if it is (more serious) then it's a mystery to me and all of her doctors,"" Bill Clinton said, adding that similar instances have happened from time to time.But Clinton also offered a robust defense of his charitable foundation. And he said he plans to step down from it's board of directors if Hillary Clinton wins in November, and that the foundation will stop accepting foreign and corporate contributions then as well. Asked why he won't make those moves now, before November 8, Clinton said: ""Because there is nothing wrong with what we're doing now and because I've got to wind it down. Because it takes time to undo this -- we've got a lot of lives on the line.""The Clinton Foundation funds and operates a long list of worldwide health and climate change initiatives -- including providing two-thirds of the world's HIV/AIDS treatment access.""We have been as transparent as we can be, and we've been more transparent than any other foundation -- more transparent than any other foundation has been asked to be, and certainly more transparent than anybody else in this line of work,"" Clinton said. ""I have said, to the best of my knowledge, nobody ever got anything from the State Department because they supported the Clinton Foundation,"" he said. ""If they did and it was inappropriate, I would say that was wrong, too."" Bill Clinton blamed voters' lack of trust in Hillary Clinton -- including polls showing three-in-five Americans say she isn't trustworthy -- on Republicans for their allegations that the Clinton Foundation's donors had enhanced access to Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state in President Barack Obama's first term. ""There's never been a foundation to disclose as much as I have,"" he said. ""Then why don't people feel trust? Because of the way the disclosed information is selectively used.""Clinton said if Hillary Clinton is elected president, the foundation will continue operating his presidential library, working on community health and operating the Clinton Global Initiative for university students.That, he said, can be done through individual contributions and donations from charitable organizations like the Carnegie Foundation.""I don't know what the future will bring, but we need to be transparent ... and we need to recognize that if she is the president, there is the possibility of conflict,"" Clinton said.Asked what the Clinton Foundation's most important achievement has been, Bill Clinton said: ""We got the world's cheapest AIDS medicine to more than half the people on earth who are alive with it, including more than two-thirds of the kids.""We built an organization that helped 430 million people in 180 countries just by getting people together, including organizing the first 500 tons of medical equipment to the Ebola epidemic, and it didn't cost the taxpayers a penny. And we made life better for a lot of Americans.""We created jobs and saved lives. I'm proud of that. We got caught trying,"" he said."
