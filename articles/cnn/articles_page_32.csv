The projections will continue throughout the night, and will ultimately unveil the 45th President of the United States.  The event at the famed building is the grand finale of the #MyVote nationwide tour, where CNN correspondents toured the country in the Campaign Camper and talked to real voters about their political views. During this tour, we collected thousands of images of voters from Instagram, many of which will be displayed through the projections. Not in New York? The #MyVote projections will also be featured at the Newseum in Washington, and on the Miracle Mile in Las Vegas. The Coit Tower in San Francisco will also be lit up in either red or blue lights, depending on how the state race is called. If you are in these areas, Instagram a picture of your view with #MyVote. If you cannot see the projections in person, we will have full coverage of the display on CNN TV and CNN.com.  	CNN lights up the sky at the Empire State Building

""If, after everything he has said, after every attack he has made against Latinos, after he has thrown out Latino anchors from press events, after he hasn't done any outreach, after he has questioned and judged our citizenship, after he has called Mexicans rapists, it would be sweet, sweet justice if it was a Latino vote that defeated Donald Trump.""Navarro then followed up her anti-Trump speech with a similar message in her native-tongued Spanish, prompting host Anderson Cooper to quip: ""You are not a Trump supporter, Ana Navarro.""Switching back to English, Navarro answered proudly, ""No. I am a college-educated Latina and sure as hell not a Trump supporter."""

""At this point, he is President-elect Trump. I don't like Donald Trump. I respect the office of the presidency.""When Cuomo suggested that Trump's acceptance speech seemed to be less divisive and more humble and conciliatory than many might have expected, the avowed Republican quickly cut him off.""I found very little comforting last night,"" said Navarro.As for the road ahead and the future of a nation that will be led by a man with no government experience, Navarro said she hoped that the man soon to inhabit the Oval Office is far different from the one who blazed a campaign trail unlike any seen before.""Let's hope that he was playing a character for campaign purposes. He's an entertainer. Let's hope that that's what he was doing and that the Trump that becomes president... feels the weight of the position, the responsibility and duty of the position, and realizes that governing a divided country is very, very difficult.""""We've got to hope for his success,"" she concluded. ""We've got to hope for our country's success."""	Ana Navarro on Trump win: End of one nightmare, the beginning of another

""We have heard for weeks that Donald Trump will call into question the legitimacy of this election,"" said Lewandowski. ""'He will not concede. What will his people do? Will there be an outrage?'""""Where is the outrage tonight that Hillary Clinton refuses to call and concede the election,"" he asked. ""The race is over."" Shortly after the exchange Clinton called Trump, but there was no indication there would be a concession speech. Speaking from the Javitz Center in New York City, Podesta delivered defiant words to crowd of Clinton supporters telling them to go home. ""I can say we can wait a little longer, can't we?"" said Podesta. ""They're still counting votes and every vote should count. Several states are too close to call, so we're not going to have anything more to say tonight."""	Corey Lewandowski demands concession speech: 'Where is the outrage?'

The younger man struck the older man and caused him to fall to the ground, the sheriff's office said.""Fearing for his safety,"" the older man said he had a weapon, authorities said. He didn't actually make a threat and had a concealed weapons permit for the weapon he was carrying, the sheriff's office said.The older man was charged with simple battery and criminal mischief, the sheriff's office said. He has not been identified. The younger man was not charged.CNN affiliate WPBF interviewed the younger man, identified as Tobian Norris, who said he was approaching the poll when the older man began soliciting him to vote for Donald Trump. Norris said he wouldn't vote for Trump and they argued about Trump and Hillary Clinton.  He said he started filming the other man with his cell phone and running it live on Facebook. Video from Norris' cellphone, aired by WPBF showed the younger man saying, ""Hey, did you finish high school?"" The video showed the older man approaching, uttering bleeped-out words and appearing to reach his hand toward the phone. The sounds of a scuffle follow.Norris said the man called him a racial slur and he began punching him in the ribs. Norris said he left when the older man pulled a gun."

Patrick Murphy, once a promising Democratic recruit who faced questions about whether he embellished his resume. Democrats were once optimistic about Murphy's Florida bid, but later largely pulled all advertising in the expensive state in order to finance buys in other contests.Rubio originally ran for the GOP presidential nomination and pledged to not seek another term in the Senate. But after dropping out of the race, Republican leaders pressured him to re-consider, and his entry into the fold virtually cleared the crowded field for the Republican nomination.

Kirk later said he wrote in former Gen. David Petraeus for president.National Republicans largely did not advertise on Kirk's behalf, viewing the Illinois seat as hard to defend. Kirk also hurt his chances in a recent debate, when he disparaged Duckworth's mixed-race background and family history.	Tammy Duckworth gives Democrats first Senate flip

""Probably 2008 would've been a better time for her to run for president. But it's just right time, right place. And again, you've got to give Donald Trump a ton of credit.""Clinton did run for president in 2008 and lost to Barack Obama in the Democratic primary.Asked by host Rich Zeoli why Clinton had the support of the establishment of the Democratic party during this year's primary, Rendell replied it was because of her emotional ties with those in the party.""Because she was someone who had friends that were longtime friends and associates of the party and there's a great feeling,"" he said. ""There's an emotional tie between a lot of Democrats around the country and Hillary Clinton. But you know, that doesn't mean that she was the right candidate for a general election.""He continued, ""And it would be interesting to think of how Bernie Sanders would've done. Bernie Sanders would've lost a few Republicans who voted for Hillary because of some of his economic views but he would've fought Donald pretty hard for those disaffected, angry, and frustrated workers.""Earlier in the interview, Rendell praised President-elect Donald Trump as a ""great campaigner"" and for turning out voters that Mitt Romney did not in 2012.""We can say all we want about Donald Trump and a lot of us have said negative things,"" he said. ""Myself included. But boy he turned out to be a great campaigner. He understood what people were feeling better than anybody else in the race and he hit it right on the head and just got people out to vote who almost never voted before.""Rendell also said in the interview that Clinton's loss in Pennsylvania was not a result of a lack of resources put into the state, criticizing the campaign's strategy in two other usually Democratic states that Trump won. ""Unlike Wisconsin and Michigan, where I think the Clinton campaign didn't put enough resources in and spend enough time, certainly the resources were put in here and the time was spent here and the campaign on the ground was terrific,"" he said.Rendell further criticized some Pennsylvania voters, male and female, who he said were reluctant to elect women to prominent positions, saying that it was one of the reasons Clinton was the wrong presidential candidate.
