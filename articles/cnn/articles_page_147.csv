""The IRS currently holds the power to impose legal sanctions on a church for something its pastor preaches from the pulpit.""As a senator, Lyndon B. Johnson backed a change in the US tax code that blocked some tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from supporting or opposing political candidates.""Until 1954, America's pastors had the right to speak freely they exercised that right responsibly,"" Stanley said. ""Churches were not turned into political action committees and party bosses did not set up shop in the basement of churches. Instead, pastors spoke out as they believed their faith intersected with something that was happening in an election. Pastors should have the right to decide that issue for themselves.""Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to repeal the ""Johnson Amendment"" should he win.""The Johnson Amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits,"" he said at the Values Voter Summit last month. ""If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status,"" he said. ""All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson Amendment if I am elected your president, I promise. So important.""Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the Johnson Amendment.The IRS told CNN that federal privacy laws prohibit the agency from commenting on any individual taxpayer or case.But Jim Garlow, lead pastor of Skyline Church in San Diego, has tried to get the IRS to comment on this issue for years.""We record our sermons, as have many several thousands of pastors, and then send their sermons to the IRS in the hopes of provoking a lawsuit. But we have not been successful,"" he said.Although ADF advocates for more traditional social issues like marriage and abortion, the group is not endorsing a candidate or encouraging pastors to address certain issues.""ADF remains firmly committed to the goal that Pulpit Freedom Sunday is not about any particular issue or candidate or election, but is about restoring the right of pastors to speak freely from their pulpits and removing the censorship and punishment power from the IRS,"" Stanley said. Trump supporter Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council, said that although pastors don't need to choose a candidate, they do need the freedom to do so if they want.""As a pastor, you have a biblical responsibility to speak to your congregation and help them understand the issues and how they line up with Scripture,"" he said. ""We're simply going down the list of biblical issues like life and human sexuality and marriage and speaking to what Scripture has to say and juxtaposing that with the positions of the candidates.""But not all clergy are in favor of religious leaders using the pulpit to make political endorsements.Broderick Greer, curate at Grace-St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Memphis, Tennessee, believes support for Pulpit Freedom Sunday is due to more conservative leaders losing influence in an increasingly diverse climate. ""I don't see our relationship with the people we're serving as one of paternalism,"" he said. ""I would never want to tell people who they should vote for.""""If you want to lose your tax-exempt status, then feel free to make an endorsement from your pulpit. If you don't then, you don't,"" he added. ""I think the broader question is should religious organizations have tax-exempt status at all."""

1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/donald-trump-rhetoric/index.html	"The Republican nominee's campaign might be unprecedented, but a key element of his stump schtick is rooted in a rhetorical device pioneered by the Ancient Greeks.For campaign watchers in 2016, the trope has become so familiar it typically slides by without notice. It is most commonly known among linguists as ""paralipsis"" (""to leave to the side""), a tool employed by the great Roman debater Cicero and Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift that allows a speaker to effectively say two things at once. The pattern has played out repeatedly over the past 15 months of campaigning: Trump tells you he won't say something negative about a rival, and in so promising, does it anyway. He's used the device in talking about Bill and Hillary Clinton, a former Miss Universe, and past primary opponents including Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson, among others.  More than 80 million people heard it Monday night, in the closing minutes of Trump's first face-off with Hillary Clinton, when he told viewers that, despite plans to level an ""extremely rough"" charge against Clinton and her family, ""I said to myself, I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate."" A few minutes later, Trump turned it up a notch. ""I'm very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash in the spin room as he raised the infidelity issue he'd skirted on stage, ""because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton, and I just didn't want to say what I was going to say.""And there it was: Trump had not discussed the former president's extramarital affairs, except, of course, that he was quite obviously standing there, discussing the former president's extramarital affairs. ""Donald Trump uses paralipsis, repeatedly, and he does it in combination with another rhetorical figure, which is called argumentum ad baculum -- or threats of force,"" Dr. Jennifer Mercieca, an expert on political discourse at Texas A&M University, told CNN. ""He implied that there was something that he was going to say, that he wanted to say, about Bill Clinton and infidelity, but that he wasn't.""""It was a threat,"" she said, ""be nice to me or I'm going bring out these terrible things. And I think that's what we've seen from the surrogates, and from him, since the debates, so it keeps being lorded over the Clinton campaign's head -- that this thing is coming.""  The device may be thousands of years old, but Trump has employed it in new and, at least in the modern American context, surprising ways.  ""I've never seen anyone in public life use paralipsis the way he does,"" Mercieca said. ""It's a clearly demagogic move. It allows him to recirculate information without being held accountable for it.""Such was the purpose during Trump's Wednesday night interview with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News, which followed more than a day of being questioned and criticized for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.""So a lot of things are coming out about her,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say anything.""Pressed to comment on whether Clinton had taken a ""cheap shot"" by bringing up Machado during the debate, Trump started in on the former beauty queen after vowing he wouldn't.""A lot of things are coming out that I wasn't aware of, like they say that she threatened the life of a judge and got involved in all sorts of problems,"" he said. During an August 2015 rally in New Hampshire, when Fiorina was enjoying a brief uptick in the GOP primary race, Trump observed that she had been ""a little nasty"" to him.""So I promised that I wouldn't say, so I said it to myself, I promised I wouldn't say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground,"" he said to hoots from supporters. ""I said I will not say it -- that her stock value tanked. That she laid off tens of thousands of people  and she got viciously fired. I said I will not say it.""And yet, he did. Irony is implicit in paralipsis, which is why so many comedians use it to make us laugh and feel in on the joke.A few months later, at a raucous rally in Fort Dodge, Iowa, Trump delivered a kind of oratorical masterclass.First up was Marco Rubio:""I will not call him a lightweight, because I think that's a derogatory term,"" Trump said. ""So I will not call him a lightweight. Is that OK with you people? I refuse to say that he's a lightweight.""And then Ben Carson:""Carson is an enigma to me,"" he said, prompting someone in the audience to yell, ""Boring!' Without missing a beat, Trump replied, ""I didn't say it!"" Then he smiled and pointed into the crowd.Asked months later by a Washington Post reporter if he would quietly concede in the event he lost a narrow race to Clinton, Trump once again found inspiration in Ancient Greece.""I don't want to talk about that,"" he said as he then began talking about it. ""I'm just saying that I wouldn't be surprised if the election ... there's a lot of dirty pool played at the election, meaning the election is rigged."""	Donald Trump promises he won't say it, then he does
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/donald-trump-big-money-success/index.html	"Amid the campaign's final frenzy, there are encouraging signs that Trump's slow-to-build money operation has matured to presidential caliber, but alarm persists that it may be too late to combat Hillary Clinton's big-dollar machine, according to a dozen people with ties to Trump's finance team.The fundraising quarter that ended Friday has injected sorely needed cash into Trump's White House hopes, with long-sought donations finally clearing and optimism abound that Trump himself will match his tightening poll numbers with a loosening of his own wallet. Trump has two families in particular to thank: the Adelsons of Las Vegas and the Ricketts of the Midwest, who are behind the scenes directing major cash -- and critically, major credibility -- to Trump's fundraising ambitions. Despite only publicly committing $5 million to what is likely to be the de facto Trump super PAC, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson are pledging at least $25 million to pro-Trump presidential efforts, according to multiple people briefed on their donations. That sum includes giving to nonprofit group that will never be required to disclose his donations.""I'm doing more than a lot of people think I'm doing,"" Adelson recently told one top Trump ally. The casino magnate reportedly pledged to spend $100 million at the onset of the general election -- a total some expect him to still hit, though several sources cautioned that the famously hard-to-read casino magnate can always change his mind should Trump slump.The Ricketts family, the founder and heirs to the TD Ameritrade fortune, have told associates that the Adelsons has pledged $25 million to their groups, which includes a revived super PAC, Future 45, and the nonprofit 501(c)(4) group, 45Committee. It is unclear how the Adelsons plan to split their checks between the entities.And two people who have spoken personally with Todd Ricketts this week said Ricketts said he now had $35 million in the bank thanks to the Adelson donation and was working toward raising $70 million, earmarked exclusively for the presidential race.Adelson and Ricketts representatives did not respond to request for comments, though an Adelson spokesman did deny a report in The Guardian, which first reported the $25 million commitment but claimed it was all promised to the super PAC. Will Trump spend more?After inviting unprecedented scorn from the Republican donor base during the primary only to plead for their checks once winning it, Trump enters the homestretch in a competitive financial position versus Clinton. That is mostly driven by Trump's surprisingly successful online fundraising program, which flooded him with money over the summer largely given directly to his campaign -- though he had to pay a pretty penny to collect it.Yet now there is mounting evidence that traditional donors are at least begrudgingly giving: A post-debate fundraising drive this week yielded $18 million, and about $11 million of that cash came from high-dollar givers who fielded the calls of top Trump fundraisers at Trump Tower on Tuesday, according to a person with knowledge of the figures.And Trump himself is sparking hope from Republicans that he himself will put more skin in the game than the $2 million a month he has been investing in his bid since he wrapped up the primary. While Trump has yet to make a final commitment -- and fundraising emails as recently as this week suggested that he would only give his standard $2 million in September -- the $150 million last-hurrah advertising plan unveiled by Trump aides last week is almost certainly not possible without a substantial check from the man at the top.And those who know the billionaire expect him to not tolerate a loss on account of his own stinginess -- and are predicting infusions from a competitive businessman who hates losing. Trump revealed Friday at a rally that he would spend ""over $100 million"" on the race.""If he wanted to run 10 more ads and there wasn't money in the Republican National Committee or any other fund,"" said John Catsimatidis, a grocery magnate who himself spent over $10 million on his own political run for New York mayor, ""I would write a check.""Meanwhile, a collection of super PACs -- at first scorned, at least officially, by Trump brass -- are preparing final fundraising drives that they hope can at least mitigate the advertising gap that could swallow Trump's dreams in swing states. Rebuilding America Now, the favorite of Trump leadership during the summer, has stalled since. But it held a major fundraiser on Thursday evening in New York City with Donald Trump Jr. and the group has obtained another $2 million check from Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, according to a person close to the group, boosting his overall contributions to the group to $5 million.The group, struggling since the departure of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and now threatened by the rise of Future 45, is not required to disclose its fundraising totals until October 15. But people close to the group predict -- and their abrupt stop in advertising this fall after a $13 million push substantiates -- that the super PAC has raised only between $15 and $20 million, far short of their initial goal.Marcus is also expected to have donated to Make America Number One, a super PAC run by key Trump influencer and megadonor Rebekah Mercer.Eyes on Adelson, Ricketts familiesIt is the Adelson and Ricketts families, though, that are the hot commodities in GOP finance circles: Sheldon and Miriam Adelson scored four third-row seats to the first presidential debate this week in New York and were seen mingling with Trump friends ranging from Rudy Giuliani to Don King. And at a recent fundraiser in the Chicago suburbs this week, Trump praised Todd Ricketts on three separate occasions, according to an attendee, even as he ripped into other Illinois Republican elites like GOP Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who is trailing badly in his re-election race.""Guys like Kirk who are behind in the polls can't figure out why guys like me are ahead in the polls,"" Trump told the crowd, according to two attendees who relayed the remarks.The Ricketts family is also focused on a half-dozen Senate races -- though their spending would not boost Kirk, who is not running in a presidential swing-state. And their focus remains tearing down Clinton, as they have done in a pair of searing new advertisements out this week.The Ricketts family has committed $1 million to the effort, and is likely to find success in the American Opportunity Alliance, an exclusive, Wall Street-tied, socially liberal donor network that has largely spurned Trump, most prominently by hedge-funder Paul Singer, the most prolific bundler in GOP politics.At least one of those prominent donors is not currently expected to get behind the group: Linda McMahon, the former US Senate candidate, who co-hosted the Rebuilding America Now event on Thursday.In addition to Adelson and Marcus, Trump is also making inroads with their fellow leaders in the Republican Jewish Coalition, where Marc Goldman, a Florida investor and RJC board member, has taken the lead in trying to win over his pro-Israel peers.One possible route for Trump-shy donors: the nonprofit arm, which gives Republicans the cloak of non-disclosure.Cecil O'Brate, a Kansas-based energy titan who has supported Ricketts-led groups in the past, said he would consider the groups but was especially attracted to any entities that kept his donations out of the public eye.""If you push one guy hard and the name's out there, and then he doesn't win, then you're in trouble,"" said O'Brate, who as of this week had not heard from Future45. ""I'll wait and see what they try and do.""Yet there are significant limitations on what a pro-Trump nonprofit could do. Given that Clinton is not a current federal officeholder, many campaign-finance lawyers have long believed that their options are particularly limited in the 2016 cycle. To maintain their tax-exempt status, nonprofits cannot spend a majority of their money on elections, leading most of these political groups to run ads either ""thanking"" or scolding various public officials -- who just happen to be up for election -- that are ostensibly not related to the campaign.Attacks on Clinton -- or, for that matter, praise for Trump, another person not in office -- could be severely limited by nonprofit law. Yet the Ricketts operation believes it has a way to tactically play 2016 politics even with their nonprofit, according to a person briefed on the plans.But whatever limitations may apply, the Ricketts name is gold in political finance circles, and Republican money operatives and donors alike voice confidence in any shop led by the politically savvy family. The clearest sign of trust was that the Adelsons, who control their own top-flight operation and had considered helming their own super PAC, entrusted their fortunes.Doug Manchester, a San Diego developer who also at one point thought of starting his own PAC, said he had now sworn off giving to outside groups. But Manchester, who has given the maximum to Trump Victory, was piqued when informed of the new Ricketts venture.""I just haven't been approached correctly by the right people,"" said Manchester, voicing his displeasure with negative advertisements. ""If they were to approach me, I may be interested."""	Trump finally hits the big-money jackpot

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/fact-check-stop-and-frisk/index.html	"In an op-ed column in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who instituted the practice of large-scale warrantless search of people in his city, declared Clinton and Holt to be flat wrong and he called upon Holt to apologize for ""trying so hard to help Mrs. Clinton support her incorrect statement that stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional."" Giuliani also credited stop-and-frisk with helping to bring about ""an 85% reduction in crime in New York City between 1994 and 2013.""Is Giuliani right?As the former mayor noted in his op-ed, stop-and-frisk grew out of a 1968 Supreme Court decision, Terry v. Ohio, which ruled that police are allowed to stop and search a person if officers have a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime. It is still the law of the land.In 2013, US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin found that New York's stop-and-frisk strategy focused too heavily on black and Hispanic people and was carried out too often without reasonable suspicion. As a result, she ruled that New York's stop-and-frisk policy was unconstitutional ""as applied."" Scheindlin specifically said she was not ordering New York to end stop-and-frisk, but instead, she ordered the city's police to reform their training and policing procedures to, among other things, make sure that officers do not engage in racial profiling when determine who to stop. She also appointed a monitor to oversee how the department was carrying out her orders.Scheindlin's ruling was highly controversial. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals halted enforcement of the reforms she had ordered and returned the case to a lower court for further review. The appeals court also took unusual step of removing her from the case. But the appellate court did not overturn her ruling that the way the city was carrying out stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional, since it violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure. It is also true that the way stop-and-frisk was carried out in New York -- tactics that Giuliani touted as helping to ""change New York City from the crime capital of America to the safest large city in the country"" -- is still considered illegal. So Giuliani is correct when he says that stop-and-frisk overall is constitutional, which is how Clinton described it. But here is what Holt said during the debate: ""Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.""  That is a correct description of Scheindlin's ruling and Giuliani is wrong to criticize Holt for characterizing it that way.With regard to the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, critics note that violent crime was decreasing in New York in the second half of the administration of David Dinkins, who was Giuliani's Democratic predecessor. It continued to fall during Giuliani's time in office. It continued to fall when his successor, Michael Bloomberg, dramatically ramped up stop-and-frisk. Stop-and-frisk peaked in 2011 under the Bloomberg administration, but was cut back amid protests and lawsuits against the practice. Still, violent crime fell. And it continues to fall under the administration of Bill de Blasio, who has scaled back the practice even further, though it is still a tactic used on a much less frequent basis. Critics also note that violent crime was tumbling across the country, including in cities that did not use stop-and-frisk as aggressively as New York. Indeed, during the time when stop-and-frisk was at its most intense in New York, other cities, such as Dallas and Los Angeles, that did not use the practice so extensively saw even greater decreases in violent crime.

House Speaker Paul Ryan specifically called for a ""fix"" to protect service members overseas.Earlier this year, the US released portions of a formerly classified Congressional report showing some of the 9/11 hijackers were in contact with and received support from individuals likely connected to the Saudi government.Fifteen of the 19 9/11 attackers were Saudi citizens.The Saudi Foreign Ministry put out a statement earlier this week saying, ""The enactment of JASTA is of great concern to the community of nations that object to the erosion of the principle of sovereign immunity, which has governed international relations for hundreds of years.""""The erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the United States."""	9/11 widow files lawsuit against Saudi Arabia
9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/hillary-clinton-millennial-voters-audio-bernie-sanders/index.html	"The comments were posted late Friday by the conservative website Washington Free Beacon, which says it obtained the audio from a Clinton campaign staffer's hacked email. The recording comes to light as Clinton has emphasized reaching out to millennials in an effort to attract Sanders supporters to her campaign.Speaking to a gathering of campaign supporters in February, Clinton said some of Sanders' followers ""are new to politics completely. They're children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents' basement.""She continued: ""If you're feeling like you're consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot, and doesn't have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. I think we all should be really understanding of that."" The Democratic nominee -- who at one point said she didn't want to ""overpromise"" and ""be clear about the progress we can make"" -- questioned if Sanders' supporters were adequately informed.""There's just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free health care, that what we've done hasn't gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, 'Scandinavia,' whatever that means,"" she says in the audio. ""And half the people don't know what that means, but it's something that they deeply feel.""She also said: ""I don't think you tell idealistic people, particularly young people, that they've bought into a false promise. You try to do the best you can to say, 'Hey that's his view. That's what he's offering you. But here's another way, where actually we can achieve a lot of what we have said starting Day One, and make a real difference in people's lives.'""In a statement, the Clinton campaign did not dispute the audio's authenticity.""As Hillary Clinton said in those remarks, she wants young people to be idealistic and set big goals. She is fighting for exactly what the millennial generation cares most about -- a fairer more equal, just world,"" said Glen Caplin, a campaign spokesman. He added: ""She's inspired by the optimism and the drive of this generation and Sanders supporters across the country -- and they've helped her craft and promote the most progressive platform in Democratic party history.""A message left with Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, was not immediately returned. But Mike Casca, a Sanders spokesman, tweeted that Clinton's comments were sympathetic and understanding of the supporters' frustrations.Clinton is not polling as well with millennial voters as President Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012, with many backing Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. But following the Democratic convention, the Clinton campaign has enlisted surrogates such as Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, first lady Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton to stump for Clinton and convince young people to back her.Clinton also has embraced some of the policy positions that made Sanders such a hit with millenials, such as a $15 federal minimum wage and greater taxpayer funding for health care.  Trump on Saturday night leaned into the issue as he made his latest play to earn the votes of Sanders' supporters.Speaking at a rally in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Trump accused Clinton of ""demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters"" and argued that Clinton was calling Sanders supporters ""ignorant.""Trump argued that Clinton delivered her comments in a ""really sarcastic tone because she's a sarcastic woman.""""To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie Sanders supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement-dwellers,"" he said.Trump said he believed many of Sanders' supporters would cross over and vote for him, rather than Clinton, particularly because of their shared distrust on free trade.Echoes of past Clinton criticismsClinton has previously suggested that Sanders was promising his supporters too much.In January, she told voters in Iowa that she agrees with ""very aspirational"" candidates but is ""also interested in getting things done.""""Now, I know some of the folks running are very aspirational, and I agree with that. We should all be aiming high. But I'm also interested in getting things done,"" she said in January. ""We can't wait to get a lot of new jobs. We can't wait to get incomes rising. We can't wait to make sure that we are moving forward together.  And I also know something about how to make sure that the financial markets, Wall Street, doesn't wreck our economy.""The next month, Clinton told New Hampshire's WKXL that ""overpromising"" from candidates is one of the main reasons many people are disappointed in politics. ""It worries me because I think overpromising is one of the roots of a lot of disappointment and the real dismissal of politics, on all sides of the political spectrum. And what we need now is to underpromise and overdeliver,"" she said.

""But I think it is what the country will eventually respond to, because if you say, as I do, I'm going to fight to make real change, to build on progress, to go further, but I will not promise what I cannot, and know I cannot, deliver."""
