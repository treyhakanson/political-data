He called for all planes in key areas of Syria to be immediately grounded and for countries to stop supporting those who sabotage ceasefire efforts. Kerry also questioned how the US-supported opposition can engage in political talks to resolve the conflict when the Syrian regime, backed by Russia, doesn't halt its attacks. Russia was tasked with restraining Syria during this latest attempt at a ceasefire, undertaken last week.RELATED: US blames Russia for Syria convoy attack; Moscow points to terrorists ""How can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and acts with impunity,"" Kerry asked. ""You're supposed to sit there and have happy talk in Geneva while the regime drops bombs?""Russian denialThe diplomatic clashing of swords highlights just how hard it has been to take even the first steps toward calming the Syrian conflict enough to begin political talks. The ongoing civil war has given terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda fertile recruiting ground, has sucked in regional powers seeking influence over the outcome and has sent ripples through Europe and its allies.As diplomats sparred at the Security Council, Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said that Moscow was sending an aircraft cruiser to the Mediterranean to strengthen its capabilities there.  The Russians have denied that they were behind the attack on the UN convoy and instead have offered a series of explanations that Kerry detailed at the Security Council meeting..Russia initially said that the strike was a necessary response to an alleged offensive by an al-Qaeda-linked terror group, Kerry said. Then Russia claimed they were bombing elsewhere, then that the aid convoy had been followed by militants with mortars, and then that the trucks caught fire.""The trucks and the food and the medicine just spontaneously combusted,"" Kerry said. ""Anybody here believe that?"" he asked. The bombing attacks on hospitals and children are ""flagrant violations of international law,"" he added.And attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers continue, Kerry noted. He cited separate air strikes on Monday that killed four aid workers near Aleppo.""There are only two countries that have planes that are flying during the night or flying in that particular area at all,"" Kerry said. ""They are Russia and Syria.""   'Thorough and impartial' investigation At the Security Council Wednesday, Lavrov said Russia always put as a top priority the resumption of the inter-Syrian political dialogue without any preconditions. And he called for a ""thorough and impartial"" investigation into Monday's bombing, which left the convoy of trucks in a twisted wreck of smoking metal.And he urged his counterparts at the meeting to ""refrain from emotional comments.""US officials have fingered Russia as the perpetrator of the attack based on intelligence and reports from the ground. Kerry cited eyewitnesses who said that ""all of a sudden, the place became hell and the fighter jets were in the sky.""The White House said publicly Tuesday night that it held Russians responsible, regardless of whether it or the Syrian government had launched the strikes, since they have responsibility for the airspace.""We have not seen good faith. This was an outrageous action,"" said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes.Syrian Ambassador to the UN Bashaar Jaafari hit back, saying it was ""laughable"" for Kerry to cite eyewitness accounts when, he claimed, ""thousands of people"" in the area hadn't seen any jets.He also took the US to task for an airstrike on Satruday that killed 62 Syrian soldiers, calling it a ""deliberate and unacceptable aggression."" The US has said it was an accident.Kerry's scathing 28-minute speech to the Security Council also pressed the need to return to a 2012 plan to create a political transition in Syria. He pointed to repeated Syrian attacks on civilians, detailed shifting Russian explanations about the aid convoy attack and ridiculed Moscow's argument that political talks shouldn't be burdened with preconditions.The US has said that Russia bears responsibility for the attack on the convoy because they were the only two countries flying planes over the area at that time and Russia had pledged to restrain Syria.""The primary question is no longer what do we know,"" Kerry said. ""The primary question is, collectively, what are we going to do about it? In other words, this is a moment of truth.""Washington, Moscow clashLavrov needled the US over opposition groups during his address. Washington and Moscow have clashed over Russian targeting of moderate Syrian opposition groups backed by the US. The Russians have claimed that some of these groups are not particularly moderate and have accused opposition groups of violating the ceasefire. On Wednesday, Lavrov called for all members of the International Syrian Support Group to ensure that the opposition groups over which they have influence will comply with the cessation of hostilities.Otherwise, he added, ""We can't preserve Syria as a single, united state."" And he alluded to ""geopolitical engineering,"" a reference to Russian concerns about US attempts at ""regime change."" Syria's Jaafari echoed the argument, telling the meeting that the International Syrian Support Group was ""formed outside international legitimacy"" and was ""reminiscent of other destructive coalitions that only brought disasters to countries like Iraq and Libya and Yemen.""The only success the US has managed to achieve, Jaafari said, is to level ""false accusations"" about the ""suffering of Syrians to demonize the Syrian government and its allies.""Four failed ceasefiresKerry had left the meeting before the Syrian ambassador spoke, but when Jaafari had finished speaking, Ambassador Michele Sison, the US deputy representative to the UN, asked to address the council. ""My colleagues are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts,"" Sison said. ""Let's just keep in mind just who is prolonging the suffering of the people of Syria."" Jaafari's remarks had been ""so full of untruths that I feel no need to say anything further,"" she said.For his part, earlier in the meeting, Kerry mocked Lavrov's argument that there should be no preconditions before political negotiations start. Citing four international-level agreements calling for a cessation of hostilities that could then lead to peace talks, Kerry said, ""that's not a precondition. That's an international agreement, four times arrived at.""RELATED: Obama at UN warns Americans against walls and nationalism""Four times, it's been shredded by independent actors,"" Kerry said, ""by spoilers who don't want a cease-fire.""Half of Syria's population has been uprooted, many of them fleeing to Europe, and well over 300,000 men, women and children have been killed, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the meeting.  ""Those who believe the crisis in Syria cannot become even worse are dead wrong,"" Kerry said, ""as are those who believe there's a military solution."""

Clinton said with a smile.""Besides me and (Justin) Timberlake, you know what I mean,"" Fallon said, referencing the pop star and Grammy Award-winner.""But, but Justin's worthy of your attention,"" Clinton said. ""Because last I checked, he hadn't, you know, killed off his adversaries.""The bag also included a Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" CD -- a reference to Trump's desire to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and a bag of softballs, a joke about Fallon's interview style.""This is a pretty beat up bag. It's like a homeless person's bag,"" Clinton said about the wrinkled brown bag.Clinton has sought to make Trump's glowing comments about Putin an issue in the 2016 election, arguing that if the Republican nominee is elected, he would be someone the Russian president could manipulate.""Every day that goes by, this just becomes more and more of a reality television show,"" Clinton said after Trump appeared on RT, a cable channel in the United States that is an arm of the government-run news agency Russia Today. ""It is not a serious presidential campaign and it is beyond one's imagination to have candidate for president praising a Russian autocrat like Vladimir Putin and throwing his lot in with him,"" she said.Trump has said when a world leader compliments him, as Putin has, he will compliment them back. Trump has also argued that Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama, citing his approval rating inside the country.His fondness for Putin has been criticized by many Republican hawks such as Sen. John McCain, in addition to Clinton and Democrats.Clinton's interview with Fallon comes as the Democratic presidential nominee is trying to push a more aspirational message on the campaign trail, touting her policies and values more than going after Trump. Aides feel late night interviews like the one with Fallon help soften Clinton to voters. Friday's taping marked her third interview with Fallon.The forum allows Clinton to let loose and tell stories she doesn't usually use in standard interviews. For example, Clinton used this appearance to tell Fallon about playing high school softball.""I am not the greatest athlete, but I loved playing sports when I was growing up,"" Clinton said, describing how the team she played on -- the Good and Plenty's -- was sponsored by a local candy distributor.Fallon started the interview with Clinton by joking about her recent pneumonia diagnosis, which kept her off the campaign trail for three days.The late-night host put on a surgical mask and used hand sanitizer on his hands after high-fiving the Democratic nominee.Clinton said she was feeling better and when asked whether former President Bill Clinton was a good nurse, the former secretary of state said he was very ""solicitous.""""He was really, he was really very sweet, actually,"" Clinton said. ""My dogs were great, too."""	Clinton: Trump, Putin have 'the most famous bromance going'	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

He's not as rich as he would have us believe + a bad businessman. That's why we can't see his tax returns,"" Reid tweeted.Reid, citing an unnamed source, memorably accused Romney during the 2012 race of going 10 years without paying federal income taxes. Romney released a 20-year summary of his tax liabilities from 1990 through 2009, and his tax returns from 2010 and 2011. But he did not release additional returns.The Trump campaign did not return CNN's request for comment.Reid on Tuesday then went to the Senate floor to rip into Trump.""The last thing the American people want or need is a president who will run another financial scam on each of them,"" the Nevada Democrat said. ""If elected, Donald Trump would be the scammer in chief. Trump is a fraud.""""He's always looking for a mark, some victim for one of his schemes,"" Reid added. ""And now our country is Trump's next target. He wants this to be his biggest payoff ever.""Reid's speech focused what he sees as lies about Trump's money and said the real estate mogul is only wealthy because he was born with ""a silver spoon."" Trump's father was a wealthy real estate magnate who loaned his son money to jumpstart his career.""Litigation is nothing new to Donald Trump. Over the last decade and a half, Trump and his companies and have been sued in federal court 72 times. That doesn't take into consideration the many times he's been sued in state courts,"" Reid said. ""But Trump being the flim-flammer he is just moves on to another scam.""Reid, who is supporting Hillary Clinton, has repeatedly attacked Trump this campaign. Following Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, Reid attacked Trump's health.""Take a look at this character that's running for president. He complains about her health. What does he do? He's 70 years old. He's not slim and trim. He brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit,"" Reid said last week. And on Thursday, Reid tore into Trump on the Senate floor, calling the Republican presidential nominee a ""spoiled brat,"" ""a con artist"" and a ""human leech who will bleed the country."""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-utah-mormon-trump/index.html	"Clinton's campaign has sought to draw a wedge between Mormons -- a religious group that makes up about 60% of Utah, according to some estimates -- and Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Some Mormon voters have grown concerned by Trump's candidacy, citing questions they have about his principles and comments he has made that hint at religious persecution.The goal, according to David Irvine, a former Republican member of the Utah House of Representatives and a member of the the organization, is to convince people within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to pick Clinton over Trump by touting the former secretary of state's values and commitment to religious liberty.Since its founding in 1830, Mormons have been persecuted and chased out of a number of areas they tried to settle. Members of the faith, after being expelled from Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, eventually settled in Utah in 1847. Irvine said in a statement that Trump is ""belittling and scapegoating people of other religious and ethnic minorities in the harshest language."" ""His disdain for them is equaled only by his disdain and crudity toward women,"" Irvine said. ""The most enduring pioneer value is charity in its broadest sense, and Utahns looking for those kinds of values"" should vote for Clinton.Last month, Clinton pitched Mormon voters in an op-ed published by the Deseret News, a paper owned by the church.Clinton nods to the church's history of persecution in her op-ed, noting that other Mormons have compared Trump's comments to ""when Missouri Gov. Lilburn Boggs singled out Mormons in his infamous extermination order of 1838"" and ""President Rutherford B. Hayes' attempt to limit Mormon immigration to America in 1879.""Shortly after the piece came out, Jake Sullivan, Clinton's top policy adviser, opened a campaign headquarters in Salt Late City.Clinton is not the only presidential candidate looking to undermine Trump in Utah.Evan McMullin, a former House Republican aide and a Mormon born in Provo, Utah, announced his plan to get on the ballot in Utah earlier this year, hoping to court members of the church away from Trump.McMullin's campaign stresses that he is plugged into the Mormon church's power structure, and in a close race in Utah, a strong McMullin showing could help put the state's six Electoral College votes into Clinton's column.Clinton's aides know that chances of winning Utah are long, but her outreach is more about forcing Trump to spend time and money to shore up support in a state that hasn't voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/gun-control-law-court/index.html	"""This is the most important question in the Second Amendment today,"" said Adam Winkler of UCLA School of Law. ""Whether people can carry guns in public and under what conditions is a major battleground."" Lawyers for District of Columbia called the license restriction an ""important public safety law"" and argued before a panel of the US District Court for the District of Columbia that the law should be allowed to remain in effect pending appeal.""This case is in its infancy,"" said Holly M. Johnson, an assistant attorney general for the District.But challengers asked the court to block it, arguing that ""very few people"" will be able to demonstrate that they are eligible for the permit.The three judges hearing the challenge were all nominated by Republican presidents.Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush nominee, asked by far the most questions on the bench. He noted there is a ""long history"" of courts sustaining bans on concealed carry, but, joined by Judge Stephen Williams, a Ronald Reagan appointee, he repeatedly questioned the scope of the DC permit requirement. More than once he asked about someone who lived in a dangerous neighborhood but had never been attacked who might not qualify for the permit. Griffith asked whether someone had to be ""attacked first."" Griffith noted that only a handful of other states have similar laws. The third judge, Karen Henderson, a George H. W. Bush nominee, did not ask a question.One of biggest cases since HellerEight years ago, it was another Washington gun ordinance that triggered a landmark Supreme Court opinion -- District of Columbia v. Heller -- that held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. The opinion capped off a decades-long debate on whether the right applied only in connection to service in a state militia. Back in 2008, the law at issue concerned a total ban on handguns in the home. Tuesday's case deals with weapons outside the home.Gun rights advocates thought that Heller -- penned by the late Justice Antonin Scalia -- would encourage courts to strike down restrictions across the country. That didn't happen. Instead, many courts relied upon a different part of Scalia's opinion where he cautioned that the Second Amendment should not be understood as conferring a ""right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has declined to take up any follow-up cases. How Scalia will be replaced has become a major issue in the presidential race. Donald Trump has pledged to appoint conservative justices in the mold of Scalia. Trump's GOP primary rival, Ted Cruz, consistently name-checked the Heller decision. Hillary Clinton has advocated for stronger gun control laws. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama's nominee for the bench, Judge Merrick Garland, waits on the sidelines.The DC law at issue in Tuesday's case is based on similar provisions in New York, Maryland and New Jersey.Several plaintiffs are challenging the law, including Matthew Grace, who says he was denied a permit in 2016 because he had failed to show a ""good or proper reason"" to support his request for a license. He owns four lawfully registered handguns and seeks to carry them outside the home for self-defense.Grace's case and a similar one brought by different plaintiffs split two different district court judges reviewing the law.The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hear both appeals on Tuesday.""The District of Columbia has spent the last four decades trying to drain the Second Amendment of any meaning,"" Charles Cooper, a lawyer representing Grace and other plaintiffs, argued in court papers. Cooper objects to the fact that DC officials have given themselves the power to decide ""on a case-by-case basis"" whether an applicant has ""good reason"" to obtain a license to carry a concealed gun.He says that such a power is ""categorically irreconcilable"" with the Second Amendment. ""Nearly a decade after Heller, the District of Columbia still refuses to treat the right to bear arms as a genuine constitutional right,"" he said.  In their briefs, lawyers for the District of Columbia point out that Washington is ""unique"" in that it is filled with thousands of high ranking federal officials, and diplomats and it hosts hundreds of heavily attended events annually including political marches and protests. Citing Supreme Court precedent, they argue that the ""Second Amendment preserves the ability of local jurisdictions to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values, and that is precisely what the Council has done through the 'good reason' standard.""DC is supported by lawyers for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, who emphasize that from 2014 to 2015, the homicide rate in the District increased 54%.""The District may meet or surpass that tragic record in 2016,"" Jonathan Lowy, an attorney for the Brady Center, argued in briefs. He pointed out that in one DC area -- Ward 7 -- homicides have tripled so far this year.""It is critical that law enforcement maintain its longstanding authority to prevent the rampant carrying of guns in public places,"" Lowy said in an interview. ""It would be an extraordinary and radical shift for a court to find that law enforcement has no authority to reasonably regulate the carrying of hidden handguns in public.""But the National Rifle Association counters that while DC officials are ""rightly concerned about violent crime,"" the ""Constitution affords them considerable discretion in addressing the problem. """"The Second Amendment's protection of the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms' necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table."" NRA's lawyer Paul Clement argued in court briefs. ""Municipal leaders, no matter how well-intentioned, cannot simply enact any gun control law that they deem to be reasonable."""

The lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. The terrorism investigation in New York and New Jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with Trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues. Find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on ""The Daily DC"" podcastClinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with Trump. She is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity to her health. Trump showed he was willing to go there Tuesday when he tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!""Clinton, in a radio interview Tuesday, said she was ready to deal with Trump's attacks.""I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,"" Clinton said Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. ""I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport.""Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battleTo knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest.Clinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style.But Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton. Clinton told supporters at an August fundraiser that a friend told her: ""There will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. So don't assume they have followed anything."" ""There will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night,"" Clinton said.A team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including Ron Klain, who advised Obama, and Karen Dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. She is not setting up a formal ""debate camp,"" aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in Chappaqua, New York, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on Monday. Clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about Trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from Tony Schwartz, who was the co-author for ""Art of the Deal,"" the best-seller about Trump.Expectations gameClinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event. ""For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August. With her Senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with Barack Obama in 2008 and nine meetings with Bernie Sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times.2016 race tightens in FloridaTrump will not be the first unconventional opponent Clinton has faced in a debate. Clinton all-but ended her 2000 Senate race against Rick Lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the Republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. Lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and Clinton handily beat him by 12 points in November.Her debate last fall against four Democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions, including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the Democratic Party.""I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done,"" Clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning.Clinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. The former senator from New York cited the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to Wall Street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacking her on the issue. Which Trump will show up?In the last few weeks, as Clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks.Clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about Clinton's debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the Trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate. When asked about the debates, Clinton has tried to laud Trump's debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at Hofstra. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders""I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,"" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York.

As the track opens, YG says, ""Me and all my peoples, we always thought he was straight, influential motherf---er when it came to the business. But now, since we know how you really feel, this is how we feel. F--- Donald Trump."" Then he launches into his anthem, cursing the real estate mogul's name dozens of times.It was something of a new area for the West Coast rapper. The songs off his first album, like ""Bicken back being bool"" or ""Who do you love,"" were largely apolitical, even if they did veer into socially conscious territory once in a while. By his own admission, YG is ""not political."" He told CNN in a wide-ranging interview about his music over the summer his concerns over issues like Trump's anti-Mexican rhetoric and his dismissal of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement led him to speak out.""He can't be counted on to handle these issues. This issue is important to the black community, period. It's life,"" YG said. ""This s--- is bigger than hip- hop. ... We're supposed to use our platform to speak up and bring our brothers together and put some light on some of this s--- that's not right for our people.""YG also called out other rappers for not speaking out against what he considers a ""racist"" campaign. He said they were putting their personal interests and fear of backlash over their beliefs.""They're scared on what comes with it, what could come with it,"" YG said, adding, ""They're not doing business with Trump. ... They're saying they ain't political. They ain't going to get into all this s---... I'm not political either bro, but guess what? All that s--- matters.""YG said that fear of backlash is not unfounded, and added that he has faced repercussions over his song. He told TMZ in April that the US Secret Service reached out to his record label after he dropped ""FDT.""""If I talk about him on my album, they're gonna try to take it off the shelf,"" YG told TMZ.Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor declined to verify or deny those claims, telling CNN, ""The Secret Service does not discuss protective investigations.""What hip hop lyrics tell us about Donald TrumpPotential Secret Service warnings aside, the Compton rapper hasn't let up.In May 2016, he released a video where he read the lyrics to ""FDT"" from behind a podium, offering the lines as a point-by-point rebuttal to a Trump speech. Just before the Republican National Convention, YG released ""FDT Part 2,"" a remix featuring unlikely YG collaborators Macklemore and G-Eazy. On his verse to close out the song, YG nods to the two white rappers joining him and says of Trump, ""your own kind don't even like you."" ""I'm on tour with two of the biggest white rappers in the game right now,"" YG said. ""(The) fan base a little different than mine.
