EUROPEThe Irish want to know where to place their bets. Searches related to election odds and a popular online betting site rose in popularity throughout the week. The search ""Trump win"" increased by 5000%, which might suggest gambler's regret -- one betting website has already paid out $1.1 million on a Clinton victory.ASIAIn Singapore, it's all about Clinton and the dollar. Singaporeans searching for information about Clinton's FBI probe are also querying the Dow Jones and the price of Groupon shares. When news broke that the FBI was looking into new Clinton emails, the Dow dropped 125 points, but then rebounded later in the day once more information was released. Most investors are hoping for a Clinton win.AFRICAIn Ghana, people want to know when the election is; Ugandans are looking for recent polling statistics. Nigerians searching for ""the latest on Hillary Clinton"" are also checking out CNN polls; Kenyans, meanwhile, prefer Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight.Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college mapAUSTRALASIAAustralians don't want to miss the results -- and since they are many time zones away, they want to be sure they get their dates right.Related searches show that Aussies who are into US politics are also interested in what's going on in Lebanon. Last week, Lebanon elected the former army general Michel Aoun into power, ending the political vacuum which left the country without a head of state for 2 years. In New Zealand, searches for James Comey, Clinton and the FBI spiked this week. And like the Irish, New Zealanders are also placing their bets on who they think might win.NORTH AMERICACanadians are mostly interested in Clinton -- searches for James Comey, FBI Clinton and the Clinton emails have been trending since the latest in the email saga broke earlier this week."

A Clinton win in Ohio would be devastating to Trump's chances. CNN's Jeff Zeleny shared reporting on how Team Clinton hopes some superstar help brings a late campaign boost.            ""There's perhaps no other big city in America that speaks more to the final strategy of the Clinton campaign than Cleveland. ... Obviously, a huge share of the vote in Ohio is in Cleveland and around the surrounding area. But by this point, the Clinton campaign had hoped to be expanding into sort of more Republican areas. The old adage of Ohio is when Democrats are going to Cleveland at the end, that is to get out their base, and they aren't doing the independents and the persuasion.""2) The Obama factor: Clinton hardly the only beneficiary            President Obama speaking Spanish on the radio?            Jonathan Martin of The New York Times heard it with his own ears in the Miami area Saturday as the president tried to help Democrat Patrick Murphy in his race against incumbent Republican Marco Rubio.            Proof, Martin reports, that the unprecedented Obama effort in campaign 2016 is aimed at trying to do something he was unable to do in 2010 and 2014.       ""He's finally an asset after being a liability for much of the last eight years for his own party.  I was with him in Chapel Hill last week. He was as impassioned going after Richard Burr, the senator there, as he was Donald Trump. Almost ridiculing Burr for supporting Trump,"" explains Martin. ""Given his popularity he might pull some Democrats over the lines.""3) Military families are key targets in swing states            There are battlegrounds within battlegrounds that can sway the states that matter most -- including the effort to win the votes of military families.            Think Florida. And Virginia. Add in North Carolina. Plus Colorado. Four states where the votes of current and retired military members and their families are abundant -- and getting a lot of attention in these final days of the campaign.            CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson noted the importance of this vote in the Obama presidential wins as she discussed this campaign's final appeals.             ""In terms of ads, there are two more debuting during Sunday Night Football, i guess it's the Broncos and Raiders game. These are Hillary Clinton ads, 30-second ads featuring Republican, white men who served in the military. Talking about Donald Trump, talking about why they don't want to vote for Donald Trump, talking about his words about women,"" reports Henderson.  ""Interesting to look at it within the context of the military vote. Of 20 million veterans in this country, particularly in states like North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, Colorado. And we've seen both campaigns really go after this voting bloc.""4) Election will shape prospects for immigration legislation            This could well be the ""Year of the Latino"" when we break down the biggest factors in the election results -- and the impact could go well beyond who wins the White House.            CNN's Maeve Reston shared conversations with Republican lawmakers who want to advance immigration legislation through Congress. That's a tough sell with the conservatives who dominate the House.            But Reston reports that if Latinos punish Republican candidates, those GOPers looking to change the immigration debate hope their colleagues see a need to do something.""There's still a group of Republicans in Congress that is deeply committed to getting an immigration reform bill through Congress. And they are hoping that if there is a huge kind of anti-Trump Latino turnout, on Tuesday night, that will provide some momentum to actually finally get a bill through Congress,"" explains Reston. 5) GOP hopes of winning Reid's seat fading            Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid is retiring -- and Republicans had hoped to send him off with a thumping at home.            But those hopes -- of turning Reid's Nevada Senate seat from blue to red -- are fading because of a late surge in Latino early voting.            And if the GOP can't get that seat -- its one big hope for a pickup this year -- it complicates the Republican math for keeping its Senate majority.The GOP math begins with the current 54 seats. There are three expected losses: Illinois, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. So, if it plays out that way, Republicans would need to win all four of these: Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and North Carolina.Bullish Republicans think that is possible but it is scenario that leaves zero room for error."

Martin, author of the book series on which the show is based, stay away?Martin spent some of his finite time on Earth speaking to volunteers for Hillary Clinton in New Mexico after having written several online posts about the election. """"Hold the door!"" George R.R. Martin surprised volunteers in Santa Fe today to encourage early voting. Learn more: IWillVote.com,"" tweeted the Hillary Clinton for New Mexico campaign account, linking to a DNC voting tool along with a photo of Martin speaking.On November 4, Martin warned that New Mexico, a state CNN has rated as ""leans Democrat,"" was apparently competitive and bemoaned the ads he had seen from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Martin also wrote about the difference between the ads and went on to dismiss Trump at length, who he argued had ""said the vilest things any presidential candidate has said since George Wallace.""Martin has yet to finish two of the remaining books in his acclaimed series, currently billed as ""The Winds of Winter"" and ""A Dream of Spring."""

We don't,"" Weld said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Having said all of that, I do see a big difference between the two other candidates.""Weld said he wanted the Libertarian Party to earn at least 5% of the popular vote in the general election and thus qualify for federal funding and increased ballot access. But he also made sure to hammer home his problems with Donald Trump and his deep-seated respect for Clinton.Libertarian VP nominee: 'I'm here vouching for Mrs. Clinton'He called Trump ""totally unfit to be president"" and said Clinton was ""a perfectly reputable, professional, responsible candidate for president of the United States and deserves to be treated as such.""""Frankly, I think Mrs. Clinton has been receiving a pretty raw deal,"" Weld said.Weld and his running mate, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, failed to qualify for the national debates. He has since aimed his fire almost entirely at Trump and has repeatedly defended Clinton, or at least deferred on attacking her.When it comes to Clinton, the former Massachusetts governor and his running mate are divided. As Weld defended Clinton on CNN's State of the Union, Johnson told MSNBC that Clinton would be ""under a drumbeat"" of calls for impeachment.Asked about his running mate's defense of Clinton, Johnson told MSNBC: ""He's really got it in for Trump.""Johnson made their differences clear in his characteristically off-kilter style.

But the leakers should shut up,"" Podesta said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Podesta called the leaks ""worrisome."" Democrats have pointed to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's claims that agents within the FBI are angry that Director James Comey hasn't recommended charges against Clinton. Democrats have criticized Comey for revealing to Congress just 11 days before the election that the FBI had discovered new emails -- these on Anthony Weiner's personal laptop -- that could be related to its investigation into Clinton's private server. Podesta wouldn't call for Comey's resignation after the election. ""I've never questioned his motivation. I've just said it was a mistake,"" he said. ""It broke with precedent. There's a reason for that policy. It looked like that it was interfering with the election.""  "	John Podesta: FBI leakers should 'shut up'	['Clinton']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/hillary-clinton-new-hampshire/index.html	But then the FBI announced it was reviewing emails potentially related to her private server, and Clinton's campaign announced last week that she will rally with supporters in Manchester on Sunday.One key reason? The ghost of Al Gore.Gore lost New Hampshire by a mere 7,211 votes in 2000, a fraction that infuriated Democrats in the state given how little he campaigned there during the race.Gore, according to those Democrats, held one event in New Hampshire as the nominee, canoeing with Jeanne Shaheen on the Connecticut River in July.Democrats urged Gore to return to the state in the closing weeks of the race, but he declined, and did not dispatch President Bill Clinton -- who won the Granite State in 1992 and 1996 -- to campaign in New Hampshire, either.This history was not lost on many of Clinton's top aides, some of whom worked for either Bill Clinton or Gore at the time.Of course, there are other reasons for the trip, one of which is the number of pro-Bernie Sanders Democrats who have been reluctant to back Clinton. But one aide told CNN on Friday that one of the reasons Clinton was visiting the state less than 48 hours before Election Day was the lessons learned from Gore.James Taylor will perform at the Manchester event and Khizr Khan, whose son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, died from a suicide bombing in Baghdad 12 years ago, will speak. Khan was thrust into the national spotlight after he challenged Donald Trump in a speech at the Democratic National Convention.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/comey-tells-congress-fbi-has-not-changed-conclusions/index.html	"""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July,"" Comey wrote in the new letter to congressional committee chairmen.Comey dropped a bombshell on the presidential race last month when he sent a letter to Congress saying the FBI had discovered emails in a separate investigation that could be connected to the now-closed probe of whether Clinton mishandled classified information. The move infuriated Democrats and emboldened Republican nominee Donald Trump. It's impossible to know before results are tallied what impact Comey's actions -- first raising a vaguely worded red flag 11 days out, and then lowering it two days from the election -- will have on the contest. But the news could help Clinton put to rest a controversy that has dogged her in the 2016 race's closing days, helping Trump narrow a polling gap nationally and in key battleground states.Trump assailed the FBI's handling of the matter, though he did not directly address Comey's announcement at a rally in Sterling Heights, Michigan.""You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can't do it, folks,"" Trump said, adding, ""Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it, and now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8."" Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, blasted Comey's handling of the review.""Today's letter makes Director Comey's actions nine days ago even more troubling,"" Feinstein said in a statement. ""There's no doubt that it created a false impression about the nature of the agency's inquiry.""She added: ""The Justice Department needs to take a look at its procedures to prevent similar actions that could influence future elections.""'As fast as we could'Comey's letter was the culmination of a fast-paced review of the newly discovered email, law enforcement sources said Sunday.""We went through this as fast as we could,"" a senior law enforcement official told CNN, with another law enforcement official saying investigators worked ""around the clock"" to review the large volume of emails.The FBI found the new emails as part of its separate investigation into a sexting incident by Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The thousands of new emails were mostly personal and duplicates of what had already been seen, law enforcement officials said in explaining how the conclusion was reached so quickly. The laptop which was found was about a decade old with lots of personal content on it not relevant to the investigation, according to one source.The probe is considered over with regard to Clinton. Though with not all the deleted emails recovered and not all the devices in FBI's possession, it is always possible something else could turn up that would require more review. There were some classified emails found, but law enforcement officials stressed the issue is not the classified information so much as proving intent. The sources would not specify if the the classified messages were new or duplicates of ones already reviewed, nor would would officials say how many there were and what levels at which they were classified.""Keep in mind we are focused on intent,"" the official said. ""We know there are classified materials, but that doesn't change the conclusion reached back in July.""As for others who were part of the probe, including Abedin, the FBI is still working on some remaining aspects of the review, including determining how the emails ended up on the laptop in the first place. Abedin's attorneys have said she doesn't know why these emails were there because this wasn't a computer she used.The expectation remains that investigators will have to talk to Abedin again. It isn't uncommon to come across new evidence after concluding a probe -- which is what happened here in October. Normally, investigators take a look to see if anything changes in their conclusions and it's not a controversial issue. This case isn't a normal case, given the election and the stakes. DOJ informed of decisionComey sent the letter as soon as possible, the senior law enforcement official said. He was ""very careful"" about how the letter was crafted given the sensitivities.Attorney General Loretta Lynch was informed ahead of time that the FBI director was sending the updated letter to Congress informing them of that there would be no change in the FBI stance on Hillary Clinton, a Justice official told CNN on Sunday.Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates disagreed with Comey's earlier decision to notify Congress. The attorney general backed Comey's move Sunday. ""Everyone is on the same page,"" the source said.Since there is no change to the original findings, the Justice Department has no need to weigh in further, the official said.""The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously,"" the Justice Department said in a brief statement released Sunday afternoon.Campaigns weigh inClinton spokesman Brian Fallon said her campaign is validated in its belief that nothing would change.""We were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed it,"" he tweeted.The Trump campaign quickly slammed Comey.""We thought that Director Comey and the FBI were wrong when they made their initial recommendation in July, and we think that they're wrong now,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence sought to keep the pressure on Clinton.""Mishandling classified information is a crime,"" he said at a rally in an airport hanger in Hickory, North Carolina. ""Hillary Clinton said that she never sent or received any classified information and the director of the FBI told the Congress classified information was sent.""In Michigan, Trump called Clinton ""the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States.""But the Republican nominee, who has expressed hope in the last week that the FBI's review of new emails might yield an indictment, emphasized to his supporters Sunday that Clinton is ""protected"" by powerful forces.""Well, you have to understand it's a rigged system and she's protected,"" Trump said in Minnesota, though he offered no evidence to back up his theory.'It opened a wound'A senior Democrat close to Clinton's campaign told CNN that ""it's impossible to fully undo the damage of the last nine days.""Internal campaign polling, the source said, found that some independents and Republican women fled Clinton after the original Comey announcement, robbing her of a constituency that she'd hoped would turn her contest with Trump into a blowout.""It opened a wound that cannot be quickly healed,"" the Democrat said.However, the Democrat called it a relief that the ""matter is resolved"" and said Clinton's campaign plans to ""make everyone know about"" Comey's Sunday letter.Comey's last-minute announcement gives Clinton an opportunity for an I-told-you-so moment.""We have seen Director Comey's latest letter to the Hill,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, speaking with reporters after the news broke. ""We are glad to see that he has found, as we were confident that he would, that he had confirmed the conclusions he reached in July and we are glad that this matter is resolved."" Trump and his allies have seized on that announcement, using it to claim Clinton was likely to face criminal charges.""If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis,"" Trump claimed Saturday night in Reno, Nevada. ""In that situation we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial.  It would grind government to a halt.""Political benefitThe political benefit for Trump has been that Republicans who'd been skeptical of their party's nominee have largely followed vice presidential nominee Mike Pence's calls to ""come home"" to the party -- finding Trump less objectionable than Clinton.It's not just Trump's campaign that seized on Comey's actions. Down-ballot Republicans -- particularly Senate candidates who had been forced to answer for Trump's statements for months -- used the moment to change the topic, shifting to the more comfortable ground of attacking Clinton.The last-minute Sunday move from Comey could also provide new fuel for Trump's claims of a ""rigged"" system -- allowing him to cast the FBI director's intervention in the presidential election in a new light.Comey and the FBI went from Trump's scapegoat to the Republican nominee's hero, with Trump claiming Comey had redeemed himself just in time.Newt Gingrich, a top Trump ally, tweeted ""Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this.""Dems, GOP reactHouse Speaker Paul Ryan dismissed the significance of Comey's latest letter.""Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""Fortunately, the American people have the opportunity to ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again.""Capitol Hill Democrats praised Comey's decision to release more information.""While the original letter should never have been sent so close to an election, the expeditious review of these emails should put to rest -- once and for all -- the irresponsible speculation indulged in by the Trump campaign and others,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said. ""Voters can now make their decision based on the merits, and that decision should be simple: it is the choice between a woman superbly qualified to be commander in chief, and a man patently unfit for office.""Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus issued a statement saying, ""None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton should never be president."""	FBI clears Clinton -- again	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Feinstein', 'Wolf', 'Hill', 'Paul', 'Lynch']	[]

The polling location stayed open to allow voters who were already in line -- many of whom waited more than two hours, according to local reports -- to cast their ballots.""Last night, in Clark County, they kept a poll open 'til 10 o'clock at night so a certain group could vote,"" McDonald said in introductory remarks at the rally. ""The polls are supposed to close at 7. This was kept open until 10. Yeah, you feel free right now? You think this is a free and easy election? That's why it's important.""Dan Kulin, a spokesperson for the county, said no early no early voting stations extended their closing times. They did, however, process voters who were in line at closing time to allow as many people to vote as possible.The latest vote was cast at 10:10 p.m. at Silverado Ranch, which closed at 8 p.m. and had been experiencing about a two-hour delay when CNN visited the station.A message left with the Trump campaign was not immediately returned.Taking the stage here, Trump then suggested that the polling location's extended closing time to allow voters to cast their ballots is a sign of a ""rigged system"" pitted against his campaign.""It's being reported that certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring democratic voters in. Folks, it's a rigged system.  It's a rigged system and we're going to beat it. We're going to beat it,"" Trump said Saturday.His remarks were delivered before someone in the audience shouted ""gun,"" leading Secret Service agents to escort him off the stage. Trump was unharmed in the incident, and the Secret Service said in a statement that after a ""thorough search,"" no weapon was found.Polling locations are non-partisan, and a spokesperson with Clark County said voters who were already in line before the polls closed were still allowed to vote -- a common practice at polling locations around the country.More than 57,000 people voted in Clark County on Friday, the largest single-day early voting turnout in the county, according to data from the Nevada secretary of state's office that's based on the party registration of those who have voted.While polls are showing Trump competitive in the state, a surge of Hispanics casting their votes in early voting in the state has led many political observers to believe Trump's path to victory in the state has significantly narrowed."

US officials have said the releases bear the hallmarks of Russian meddling in the US election -- which WikiLeaks has denied.It is impossible to verify the authenticity of the emails or the context, as WikiLeaks controls their release and the Clinton campaign has refused to confirm or deny any documents' authenticity.The problems raised by Clinton's use and the legal challenges they might present came up in another discussion from Mills to Podesta, and top members of Clinton's communication team at the campaign in August 2015 when Mills forwarded information regarding a former CIA Director's use of classified material outside of the office.Clinton's use of the private email server, and the transmission of a small amount of material that was retroactively upgraded to classified status has drawn a great deal of criticism from across the Republican spectrum.Mills forwards an email she received from R. Scott Patrick, a former staffer at the Democratic National Committee and Bill Clinton, who wrote about ""deep and early precedent"" illustrated in a book by David Hoffman about the CIA of former Director Stansfield Turner who took home top secret classified reports that he ""edited and worked on.""Patrick recommended the campaign ""putting together a few highly respected intelligence service professionals that will push out a few talking points that will help level the playing field.""

He added: ""Meanwhile, news reports have detailed that a criminal investigation into Trump's former campaign chair is ongoing while two other Trump campaign associates are reportedly being looked at for their ties to the Russian hacking.
