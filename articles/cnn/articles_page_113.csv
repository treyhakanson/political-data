He characterized the GOP candidate -- who has recently stirred the pot in his own party, with several high-level Republicans renouncing their support for him -- with a litany of negatives, indicating his inability to be commander-in-chief. RELATED: GOP on the precipice""I actually believe that for the most part he's a fascist,"" Stipanovich told CNN's John Berman. ""He's a xenophobe, he's a racist, he's an isolationist, he's a protectionist, he has little respect for any part of the constitution except the second amendment. He's an authoritarian. The aura of violence clings to him. I believe he's a dangerous man.""Stipanovich, who hails from Florida, will still support Sen. Marco Rubio in his reelection campaign, even though he continues to stand behind Trump.""I'm not too proud of Marco,"" Stipanovich said. RELATED: As Trump gets 'unshackled,' Clinton's campaign sweats turnoutHe added that many Republicans up for re-election are failing to pull their support for Trump because they do not want to appear as if they are neglecting or abandoning the party, or their party's chosen candidate.

Huntsman said he never asked to meet Trump, but it was actually Trump who asked him to meet with him at Trump Tower. Huntsman had declined to participate in a planned presidential debate hosted by Donald Trump that year. The debate was eventually cancelled.Trump suggested repeatedly Huntsman could be lying, and took a shot at his faith. ""And the other thing is Governor Huntsman called my office asking for a meeting and I didn't call him back, which I could have and should have,"" Trump said to Fox News in early December 2011.  ""But he called my office asking for a meeting, and I'm sure, being a Mormon, he will absolutely confirm that. So that's one of those things.""The website CNS News also reported at the time Trump made similar comments in a conference call with reporters.""But, he wanted to, I just didn't do it. So, you know, I'm sure that he will admit that,"" Trump said. ""Being a Mormon, I know he doesn't lie.""And speaking on MSNBC's Daily Rundown several days later, Trump took aim at Huntsman's faith again. ""Mr. Huntsman call my office a number of times trying to set up a meeting, I didn't have a meeting with him,"" Trump said. ""And then he went on the debate and said, `I didn't meet with Mr. Trump like everybody else in the room.' So, you know, I'm sure he'll tell the truth about that, because he's a Mormon.""That night, Huntsman responded to Trump telling Fox News of Trump, ""I'm not going to kiss his ring, and I'm not going to kiss any other part of his anatomy.""On Hannity, Trump reiterated his comments, ""So, he's a Mormon, so I'm sure he wouldn't lie about it.""A spokesperson for Trump's campaign did not return a request for comment. Huntsman declined to relitigate his exchanges with Trump when asked for comment from CNN. ""Nothing here I wish to elaborate on,"" the former Utah governor said in an email.Huntsman called on Trump to drop out of the race after a 2005 video tape surfaced that showed Trump making lewd comments. The independent conservative candidate McMullin, a Mormon, took aim at Trump over his comments towards Huntsman.""Donald Trump has a long and shameful pattern of attacking religious and ethnic minorities. It comes as no surprise he'd have a record of bigoted remarks about LDS members like Jon Huntsman,"" he told CNN earlier this week.

Walker, of the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida, granted a preliminary injunction to the Florida Democratic Party and other groups who had argued that voter registration needed to be moved because of the effects of the storm, which raked along the Eastern Coastline for several days. ""No right is more precious than having a voice in our democracy,"" wrote Walker, who was appointed in 2012 by President Barack Obama wrote in a brief order. ""Hopefully, it is not lost on anyone that the right to have a voice is why this great country exists in the first place,"" he said. The judge noted that he had heard testimony from the Leon County Supervisor of Elections who said the magnitude of the storm imposed ""tremendous strain"" on elections offices. He also noted that the storm delayed naturalization ceremonies and that new citizens ""through no fault of their own"" would not have had the opportunity to vote in the election absent his order.A spokesperson for the Florida Secretary of State's office said they have already sent the order to the Supervisor of Elections.The original deadline was Tuesday, but the judge had temporarily moved it to Wednesday so that he could hold a hearing on the matter.Marc Elias — an attorney for the Florida Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign -- had argued in court papers that Florida voters faced a ""daunting, and indeed, life threatening obstacle"" to register to vote because of Hurricane Matthew. He said ""a massive and dangerous weather event that has threatened Florida with substantial damage and loss of life.""Last week, Republican Gov. Rick Scott told reporters he didn't ""intend to make changes,"" saying ""people have had time to register.""""We'll now be able to make up for lost time and help register people whose lives were disrupted by the storm,"" said Pamela Goodman, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida. ""Our goal is to help every Floridian register, vote, and be heard, and we're grateful that the storm did not silence their voices.""""Federal law requires the state to provide voters with enough time to register before the election,"" said Myrna Pérez, deputy director of the Brennan Center's Democracy Program. ""With this extension, more citizens will be able to exercise their most fundamental right in our democracy."	Judge extends Florida voter registration deadline until October 18

""She did it to me all time. It's not a problem. But I will say this: When Hillary opens her mouth, people die.""On Tuesday, LePage said maybe Trump needed to show ""authoritarian power"" as president to bring back the rule of law.  At a news conference on Wednesday, LePage backtracked slightly on those comments, saying, ""Yesterday, I used the word authoritarian when I meant to use the word authoritative.""At the news conference, LePage added that President Barack Obama was a dictator."

""Anything that undermines the legitimacy of the electoral process is bad news for democracy,"" said professor John Naughton, co-director of the Technology and Democracy Project at Cambridge University in the UK. ""Even the idea of Russian involvement could be seen by some as confirmation that the election is flawed,"" he told CNN. The Kremlin categorically denies any Russian state involvement in hacking.Hacking groups linked with different wings of the powerful Russian intelligence services -- code-named Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear -- were detected inside a Democratic Party server earlier this year, according to CrowdStrike, the US Internet security firm hired to investigate the theft of thousands of emails.Damaging revelationsSome of the emails, later released online, contained embarrassing details of the Democratic Party's inner workings, including correspondence revealing how opposed some party officials were to Hillary Clinton's rival, Bernie Sanders. The damaging revelations eventually forced Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as Democratic National Committee chair in what could be an unprecedented example of the Kremlin not covertly, but directly, intervening in US politics.A joint statement from the Office of the US Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security pinned blame for the hacking on the Russian leadership. ""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the statement read. Just how deep does the alleged Russian penetration go remains the subject of an FBI investigation. But allegations have surfaced of Russian hackers attempting to access US voter records, of trying to sabotage the physical ballot and of unleashing its troll army -- Internet bloggers paid by the Kremlin to spread false information online -- in support of Republican nominee Donald Trump. Both Trump and the Kremlin deny any links to hacking or to each other, but the issue again surfaced in the second US presidential debate on Sunday. ""We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,"" said Clinton, the Democratic Party nominee, during a heated exchange in the debate.  ""And believe me, they are not doing it to get me elected. They are doing it to influence the election for Donald Trump."" Suspicions have been fueled by the tightly controlled Russian media, which have made no secret of their preference for a Trump presidency. Whatever the truth, the Putin factor has emerged as a key issue in the US presidential campaign and that in itself may be interpreted as a victory by the Kremlin. President Vladimir Putin has long sought to cast Russia as a powerful force on the international stage, able to influence events and make its views heard. Researchers say the idea that Russia is thought of as being powerful enough to influence a US election may be satisfying to a leader like Putin. The issue of US electoral intervention also raises broader, much darker concerns -- that go way beyond Russia -- about the way the Internet can now be used not just to promote democracy but also to undermine it. ""Only now are we beginning to see the long-term impact of the technology,"" Naughton warned.""We are beginning to find out what the Internet really means."""

Monmouth found Trump garnering the support of 46% of likely Missouri voters, while Hillary Clinton trailed with 41%. Five percent of the state's voters said they intend to back Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, while just 2% gave the nod to Green Party nominee Jill Stein. About one-third of the poll's interviews were conducted prior to Sunday night's debate between Trump and Clinton, which was held in St. Louis. But the poll was conducted entirely after the release of last week's bombshell recording in which Trump can be heard making a lewd comment about groping women. Fifty-one percent of Missouri voters said that Trump's comments in the tape were ""inappropriate"" but do not necessarily make him unfit for office, according to the poll, while 35% said they do make him unfit. Monmouth's previous poll of Missouri in August showed Trump and Clinton locked in a virtual tie. The latest Monmouth poll was conducted October 9-11 using phone interviews with 406 likely Missouri voters. It has a margin of error of 4.9%. "	Presidential poll: Trump holding on to lead in Missouri
6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/politics/donald-trump-ad-reality-check/index.html	"Check out the script:Pretty hard-hitting, right? The only problem is that compiling unsubstantiated claims, misleading statements and one outright falsehood, the Trump campaign has produced an ad that is breathtaking in its dishonesty.It is certainly true that the Clintons went from what Hillary Clinton termed ""dead broke"" when they left the White House in 2001 to earning more than $10 million in 2015 and $28 million the year before, as well as owning at least three homes -- two in New York, one in Washington -- valued in the millions. But the ad suggests the couple became rich because of ""staggering amounts of cash"" given to the Clinton Foundation. This is false. The Clintons, according to the foundation's tax records, do not receive any income from the foundation. And according to the Clinton's personal tax records they receive most of their income from books and paid speeches.Neither the narrator, nor any background text in the ad identify the criminals, dictators and countries that ""hate America"" that have allegedly given to the foundation. To be sure, the relief effort in Haiti following the catastrophic 2010 earthquake -- an effort that was, in many ways led by Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation -- has been a mixed-success. Some aspects of the overall relief effort have been criticized for poor planning and cronyism but because the ad does not specifically say how Haitians were ""exploited,""  we can't issue a verdict.The charge that Clinton personally gave American uranium rights to the Russians is, at best, misleading. The US government did, indeed, approve a deal that allowed a Russian state agency to purchase a controlling stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company with significant uranium assets in the US. The company, at one time, included investors who had contributed to the Clinton Foundation.The State Department did approve the transaction. But it was one of nine US agencies, including Treasury, Commerce, Defense, energy and Homeland Security, as well as at least one state regulator, that had to sign off on the deal.Overall this ad is false.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/us-turkey-iraq-tensions-mosul-isis-fight/index.html	"The flap over the presence of Turkish troops in northern Iraq, which the government in Baghdad objects to because the forces are there without its permission, could undermine recent gains in the fight against the terror group and disrupt the upcoming effort to retake Mosul.""It is imperative for all parties to coordinate closely over the coming days and weeks to ensure unity of effort in defeating Daesh and to provide for the lasting security of the Iraqi people,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement issued Tuesday, using another name for ISIS. Kirby however did not mention Turkey by name saying he was addressing ""the role that international forces will play in the Iraqi operation to liberate Mosul.""The statement comes as tensions have increased between Turkey and Iraq amid ratcheted rhetoric from the leaders of both countries.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted Tuesday that Turkish troops would take part in the Mosul offensive whatever the views of the government in Baghdad. Erdogan said Turkey would act inside Iraq and Syria on its own terms. ""We do not need to take permission for this, we are not planning to get it,"" he told a conference in Istanbul. The Turkish leader also slammed Iraq's Prime Minister Haider Abadi for raising his opposition to the contingent of Turkish soldiers, telling him ""You should know your level.""For his part Abadi rebuked Erdogan in a post on Twitter, saying ""we are not your enemy and we will liberate our land through the determination of our men and not by video calls"" -- an apparent mocking reference to the attempted July coup  in Turkey, when Erdogan appeared on Turkish television via a FaceTime video call claiming he was still in charge.The Pentagon has also echoed the State Department's calls to focus on ISIS and to not let the current row distract from that fight.""We call on both governments to focus on their common enemy: ISIL,"" Pentagon spokesman Matthew Allen told CNN, using the government's preferred acronym for the terror group. ""It is imperative for all parties over the coming days and weeks to closely coordinate next steps to ensure unity of effort in our counter-ISIL fight.""A US defense official told CNN that 1,000 Turkish soldiers are stationed in Bashiqa in Nineveh province, northeast of the ISIS held-city of Mosul, the terror group's most important bastion in Iraq.The area is close to the ISIS frontlines and Turkish troops recently repelled an ISIS attack on the Turkish installation. The soldiers are there to train Kurdish and Arab fighters as part of an ""understanding,"" in the words of the US defense official, between Ankara and the semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq.While the Turkish government is locked in a decades-long battle with Kurdish separatists in Turkey and considers Kurdish groups in Syria to be terrorists, Turkey enjoys a close economic and political relationship with the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq, a semi-autonomous body that has welcomed the Turkish forces despite Baghdad's opposition.Though Baghdad shares the Turkish and Kurdish goal of freeing Mosul from ISIS, it has long been wary of the Kurds and foreign powers exercising too much control and influence in northern Iraq, which could undermine the central government's authority and even increase the potential for secession.In the short term, the Turkish presence could exacerbate strains between Baghdad and Kurdistan just as US officials have said that collaboration between them is essential to the Mosul fight.The US defense official said that Turkey has recently increased its training efforts in Bashiqa in anticipation of the Mosul offensive. He said that the uptick likely contributed to the latest round of protest from Baghdad.It also came after Erdogan declared his country couldn't be excluded from the Mosul offensive and the parliament renewed its approval of troops in Iraq and Syria.Last week, Iraq's cabinet condemned Erdogan's statement as a blatant interference in Iraqi affairs and an attempt to stir up sedition, after the Iraqi government slammed Turkey for having ""poisoned"" relations with ""futile statements.""The campaign to reclaim Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, could begin as early as this month, and it's expected to be tough. Anything that makes the task harder for the US and its allies concerns US officials.""We now have all the pieces in place,"" Brett McGurk, America's special presidential envoy for the fight against ISIS, told reporters at the State Department Friday.But US officials acknowledge that creating the 30,000-strong force preparing to recapture Mosul has involved a lot of negotiations, as it comprises a wide array of groups, with the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi army making up the bulk of the force. Iraqi security forces are leading the ground campaign in Iraq, battling ISIS with the backing of US and coalition airstrikes and advisers. The US recently announced the deployment of 600 additional US troops to aid in the city's capture.""Getting all of these forces together and arranged ... takes an awful lot of work,"" McGurk said, pointing to more than 100 meetings over three and a half weeks attended by US officials to develop each group's battle plan.""We worked very hard and had very close cooperation with our partners"" in Baghdad and Iraqi Kurdistan ""to agree on the overall disposition of forces, where everybody will go, what they will do,"" he added.McGurk said there have been similarly intense negotiations among Iraq's political groups about how to stabilize and govern the diverse city should the military campaign against ISIS in Mosul succeed, including which groups will be allowed to govern and police which parts of the city.Nick Heras, a Middle East researcher at the Center for New American Security in Washington, told CNN that the Iraqi-Turkish dispute could pose ""a serious challenge"" to efforts to stabilize Mosul because it could lead to various factions vying for control amid what many believe would likely be a major refugee crisis.Heras added that Baghdad, the Kurds, and Ankara were all vying for influence in Mosul, with the US caught ""trying to play referee.""Heras said that Turkey was training some 4,000 Sunni Arab fighters, many of them former local police or low-level Iraqi army soldiers, as part of an effort to influence the political situation in Mosul following its liberation from ISIS. The government in Baghdad is ruled by a majority Shiite coalition, while the denizens of Mosul are largely Sunni.The Iraqi Kurds and Turkish government are allies because ""neither believe that Baghdad will have the ability to govern Mosul after ISIS,"" Heras said, and they want to ensure that the area remains stable rather than give rise to another terrorist or insurgent movement.Heras added that Turkey has managed to extend a considerable amount of sway over the Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil.The US has not taken a firm position on the presence of Turkish troops in Iraq and has declined to rebuke Turkey publicly for its unauthorized troop presence. Despite the risks they pose to the Mosul mission and the integrity of a unified Iraq, the US is working closely with Turkey, its long-time NATO ally, in the ongoing effort to drive ISIS out of the Syria-Turkish border region in northern Syria.Addressing the Turkey-Iraq strain, McGurk stressed the importance of maintaining the ""sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq,"" adding that, ""All military activities in Iraq have to be with the full consent and coordination of the government of Iraq.""This sentiment was echoed in the statement issued Tuesday, although that statement by Kirby did not mention Turkey by name.McGurk attributed the row over the Turkish presence to ""some miscommunication or something"" that prevented Turkey from gaining the consent of the Iraqi government for Turkish troops deploying in the north when the units arrived a year ago.But McGurk also welcomed the Turkish-trained forces joining the fight against ISIS in Mosul.""They have trained a number of local Nineveh fighters and we are prepared to incorporate those fighters into the operation under the Iraqi command,"" he added.Ankara and Baghdad summoned each other's ambassadors Wednesday after escalating rhetoric from both governments. The Foreign Ministry in Baghdad said the Turkish envoy had been called in because of ""provocative statements"" by Turkey. Iraq has vowed to formally protest the Turkish presence at the UN.The US has said the dispute needs to be worked out bilaterally between the two allies.""This is an issue for the government of Turkey and the government of Iraq to speak to,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook told reporters Thursday in Washington.A US defense official told CNN that the US takes no position on the legality of the Turkish presence in Iraq, with another official adding, ""We are monitoring the situation closely."""
