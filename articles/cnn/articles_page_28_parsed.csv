In the wake of 60% of the state's voters supporting the presidential loser, Hillary Clinton, the movement is getting renewed interest.""As the sixth largest economy in the world, California is more economically powerful than France and has a population larger than Poland. Point-by-point, California compares and competes with countries, not just the 49 other states,"" the campaign's website said. The #calexit name stems from the successful ""brexit"" campaign in Britain to leave the European Union. While the Yes Campaign has been considered a fringe movement in the past, it began trending on social media Wednesday night attracting more mainstream notice. Supporters are proposing a referendum on the issue in 2019.The referendum would ask whether voters think California should become an independent country. It is mainly a way to gauge interest on whether Californians prefer statehood or want to move toward nationhood.Of course, a secession is highly unlikely. Other politicians have talked of their states leaving the Union in the past with to no avail. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry suggested his state might leave the United States in 2009 during the rise of the tea party. That effort never gained traction.Thousands take to the streets to protest Trump winStill, Hundreds of protesters -- many of them Latino -- hit Los Angeles City Hall Wednesday night chanting ""¡Si se puede!"" (Spanish for ""yes, it's possible"" or ""yes, one can"" -- a longtime rallying cry of the United Farm Workers).Activists chanting #NotMyPresident in cities from coast-to-coast occupied the streets protesting the election results that made the former reality show star the next president. Police estimated that thousands of people stood outside New York City's Trump Tower protesting the president-elect's positions on immigration and law enforcement.  ""I came out here to let go of a lot of fear that was sparked as soon as I saw the results,"" protester Nick Powers told CNN.

Obviously he's going to build it. It's a campaign promise. He's not going to break a campaign promise,"" Giuliani told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day.""Cuomo pointed out there is bipartisan opposition to the idea of a wall in Congress, to which Giuliani said something very interesting that could presage a very interesting debate over executive power.""Well, he can do it by executive order by just reprogramming money within the, within the immigration service,"" Giuliani said. ""And not only that, they have actually approved a wall for certain portions of the border that hasn't even been built yet. So you could take a year building that out, with what has been approved.""During the campaign, CNN imagined the red tape the wall might encounter in bureaucratic Washington. It'll have to go through government agencies and, theoretically, Congress, which controls the purse strings through bills to authorize programs and then separate bills to appropriate money for them.How will Trump and Congress get along?Even lawmakers who support a wall might balk at the idea of a major project being started without their say-so.As CNN's Capitol Hill team reported recently, there is currently little appetite for the wall among top Republicans. Asked three times by CNN if he supports Trump's signature plan to build a wall with Mexico, US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would only say: ""I want to achieve border security the way that's most effective."""

He's practicing some unusual humility.""I pledge to every citizen of our lands that I will be the president for the American people,"" Trump said in his victory speech Tuesday. ""For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, for which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so we can work together and unify our great country.""But his challenges were on clear display Wednesday as protests broke out from Boston to Los Angeles.Trump's meeting with Obama promises to be one of the most awkward encounters ever between a president and his successor. The President-elect's agenda is diametrically opposed to Obama, including the repeal of his signature health care law.Obama faces sharp repudiation and a legacy nightmareTrump built his political career and appeal to what eventually became his base with his crusade to prove that Obama was not a natural born citizen and was not therefore eligible for the presidency. Many Democrats found his antics racist and deeply offensive to the first African-American president.Partly spurred by his contempt for Trump, Obama used the power of his office like no other president before him to make the case on the campaign trail that his potential successor was essentially un-American, unfit for the presidency and too risky to be trusted with the nuclear codes.""The president made a forceful argument and he stands by that argument, but the time for making that argument has passed,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday. ""The American people rendered their judgment, and President Obama doesn't get to choose his successor, the American people do, and they did.""Preserving the integrity of American democracy makes it incumbent on Obama to ensure the peaceful transition of power, despite his own deep reservations and antipathy toward his successor.Trump is also under immediate pressure to build a relationship with Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, who have often viewed him with deep skepticism but are now crucial to his agenda .Trump must build an administration that is ready to hit the ground running January 20. And perhaps his most daunting assignment is building a national security structure from scratch, and bringing his own sketchy foreign policy and national security credentials up to speed.Every president who walks into the Oval Office faces an adjustment to the inhuman demands of the presidency. Obama is fond of saying that only problems that no one else can solve reach the President's desk.How Donald Trump wonBut Trump is the only man ever to win the presidency with no political, diplomatic or military executive experience, so his learning curve to becoming the most powerful man in the world will be even steeper.Trump is no longer on the campaign trail and is not therefore subject to the same pressures that a candidate faces. So in a sense, the transition allows him to reset and at least attempt to adopt a more presidential posture.His task will be exacerbated by the fact that he appears on track to lose the popular vote to Clinton, even though he won the electoral college -- a factor that undercuts any claims of a mandate.Clinton's 2008 campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle, a CNN contributor, said Trump needs to make amends to Americans insulted by his conduct -- including African-Americans, women and Hispanics.""I think he needs to start with an apology — honestly,"" she said on CNN's ""The Lead."" Given the President-elect's reluctance to admit he is wrong, that step at least seems unlikely.Trump's new audience stretches beyond Washington and the United States. US allies were alarmed by Trump's victory, given his criticism of US alliances overseas and hazy knowledge of defense and nuclear doctrine.Adversaries like Russia and China will already be gaming out how best they can take advantage of their inexperienced new counterpart in Washington.How Republicans scrambled to hold the SenateWhile Trump has the advantage of a ready-made domestic program given Republican control of Congress, he has no such luxury when it comes to national security policy.Trump's foreign policy team also lacks a diplomatic heavy hitter respected abroad: speculation is mounting that he will bring in someone who is a known quantity overseas as Secretary of State — someone like Sen. Bob Corker, who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.He has just over two months to staff the State Department, Pentagon, his White House National Security staff, install new leadership at the Intelligence Agencies and begin to install top diplomatic envoys overseas.It would be a daunting task for any president. Trump is further handicapped by the fact that a huge chunk of the Republican national security establishment, alarmed by his volatile temperament and rudimentary knowledge, defected en masse to Clinton.But the most fundamental question facing Trump may be his own temperament.The idea that the President-elect was too erratic and volatile to be commander-in-chief was at the center of Clinton's campaign, and many Americans and foreigners alike worry that his inauguration will usher in a period full of danger and risks.Who could be in the Trump administration?Trump showed at times on the campaign trail that he could be disciplined. Such a demeanor will be even more crucial now because a stray word from a president who can send financial markets tumbling or send foreign armies onto red alert.The transition period will be a time for him to try on his new role as a statesman.The question is whether he will be the version of Trump who vowed to throw Clinton in jail or someone with a personality more becoming of a commander in chief.""Is this the Donald Trump who wanted to ban all Muslims coming into America?"" CNN contributor Matt Lewis, a conservative author, said on CNN Wednesday. ""Or is this the Donald Trump that sounded a much more conciliatory last night?He added: ""I hope that he was sort of fronting a little bit to win the election and that he will actually govern in a more statesmanlike manner."""

Right? This is America, you can't be a dictator.""Barrack explained that Trump will have to govern more like the man who delivered a gracious acceptance speech than the candidate who said he would put Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in jail. ""What's happening is you're moving from 'Candidate Trump' to 'President Trump,' and I analogize it to 'Candidate Trump' was like a UFC Fighter in the middle of an octagon and he was a martial artist using every tool that he could to convey a message,"" he said.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/donald-trump-obama-paul-ryan-washington/index.html	"Three days after mocking Trump as unfit to control the codes needed to launch nuclear weapons, Obama told his successor that he wanted him to succeed and would do everything he could to ensure a smooth transition.Trump, who spent years pursuing Obama over false claims he is not a natural-born American and accused him of being the founder of ISIS on the campaign trail, called Obama a ""very good man"" and said he would seek his counsel in future.The extraordinary meeting was a reflection of the swift and sudden change in the political mood between the frenzied last days of an election campaign and the reality of government and the transition of power between two administrations that follows.""My No. 1 priority in the next two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful,"" Obama said.Obama told Trump: ""If you succeed, the country succeeds,"" as the two men sat in high-backed chairs in front of the fireplace in the Oval Office.Trump thanked Obama for the meeting which he said had originally been scheduled for 10 minutes and went on for 90.""Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times,"" Trump said, adding that he and Obama had spoken about some wonderful and difficult things and ""some high-flying assets."" It was not immediately clear what he meant.The President-elect also said he would seek ""counsel"" from Obama.As the pool of reporters were led out, Trump told them several times that Obama was ""a very good man.""Heavy burdenIt comes with many Americans, especially Democrats and liberals, still in disbelief and shock at Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, after the most vicious and unconventional campaign in modern history.The meeting, and Trump's stern demeanor, also underscored how the heavy burden of the presidency begins to settle on the shoulders of a President-elect. In Trump's case, that process will be especially challenging giving that he will be the first president elected with not political, diplomatic or military executive experience.Republican National Committee chairman Reince Preibus, who is being mentioned as a possible chief of staff in Trump's White House, told CNN's Jake Tapper that Americans would appreciate Trump's demeanor in Washington.""I hope that everyone has seen sort of this presidential Donald Trump that we knew all along was up to the task and I think is going to make us all proud,"" Preibus said. Thursday evening, Trump tweeted about the meeting, writing, ""A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!""Smooth transitionIt is also clear that Obama's determination to facilitate a smooth and effective transition, like the one he was provided by outgoing President George W. Bush, is a reflection of his desire not to permit any animosity towards Trump from he or his staff that would detract from his own legacy in the final days of his presidency.The temporary truce between the White House and Trump and his Republican Party however obscures the deep shock, and disquiet about Trump and his temperament inside the White House and among Democrats.CNN's Jim Acosta said one senior White House official responded with a single word -- ""unbelievable"" when asked about Trump's comment that he would seek ""counsel"" from the current President. The official said no one in the White House had changed their mind about Trump, despite their commitment to a smooth political transition.Still, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that given the history between them, the meeting between Obama and Trump in which they were alone in the Oval Office, was ""a little less awkward"" than might be expected and they did not recreate some kind of presidential debate during the talks over their stark political differences.While Trump and Obama met, first lady Michelle Obama spent time with Trump's wife, Melania.Trump's first visit to Washington began as the President-elect began around 10:30 a.m. when the plane emblazoned with his last name landed at Reagan National Airport, marking a new beginning for America.Trump went to meet House Speaker Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill after the White House visit and also saw Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell while in town. Vice President-elect Mike Pence met Vice President Joe Biden.After meeting McConnell, Trump outlined his priorities. ""We'll look very strongly at immigration. We're going to look at the border, very important. We're going to look very strongly on health care. And we're looking at jobs, big league jobs.""While Trump and Obama were meeting, the billionaire's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and communications aide Hope Hicks met senior members of the White House staff.Earnest said that Obama briefed Trump on his last foreign trip -- to Greece, Germany and Peru next week -- and that the President left the talks with ""renewed confidence"" that Trump was committed to a smooth transition.Acrimony on the campaign trailThe symbolism of a President and a President-elect being together is always powerful. But it was especially notable on Thursday given the bitter history between them.Throughout Obama's presidency, Trump persistently sought to undermine the legitimacy of the nation's first African-American presidency by questioning his citizenship and his Christian faith.""He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there's something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim,"" Trump told Fox News in 2011. ""I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that.""The campaign was considered a racial attack by many people close to Obama.When Obama, attempting to put a stop to the falsehood, released his ""long-form"" birth certificate from Hawaii in April 2011, Trump continued to claim it was somehow faked.It took until September 2016 -- two months before a presidential election in which he was already the Republican Party's nominee -- for Trump to admit the reality that Obama was, indeed, born in the United States.And when he did so, it was only in a brief statement with no explanation of why he'd changed his long-held belief, aside from saying in interviews later that he wanted to get the question off the table in the heat of the campaign.Obama has directed his own barbs at Trump, too.  At the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner, with Trump in the audience, Obama mocked Trump's birtherism, in a biting attack that crossed the line between humor and sarcasm into overt personal hostility.""He can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter -- like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"" Obama said of Trump.He also cast Trump as incompetent and unhinged on the campaign trail, citing a New York Times report that Trump's staff had taken his Twitter account away from him after a 3 a.m. rant about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.  ""They had so little confidence in his self-control, they said, 'We are just going to take away your Twitter.' Now, if somebody can't handle a Twitter account, they can't handle the nuclear codes,"" Obama said on Sunday in Florida, and made similar comments in New Hampshire on election eve."

""And in those places, there's certainly room for talented women, not only in those places but across the cabinet,"" Sununu said. In an interview this past summer, Trump mentioned his daughter Ivanka Trump when asked to list possible female candidates for cabinet positions.""Well there are so many different ones to choose, I can tell you everybody would say -- 'Put Ivanka in! Put Ivanka in!' You know that, right?"" Trump replied.""She's very popular, she's done very well. And you know Ivanka very well. But there really are so many that are talented people, like you,"" he added. ""You're so talented, I don't know if your viewers know that."" The GOP nominee continued to joke about naming Savage to his cabinet. Trump attracted some criticism in May when no woman made the short list for his vice presidential pick.Former campaign manager Paul Manafort said at the time that Trump was unlikely to pick a woman or minority for the position because ""that would be viewed as pandering, I think."""

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/gary-johnson-jill-stein-spoiler/index.html	"Trump won 290 Electoral College votes to 232 for Hillary Clinton, as of Wednesday evening, with Clinton topping him in the popular vote. But had the Democrats managed to capture the bulk of third-party voters in some of the closest contests -- Wisconsin (10), Pennsylvania (20), Michigan (16) and Florida (29) -- Clinton would have defeated Trump by earning 307 Electoral College votes, enough to secure the presidency. The entire scenario conjures up memories of Ralph Nader's Green Party run in 2000. Nader's share of the vote in that year's razor-thin Florida contest was 1.63%, according to the final totals from the Federal Election Commission. Bush won the state by just .05%, which tipped the Electoral College in his favor. (Nader has for years denied his candidacy played a role in Bush's 2000 victory.)It's impossible to know how an election could have gone under hypothetical scenarios, but the Johnson campaign regularly said they thought they were pulling support equally from would-be Trump supporters and would-be Clinton voters. Stein's campaign, meanwhile, made a constant, explicit appeal to disenchanted Democrats and former supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. If Johnson and Stein weren't in the race, it's also possible many of their supporters may have stayed home. But if about half of Johnson's supporters would have voted for Clinton over Trump, and if most of Stein's supporters broke for the Democrats, the electoral map would have been decidedly different.For what it's worth, both Johnson and Stein have in repeated interviews with CNN taken offense at the notion they would spoil the race. Johnson said he hoped his candidacy would wipe out the two-party system and, in a recent MSNBC appearance, literally held his nose shut at the mention of Clinton and Trump. Stein said she would not ""sleep well"" in the event of a Clinton or Trump presidency and suggested Clinton would be more likely to start a nuclear war than the current president-elect.However, Johnson's running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, took a different tack. He defended Clinton regularly and argued Trump was a unique threat to the United States.Johnson campaign spokesman Joe Hunter told CNN on Thursday ""the Johnson/Weld campaign was clearly a factor"" and cited Colorado as a place where the Libertarian presidential campaign may have actually benefited Clinton.""To the extent that independents and others found a voice through our campaign, were heard, and impacted the outcome, that is success -- and ultimately an important step toward breaking the two-party hold on the system,"" Hunter said.Also in a response on Thursday, Stein campaign press director Meleiza Figueroa dismissed any impact the Green Party may have had on the presidential election, citing the campaign's marginal showing in battleground states.""There is no way statistically we could have been a ""spoiler"" for the outcome of the election,"" Figueroa said. ""In any case, the solution to a potential 'spoiler' scenario should never be to silence political opposition and limit democracy to two corporate-sponsored choices.""Here's the breakdown of what might have been, based on available totals for the key states:Florida (29 electoral votes)Trump stood 119,770 votes ahead of Clinton, with 99% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 270,026 votes -- well more than double Trump's margin of victory. CNN projected a Trump victory here.If half of Johnson's supporters and all of Stein's supporters had voted Clinton, it would have flipped the state.Michigan (16 electoral votes)Trump stood 11,837 votes ahead of Clinton, with 96% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 223,707 votes -- almost 20 times more than the margin as of this writing. CNN has not yet projected a victory here.If half of Johnson's supporters and all of Stein's supporters had voted Clinton, it could have delivered a Democratic win here.Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes)Trump stood 68,236 votes ahead of Clinton, with 99% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 191,565 -- almost three times Trump's margin of victory. CNN projected a Trump victory here.If half of Johnson's supporters and all of Stein's supporters had voted Clinton, it would have flipped the state.Wisconsin (10 electoral votes)Trump stood 27,257 votes ahead of Clinton, with 95% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 137,422 votes -- about five times Trump's margin of victory.

How Donald Trump wonHere's a look at some of the most notable examples:Low energyEarly on in the primary Trump labeled former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as ""low energy,"" and while the dig seems very mild compared to other nicknames Trump had for his opponents like ""Crooked Hillary"" and ""Lyin' Ted,"" the insult stuck to the mild-mannered Bush like glue.""I defined him. I gave him this term, 'Low energy.' I said he's a low energy individual,"" Trump explained to Jimmy Kimmel last December. ""We do not need in this country low energy. Do you agree with that? We need high energy.""You can no longer assess a person's energy without the ghost of the Trump vs. Bush battle creeping up on you. You will inevitably ask yourself, ""Am I a Trump or a Bush?"" Trump calls Obama 'a very good man' after historic White House meetingHuge/YuuugePresident-elect Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are both New York City natives with ""yuuge"" New York accents.Their unique way of pronouncing ""huge"" when talking about ""yuuge"" movements or ""yuuge"" crowds stood out to Americans across the nation and this 2016 political buzz word is now forever archived in GIFs, Vines and the subconscious of politically engaged American minds.  LightweightBefore 2016 ""lightweight"" was prominently used to describe a person or an item's weight, particularly in sports like boxing. But after 2016, ""Lightweight,"" which is one of Trump's most prolifically used attacks, will forever be heard as an insult.Trump has referred to tens of people as ""lightweight"" to imply that they are daft or unsubstantial. He repeatedly called FOX News' Megyn Kelly a ""lightweight."" ""I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!"" he tweeted in January.He also dismissed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as a ""dishonest lightweight.""""Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown,"" he tweeted in February.""I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida,"" Trump tweeted in March.He slammed a former acting director of the CIA, Mike Morell, tweeting, ""Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!""SAD!Trump's tweets often ended with what we could refer to as ""Trump-xclamations"" -- a single word with an exclamation mark, often capitalized, at the end of a tweet for dramatic effect. Sometimes he added ""very"" for emphasis and used ""SAD!"" to comment on everything from his opponents, to ""The View.""""Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad!"" Trump tweeted in March.""The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!"" he tweeted in January.""Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!"" the President-elect tweeted last December.Feel the Burn/Bern""Feel the Burn"" will now always be heard as ""Bern"" -- with an ""E"" for Bernie.The passionate support that the Vermont senator got from young Americas across the county translated into an equally fiery campaign slogan and a hashtag that lived on months after Sanders exited the 2016 race. #FeelTheBern will always remind us of the Democratic socialist, who gave challenged Clinton during the 2016 Democratic primary.Playing the woman cardWhen Trump accused Clinton of ""playing the woman's card,"" the former Democratic presidential nominee turned Trump's attack against him by embracing the phrase.The Clinton campaign produced an actual ""Woman Card"" that they sent out to supporters who donate to the campaign.""The other day, Mr. Trump accused me, of playing the, quote, 'woman card,'"" Clinton said in April. ""Well, if fighting for women's health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.""This became a popular line of attack against Trump throughout her campaign.Nasty womanWhen Trump called Clinton a ""nasty woman"" during a debate dig, Clinton supporters embraced the phrase -- capitalizing on the positive connotations of the word that have existed in American slang for years.""Nasty"" has been used as a synonym for ""cool"" and has also been used to describe a fierce woman -- especially one with exceptionally good abilities.""Nasty Woman"" T-shirts popped up around the country and streams of Janet Jackson's ""Nasty"" soared on Spotify.""I just bought a NASTY WOMAN t-shirt. 50% goes to Planned Parenthood,"" one woman tweeted.Even Katy Perry wore a ""Nasty Woman"" T-shirt while campaigning for Clinton last month.Any variation of ""America"" and ""great""Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again,"" sparked heated debates across the country. Some argued that America is already great, others longed for a ""greater"" past, while some pointed to a history of racism defined by slavery and Jim Crow and took issue with the ""again"" portion of the slogan.After 2016, you can no longer say that America is great or long for greater times without appearing to take a political stand.Trump's slogan will also resonate whenever making anything ""great again"" is discussed.Bad""Bad"" is one of Trump's favorite insults. He used it to comment on everything from his election opponents, to describing some Latinos as ""bad hombres"" during the final presidential debate last month. He punctuated several of his tweets about his former primary opponent Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with ""Bad!""""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Trump tweeted in February.""Ted Cruz does not have the right 'temperment' to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!"" Trump tweeted later that month.It will be difficult to call something ""bad"" again without hearing Trump in your head.CrookedTrump is known for selecting nicknames for his opponents -- Cruz became ""Lyin' Ted,"" Sanders became ""Crazy Bernie,"" Rubio became ""little Marco"" and Sen. Elizabeth Warren is simply ""Pocahontas."" But none of his 2016 nicknames will be as prominently remembered as ""Crooked Hillary.""At times, Trump would even drop ""Hillary"" and simply called the former secretary of state ""Crooked"" in various tweets.The Trump campaign even launched a ""Crooked Hillary"" Snapchat filter ahead of the first presidential debate.It's safe to say that ""Crooked"" will never be the same again."
