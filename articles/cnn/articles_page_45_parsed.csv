She has led in most public opinion polling there since the summer. Just 12 days ago, a New York Times poll had her leading by 7 points, and the CNN poll of polls currently has her ahead by 4 points.But a CNN analysis of early voting paints a very different picture and suggests that Clinton has underperformed President Obama's 2012 performance in the Tar Heel State and Trump has outperformed Mitt Romney. It might seem that Democrats have built up a big early lead. More than 1.3 million Democrats have already voted compared to 990,000 Republicans.But the raw numbers don't account for the 2012 results. President Barack Obama built an early lead then but got trounced by Mitt Romney on Election Day.As of Saturday, the final day of early voting, slightly fewer Democrats had cast ballots while 125,000 more Republicans have voted this time. If this election shapes up like the last, Donald Trump would win North Carolina.There is one key difference that complicates the data: Independent voters came out this time in droves. They cast nearly 810,000 votes, up a whopping 42% from 2012.This group broke heavily for Romney in 2012. However, he was a more traditional Republican. Romney himself has been one of Trump's harshest critics, saying last spring ""Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud.""One difference this election is the popularity of a third-party candidate, Libertarian Gary Johnson. The CNN poll of polls show him garnering 5% support among likely voters.2016 exit pollsOther early voting trends favor Trump. While polls show Clinton has a commanding lead among African Americans, the share of black votes so far is down 5 percentage points. Trump does much better with white voters, who increased their share by 22% this election. The North Carolina Republican Party, in a statement Monday, bragged about the changes in turnout as a sign of the ""North Carolina Obama coalition crumbling.""Another group that failed to show up was 20-something Democrats. The North Carolina Board of Elections releases data on each voter. CNN compared registered voters who voted early in both 2012 and 2016.One third of Democrats age 22 to 29 who voted in 2012 failed to show up this time. By comparison, turnout of Democrats age 50 and older exceeded 90%.Twenty-something Republicans were more enthusiastic. Nearly three quarters of them who voted early in 2012 showed up again this election.There have been complaints that election officials have tried to suppress votes of Democrats. The NAACP sued three counties in North Carolina for canceling the registrations of about 4,500 eligible voters. The registrations were challenged based ""exclusively on mass mailings that were returned as undeliverable."" Early voting data, however, shows less than 200 votes in those counties were thrown out due to cancellations.Critics have also complained of a lack of early voting sites in Democrat strongholds. Early-voting data show the busiest voting sites, with longer waits, were mostly in predominately Democratic locations. Of the 25 busiest voting sites, Democrats outnumbered Republicans at 19 of them, according to CNN's analysis.At the Herbert C. Young Community Center in Wake County -- where two Democrats voted for every Republican -- more than 32,000 votes were cast, the most of any location. The average site had about 6,700 voters."

1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/election-day-weather-forecast/index.html	Weather can play a significant role in voting behavior, with bad weather generally suppressing turnout. And research has showed it could have swung a couple of elections. One study from 2007 (PDF) found that Richard Nixon would probably have edged out John F. Kennedy in the close 1960 election if the weather had turned foul in a few key states. Conversely, if Florida had seen drier conditions in 2000, simulations show that Al Gore likely would have carried the state and thus won the presidency.    Tuesday, however, should feature very little in the way of significant rain or snow -- two factors that are shown to decrease voter turnout in a statistically significant way. The only state that will see any accumulating snow on Election Day is Alaska, although rain could dampen polling places in a number of states, including a few key states across the Great Lakes and Midwest regions.  An advancing cold front draped across the nation's midsection will bring showers to much of the Midwest, the Ohio River Valley and down to the Southeast.  Iowa and Wisconsin will see a few lingering showers in the morning for those hitting the polls early, but the precipitation should clear the state by midday. The same batch of showers will move through Michigan during the day and reach Ohio by lunchtime, remaining until polls close. Western Pennsylvania will see some rain move in before polls close, but major Northeast cities will not see any rain until early Wednesday.Though the electoral college map remains up in the air, the temperature map for Election Day is covered in red, with little to no blue in sight. Temperatures across the nation will be mild, with many states 10 to 15 degrees above average for early November.  	Election Day forecast: Rain possible for a few key states	['Kennedy', 'Nixon']	[]

""We are aware of the text messages that have been reported to the clerk's office,"" said Michael Leffler, spokesman for Marion County prosecutor Terry Curry. But the Indiana Democratic Party took responsibility for the problem, attributing it to a mismatch in their voter software, according to The Indianapolis Star.""The Indiana Democratic Party experienced a data-match error in our get-out-the-vote text message program to Democratic voters,"" Indiana Democratic Party spokesman Drew Anderson, wrote in an email to the paper. ""We believe the error impacted less than 2,000 voters.""Indiana State Police meanwhile have been investigating allegations of voter fraud by a group registering Democrats in the state, an investigation Gov. Mike Pence has been blasting in a flurry of stops.Twitter recently pulled ads that had been directing people to vote by text -- you cannot vote via text message in any state.""@mcnees @Support not sure how this got past us.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/janet-reno-10-things-historic-career/index.html	"Not only did the oldest daughter of two newspaper reporters become the first woman to serve as US attorney general, the Harvard Law School product would also go on to serve longer than any AG in the 20th century. The Miami native died Monday at age 78 after a battle with Parkinson's disease, more than a decade after her 24-year political career ended with a failed gubernatorial bid. Here is a quick look at a career punctuated by high-profile prosecutions and controversial tactics. Child abuse prosecutions As Miami-Dade County state attorney, Reno earned a reputation as being tough on child abuse. But for all the cases she prosecuted -- including the 1984 Country Walk Babysitting Service case, which made headlines amid an era of national paranoia about sex abuse in day cares -- she came up relatively empty. Defendants were acquitted or won their cases on appeal. The wife of Frank Fuster, the target in the Country Walk case, years later retracted her testimony in the case, then retracted the retraction, according to the PBS newsmagazine ""Frontline.""Reno's record in these cases -- and her reticence regarding Country Walk -- prompted The St. Petersburg Times to print a critical editorial during her 2002 run for governor: ""She pioneered a controversial technique for eliciting intimate details from young children and inspired passage of a law allowing them to testify by closed-circuit television, out of the possibly intimidating presence of their suspected molesters. It is open to dispute, however, whether this is a record of which she should be proud.""Waco siegeThe West Texas standoff between the US government and David Koresh's Branch Davidians began a couple of weeks before Reno was named President Bill Clinton's attorney general, but Reno's Justice Department is responsible for bringing the siege to its violent close. Reno approved the raid on the compound that ended the 51-day standoff on April 19, 1993, resulting in the deaths of 82 Branch Davidians (24 of them children) and four federal agents. Inquiries into the gunbattle and ensuing fire that consumed the compound dragged on for years. Conspiracy theories live on. Despite the controversy, Reno earned political points with a simple act of accountability, telling reporters, ""I made the decision. I'm accountable. The buck stops with me.""Microsoft monopolyIn 1998, Reno's Justice Department went after Microsoft Corp., accusing it of committing monopolization by bundling its Internet Explorer browser and Windows operating system in an attempt to snuff out competition, namely Netscape. ""Consumers and computer manufacturers should have the right to choose the software they want installed on their personal computers,"" Reno said at the time. ""We are acting to preserve competition and promote innovation in the computer software industry.""Microsoft and the Justice Department eventually reached a settlement in 2001, after Reno's tenure as attorney general had ended. Freemen standoffWhen 20 or so Freemen holed up in 1996 on a farm in Montana, determined to dodge charges of bank and credit card fraud, the memory of Waco still resonated in Reno's mind. This time, she said, there would be ""no armed confrontation, no siege, no armed perimeter.""The standoff would endure 81 days and 42 negotiators, one of whom called the Freemen's escalating demands ""sheer lunacy."" On June 3, 1996, the FBI cut power to the farm, and the Freemen lasted 10 more days before surrendering. Nailing terroristsShe put some bad, bad dudes behind bars. Four of the highest crimes prosecuted by Reno's Justice Department imprisoned some of the country's most notorious criminals: Ted Kaczynski, aka the Unabomber; Timothy McVeigh, orchestrator of the Oklahoma City bombing; Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and Mir Aimal Kasi, who killed two CIA employees outside the agency's Langley, Virginia, headquarters in 1993. Kaczynski received multiple life sentences and remains incarcerated at a Supermax prison in Colorado. Yousef is serving life plus 240 years at the same facility. McVeigh and Kasi were executed. Richard Jewell debacleWhile Reno's Justice Department had much success in prosecuting terrorists, its handling of the Richard Jewell case made him the poster man for the wrongly accused. Jewell was a security guard during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and when a pipe bomb exploded at the city's Centennial Olympic Park, killing two people and injuring 111 others, police were quick to suspect Jewell. The media followed suit, leading to months of unwarranted scrutiny. The next year, Reno said she was ""sorry it happened,"" and if given the chance to speak to Jewell face to face, she would say, ""I'm sorry.""""I think we owe him an apology. I regret the leak,"" she said. Eric Rudolph pleaded guilty to the bombing in 2005. Reno v. ACLUIn 1997, the ACLU and other groups challenged provisions of the Communications Decency Act that forbade sending or displaying to a person younger than 18 material ""that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.""When a district court ruled in favor of the ACLU, Reno was charged with appealing the decision to the US Supreme Court. It didn't go well. All nine justices (two of whom dissented, in part) voted to strike down the provisions, saying they constituted a violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Elian GonzalezThe 6-year-old was on a rickety boat that capsized en route from Cuba to Florida, killing his mother. Relatives in Miami took the boy in, despite his father, back home in Cuba, demanding his son be returned. Elian became the fodder of political demonstrations in both Cuba and Miami. Reno set a deadline, ordering Elian be returned to his dad. Nine days later, on April 22, 2000, federal agents entered the house and took the boy. Reno later stood by the decision: ""I will have peace in my heart and peace in my mind when everybody is home, wherever home will be, wherever the law leads us.""Contempt of Congress allegedIn 1998, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform voted to hold Reno in contempt of Congress for failing to hand over two key memos. Reno countered that the committee, namely its chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Indiana, was playing ""political football.""FBI director Louis Freeh and Charles LaBella of the Justice Department campaign finance task force had recommended Reno request an independent counsel to investigate the fundraising practices of the 1996 Bill Clinton-Al Gore campaign. Burton subpoenaed both documents, but Reno said they contained secret grand jury material. She eventually handed them over. The House never followed up with a contempt vote of its own. Brushes with HollywoodComedian Will Ferell's impression of Reno on ""Saturday Night Live"" prompted a former Justice Department spokesman to chime in: ""Both in Florida and in Washington she has a great many friends whose homes she visits, and she goes to plays, her dance card is full. To portray her as a wallflower that nobody asks to dance is not only demeaning but inaccurate.""It wasn't her only foray into pop culture. She also helped voice herself in an episode of ""The Simpsons,"" in which she presided over the trial of Bart Simpson, accused of planting rotten eggs in the Springfield Elementary band members' instruments. The episode was dedicated to her late brother, who died of Alzheimer's.She appeared in an NFL ad featuring the star-studded guest list at Chad Ochocinco's Super Bowl Party and helped curate a three-disc music compilation called ""Song of America"" featuring tunes from Old Crow Medicine Show, John Mellencamp, Blind Boys of Alabama and dozens of other artists.

 THE BASICS:  When's the election? | Why is the turnout so poor? | Why is the election on a work day? | Why does the campaign last so long? | Can anyone run for President? | Why does America have only 2 parties?
 THE PROCESS:  What is the Electoral College?  | Did anyone ever lose the popular vote and still become President? | What if there's a tie? | What are battleground states? | Why are Democratic states ""blue"" and Republican states ""red""?
 THE ISSUES:  What are the biggest issues? | What else are Americans voting on?
 THE OUTCOME:  When will we know the result? | Can you really rig an election? | Can you contest the result? | When does the winner take office?
 THE SIGNIFICANCE: Just how unprecedented is this election?
 THE BURNING QUESTION: Who will win?
When's the election? Tuesday, November 8, for most Americans. Notice we say ""most."" Millions will have already voted by then. That's because early voting is a thing Back to topWhy is the turnout so pathetic? All right, you got us with that one. Our country loves the hype surrounding the elections, but the actual election? Not so much. Just 53.6% of the voting-age populationBack to topWhy is the election on a work day?You can thank Congress for that one. Once upon a time, America was a farming nation that went to church on Sundays and market on Wednesdays. Holding elections on Tuesdays gave farmers enough time to get to the polls, get back home, and get their products to market. Hey, they weren't going to sacrifice capitalism for democracy. Why November? So, people could vote after the fall harvest, but before winter weather made travel difficult. Cut to 2016, and we're STILL  DOING THAT!Back to topWhy is the election season so darned long?We can see how this puzzles the world. Britain gets it done in 4 months, Canada in 2 and a 1/2 and Japan in just TWELVE DAYS. America's two main political parties -- the Democrats and the Republicans -- pick nominees through contests called primaries and caucuses in each of the 50 states and the U.S. territories. That process starts in February and it alone takes up to five months! Before that, candidates typically spend a year laying groundwork. They can start earlier, because there are no laws dictating the length of a campaign. Because, you know, freedom. But don't worry. Sheryl Crow will make it all better. Back to topCan anybody run for president?Yes, even Kanye West, if he chooses. The list of qualifications listed in the US Constitution isn't exactly long. It says you have to be at least 35 years old, have lived in the US for at least 14 years and be ""a natural born citizen."" The good folks who put together the Constitution nailed down a lot of things, but the exact definition of a natural born citizen wasn't one of them. And neither Congress nor the Supreme Court have provided much clarity. (Here, enjoy this light reading.)  That explains why the birthers who question President Obama's citizenship won't shut up. Back to topWhy is it that the greatest country in the world only has two parties? Actually America has a ton of them. There's the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, the Socialist Workers Party, even something called the Legal Marijuana Now Party. But for pretty much all of its history, the US has always had just two dominant parties that compete for the White House. These days it's the Democrats and Republicans. In middle of the 19th century, it was the Democrats and the Whigs. It's primarily because of America's winner-take-all elections. In other countries, 20% of the vote means you get some seats in parliament. In America, you get a sympathetic pat on the back and a ""you'll get 'em next time"" pep talk.Back to topIs it true Americans don't directly vote for President?The election is determined by this mysterious thing called the Electoral CollegeThe Electoral College is a group of people appointed by each party The total number of electors is equal to the number of members in Congress: 538Each state gets electors based on its population. So, Wyoming has 3; New York has 29So, if Candidate A wins the most votes in, say, New York, (s)he gets all 29 electoral votes.The goal is to get to 270, which is just over half of 538.Because of this wacky system, a candidate can get ZERO votes in THIRTY-NINE  states and DC and still win the presidency. Back to topHas anyone ever lost the popular vote and still become president?Why don't you ask Al Gore?  He lost to George W. Bush in 2000, despite winning more votes nationwide.Back to top538 is an even number. What if there's a tie?An Electoral College tie is extremely rare. It's only happened twice. In a tie, one arm of Congress, the House of Representatives, will elect the president, while the other, the Senate, will elect the vice president. (Here's a helpful chart). This year, if there's a tie in the Electoral College, and the Republicans keep the House but the Democrats win back the Senate, it's quite possible that we'd be looking at a Donald Trump-Tim Kaine administration, a fitting end to the wackiest election we've ever seen. Isn't democracy wonderful?Back to topWhat are battleground states? The way the Electoral College works now is that most states are reliably either ""blue,"" meaning they vote for the Democratic candidate, or ""red,"" meaning they go with the Republican candidate. That leaves just a handful of states -- the battleground, or swing, states -- that the candidates fight over, such as Florida. Florida is the swingiest swing state of all. In 2008 and 2012 it went for President Obama; in 2000 and 2004 it went for President Bush. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck there. Back to topWhy are Democratic states 'blue' and Republican states 'red'?The media made it up. Both are colors in the American flag, and they look sharp on infographics because they're pretty much on opposite ends of the color spectrum. But the seemingly arbitrary color assignments have actually flip-flopped over the years. In 1980, states won by Republican Ronald Reagan were colored blue; Democrat Jimmy Carter's states were colored red. Even as late as 1996, major media outlets were divided on how to color-code the parties. Back to topWhat are the biggest issues?The usual suspects: The economy, national security, health care. The issues are so big the candidates never seem to find time to talk about them. How could they, when there's private email servers and lewd hot-mic videos to discuss.On foreign policy: Trump: His is an America-first strategy. He's suggested not coming to the aid of some countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and said he would work with challenging world leaders.Clinton: She wants to use diplomacy and development to quell problems abroad, stand by US allies, and stand her ground with rivals such as Russia and China.On trade: Trump: He's said the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a bad deal for America. He's also said he'd renegotiate or end the North American Free Trade Agreement and label China a currency manipulator.Clinton: She used to call TPP the ""gold standard"" of trade agreements ... until it wasn't politically expedient anymore. On climate change: Trump: He called global warming ""a hoax."" He has told coal miners he'd save their jobs by reversing President Barack Obama's executive actions and dramatically cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency.Clinton: She wants to combat climate change and boost renewable energies, cut waste and reduce the United States' dependency on oil.Back to topWhat else are Americans voting on?We're voting to fill all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the seats in the Senate. The GOP majority in the House is so big it'll probably stay in Republican hands. But the Democracts can flip the Senate if they manage to pick up just a handful of seats. On a state level, eight states will vote on legalizing marijuana, and four states will vote on raising the minimum wage. And only California would have something on the ballot like Proposition 60, which would require the use of condoms and ""other protective measures"" during the filming of porn. Back to topWhen will we know the results? Landslide elections are usually called about 8 p.m. ET when most of the polls have closed on the East Coast and in Central Time zones. This election seems destined to be a nail-biter though, so we'll be lucky if we know who won by midnight. If it all comes down to Ohio -- wouldn't be the first time -- and Trump and Clinton are pretty much tied, the whole thing could ride on absentee and provisional ballots. But poll workers there have a whole 10 daysBack to topCan you really rig an election?In America? That'd be really hard. In the last presidential election some 129 million votes were cast, so just think about the large scale of votes you'd have to manipulate to even have an effect.Vote more than once? That small army of poll workers and poll watchers (not to mention the lawyers) at each precinct can easily put a stop to that.Vote as someone else? See above.Screw around with the voting machines? Sure, but first you have to figure out how to break the locks and seals that are placed on each voting machine. And did we mention each machine sits out in the open all Election Day long?Hack the machines? Yeah, good luck. The election system is decentralized by design, with state, county and local governments all managing voting. Even though many precincts use voting machines, none are connected to the Internet, nor are they connected to each other.It's probably a lot easier to just pick up a campaign sign, stand on a street corner and try to convince people that your candidate's the better option. You know, it's called democracy.Back to topCan anyone contest the result?Well, sure, a candidate could, but it's not so simple. Remember, America really doesn't have a national election as much as a series of state elections. So if you're going to contest the results, you'll have to do it state by stateBack to topWhen would the winner take office? Back in the old days, the president was inaugurated on March 20. But travel across the country is much faster and easier than before (thanks, airplanes!). So, now Inauguration Day is January 20. Back to topJust how unprecedented is this election ?It's kind of like that old Prince song: 2016, nothing compares to you. For the first time, you have a woman a step away from being president. That alone makes this campaign unique. And yet you don't hear much buzz about it, probably because Clinton herself rarely mentions it. Older female voters seem geeked up by the possibility of having a Madame President, but female millennial voters are surprisingly blah about it. Probably because they already feel like they'll see a female president in their lifetimes They're just not sure if they want this female to be the first.For the first time, you have a true outsider-businessman who really could shake up business as usual in Washington. Change is the big call this election, and nobody represents that more than The Donald. He's the ultimate Washington outsider -- he was the host of ""The Apprentice"" for goodness sake -- who doesn't give a damn about political tradition.For the first time, you have a major party nominee who, until this weekend, was under FBI investigation. Clinton's email problems were kind of fading into the background, then came roaring back. For the first time, you have a man seeking office who bragged about wanting to sexually assault women. That ""Access Hollywood"" video of Trump would have been the death knell for any other candidate. But Trump is, well, Trump, and he says and gets away with things other politicians can only dream about.For the first time, you have two of the most despised, hated and untrusted candidatesBack to topLast question: Who's going to win?Hey, if we knew the answer to that one, we'd extend our prophetic talents to something much more worthwhile, like predicting lottery numbers. The general consensus seems to be that this race is Clinton's to lose. But that's based on polls. And what have we learned about polls this year? Look at Brexit. Or Colombia. So let's just ride it out together. Back to top"	The non Americans' guide to US elections (Handy for citizens, too)	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Holding', 'Kaine']	[]

In 2008 of all the states that went for Obama, his margin was the smallest in North Carolina. Flip to 2012 and you have Romney winning North Carolina, but his margin was extremely small and so I think we would expect to see that in 2016,"" said Chris Cooper, political science department head at Western Carolina University.North Carolina's nearly 10 million residents have over 75% of the population at voting age. Republicans have carried the state in 10 of the last 12 presidential elections.""The urban-rural divide has long defined North Carolina and that has only been exacerbated by this election. Trump's appeal is very strong in the rural areas yet in the urban areas they are definitely Hillary Clinton strongholds,"" said Cooper.Steven Greene, professor of political science at North Carolina State University said, ""this is going to be known as the Donald Trump election.""""He is such an unusual candidate, he's performing far better than we would think from a candidate that violates so many of the norms,"" he said. ""I think we are going to pick the winner. If Donald Trump wins North Carolina he will be president, if Hillary Clinton win then she will be our next president.""Political geography has always been important in understanding voting patterns in America.""North Carolina is a microcosm of the country,"" said Cooper, whose state holds the key to 15 electoral votes.African-Americans made up 23% of North Carolina's 2012 electorate and this year their vote could pick the winner.""The turn out of African-Americans is going to be extremely important.

Spratt supports Hillary Clinton. ""I feel Hillary is well-educated and aware of the issues going on in America especially with my race, African-American,"" Spratt said.Spratt is concerned about how close the election has been and she's not shy about her opinion on Donald Trump.""Donald Trump is a pompous, arrogant, entitled person that cares about himself, and his temperament is toxic to the United States. He doesn't care about anybody other than the top 2%, and that definitely doesn't align with my people at all,"" she said. ""To vote him in as our president would be the biggest, the greatest downfall for America.""Another worry for Spratt is voter suppression.In July, the NAACP won a three-year battle to overturn HB 369, a voter ID law, when the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the law's provisions ""were enacted with racially discriminatory intent"" against blacks. The Supreme Court denied North Carolina's appeal in August.""Initially I had a big issue with IDs not being required but I have a couple of friends that informed me of why it's a good thing that identification isn't required now. Mainly because of the elderly, many of them just don't have an ID,"" Spratt said.Spratt thinks there was racism behind the law but she says that's not surprising. ""We think that things have changed and, yes, some thing have, but racism is alive,"" she said.Paul Faith, an environmental economist is also concerned about disenfranchised minority voters. Because of his worry, he has been driving a bus around the state's cultural hub of Asheville with signs taped to the windows reading ""Ride to the Polls.""""For me personally, what's driven me is all the shenanigans around voter registration and trying to keep minorities from voting and that made me upset so I'm trying to get people out to vote and not be kept down,"" he said.Jesse Maybin, a 32-year-old African-American, manages a printing shop in Asheville. Maybin is undecided but knows one thing for certain. ""I'm just not voting for Trump, just can't. I just can't believe that we have gotten this far with Trump. That's my biggest thing, I just don't understand how we got here. I laughed it off when he said that he was running but he's here,"" he said.Maybin's opinion is not unique to Asheville residents or other African-American voters in the state. Though Maybin may vote for a third-party candidate, he hopes everyone hits the polls on November 8.""The African-American vote is just as important as it always is. We should never sit out. Whether it's a black president, a woman, a white. Every vote is important.""Millennials at the pollsNorth Carolina's changing demographics are as obvious as the seasons across the Tar Heel state. Today, there are now fewer native-born North Carolinians in the state than newcomers. Nearly half a million people moved to North Carolina since 2010, many of them millennials.""I'm going to pick somebody for president but that's not really what I'm worried about,"" said 25-year-old Jason Hazinski of Raleigh.Hazinski doesn't have faith in the candidates and think the fame of politics is ruining the system.""It's just foolish, absolutely foolish. To think that they could run what could potentially be a beautiful country if we all worked together but they continue to destroy it and the world. It makes us all look like terrible people and I want to tell people that we are not terrible people,"" he said.Tanner Martinelli moved to Asheville four months ago from Colorado. He works at City Bakery and doesn't like to talk about politics much but he is voting. ""I'll be voting for Hillary Clinton because I feel that Donald Trump is a worse candidate,"" said Martinelli.Around Asheville, the latter is common sentence to overhear. ""To be honest, it's about the lesser of two evils in my mind, and I know that's sounds kind of rough. But simply put, Donald Trump is kind of mad and I don't agree with a lot of what he says,"" Martinelli said.Eme Enyong is another millennial transplant to North Carolina. Six years ago she moved to Charlotte from Pennsylvania. Enyong is voting for Hillary Clinton.""The things Trump has said about African-Americans, Latinos, women. It's all caused a divide in this country,"" said Eme Enyong.Enyong says she is hopeful that her generation is taking this election serious and will vote.""With the reputation that millennials get about all kinds of things going on in the country I would hope that my demographic would go out and vote because who we vote for effects out foreseeable future and lives,"" said Enyong.Tar heels for Trump""Lesser of the two evils,"" said 69-year-old Jim Suttle of Forest City, North Carolina.Jim and Mary Suttle both voted for Donald Trump.""I think he is a strong man, a business man which we need that for our economy but to tell you the truth I'm not crazy about either one but he was my first choice,"" said Mary Suttle.The couple says they don't know anyone in the rural region of the state who is voting for Clinton.The Suttle's are religious people and would like to see Trump watch some of the things he says but for Jim, there is no way he would have ever voted for Clinton.""I don't think a woman should have an authority over a man, that's biblical and I just don't think she is a good candidate,"" said Jim Suttle.Along with Trump, the Suttles' think the election could be potentially rigged and they worry about their votes counting and making a difference.""I don't think the election should be decided by the Electoral College,"" said Jim. ""I did my part, put my mark down. We want our vote to count,"" said Mary Suttle.The Suttle's think Clinton will win the election.On the border of Georgia is Franklin, North Carolina. Trump signs line the streets and support for the candidate is strong.""I'm not ashamed to say I voted for Donald Trump. Hands down, I think he is going to make some changes if he is fortunate enough to get in there,"" said Jim Anello.Anello owns Protected Second, a gun shop in Franklin.""We feel very strong about the Second Amendment and most of the people here are pro-gun and pro-Trump,"" said Anello.The Urban-rural divide that makes North Carolina a swing state and a snapshot of the country makes sense to Anello who is proudly supporting Donald Trump.""In the rural communities people tend to be more conservative and pro gun, and possibly more Republican than Democrat. In the larger metro areas, you have a more diverse crowd of people and some of them obviously have different feelings on what their benefits should and should not be,"" said Anello."
