Now, as Obama participates in his last Southeast Asian summit to promote the pivot and its massive trade pact, the TPP looks like it's headed to the political graveyard.Obama tried to sound optimistic Wednesday about the deal's future, while also conveying to leaders in Asia the reality of the obstacles.""I believe that we'll get it done but it's always going to be hard,"" Obama said at a news conference in Laos, suggesting the deal's path might be easier after the US election. ""Nothing is easy in the US Congress right now. Maybe there was a time when it was but I haven't seen it.""Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump roused a populist base with his strident anti-trade message, declaring the Pacific Rim deal ""terrible"" and a ""rape"" of American workers. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, seeking to minimize the threat of primary opponent Bernie Sanders, announced that she, too, opposes the TPP. And, sensing the political risk of supporting a controversial deal both presidential nominees oppose, several lawmakers changed their positions.  Trump is expected to call Wednesday for eliminating the sequester on defense spending and bolstering the US' defenses by proposing a ""major investment"" in US military spending.As Obama tries to cajole last concessions from partner countries on his final trip to Asia, the same congressional leaders who'd nudged him along on the TPP now say it's unlikely to be ratified.""The current agreement, the Trans-Pacific agreement, which has some serious flaws, will not be acted upon this year,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell flatly declared at a Kentucky Farm Bureau event last week.Right now, with even pro-trade stalwarts like McConnell opposed to ratification during Obama's term, advocates of the TPP admit that they don't have the votes necessary to clear the House and the Senate.The summer has featured a rush of Republicans -- particularly those in competitive races -- bolting from the trade deal.Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican and long-time trade supporter, wrote in August in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette op-ed: ""We should dump the TPP and return to the negotiating table to get an agreement that would create jobs and economic growth here at home.""Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt told reporters he's having second thoughts about the deal. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, once a Trump challenger, hasn't taken an official position, but he stripped mention of trade -- and his support for earlier steps greasing the wheels for TPP -- from his website, RealClearPolitics recently reported.And Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who once negotiated pacts as the US trade representative under George W. Bush, opposes the TPP.Conservative activists who waged a battle to deny Obama trade promotion authority in the first place, meanwhile, say they believe Trump awakened a party that had been ignoring its loyalists on trade.""I think this will last. Every time an issue comes to the forefront, I've never seen the activists forget about it. Once that issue is in the quiver and activists are paying attention to it, it stays there and activists will fight it forever,"" said Tea Party Patriots co-founder Mark Meckler. ""The stain is here to stay.""The deal's supporters -- including the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers -- aren't giving up. But they acknowledge the uphill battle on Capitol Hill.Linda Dempsey, the National Association of Manufacturers' vice president of international economic affairs, said that, ""additional leadership is needed in Washington to forge a viable path forward.""The US manufacturing sector ""continues to lose foreign sales and access to new customers in some of the fastest-growing markets in the world,"" Dempsey warned about the deal falling through.Obama and TPP advocates have a problem with the president's typical allies on the left, too.Only a small group of Democrats -- mostly members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition -- backed trade promotion authority in the first place, making for the unusual coalition of Obama and congressional Republicans.Since then, those Democrats have been under pressure from labor unions that argue the TPP, which they've dubbed ""NAFTA on steroids,"" would siphon more manufacturing jobs away from the United States.Sanders stoked opposition to the TPP among unions and progressives during the primaries, making it a mainstay of his stump speech and his go-to answer about what differentiated him from Obama and Clinton.That forced Clinton -- who'd declared the TPP a ""gold standard"" trade deal in 2012 while serving as Obama's secretary of state -- to the left. Her announcement in the fall of 2015 that she opposes the deal made Obama's task of getting Democrats on board even tougher.Opponents, meanwhile, are declaring victory -- at least for now.""It won't come up because the votes aren't there,"" Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL-CIO, a labor union that opposes TPP, said at a Christian Science Monitor Breakfast Thursday. ""The candidates running will have to declare where they stand on TPP and the chips will fall where they may.""Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has maintained the deal would need substantial renegotiation -- a tough task since each of the other 11 participating nations have their own political sensitivities and Obama has less than five months remaining in office.""They have to fix this agreement and renegotiate some pieces of it if they have any hope or chance of passing it,"" Ryan said in an early August interview with Wisconsin Public Radio. ""I don't see how they'll ever get the votes for it.""But McConnell made clear last week that the path to the TPP's passage isn't totally closed.""It will still be around. It can be massaged, changed, worked on during the next administration,"" he said.Even if Congress ultimately does approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the next president will have ways of blocking its implementation -- such as procedural steps like refusing to officially notify other countries of the United States' implementation of the deal or not verifying that those countries have satisfied their TPP commitments.The hope of trade supporters is that a President Clinton or Trump would drop their resistance to the trade deal once in office. If they did, they'd be following a path similar to Obama, who pledged as a presidential candidate to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement but governed as a trade supporter who entered new negotiations with the European Union and Asia-Pacific countries.But trade was less of a driving issue in the 2008 race, and neither Clinton nor Trump has left much wiggle room for a post-election reversal.""I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages -- including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" Clinton said in August in Warren, Michigan. ""I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president.""Trump -- whose strident rejection of the TPP and other trade deals is a staple of his campaign events -- denounced the pact again on conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's show Thursday.""It's a terrible deal for the United States,"" he said. ""It's a terrible deal for our workers."""	Obama pushes trade in Asia, but has 2016 killed the TPP?	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'McConnell', 'Hill', 'Paul', 'Blunt', 'Obama']	[]
1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/politics/us-russia-kerry-syria/index.html	"The Russian Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, for the third time in two weeks on the heels of a meeting in China Monday between President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20.Deputy State Department Spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that the US wanted to put the finishing touches on the deal, but added that while progress had been made, gaps remain. Last-ditch effort?Senior administration officials billed Kerry's latest bid to strike a deal with the Russians as a last-ditch effort to test Russian intentions before the US abandoned plans to cooperate more closely with Russia. For weeks, the US and Russia have been struggling to come to terms on a cease-fire between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and moderate rebels that would expand humanitarian access for hundreds of thousands of Syrians. The US and Russia are also holding talks on coordinating more closely on the air operations each is conducting in Syria.But both Obama and Secretary of Defense Ash Carter have had tough words for Russia in recent days, dimming the prospect of a deal on a cease-fire and closer military cooperation. The US and Russia are both ostensibly fighting ISIS in Syria, but America has charged that Russia has mostly focused on bombing groups opposing Assad, a close Moscow ally. Some of those groups are supported by the US.Carter told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Wednesday that Russia will bear responsibility for Assad's actions Syria.""It could use its influence to help put an end to this civil war,"" he told her in London. ""They bear the responsibility of the consequences of things that they could avoid.""""But this morning's episode suggests that at least as of this morning things are definitely not heading in the right direction,"" he added, referring to an alleged chlorine attack in Aleppo Wednesday.Expressing further skepticism, Carter said that while ""you've got to keep hoping, the experience suggests that we're not close to that point"" where Russia will change its actions.And Obama has questioned whether a deal was possible given the ""gaps of trust"" between the two countries after his meeting with Putin. A senior administration official told reporters Tuesday the US would ""walk away"" from talks with Russia if a good agreement couldn't be reached. ""We would like to see this, if it can get done, happen quickly because of the enormous humanitarian needs,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters. ""If it cannot get done, we won't sign on to a bad deal.""Greater cooperation?The strategy hinges on deeper cooperation between the US and Russian military against extremist groups operating in Syria, particularly ISIS and Nusra Front. But the US has resisted coming to an agreement due to Russian and Syrian regime actions against civilians in the besieged, rebel-held city of Aleppo. On Wednesday, a fresh round of airstrikes there killed at least seven people and injured more than 40 in Aleppo's al-Sukkari neighborhood, an activist from the Aleppo Media Center told CNN.‎ The strikes come a day after dozens of people were hospitalized in a suspected chlorine gas attack, one of several in the area being investigated by the international community. The US wants a nation-wide cease-fire in Syria between the regime and the rebels in order to create the conditions for UN-led political talks to end the five-year war, rather than a time-limited cessation of hostilities in certain areas. After Kerry and Lavrov were unable to agree on terms Monday during a meeting in China, Obama and Putin told their top diplomats to keep working -- but the prospects aren't promising.""We have had some productive conversations about what a real cessation of hostilities would look like that would allow us both ... to focus our attention on common enemies,"" Obama said Monday. ""But given the gaps of trust that exist, that's a tough negotiation, and we haven't yet closed the gaps in a way where we think it would actually work.""High stakes for Moscow  The decision to deepen cooperation with Moscow was already controversial, given the Obama administration's public criticism of Russia's role in Syria. A cessation of hostilities negotiated between Kerry and Lavrov in February fell apart within weeks and efforts to reach a political settlement in the war-torn country are on the verge of collapse.For months, the Russians have been pushing the US to agree to share intelligence on targeting ISIS and al-Nusra militants. Under the plan being discussed, an ""implementation cell"" would house US and Russian military planners together, sharing intelligence, maps and targeting information. Officials said Russia has pledged not to use the information to target US-backed rebels.""The Russians badly want this agreement,"" one senior official said. ""Their argument is if we want them to stop targeting our opposition, we should tell them where they are. So it's a tactical thing, but it's also political. They want the US military to recognize they have a role to play in Syria.""What the U.S. would offer In exchange for the military partnership, Russia would agree to halt its attacks on US-backed rebels and other groups the US does not consider terrorists and deliver assurances Assad would do so as well.""In areas where there is just opposition or intermingling of opposition with Nusra, Assad will not be able to fly,"" another senior administration official said. ""That essentially puts Assad's air force on the ground in most circumstances.""But Pentagon officials told CNN that extreme mistrust of the Russians is coupled with logistical concerns that make such an agreement complicated. For starters, the US doesn't want to be held accountable for civilian casualties caused by Russian strikes against ISIS targets. Although the US shares some mutual interest with the Russians in bombing groups like Nusra Front, the Pentagon does not see the Russians as critical to that effort, nor is it eager to give Russia sensitive US intelligence about where US aircraft are operating in Syria.  Aleppo blocked A main point of contention is the mingling of opposition fighters, backed by the United States and Middle East allies, and Nusra militants, mostly in southwestern Aleppo. Russia has balked at a ceasefire in areas where there is so-called ""marbling"" of the two groups.Another sticking point centers around access to the main ""Costello road"" leading to Aleppo, where distrust between the regime and rebels has held up delivery of critical humanitarian supplies. Last month, the Russians introduced a plan to provide ""safe corridors"" for people to flee Aleppo. But Kerry warned if the plan was a ""ruse"" to empty the Aleppo for the Syrian army to target opposition forces as they leave and then seize the city, it would risked ""completely breaking apart"" any hope of cooperation.""Nobody's going to sit around and allow this pretense to continue,"" Kerry said.A break for aidSenior US officials said Tuesday they hope an initial 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo will enable the UN to set up internationally monitored check-points that could get aid through.Administration officials said the US would want to wait several days to see if a ceasefire took hold before moving forward on an agreement for a military partnership with Russia. Several senior administration officials have told CNN in recent weeks the administration was discussing possibly declaring the cessation of hostilities over and ending its cooperation with Russia if Moscow continued to violate the ceasefire and block the flow of humanitarian aid. But the lack of a viable alternative in Syria to trying to work with Russia has continued to cause paralysis. Senior US officials say the White House is close to pulling the plug if Kerry's latest diplomatic mission fails to produce an agreement, or an agreement fails to take hold.""I think this is the last card that is going to be played,"" one senior administration official said. ""I can't imagine there is going to be much patience for Kerry to do more horse trading if this doesn't work."""

It is a major shift and signals that the powerful group, which has in the past focused primarily on community organizing, is becoming more comfortable with political warfare.Like other Koch nonprofits, the Libre Initiative has only run television spots asking for voters to ""thank"" the individuals running, a technicality that allows groups to avoid disclosing the identities of their donors. All Koch network nonprofits -- unlike their super PACs -- have to be careful in order to maintain their tax-exempt status and shield their donor identities. Some groups have been reluctant to test the legal boundaries, yet the Libre Initiative appears more willing than ever to engage in direct politics.""Marco Rubio: standing up for hardworking Floridians,"" goes the spot, which is also airing in Spanish. ""This November vote Marco Rubio for Senate.""It is the last line that makes the advertisement an ""express advocacy"" spot, which the Libre Initiative has never aired before. The spots are also the group's first television ads of the entire 2016 cycle.The Koch network has spurned Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, and instead focused its considerable financial resources on down-ballot races like Rubio's. Rubio is slightly favored to beat Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy.The group will bolster the television and digital spots with a Latino-focused field program in Florida's Hispanic communities.Asked about their tactical shift, a Libre spokesman, Brian Faughnan, said, ""We approach these questions on a case by case basis."""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/politics/zika-congress-funding-mitch-mcconnell/index.html	"He also said they are negotiating a bill to combat the Zika virus and is ""hopeful and optimistic"" a deal can be reached soon and that floor debate could begin next week.But conservative members in the House were blunt -- they said don't like a possible Senate short-term spending compromise and might try to block it. ""I think Leader McConnell is going in the wrong direction,"" said Texas GOP Rep. Bill Flores who told reporters he didn't believe it would pass the House. ""Conservatives in the House would have an issue with that.""McConnell's upbeat assessment was a sharp turnaround from his remarks Tuesday when negotiations appeared stalled on the few key items Congress has left to do before the November election. But the driving motivation for the GOP leader is to get the two contentious issues -- spending and Zika -- behind him and let his vulnerable members facing re-election go home to campaign. ""The single biggest piece of business we need to conduct is to get the government funded before the end of the fiscal year,"" McConnell told reporters after meeting privately with his caucus for the first time since senators returned from a seven-week recess. McConnell would not say if government funding and Zika would be joined into a single bill although several senators in both parties believed they would end up in one package.  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid also said he hopes ""to do something quickly,"" but warned his party would block bills that included what Democrats consider poison pills, like restrictions on funding for Planned Parenthood and cuts to Obamacare in the Zika bill. Speaking to the potential showdown with conservatives in the House, Reid described those provisions as unacceptable ""Freedom Caucus bells and whistles.""The Democratic leader said the tangible progress on the two issues was positive enough that he dropped his threat Tuesday to shutter action in Senate committees to force action on Merrick Garland's stalled Supreme Court nomination. But the concerns of the House Freedom Caucus, the group of members on the right, are real and without their votes it's likely House Speaker Paul Ryan will have to turn to Democrats to pass a funding bill.This bloc of conservatives, along with several outside advocacy groups on the right are arguing that Congress should pass a funding bill that lasts through the spring. They want to avoid a lame duck session because they worry any broader spending deal negotiated in December will be a deal with items they oppose. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, said he and other conservatives in the Freedom Caucus prefer a spending bill that funds agencies through the spring. But Meadows acknowledged that he and some are open to something else if leaders agree to add a provision that would impose a ""temporary pause"" on refugees from Syria and other Mideast countries with terror ties to come to the United States.""If that were something that could be guaranteed in the short term (continuing resolution) I think you'd see a majority of Freedom Caucus members supporting a short term strategy,"" Meadows said, saying they believed it was ""a reasonable request.""That idea will be a non-starter for Democrats. And again, when faced with a pre-election deadline, GOP leaders will come under pressure to avoid any policy provisions that will cause Democrats to bolt.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers has said he supports a similar approach as McConnell's -- a bill through some time in December -- and said that there are some discussions about attaching Zika money to the must-pass bill, although no decisions have been made.Asked if adding Zika could help attract Democratic support for a package, Rogers said: ""I think so""House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi held a news conference with public health advocates and physicians pushing for Republicans to take up a ""clean"" bill funding Zika efforts. Ryan, asked about moving a Zika bill without controversial policy riders on it, sidestepped the question and blasted Senate Democrats for blocking action on a Zika measure on Tuesday night. ""Give me a break on this one. We passed the $1.1 billion bill for Zika, which was the level agreed to in the Senate,"" he said.But Ryan added: ""This is obviously an issue we are going to have to resolve this month.""  Previously, Pelosi had insisted that Congress give the Obama administration the full $1.9 billion it requested to fight the epidemic, but on Wednesday she just stressed that whatever Congress does it ""has to be for a year."" A Pelosi aide said the $1.1 billion in the Senate measure meets that criteria."

Jeff Sessions defended his party's nominee in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead"" when pressed about what happened to a ""foolproof"" plan to defeat ISIS that the candidate had spoken of in 2015.  ""This can be done, and Donald Trump is saying clearly and unequivocally and consistently we're going to target ISIS first,"" Sessions said. ""I don't think he ever doubted he'd be talking to the generals about how to achieve it.""Tapper then played a clip in which Trump claimed he had a secret ""foolproof"" plan to beat the terrorist group.""Did he not have a plan to begin with, or does he think that these generals whom he's said 'don't know much' are going to come up with a better plan than he concocted?"" Tapper asked. Retired general: Trump plan 'sophomoric'Sessions maintained that a Trump administration would defeat ISIS. ""These statements he made during the campaign some months ago, a year ago, are not controlling,"" Sessions said. ""I gather he didn't actually have a plan in 2015?"" Tapper said. ""You're having fun with this argument, OK?"" Sessions replied. ""You can keep talking about it, but the American people are concerned about what we are going to do. I have no doubt he had a lot of ideas about how he had planned to deal with this confrontation with ISIS and he's going to work with our military generals to firm that up.""Sessions also denied that the two positions were contradictory.""I don't think it's a fundamental contradiction at all,"" Sessions said.Tapper pressed the Republican senator to give an example of something the current administration and military leadership has not done that Trump would have pursued to fight ISIS. Sessions replied that the military needs to be ""unleashed.""""There are a lot of things that are policy decisions that you reach based on the priorities that you have, and I believe that had we unleashed the military and given them more ability to function they could have been more effective in fighting ISIS already,"" Sessions said. Later on ""The Situation Room,"" Trump adviser retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn echoed Sessions' call to ""unleash"" the military, but declined to go into specifics.""There are people (now) that know that we could do more in our military for sure, and I know we could do far more on the ideological front and we could do far more on the financial front,"" Flynn told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""I think that what they need to be able to do is they need to be able to unleash our military capabilities as well as other capabilities we have.""Trump delivered a speech on Wednesday articulating his military policy, calling for increasing spending.

Footage of her shaking a can before painting her message onto the bulldozer at the site in St. Anthony could be seen in local media on Tuesday as well.The company Energy Transfer Partners is behind the pipeline construction, though it is unclear who owns the bulldozer.In her statement, Stein blasted North Dakota law enforcement and the Dakota Access pipeline, calling the spray-painting an act of ""civil disobedience.""

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/politics/donald-trump-august-fundraising/index.html	"Critically, much of the cash raised by Trump last month will eventually head to his campaign's own coffers, giving him greater discretion over how Republican efforts are waged in the homestretch of the general election.Despite its paltry fundraising operation, the Trump campaign said Wednesday that it collected huge totals from from small-dollar donors, who have flocked to the Republican nominee thanks to his costly investment in digital fundraising tools. The campaign said 2.1 million individuals have given to Trump and it collected over $5 million during Trump's whirlwind, controversial visit to Mexico on the last day of the month.The campaign said that it and its joint committees had $97 million on hand as of September 1, though it did not disclose how much of that cash was held by the campaign proper. Additional details will not be revealed until documents are filed with the Federal Election Commission later this month.Trump raises money for both his individual campaign along with two joint committees that split the cash between his operation, the Republican National Committee and more than a dozen state parties. The campaign did not announce how the $90 million was split.Of the money, $70 million came through Trump's official campaign and his small-dollar joint fundraising group, Steven Mnuchin, Trump's finance chair, told CNN. And an additional $18 million was raised through Trump Victory -- a high-dollar group that largely funnels checks to the RNC, not his campaign.Trump contributed an additional $2 million to his campaign last month, Mnuchin said, boosting his overall total to shy of $60 million.Trump's fundraising total was first reported Wednesday by Fox News.The haul, raised in the late summer doldrums when candidates often struggle to collect large checks, is another sign that Trump has managed to quickly assemble a finance operation despite his historically late start to presidential fundraising. The billionaire largely self-funded his primary bid before deciding to raise money traditionally once becoming the presumptive GOP nominee in the late spring.Yet Clinton, who prioritized exclusive fundraising events over retail campaigning last month, still holds a commanding lead in the cash race as of the beginning of September. Her campaign, along with the Democratic National Committee and other state parties, collected $143 million in August, a record-shattering number. Her campaign said it had $68 million on hand.""We are very pleased he has continued to dedicate time to fundraise with the RNC to support important ground operations for the Republican Party,"" Mnuchin said in a statement, arguing that Trump was competitive in surveys despite Clinton's advertising advantages. And while Clinton's super PACs have steadily raised checks of unlimited size and deployed their substantial resources on swing-state television, Trump's are still sputtering, failing to reel in large checks and ceding television airwaves for much of the summer to Clinton allies."

The former West Virginia governor said that ever since Bresch has been at Mylan and he's been in politics, ""we made a point"" to keep those parts of their lives separate.""We make a point, ever since I've been in this position, and when I was governor, we made a point -- we just didn't get involved. It's so convoluted, I don't understand. To get into something you don't understand and your daughter being in this type of industry -- it was best I stayed away,"" he said. ""My daughter is my daughter with unconditional love, and she's the most amazing person that I know,"" he continued. ""She's so compassionate and generous in how she's always lived her life.""Bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the lifesaving allergy drug EpiPen, which is one of the company's signature products. The drug, which cost around $100 in 2009, shot up to as much as $600. The move sparked outrage from parents with children who rely on the drug, and even prompted comments from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the need to rein in rising drug costs. One of those parents was actually a colleague of Manchin -- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- and multiple members of Congress called for hearings on the spiking cost.In the interview, Manchin suggested that the controversy was a ""blessing in disguise"" because it would lead to greater attention to the challenge of rising drug costs.""They're all too expensive. So if there is a way to find out that we can deliver it at a better, more economical price, and still have the innovative and creative juices flowing, I guess that makes all these things happen -- you've got to find the balance somewhere,"" he said.In response to criticism of the price hike, Mylan announced last week plans to launch a generic EpiPen at a 50% discount to the branded version of the life saving allergy treatment. The generic EpiPen will be ""identical"" to the branded product in terms of how the drug is made and how the auto-injector functions, Mylan said."
