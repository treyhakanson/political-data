""We repealed Obamacare this year without the Democrats. We can do it again early next year and it will become law — we will repeal it from law, because we'll have a president that won't veto it. I believe that we'll repeal the Waters of the US, we'll repeal the Clean Air Act, and we'll pass Keystone Pipeline again. And all three, all four of those things will get signed into law by President Trump, so that's with the votes we already had. That's no new Democrats. That's just what we did this year. So I'm hopeful that that will set a tone.""Speaking on the Atlanta-based Bryan Crabtree Show Thursday morning, Perdue said each of those legislative items would be passed within the first 100 hundred days of Trump's presidency. ""All four of those things will get done in the first 100 days, I think,"" he said. Perdue added Republicans would take aim at the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill as well.After the initial publication of this story, Senator Perdue's spokeswoman, Caroline Vanvick, clarified his comments to CNN, saying he meant to say ""Clean Power Plan,"" not ""Clean Air Act.""""Senator Perdue will work with president-elect Donald Trump to repeal Obama policy initiatives that have eliminated jobs and shrunk Americans' take home pay — like Obamacare and the Clean Power Plan,"" she said.

Collins also noted that he had ""floated"" the idea past House Speaker Paul Ryan earlier in the day. Collins was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump, and told Blitzer the President-elect, along with his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, called him Wednesday to thank him. ""We reminisced about the campaign from February 24 when I endorsed him, to you know, some spots where you and other really put me on the hot seat from time to time,"" Collins said of his phone call with the Trumps. Collins said that he has thought ""long and hard"" about the idea of potentially joining the new administration. ""I'm in a job now on the (House) Energy and Commerce Committee in Congress at a stage in my career, that's where I want to end my career,"" Collins said. Trump was announced the winner of the 2016 election early Wednesday morning after Democratic rival Hillary Clinton conceded. He will be the 45th president of the United States. "	Rep.

Stabenow said she was not sure why exit polls showed that women did not gravitate toward Clinton in that state.""It's very disappointing to me, and I think were going to have to spend time listening and figuring out why that was,"" Stabenow said."

Warren was one of Trump's chief antagonists on the campaign trail. Now, though, many Democrats are looking to her to fill the massive leadership void suddenly facing the party.Warren said she and Trump are on the same page about the need to invest in infrastructure, reform campaign finance laws and crack down on Wall Street and big banks. ""He spoke to the very real sense that millions of Americans have that their government and their economy has abandoned them, and he promised to rebuild this economy for working people,"" Warren said of Trump. It is, she said, ""not a liberal worry or a conservative worry. It is not a Democratic worry or a Republican worry. It is the worry that led even Americans with deep reservations about Donald Trump's temperament and fitness to vote for him anyway.""""When President-elect Trump wants to take on these issues -- when his goal is to increase the economic security of middle-class families -- then count me in,"" Warren said. ""I will push aside our differences and I will work with him to achieve that goal.""Warren's comments come on the same day Trump was in Washington to meet with President Barack Obama, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. She echoed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, another frequent Trump critic who said Wednesday that she could work with the Republican President-elect on infrastructure spending. Warren said Trump's brand of populism is a major departure from Ryan and McConnell, the Republican congressional leaders. She said the congressional GOP's approach to the issues she highlighted was ""rejected -- rejected by their own primary voters, rejected during the campaign and rejected during Tuesday's election."""

The agreement was announced Thursday by the New York attorney general's office following an expose on the charity by CNN.Burch remains a VA government lawyer earning an annual salary of $125,000. He was earning that salary while also, at one point, receiving a $65,000 annual salary from his foundation along with other benefits.""VA takes this matter very seriously as unethical conduct undermines the trust and confidence veterans and the American people have in the good and important work of VA,"" VA spokesman Henry L. Huntley said in a statement to CNN. ""After reviewing the evidence provided by the (Office of the Inspector General), today VA initiated the process for the employee's removal from federal service.""In announcing the settlement, the New York attorney general's office said its investigators determined almost all the money collected by the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation went to professional fundraising fees. And that ""The fraction that actually made it to NVVF was further reduced by a pattern of abuse, mismanagement and misspending by NVVF's former President.""Burch remains a career government lawyer with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington, and has been running the charity from his home in suburban Virginia. CNN tried to reach Burch last May to ask about the lack of donations his organization made to charity. Instead of answering questions, Burch sped away in a Rolls Royce bearing the license plate ""My Rolls"".The New York attorney general has accused Burch of using donated funds to spend lavishly on travel, a yearly salary and other personal benefits, including a severance package the charity awarded him when he stepped down after being exposed by CNN. Burch has agreed to pay back $100,000 which will be re-directed to actual charitable works according to the New York attorney general's office.RELATED: 'Worst' charity for veterans run by VA employee""There is nothing more shameless than exploiting military veterans in order to enrich oneself. The actions of this charity and its founder are appalling,"" said Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. ""This organization took advantage of the good will of millions, yet failed to fulfill nearly all of its promises to help those who have sacrificed for our nation. This settlement sends a clear message that charities will not get away with fleecing donors in New York.""The National Vietnam Veterans Foundation has a long record of poor management. It earned a zero rating form the watchdog group Charity Navigator. An official calling it one of the worst charities in the United States.According to the settlement terms: Burch has agreed to a permanent nationwide bar on access to charitable assets or decision-making, issued an apology to donors of NVVF and to Vietnam Veterans whom he exploited in order for fundraisers to collect money, and admitted that NVVF had paid 90% of its donations to its fundraisers and admitted to deceptively marketing how solicited money would be spent.  The settlement also states Burch has admitted to using foundation funds to pay for foreign and domestic travel, frequenting night clubs in the Baltimore area on a nearly weekly basis, ordering excessive and expensive food and drink at the country's top restaurants and lavishing gifts on women. The settlement states Burch expensed an $800 dollar nightclub and hotel bill in 2012 as ""work on homelessness"" and ""veteran issue.""VA still investigatingOfficials at the Department of Veterans Affairs were first made aware of Burch's foundation activities when contacted by CNN in May. The VA opened an investigation into the matter, and told CNN that the results are expected this week.  At the time, the VA said there was nothing wrong with an employee operating a charity outside his or her employment duties.

""I think it's a tough one that should be given a lot of thought and shouldn't be an off-the-cuff answer. Equal administration of justice is one of our most important principles.""He added: ""It's been a tradition in our politics to put things behind us. On the other hand, you have to look at how bad was it? Because suppose somebody comes along a year from now and is alleged to have stolen $50,000 from a charity -- and (Clinton) was never investigated for hundreds of millions."" Giuliani told Cuomo he isn't interested in returning to government, but when asked whether he would accept the position of attorney general if it came with the condition of not going after Clinton, he said, ""I think that's a presidential decision."" ""We would have to talk about that. We would have to talk about what the -- what the ramifications of that to other prosecutions, future prosecutions -- how would you cover that, suppose more evidence came forward a year from now that we don't know now that makes it a much worse situation,"" the former New York City mayor said.""Do you believe that the value of that investigation is worth the political instability it would cause?"" asked Cuomo.""I told you, I think it's a very close question. I think that somebody should review that very carefully, as to how bad is that evidence. And if it isn't as bad as some of the exaggerators think it is, then maybe the best thing to do is forget about it and move on. If it is really bad, then somebody's got to look at it who is independent,"" Giuliani said.Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Christie, who has headed Trump's White House transition team and is reportedly under consideration for attorney general or chief of staff, was also noncommittal when asked about Clinton's future in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show Thursday. ""I haven't spoken to (Trump) about that. I will tell you they had an enormously gracious conversation with each other Tuesday night,"" he said. ""Again, politics are over now, people have spoken, time to move on.""""People wanted (Clinton) to be locked up. Those are his constituents,"" host Matt Lauer replied.""Listen, but the people get to speak through their vote and they voted for Donald Trump to be president of the United States. It is now his job -- and I am confident he will -- to bring the country together,"" Christie said.Both men were asked about their political futures under a Trump administration. Giuliani -- a former associate US attorney general under President Ronald Reagan -- tried to downplay speculation, saying he would consider the job of attorney general ""if it really was just me and I couldn't point to three others that would be just as good or better."" ""I certainly have the energy, and there's probably nobody that knows the Justice Department better than me,"" he said, adding, ""Christie is an excellent choice for any job in government.""And when Christie was asked on NBC if he was interested in being either chief of staff or attorney general, he delivered what NBC co-host Savannah Guthrie called a ""pregnant pause.""""You don't really think I'm answering any of these questions, do you? You know me better than that,"" Christie said. ""The answer is I'm not committed to doing anything in a new administration or not. The bottom line is that I have a job to do to help get the administration ready.""He added: ""If there's some role for me that I want to do and that the President-elect wants me to do, you know, we've known each other for 14 years. We'll talk about it."""	Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie: Lock her up? Maybe not so much	['Guthrie', 'Trump', 'Cuomo', 'Christie']	[]

""You're clever to ask the question that way through the side door instead of the front door. But, look it's really not an issue. Honestly, it just isn't. Right now, basically most of us have had two hours of sleep in four days. I think people are taking a breath, getting some of the details figured out. There's just these transition teams, as you know, have been working for months and months.

""There was no bragging, there was no relitigating issues from the campaign trail. And he did that.""He continued: ""I'm certain that what's in his heart is to continue reminding America that he wants to be a president for anyone in this country no matter who you are no matter where you are.""Author: Many white, working-class voters 'relatively pessimistic' about TrumpAnd when asked how much of a mandate Trump has, Priebus responded the Democrats are completely out of power and that Republicans will ""execute a plan and an agenda and that plan is going to be the one we campaigned on.""He added that Republicans will act on their campaign promises, not specifying if that included Trump's more controversial campaign platform points, such as his Muslim ban.Earlier Thursday during his Washington trip, Trump was asked by reporters directly about his controversial Muslim ban as he walked away from reporters. Asked later Thursday by CNN's Erin Burnett about the Muslim ban, Priebus defended Trump.""He said repeatedly there's no religious test. For you all to be coming back and relitigating something that is now five months old is what the problem is in our country,"" Priebus said on ""OutFront."" ""The problem is that we have to fill 24 hours a day, seven days a week of cable stations that create these issues that don't exist and turn people against each other.
