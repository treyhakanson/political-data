Share your videos and images on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook by tagging #cnnireport.At universities across the country, students were walking out Wednesday. Their aim: Pressuring officials to make their school a ""sanctuary campus"" that limits cooperation with federal immigration authorities.The protests came a week after the election of Donald Trump, who's said that deporting millions of undocumented immigrants will be a top priority once he takes office.What's a sanctuary campus?That depends who you ask. Petitions have been circulating at a number of schools over the past few days. Some ask universities to declare their support for undocumented students publicly. Others ask for more specific measures, such as guarantees that the school won't release information on students' immigration status and that university police forces won't team up with the feds in deportation raids.""Different campuses are doing different things,"" said Vera Parra, an organizer with Cosecha Movement. ""Actions are not necessarily directed at school administration, but about supporting undocumented students on campuses and their fears about what can happen to them and their families under a Donald Trump administration.""What are protesters saying?New York University students were among the first to walk out Wednesday.They packed part of Washington Square Park, calling out demands for the school to become a sanctuary and vowing to fight any government immigration crackdowns.An enthusiastic crowd repeated each speaker's words, line by line. ""We are unstoppable,"" the crowd chanted.But not everyone agreed. A man walking by yelled a response: ""You can't stop Trump.""Hannah Fullerton, a junior at the school who helped organized the protest, said she's determined to try.""We know that President-elect Trump could easily change a lot of policies, and we feel very threatened by that,"" she said. ""This is a moment where it's not about whether you're personally affected anymore. We have a duty to not just do something because it affects us, but because it affects those next to us, our neighbors, our community.""Pia Iribarren, a graduate student who's undocumented, said she and many others could be at risk if Trump rescinds the program that gives relief from deportation to immigrants brought to the United States as children. ""I didn't think we'd actually get to this moment,"" said Iribarren, who immigrated to the United States from Chile when she was a toddler. ""And yet, here we are.""Echoing the message, students from East Los Angeles College held a march Wednesday. The campus is located in the heart of the city's Latino enclave. Nearly 5,000 of some 30,000 students are undocumented, Marvin Martinez, President of East Los Angeles College,  told CNN. California privacy laws will protect anyone from trying to access the identities of the students to determine who's documented and who isn't, Martinez said. 5 key things anti-Trump protesters wantWho else is participating?In addition to NYU, organizers say students from about 80 schools around the country are protesting.A map released by organizers shows dozens of campuses. The map isn't official. People can sign up to place their campus on the map with an online form. But it gives a sense of where we might start to see protests popping up.What do others think?Word of the protests sparked a swift backlash on Twitter, where some users slammed students for participating.Many said students shouldn't expect their college campuses to protect them. Some called for funding to be cut to schools that pursued a sanctuary campus policy.How have universities responded?Some school officials have expressed support for students. But according to Inside Higher Ed, some schools have responded with statements suggesting that when it comes to cooperating with federal authorities, their hands are tied.Wesleyan University President Michael Roth said in a statement that he's weighing the idea.""In the coming days and weeks I will discuss this option with the appropriate offices and Trustees,"" he wrote. ""I will report back to the campus on what we can do in this regard.Where does this idea come from?In recent years, local governments across the country have been in the spotlight for fighting back against federal immigration enforcement by calling themselves sanctuary cities.Trump made them a focus on the campaign trail, pledging to block funding for cities that take that tack.More than 200 state and local jurisdictions have policies that call for not honoring US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention requests, the agency's director, Sarah Saldaña, told Congress last year.There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, county or state, and what it means varies from place to place."

1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/kfile-rudy-giuliani-undocumented-immigrants/index.html	"His past positions are directly at odds with President-elect Donald Trump's stated immigration policy, which is to end so-called sanctuary cities and deport millions of undocumented immigrants.  Giuliani is under serious consideration to join Trump's incoming administration in a high-level cabinet position, reportedly secretary of state or attorney general. A source familiar with the transition process told CNN this week Giuliani preferred secretary of state. Either role would give Giuliani a hand in federal immigration policy. A spokesperson for Giuliani did not return a request for comment. As New York City mayor, Giuliani praised the contribution undocumented immigrants made to the city and even went to court to protect them from being reported to the federal government. ""Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens,"" Giuliani said at a 1994 press conference. ""If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.""Appearing on WABC in 2001, Giuliani said, ""The city of New York, quite frankly, is quite tolerant of undocumented immigration and this shouldn't surprise you because I've been the mayor for a long time and outspoken on this issue, even nationally, I happen to agree with that.""""I think New York City should not deal with undocumented immigrants in a harsh way. I think they make a big contribution to the life of the city and were much better off being sensible and practical about it,"" he continued. ""And the reality is that restaurants are going to have a certain number of people who are undocumented, you know people that come here to make a living trying to help themselves and their families.""In 1996, Giuliani sued the federal government over a provision in a welfare law that said any city or state employees could not be prevented from reporting someone's immigration status to the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service. Giuliani argued at the time that the provision was a direct attack on New York City's Executive Order 124, which prohibited city employees from reporting the immigration status of an undocumented immigrant unless they were suspected of a crime. The court ruled against Giuliani. ""For those who may not know, 'Executive Order 124' is New York City's policy regarding undocumented immigrants,"" said Giuliani in an October 1996 statement. ""This order was issued seven years ago by Mayor Ed Koch and then later reissued by Mayor Dinkins and then by me. 'Executive Order 124' protects undocumented immigrants in New York City from being reported to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service while they are using City services that are crucial for their health and safety, and critical for the health and safety of the entire city. I know 'Executive Order 124' offends some people. They ask, 'Why should we pay to provide services for illegal immigrants?' The answer is it's not only to protect them, but to protect the rest of society, as well.""In a speech at Harvard around the same time in 1996, Giuliani forcefully argued for the city's right to ""protect the health and well being of our city"" by shielding undocumented immigrants from the federal government. ""The Tenth Amendment provides that 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people,'"" said the mayor in a speech at Harvard shortly before filing suit. ""One right not granted to the federal government is the right of state and local governments to provide for the health and safety of their local communities. This right is generally described as 'the police power.' When Ed Koch signed 'Executive Order 124' it was a classic example of New York City's police power being used to protect the health and well being of our city.""""Most likely, the federal government will reply that controlling immigration is one of their core functions. But this is a disingenuous argument,"" he continued. ""The federal government will be forced to argue that it has to treat undocumented immigrants unfairly in order to discourage others from coming here. Attempting to control immigration by creating a disincentive for a woman to report to the police that she has been beaten up by her husband is a very weak argument. And it's a horrible position for the federal government to take."""	Rudy Giuliani fought federal government to defend undocumented immigrants as NYC mayor
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/trump-children-security-clearance-controversy/index.html	"""I am not trying to get 'top level security clearance' for my children. This was a typically false news story,"" Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning.Trump's tweet comes after growing controversy over his reported interest in getting security clearance for his children -- Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner. A source with knowledge of the situation told CNN that Kushner could likely end up with a top national security clearance as a key adviser to his father-in-law, a position he is expected to take. The source said it is likely, but has not happened yet. Regarding security clearance for the other children, a transition source told CNN that an inquiry had been made, but that it had not yet led to any action. Trump spokesman Jason Miller, however, also denied Wednesday that an official request had been sent. ""The President-elect has not requested security clearance for any family members and no paperwork has been submitted to this effect. Any reporting otherwise is inaccurate.""Trump's adult children played key advisory roles during the presidential campaign, and it is not yet clear what positions they'll hold once their father takes office. The Trumps have suggested that the children will take control of the family business empire in a sort of ""blind trust"" while their father serves as president, but critics have countered that having family members running such a trust would do little to resolve major potential conflicts of interest. Sean Bigley, a federal security clearance attorney and former background investigator for the Office of Personnel Management, told CNN on Tuesday security clearance is tied to a position, not a person. As a result, clearance can't be granted without a specific position in mind. Clearance for Trump's children would be determined by what, if any, administrative positions they take -- something Kushner appears most likely to do. Bigley pointed out that the President does have the authority to create a new position, such as a special adviser, that would require access to classified material. But the person named to that post would still undergo a security clearance review. Under such circumstances, interim clearance can be granted in as little as 14 days.Democrats were quick to seize on the reports of Trump's interest in getting security clearance for his children, expressing concerns and hurling accusations of nepotism. Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, issued a statement rebuking Trump for the alleged request.""The President-elect's request of top secret security clearances for his children must be reconsidered,"" he said in a statement. ""Granting security clearances to people whose part-time interest in our federal government is rooted in nepotism and the numerous conflicts of interest created by their continuing to run private corporations could chill information sharing with private industry and international partners is not in the best interest of our nation. Our nation's top secrets should not be carelessly or casually shared with those without a national security need-to-know.""Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland), ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote a letter to new White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus asking for an explanation of the reported request and expressing his concerns. ""There is a process by which a position within the executive branch may be designated as a national security position if its responsibilities and assignments require eligibility for access to classified information. It does not appear that Mr. Trump intends to hire his children into such positions. If he does, however, that would raise significant concerns given their direct involvement in his business interests,"" Cummings said.Cummings later Wednesday penned a letter to Vice President-elect Mike Pence on the matter, asking him to provide a list of people who are being considered for security clearances."

According to the book, these included: ""Drop the names of foreign leaders and challenge him to identify their countries. Fight back if he brought up her husband's womanizing by reminding him of his own. Clinton's aides saw a pattern in Trump's behavior, an inability to let a slight go unreturned, and they thought Clinton could use this trait against him. If she played it just right, provoked him just enough, he might prove her case about his un-presidential temperament.""However, Clinton clearly understood the challenges she personally faced in finding balances between toughness and approachability, as well as depth and directness -- and the need to do it all against a candidate whom fact-checkers have found repeatedly misrepresented the truth on the debate stage.

The New York attorney general's office discovered most of the donated funds went to professional fundraising, and that ""the fraction that actually made it to NVVF was further reduced by a pattern of abuse, mismanagement and misspending by NVVF's former president.""In announcing a settlement which shut down the charity, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued a statement saying, ""There is nothing more shameless than exploiting military veterans in order to enrich oneself.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/trump-asia/index.html	"That's the big question facing Asia as President-elect Donald Trump gears up for the Oval Office. ""Trump's victory has amplified uncertainty across Asia. Many people are dismayed,"" says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan. From China and Japan to the smaller nations of southeast Asia, the region's leaders want to know whether Trump will make good on his campaign promises and potshots, which have the potential to shake up alliances, upend the geopolitical map and risk all-out conflict. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, has been quick to sense deep shifts in US interests. He will be the first Asian leader to meet Trump in person on Thursday en route to the APEC summit in Peru, when he'll try to safeguard the alliance between the US and Japan. ""I think Abe understands that Trump is a brittle person who takes offense easily and he will want to set a positive tone. He didn't have good chemistry with Obama,"" says Kingston.During the campaign, Trump stunned Japan and South Korea, two of American's strongest allies, by suggesting they were free-riding on US security commitments. Particularly jaw-dropping were the suggestions that Japan, which until last year had a pacifist constitution, should obtain nuclear weapons to protect itself from North Korea. ""Japan is the closest US ally in Asia and he'll want this to be reaffirmed,"" says Kingston.Abe ""will be seeking security reassurances and will no doubt press the point that it would be counterproductive to start a trade war with China,"" he added.  Japan will also want to know how Trump plans to approach North Korea, which has ramped up its testing of missiles this year, including a nuclear warhead. Trump has said he would be happy to host the country's dictator, Kim Jong Un, for a visit.""What the hell is wrong with speaking?"" Trump said in June. China has been a campaign trail punching bag for Trump. He threatened an all-out trade war with Beijing, which he has accused of ""raping"" the US. And Beijing is braced for Trump's blows, at least initially. ""It is possible that in the initial stage of Trump's presidency, he might bash China to establish authority as a new commander-in-chief, "" an editorial in the state-run Global Times newspaper said. However, Shen Dingli, vice dean of the Institute of International Affairs, Shanghai's Fudan University, is skeptical that Trump will make good on his campaign rhetoric given the deep ties between the world's two biggest economies. ""A trade war is inconceivable,"" said Shen. ""Trump is a smart person.  He said this to get the votes. Once he's in power, he will continue to be smart and won't want to hurt his chances to be re-elected.""Shen also expects Trump to focus more on his domestic priorities, making the US less likely to tussle with China over issues like the South China Sea. President Barack Obama's pivot to Asia was deeply unpopular in China.Trump's grandchild a viral hit in ChinaThe Global Times painted Trump as an isolationist who, with a highly divided nation at home, would be ""reluctant to raise antagonism with China.""""Without unity inside, a major power won't be determined to make troubles outside,"" the editorial said. Others have suggested that Trump, who has advocated torture, is less likely than his predecessors to take China to task over human rights abuses. Kingston said Trump's reception in China will ultimately depend on whether he delivers on the tough talk on trade. ""If he does, he will find it difficult to work with China. Trump has a short fuse, he could be easily manipulated and that could lead to conflict.""""But that aside, Trump has gifted them (China) global influence."" China's Xi Jinping and Donald Trump speak after election winTrump's victory has come at a bad time for South Korea. Its president, Park Geun-hye, is embroiled in a corruption scandal, that has led to unprecedented mass protests and sparked talk she may have to resign. ""Getting in early is smart for Abe,"" said John Delury, an associate professor of Asian Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. ""South Korea right now, it's (effectively) leaderless, there's nobody really to meet Trump.""Park is expected to be questioned by prosecutors this week, making travel unlikely. Multiple aides have resigned and she was forced to sack her prime minister. There's a lot at stake. The country, which is technically in a state of war against a nuclear armed North Korea, is home to 28,500 US troops that would defend the country in case of conflict. It's also where the United States plans deploy THAAD, a sophisticated missile defense system. Trump said during the election he would be willing to consider withdrawing US troops based in South Korea unless Seoul paid a larger share of the cost. ""Trump talking about renegotiating the alliance --  he feels he has a strong mandate. Park's lost the mandate, that's a bad way to go into a negotiation,"" Delury added. There was no love lost between Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and President Obama. Duterte called the outgoing US president a ""son of a bitch"" and threatened military and economic separation from its former colonial master. The White House under Trump would have a better relationship with Duterte, who are both strongmen populists, says Richard Javad Heydarian, a political science professor at De La Salle University in Manila.  He says Trump is less likely to rap Duterte over his controversial war on drugs and Duterte has already appointed Trump's business partner in the Philippines as a US trade envoy. ""Duterte as president will be more comfortable with Trump. Trump's more relaxed on human rights and democracy,"" Heydarian says.However, Heydarian fears a Trump administration, preoccupied and distracted with domestic issues, would not benefit smaller Asian nations like the Philippines in the longer term. ""The US ability to project its power will be reduced and the momentum will go to China.""US and Philippines: What's at stakeTrump's victory comes at a time of fraught relations between India and Pakistan with an escalation in violence in the Indian-administered state of Kashmir.Trump, however, has suggested he would like to see an improvement in relations. ""Well, I would love to see Pakistan and India get along, because that's a very, very hot tinderbox,"" he told the Hindustan Times in an exclusive interview last month.Though Trump has yet to reveal concrete plans for diplomatic relations with Pakistan, in a presidential town hall interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, said the country was ""a vital problem"" for the US given their possession of nuclear weapons.Mosharraf Zaidi, an analyst at Pakistani education organization Alif Ailaan, told CNN that the US' stance of favoring India would likely continue under Trump. ""As ever, Pakistan will have to deal with American pressure to support US and Indian interests in Afghanistan,"" Zaidi said.  ""A smart US president will be able to work closely with Pakistan, whilst also managing Indian expectations.""Zaidi also explained that Pakistan's recent successes in dismantling some terrorist groups in the region set it up to be a strong ally in the fight against ISIS.Trump has previously gushed about India, claiming he has a ""great love"" for the country because he has ""so many friends"" from there, he said in the same interview with the Hindustan Times.According to The Diplomat, India is likely to benefit from the US' commitment to Asian allies like Japan and South Korea, in order to block Chinese advancements in the South China Sea. The Indian Navy stands to benefit from these strategic ties as the US will likely enhance India's naval fleets.Trump's bid to fight ISIS will also favor India's fight against terrorism. However, if Trump pushes to curtail immigration into the US, this move could affect Indian IT companies that generate revenue based on H-1B visa programs that permit low cost Indians to find jobs in the US."
