Yet the biggest supporter remains Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist who was the Democratic Party's top donor during the 2014 cycle.Steyer has given $20 million to the organization through his personalized super PAC, NextGen Climate, and said in an interview Thursday that he did not plan to increase the size of that commitment in the coming weeks. Other top givers to the super PAC are Dustin Moskovitz, the Facebook co-founder who has stunned Democrats by injecting groups with $35 million out of nowhere, and his wife who together donated $5 million to For Our Future.RELATED: Trump campaign pulls resources out of Virginia""The organization is basically in place,"" Steyer said. ""If we decided at this point, 'Let's go do Hawaii', you really can't.""Democrats have long struggled to coordinate their field program, and the numbers reveal some success at least at generating buy-in to the effort. But nearly half of the super PAC's money, including $15 million of Steyer's, remained purely as commitments as of September 30, when the third fundraising quarter ended -- the super PAC will only report $29 million in contributions in the door.""We are really proud of the cross section of labor, progressive groups and individuals who have invested in this critical ground game operation to win on November 8,"" said Amanda Brown, the head of For Our Future, ""and to continue the conversations in our communities after the election to advocate for the issues these voters care about.""The unions that joined the effort earlier have given more substantial amounts: AFSCME contributed $4.8 million; the American Federation of Teachers donated $4.1 million; the AFL-CIO gave $2.3 million; and the National Education Association handed over another $2.1 million.RELATED: Road to 270But in August and September, the super PAC quietly recruited a new set of partners, their financial report will show: the Communications Workers of America, the National Association of Letter Carriers, United Steelworkers, United Automobile Workers and the American Federation of Government Employees, each of which forked over $1 million to join the collective.Other new members are the Office of Professional Employees International Union, Unite HERE and the trial-lawyers group, American Association of Justice, each of which gave smaller amounts.The nearly dozen unions have pledged another $15 million, according to the group.

As its older, whiter population ages and immigrant populations settle down, the United States will grow more diverse. Gradually, some Republican strongholds can become competitive. Prince William County, Virginia, is one such place.A very wealthy suburban county in the traditional swing state of Virginia, Prince William County once voted Republican. But over the past 15 or so years, its population has changed. Wealth and diversity have flourished outside of Washington, DC. Prince William County has become a majority-minority district, voting largely Democratic for the past few cycles. Signs bode well here for Hillary Clinton. Not only is it lacking the white working-class populations on which Donald Trump has built his base, it is also home to a disproportionate number of government workers who are quite familiar with her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. The Democratic vice presidential nominee is a Virginian who speaks Spanish, like a lot of Prince William County residents. According to data from Google Trends, Prince William County was the top county searching about immigration and the phrase ""en ingles."" Trump has done a lot to shake up this race, but he can't move demographics.

Can you imagine?""According to Fusion, Matthews was asking Trump about someday running for president.Trump running out of ways to winTrump's history with women has been in focus throughout the campaign, sharpening this week after the surfacing of a hot mic tape that featured Trump making lewd and sexually aggressive comments.Since then, several women have come forward to the media to recount allegations that Trump forced himself on them or groped them. Trump has denied all the accusations, calling them total fabrications. CNN has not yet independently confirmed those accounts.Trump was for decades very accessible to the press, often talking with radio shock jock Howard Stern about his love life and playboy lifestyle.

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/donald-trump-student-debt-proposals/index.html	"Trump, in a meandering speech to a group of rowdy high school and college students, called for a single student loan repayment plan capped at 12.5% of a borrowers' income and suggested borrowers would see their student debt forgiven after 15 years of making full payments.""We're going to work it out. It'll be a negotiation,"" Trump said, prompting one student to shout out ""Art of the Deal!""""We're going to work it out big league,"" Trump added.Trump's decision to explain a policy plank comes at a time when his campaign is grappling with mounting allegations of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations, but they have dominated the news for the past day and eroded his support among women and Republicans.But Trump's latest and most-detailed proposals on the issue offered little detail as to how much his plan would cost or how he would pay for it. Trump has repeatedly laid out expensive proposals, such as his sweeping tax cuts, while offering few avenues to avoid ballooning the federal debt, which Trump has said he is concerned about.Trump did not say how the government would pay for forgiving borrowers' student loan debt after 15 years or for capping student loan repayments at 15% of a borrowers' income.Trump simply said, ""If borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we'll let them get on with their lives.""Pressed for details, a Trump campaign aide said ""the plan will be paid for by lowering federal spending on ever-rising college tuition and fewer defaults on student loans."" The aide provided no estimates or dollar figures to back up the claim.The Republican nominee's campaign did not respond to requests for additional details and offered no additional explanation or supporting evidence, as presidential campaigns traditionally do when unveiling new policy.Trump has frequently said he is asked about student debt more than any other issue on the campaign trail and has called it a tremendous problem.Trump, as he has previously, also called for holding universities more accountable on the percentage of their endowment that they spend on administrative costs versus spending that directly impacts students.""If colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable, including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax exempt. We have a lot of power over the colleges. And they're not doing the job of cost cutting,"" Trump said.The campaign aide who provided additional information said Trump's plan would ""require"" colleges use their endowments to lower tuitions or risk those endowments' tax-exempt status. The plan also floats the idea of withholding federal funds to colleges that do not do enough to lower tuition.Throughout his remarks, Trump lamented the skyrocketing cost of education and the mounting total of student debt in the US, which in 2012 topped $1 trillion and has overtaken the amount of car, home and credit card debt in the country.Trump also said he would ""take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition,"" but did not lay out those steps beyond leveraging universities' tax exempt status to seek out concessions on tuition costs.Hillary Clinton has laid out a plan to tackle student debt that includes allowing borrowers to refinance their student loan debt and cap their repayments at 10% of borrowers' income, helping borrowers defaulting on their debt to protect their credit and offering a three-year loan repayment deferment program for entrepreneurs."

Check out: #GetPolitical — A CNNPolitics original series And the comedians are praised every week by their listeners for having an open dialogue about taboo issues.One thing they've been very open about on their podcast with their listeners is their opinions of the roller coaster that has been the 2016 election.""Being the president of the United States means you are the face of America, which means you have to be a good representation,"" Hutchinson told CNN in an interview in her Manhattan apartment. ""But also, I think the most important thing is that you know what you're talking about and you are a hard worker.""""This election is a comedian's dream and a nation's nightmare,"" Fisher said.Why they're with herBoth Hutchinson and Fisher said they're voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November because of many issues -- but specifically because of where she stands on women's rights.""I'm a very outspoken Hillary supporter,"" Fisher said. ""And things that young women will write about someone who, no matter what you think of her, has made history, is disturbing. People don't like Hillary, they think that she's mean and doesn't like people, this is a bit that I have, but yeah that's why we know she's smart, OK?""She continued: ""I've been waiting for this woman to become president because I think she's phenomenal.""Trump's campaign has had a rough two weeks. First, a 2005 hot mic conversation with Trump was published by The Washington Post where he boasted about being able to grope women as ""a star."" And then on Wednesday, The New York Times published the account of two women who said Trump made unwanted sexual advances, followed by a third account of similar behavior published by People Magazine. Trump has aggressively denied all of the allegations from those reports and a Trump attorney issued an open letter to the Times demanding an immediate retraction and apology. CNN has not yet independently confirmed either The New York Times or People Magazine accounts. Trump faces more groping allegationsAnd as a result, Trump is losing female voters. Nearly every national poll finds Clinton well ahead among women, and she holds a 17-point lead among women in the most recent national polling on the race from NBC and the Wall Street Journal.Hutchinson told CNN she believes the podcast contributes to starting an important dialogue in the country about issues that matter to listeners -- including women.""You have to have discussions and talk about it intelligently and calmly, which is something I need to get a little bit better at, but I think it's really important -- it's such an extreme, these two sides -- that's an interesting lesson we all need to learn. Especially in the age of the internet,"" Hutchinson said.Donald Trump rhetoric sparks Latino musicians to speak outFisher said she faces criticism from podcast listeners because her boyfriend is voting for Trump -- and they don't understand why she'd stay with him.""They're like, 'How could date someone who's voting for Donald Trump. You need to dump him.' First of all, not dumping him. And if I do, it's certainly not because he's voting for Donald Trump,"" she said. ""And it makes me angry that I can't like someone who has a different opinion than me. That's attractive to me. Liberals are very bad, I'm a liberal, and we are very bad about listening to the other side.""She continued: ""And I think the correct answer is usually something in the middle, as with everything -- it's in the gray area."""

I didn't even know I was doing it,"" Clinton said in an interview scheduled to air Friday. ""I knew that I said, 'Woo!' I knew that, but I didn't know that I did the little shimmy to go along with it. And then afterwards I saw it and now people are always saying, 'do the shimmy, do the shimmy,' you know?""Clinton also revealed what it was like sharing the stage with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump during the more recent debate last Sunday, joking that Trump would ""literally stalk me around the stage.""""My opponent, Donald Trump, was going to try to dominate the space almost to the exclusion of the people who were sitting there. I mean, they were sitting there so that we could talk to them,"" the former Secretary of State said. ""And because of the revelation of the public video and everything that came out on 'Access Hollywood,' he was really all wrought up and you could just sense how much anger he had. And, so he was really trying to dominate and then literally stalk me around the stage, and I would just feel this presence behind me. And I thought, 'whoa this is really weird' -- so I was just trying to stay focused.""Clinton explained that it was frustrating debating the real estate mogul both because of the distraction from policy issues created by the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, and because of the difficulty of fact-checking an opponent she said ""is consistently spewing falsehoods.""""It's frustrating, I feel such a sense of obligation to people. Everybody makes mistakes, don't get me wrong, I obviously have made more than my share, but to run against somebody and debate somebody who is consistently just spewing falsehoods,"" she said. The former first lady also reacted to a speech on her behalf on Thursday by current first lady Michelle Obama, who tore into Trump over allegations of sexual assault in addition to his sexually aggressive comments on the leaked tape. ""The speech that she gave, I think put into words what so many people are feeling,"" Clinton said. ""And not just women and girls, men and boys. In another part of her speech, she said, 'this is not the way men in my house talk.' And that's what I have been hearing from men the last several days."""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/battleground-map-2016-election-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/index.html	"But 25 days before the election, Trump's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency is looking more and more impossible by the day, as states he once said he'd flip from blue to red increasingly slip out of his reach. Meanwhile, reliably red states threaten to turn purple.Trump's odds of a win were spiraling downward days before the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" recording that surfaced last week and depicted him bragging about his ability to grope women as a perk of his celebrity. Since then, his support has collapsed -- particularly among women. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Clinton with a 9-point lead and a new national Fox poll released Thursday night that had Clinton at 45% and Trump at 38% in a four-way race.In the most stunning development of the week, Trump and Clinton were tied at 26% in ruby-red Utah, with virtually unknown independent candidate Evan McMullin closing in on third place with 22%, according to a survey from Y2 Analytics.""He's at a point where he's trying to draw an inside straight now by campaigning primarily in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina,"" said veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres. ""He is well behind in Pennsylvania; he appears according to the latest polls to be effectively tied in North Carolina and Ohio; and he's behind in Florida.""""Donald Trump said he would put new states in play,"" Ayres said, but he noted wryly that he never thought they would be the red states of Utah, Arizona and Georgia. Clinton's campaign has already invested resources in Arizona and is marshaling forces in Georgia as they eye ways to expand the map for down-ballot races. And this is before allegations this week from a growing number of women who have accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Trump has vehemently denied those accusations, and there is no data yet to gauge whether he will suffer further fallout in the polls, but it's another issue that has knocked Trump off-message with time running down before Election Day.  ""The map looked strong for Clinton at the start of this race and it's looking even stronger for her toward the end of it,"" Ayres said. ""If a landslide is winning in the Electoral College by more than 100 votes, Clinton is on track to do that now.""Because of Democrats' advantage in the Electoral College, Trump's path to the White House relied not only on keeping all the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012, but also seizing Democratic turf in states like Pennsylvania.Clinton held a 9-point lead in Pennsylvania, according to a new Bloomberg Politics poll released Thursday. Most striking was her lead in the Philadelphia suburbs -- the place where many strategists believe this race will be won or lost. A startling 56% of suburban Philadelphia voters said they were supporting Clinton, compared to 28% for Trump. What female voters in Philly suburbs really thinkEven if Trump were to win the mighty battleground states of North Carolina (where Clinton currently has a 4-point lead), Ohio, Nevada and Florida, he would still fall short of the 270 electoral votes that he needs to win. That means he would have to make up ground in Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin -- all states where he is trailing far behind her, according to new polls. Democrats have long been confident about their ability to win Colorado, where both Trump and Clinton visited recently And they are increasingly bullish about their chances in Nevada, another state Clinton hit this week.In another blow to Trump's campaign on Thursday, Republican sources confirmed that Trump was pulling his resources from Virginia, a state that has seen a huge influx in the number of foreign-born citizens and large growth among Asians, who have increasingly tilted toward Democrats in recent years.Because of demographic changes in Arizona and Georgia, those two states appear to be closer this year than in 2012 when Romney won them comfortably. Democrats had already made inroads with the large African-American population in Georgia, and been buoyed by the growing Hispanic population in that state. But Clinton has also shown particular strength this cycle among college-educated white women voters in the suburbs of Atlanta.While campaigning in Colorado this week, Clinton urged her supporters to get their friends out to vote in Utah and Arizona. ""We are competing everywhere, and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want a turnout in as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.""  Many Republican strategists still expect Trump to hold on in Utah and Arizona, even if he loses the race. But Democrats believe they are laying the groundwork for 2020 and beyond.Fox News national poll: Clinton leads Trump by 7""In the same way President Obama helped build up registration in the African American community and among millennials, Donald Trump is offering new opportunities for Democrats to make gains,"" said Bill Burton, a former Obama adviser.  Burton noted that in California, for example, registration among Latinos has grown exponentially, ""and you're seeing that trend across the country. It's opening doors that wouldn't otherwise be open.... Donald Trump is inspiring a whole new generation of voters to go out and get registered, and get engaged, it's really helping Democrats build up our network.""

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/donald-trump-female-voters-philadelphia-suburbs/index.html	"It's where her father must win in order to become president, but it's also full of voters -- mostly women -- who are likely to be turned off by Trump's caught-on-tape lewd comments, and allegations of groping women.Ivanka Trump's whirlwind day trip took her through all four of the so-called collar counties of Philadelphia as she worked hard to connect with female voters.""I wouldn't be able to go to the office every day if I didn't have a safe place to leave my children,"" she said in Drexel Hill. Earlier in Malvern, she spoke about her father's role as a mentor in her life. ""He was a great dad growing up and having three children myself, I recognize now it's really hard to be a good parent and it's very hard to raise a close knit family.""Ivanka played it very safe here, fielding only softballs from the crowds, like why she thinks her father would make a good president. In fact, that same question was asked at two events, as was a question about her memories of Philadelphia from when she attended the University of Pennsylvania.She was preaching to the choir. The rooms were packed with women, and some men, already all in for Trump despite his salacious language caught on tape, and several women coming forward accusing him of groping them.""He was at that time a reality TV star,"" said Melissa Braithwaite who, along with two friends, made clear they were steadfast and even defiant in their support for Trump. ""I think he wasn't saying what he does to women per se,"" she explained. ""I think he was just bragging.""Others blamed the media, and the Democrats, for dredging up an old tape of Trump, saying it has nothing to do with the issues that draw them to the billionaire. Still, when Pennsylvania Republican Jessica Curtis told us she was voting for Trump, she sounded a bit reluctant.""It's been a hard road,"" she said, sitting next to her 12-year-old daughter. ""If he said all those things right now -- in a different context it might be different but I had to separate it and I think he would do a better job representing a lot of what America needs,"" she added.Ivanka Trump did not take questions from reporters. She darted out of events in Chester and Delaware counties, ignoring our attempts to ask her anything.But Republican leaders here are well aware of the political reality outside of these tightly scripted events.A new poll from Bloomberg shows Trump trailing Hillary Clinton by a whopping 43% among female voters in the Philadelphia suburbs. Several GOP officials here privately say they have seen the bottom drop out in their own party polling since Trump's 2005 comments to ""Access Hollywood"" were leaked late Friday.Team Trump was clearly hoping local media coverage of Ivanka's events, and her positive comments about her father, will penetrate with female voters.For Trump to win Pennsylvania, it has to. In 2012, 22% of the total Pennsylvania vote came from the four counties that make up the Philadelphia suburbs. Mitt Romney lost all but one, Chester County, which he barely won.When Trump visited the Pittsburgh area the day after the last debate, he promised to be back to the Philly suburbs again and again, ""because we got to get that vote,"" he said.A group called Women for Trump is feverishly trying to do just that -- working the phones at a call center and going door to door -- even those who are not thrilled with his behavior.""I'm a feminist and of course it bothered me,"" said Marlene Furgiuele-Mentzer, who was making calls in Delaware County. ""However, the topics that are facing this country are far greater than the words on that tape and that's the bottom line.""On the suburban Philadelphia streets, some female Trump supporters say they're motivated by their opposition to Clinton. ""I think she's a liar. I think she's a fraud. I think she covers up a lot of things,"" said Colleen Green.But Susan Sluk, the owner of Eat. Drink. Om, a yoga studio in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said her female clients are now more likely to vote Clinton.""I'm hearing a lot of women that are really starting to dig their heels in and feel empowered about themselves based on what is happening in the campaign,"" said Sluk.That's true for some who say Clinton is hardly first choice.""If it were any other Republican candidate, maybe I would try to write Bernie in, but it's not just a time for a protest vote,"" said Hannah Collins.Every Wednesday night for months, Democrats in these suburbs have held what they call ""women to women"" phone banks for Clinton. This week, several said Trump's troubles are making their jobs much easier with many who were far from enthusiastic about the Democratic candidate.""A number of people have said to me that what was sort of an 'I'm going to hold my nose and vote for Secretary Clinton' has now turned into steadfast support,"" said Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh.The question is whether Ivanka Trump, or any Trump, can turn that around in under four weeks."

""You can't wait until that finally happens and then say that's too much and then think somehow you're showing any kind of leadership and deserve to be elected to the United States Senate.""Obama was speaking as the GOP confronts widespread defections after Trump's lewd comments emerged last weekend. Members of Congress, particularly those facing tough re-election battles, were swift to disavow Trump's comments, and many said they wouldn't vote for him at all.But the tape of Trump's remarks was only the latest in a series of offensive statements from the Republican nominee, who began his campaign alleging Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States, and barely let up on his harsh language as the campaign wore on.Obama declared Tuesday that Trump was merely the inheritor of a Republican Party already caught up in conspiracy theories and vitriol.""The problem is not that all Republicans think the way this guy does,"" Obama said ""The problem is that they've been riding this tiger for a long time. They've been feeding their base all kinds of crazy for years, primarily for political expedience. So if Trump was running around saying I wasn't born here, they were OK with that as long as it helped them with votes. If some of these folks on talk radio talked about how I was the antichrist, that's just politics.""""They stood by while this happened,"" Obama continued. ""And Donald Trump -- as he's prone to do -- he didn't build the building himself, he just slapped his name on it and took credit for it. And that's what happened in their party.

In August, Clinton was trailing Trump by 11 points there, Monmouth found.This latest poll suggests a shift in Indiana's political landscape, with Pence's approval rating slipping and Democrats looking more likely to win the state's Senate and  gubernatorial contests.Among the likely Indiana voters surveyed, 45% said they would cast a ballot for Trump and 41% for Clinton. Another 9% support Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson, while 5% remain undecided. Trump led Clinton 47% to 36% two months ago.Donald Trump is running out of ways to winTrump's slide in the polls seem to reflect public opinion in the wake of leaked 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" footage, in which the real estate mogul can be heard bragging about being able to force himself upon women. The poll was also conducted before and after several women publicly accused Trump of groping them, allegations that the GOP nominee has vehemently denied and CNN has not independently verified. The poll found a majority of Indiana voters (61%) had watched or listened to the tape and another 32% had read or heard about what Trump had said. About a third of the people surveyed (32%) said the businessman's comments rendered him unfit for president, while 56% considered them inappropriate but not disqualifying. 8 Republicans sent into distant orbit by Trump's 2016 odysseyThe poll also revealed dips in support for Trump among Indiana women (38% compared to Clinton's 47%), as well as his overall favorable ratings.

CNN has also reported that Clinton's campaign has invested resources in Arizona and Georgia in an effort to influence down-ballot races in those traditionally conservative states.The Monmouth University poll was conducted by telephone from October 11 to 13 and surveyed 402 likely Indiana voters.
