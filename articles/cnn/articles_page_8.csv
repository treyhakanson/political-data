Officials say a new wave of undocumented immigrants, mostly from Central America, are arriving on America's doorstep. And many of them are crossing here, along the US-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas.Did the election have anything to do with their decision to come to the United States? And how much will their chances of being allowed to stay here change once Donald Trump is in the Oval Office?The answers depend on who you ask.'They all know about President Trump'Last week, while most Americans were focused on the 270-plus electoral votes Trump won to clinch the presidency, the Department of Homeland Security announced another number: 46,195.That, the agency said, is the number of people who were apprehended at the southwest border in October. The number grew so much in a month's time (nearly 17%) that officials sent 150 more agents to this part of the border to help handle the influx.Manuel Padilla Jr., chief of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector, says the driving forces behind immigration remain the same: violence and poverty. And so far, Padilla says, he hasn't seen the US election playing much of a role.But McAllen Mayor Jim Darling sees things differently. Words said in Washington have a big impact here, says Darling, who's been McAllen's mayor since 2013. In the years since he took office, Darling says he's seen several waves of immigrants coming across the border. Two years ago, a surge of Central Americans from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador drew national attention and pledges from US officials that they'd put a stop to it. Darling says he thinks that wave of immigration had a lot to do with President Barack Obama's comments about immigration reform.Now it's happening again. And the mayor says his conversations with recent arrivals have revealed that Trump's campaign promises have a lot to do with it.""If you talk to them, they all know about President Trump,"" he says. ""They all know about a wall. ... The cartels that are encouraging and making money off this travel, they go down and they exploit that.""The message, he says, is clear: ""You better get over here before January and the swearing-in ceremony.""In the shadow of Trump's wallEven though thousands of immigrants pass through McAllen, according to its mayor, few of them stay. They're released from detention wearing ankle monitors and carrying  paperwork that requires them to appear at immigration offices soon. Then they're allowed to continue their journeys. Most are traveling to meet up with family members across the United States.""The people here ... they're coming to a neighborhood near you, America,"" Darling says.Hope and fearThe small bus station in this city near the border is filling up with people. Nearly all of them cling to manila envelopes displaying a message in bold print: ""Please help. I do not speak English. What bus do I need to take?""It's a solution bus companies came up with to help the throngs of passengers who are passing through, many of them undocumented immigrants just released from detention.Godofredo Lopez tears up as he talks about why he came to the United States from El Salvador.""To save my son's life. It's because they're killing them,"" he says. ""They're killing young people.""But even as he gets emotional about gang violence in El Salvador, Lopez says he can understand why Trump said the things he did on the campaign trail. He's simply trying to protect his country, according to Lopez. But he also says he hopes the President-elect will approach his new role with an open mind.""Maybe God will touch his heart and he will see why we came,"" he says.Like Lopez, many of the newly arrived immigrants inside the bus station appear hopeful. They've made it this far. It seems like the hardest part is behind them. Crossing the border and asking for asylum in the United States, they say, is their best shot at a better life.Some say they'd heard about Trump before they got here. But most say the President-elect didn't factor into their decision to make the dangerous journey to the United States.Stories from a desert bus station'They are not illegal people'The parking lot outside the Sacred Heart Catholic Church used to fill up with cars. Now two large, air-conditioned tents here have become a refuge for hundreds of immigrant families who come through daily.Some stay for just a few hours, Sister Norma Pimentel says. Others remain for a few days. No matter what happened to them before they got here, she says, they share one thing in common now: fear.Could the election results be contributing?""Most definitely,"" Pimentel says. ""There is a big fear in our community about what's going to happen. But ultimately, what we have to respond to is the fact that they're human beings. They are not illegal people. They are human beings who are asking for protection, and we cannot overlook that fact.""A new arrivalBack beside the Rio Grande, night has fallen.It's hot and humid. Swarms of mosquitoes are everywhere. It's getting hard to see the muddy roads that are carved out through the rough terrain. The only light in the sky comes from the full moon overhead and an occasional vehicle driving on the Mexican side border. It doesn't take long for three figures to emerge from the darkness along the riverbank. It's a woman and two teens who say they just braved the swift current of the river to make it to the United States."	Crossing the border as a Trump presidency looms

Sotomayor -- who wrote an unusually candid autobiography in 2014 -- is known as the ""people's justice"" for her ability to connect with her audiences.Near the end of the evening, a woman named Jessica stood up and asked an unusually poignant question. She identified herself as a security guard at the Metropolitan Museum in New York who had traveled from New York to meet the justice after being inspired by reading her book.""What would your advice be when you are feeling sometimes hopeless or discouraged in any aspect or spectrum of your life?"" asked Jessica, in a question seemingly unrelated to the election.Sotomayor, did not hesitate to respond.""I am not perfect, I get discouraged and I get sad and there are moments in my life where I thought 'why do I bother?'"" she said.She explained however, that her thinking has been shaped by the fact that she was diagnosed as a child with diabetes, something she discusses in great detail in her book. She said at the time the prognosis for the disease was very poor.""I believed most of my childhood, and I probably didn't change my mind until I reached 50, that I was going to die young,"" she said. ""And the one thing that that thought gave me was a drive to pack as much as I could in my life as fast as I could.""She went on to advise the woman to to find her passion: ""Don't give up, good luck."""

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/house-republicans-earmarks/index.html	"""We just had a 'drain the swamp' election,"" Ryan told members, according to a GOP source in the room. ""Let's not just turn around and bring back earmarks two weeks later.""House GOP members applauded and agreed to put off the issue until the first quarter of 2017, when they have more time to have detailed plan to oversee spending bill talks.Multiple House Republicans told CNN the proposal to reverse the ban was on track to pass in a closed door meeting before Ryan argued to slow down the process.Supporters of the change argued that ban on earmarks went too far because they can't direct funding to much-needed projects in their districts. They say the shift gave too much power to the White House and unelected bureaucrats in federal agencies who now decide where to spend the money. Former House Speaker John Boehner ran his leadership campaign on attacking the earmark practice and did away with it when he took over in 2011. Ryan supported that move and has emphasized it in recent speeches.Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, a champion of the reform when he served in the House, warned ahead of the vote in a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday that ""you can't drain the swamps by feeding the alligators pork.""Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, told CNN he supported reinstating earmarks but told reporters it would have looked bad for House Republicans to make the change as one of the first moves after the election.""We shouldn't be the only ones who have to carry this burden. Democrats would just beat the s--- out of us, even though they want to change it as much as we do. So it ought to be done in a bipartisan fashion and I think the speaker made the right decision postponing it.""GOP members told CNN they expected the issue to go through a committee process and eventually a vote on the House floor early next year so that the debate would be out in the open and both parties would be accountable for any change.  That could make it harder for proponents to roll it back since the practice of doling out money with specific line items led to cases of corruption. One former member of the Appropriations panel, California GOP Rep. Duke Cunningham, went to prison over charges that he traded favors for contributions and gifts.Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he strongly opposes the ban on earmarks that was put in place over his objections.""I'm one of the kinds of earmarks,"" the retiring Nevadan said. ""I think it was a terrible disservice to America to come up with this stupid idea to stop congressional-directed spending.""""I never apologized to anybody,"" Reid added. ""I go home and I boast about earmarks and that's what everyone should do.""But Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking GOP leader in the Senate, said if the rule is changed in the House it's unlikely to be adopted in the Senate and therefore would be moot.  A debate over spending authorityThe explosion in earmarks roughly 15 years ago gave the Appropriations Committee the nickname as the ""favor factory,"" with lobbyists contributing campaign donations to members of the panel and clients nabbing federal money for water systems, road construction and other items. The symbol of some of the wasteful spending was the infamous ""Bridge to Nowhere"" that linked a small Alaskan town to an island. Construction on that bridge was eventually canceled but it came after a spotlight on the practice of doling out so-called ""pork barrel"" spending.""I understand there were problems with it, and there were abuses in the earmark system, but it's still Congress' constitutional duty and responsibility to spend the money,"" Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta, a member of the Trump transition team, told CNN earlier Wednesday, adding, ""some bureaucrat somewhere could be spending this money and now we have no control over that spending.""Barletta said before Ryan's comments that he expected the proposal would have enough votes to pass, but outside conservative advocacy groups were lobbying against it.Florida Republican Rep. Tom Rooney, one of the members who proposed the change, told reporters Tuesday that the amount of spending wouldn't increase but would just be controlled by members of Congress who know the specific needs of their districts.Rooney told reporters his proposed change is not about money but about who has the authority to tell the Army Corps of Engineers how to dole out their funds for local projects -- Congress or ""unelected bureaucrats.""""‎I can write a letter and hope that they listen to me, which over at the Army Corps they probably take that letter and put it into the shredder. They don't give a rat's ass what I think.""The proposed rule change, also backed by Rep. John Culbertson and Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, would not have opened the door to members directing funds for all agencies, but if it passed it would have certainly put Congress back in charge of who gets billions of dollars in federal money.Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, pointed to last week's election results as evidence that House Republicans should keep the earmark ban. ""Did they learn nothing at all from these elections? People are tired of business as usual in DC. After this historic election are they really going to go back to business as usual in their first votes? This is not a show of good faith, it's a show of callous cynicism and hypocrisy.""Had the new rule been added to the House Republicans' package that is being crafted this week, it would have gotten a final vote in January when the House approves the guidelines for the new session of Congress."

I think what he should do is build consensus with these other countries that (Iran is) definitely violating the agreement,"" Corker told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead."" ""He's going to have Congress with him on that. I think that's a much better approach.""The deal is an international agreement between Iran and several world powers -- including the United States, China and Russia -- that aims to rein in the nation's nuclear stockpile. It became a serious point of contention between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the race to the White House. Kushner at the center of Trump transition 'infighting,' sources say""I think there's going to be strong bipartisan support for really pushing back on the violations that Iran is committing right now,"" Corker added.Addressing rumblings of internal turmoil within Trump's transition team, Corker said that like the formation of any new government, disagreement and reorganization would be inevitable.""You would expect the beginning of this, when you're lifting off at such speed, he's going to have a lot of moving parts,"" Corker told Tapper. ""There's a lot to this -- 4,000 positions. My sense is that all of us ought to understand how massive it is and chill a little bit and give them a little time to get their bearings.""Corker's name has been floated as a possible secretary of state appointee, among the likes of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, both of whom already boast close ties to the Trump camp. ""I understand I'm in the mix,"" Corker told Tapper. ""I also understand there are people who have been very close to the campaign, who have had long-term friendships, that are also in the mix. My sense is that those people are probably being looked at very closely right now. We'll see how it turns out."""	Corker says Trump won't tear up Iran nuclear deal
4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/japan-abe-trump-visit/index.html	"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday he had a ""very candid discussion"" with President-elect Donald Trump, during a brief press availability following their in-person meeting.Abe declined to explain in detail what he discussed with Trump because the visit was ""unofficial"" as Trump has not yet assumed the presidency, but he stressed that he emerged feeling that the US and Japan will be able to maintain ""a relationship of trust"" with Trump as president.The meeting was Trump's first in-person meeting with a foreign head of state since he clinched the presidency last week and comes after Trump has repeatedly suggested Japan should shoulder a bigger financial burden of the US's military forces in the region.Abe declined to say if the two men hashed out the defense issue or discussed their disagreement over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, but stressed that he emerged ""convinced that Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have confidence.""[Original story, published at 12:39 p.m. ET]Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he wanted to ""build trust"" with US President-elect Donald Trump ahead of their meeting in New York Thursday as he seeks to safeguard the long-standing alliance between the two countries. ""I am very honored to see the President elect ahead of other world leaders,"" Abe told reporters before his departure.""The Japan-US alliance is the axis of Japan's diplomacy and security. The alliance becomes alive only when there is trust between us. I would like to build such a trust with Mr Trump."" READ: What does Donald Trump mean for Asia?Like other Asian leaders, Abe was keen to discover how much of Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric will become policy, in particular whether Trump will follow through on a suggestion he might withdraw US troops from the region. A top aide to Abe, Katsuyuki Kawai, said that he'd been told by members of Trump's transition team that Trump's previous remarks should not be taken literally. Does Trump mean what he said?It's not hard to see why Abe wanted to get first word with Trump.The Japanese government was concerned by remarks made by Trump during his campaign about relations between the two countries. In particular, officials were rattled by Trump's suggestions that Japan, which until last year had a pacifist constitution, should obtain nuclear weapons to protect itself from North Korea.""Japan is better if it protects itself against this maniac of North Korea,"" Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper in March.At the time, Abe said that ""whoever will become the next president of the United States, the Japan-US alliance is the cornerstone of Japan's diplomacy.""A special adviser sent in advance by Abe to meet with members of Trump's transition team said he was told Japan shouldn't take Trump's campaign talk literally.""All the people shared the same opinion — that we don't need to be nervous about every single word and phrase said during Mr Trump's campaign,"" Katsuyuki Kawai told Japanese broadcaster NHK.Not following protocolThe President-elect and his team have not followed what is considered normal protocol in Washington D.C. His transition team has yet to contact the Pentagon, State Department or other federal agencies. It is also unclear in what order he has spoken with world leaders. A list issued Wednesday by his transition team details who he and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have spoken to but didn't give further details.Starting from scratch?Tomohiko Taniguchi, the Prime Minister's special adviser, said that Abe suggested the meeting during his congratulatory call to Trump on November 10. Eager ""to grab the chance"" to meet the President-elect, Abe decided to change his route to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima, Peru, to include a stopover in New York. ""He will have to work with Trump for the next four years,"" Taniguchi told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. ""This will be good opportunity for them to get to know each other well.""Reports suggest that Abe is starting from scratch in building his relationship with Trump.The Nikkei Asian Review reported last week that Abe had not been preparing for a Trump victory, and when he visited the US in September, he only met Hillary Clinton.Taniguchi told CNN that the US commitment in Japan is about more than relations between the two nations, it's about a commitment to the broader Indo-Pacific region.""As long as the US commits itself to this region, what matters is location,"" he said. ""And Japan can offer the best location in the region.""American isolationism?Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, suggested that much of Trump's tough talk on Asia talk might be bluster. ""Much of the world seems convinced that Trump's election signals the ushering in of a period of American isolationism in which Washington will retreat from the world, including from Asia, and abandon its allies,"" said Haenle, who served on the National Security Council under former President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. ""Yet, the statements that have emerged over the last several days from Trump's advisers indicate something very different -- that Trump will implement a robust a US military presence in Asia, provide strong support for Taiwan, and bolster US alliances."" Abe will also want to know how Trump plans to approach North Korea, which has ramped up its testing of missiles this year, including a nuclear warhead.Trump has said he would be happy to host the country's dictator, Kim Jong Un, for a visit.""Japan is the closest US ally in Asia and he'll want this to be reaffirmed,"" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan.""I think Abe understands that Trump is a brittle person who takes offense easily and he will want to set a positive tone. He didn't have good chemistry with Obama,"" said Kingston."	Japan's Shinzo Abe on US mission to 'build trust' with Donald Trump

""When you lose an election like this, you can't flinch, you can't ignore it. You need to look it right in the eye and ask, 'Why?' Analyze it and learn from it.'""As part of that post-election analysis, Schumer formally added top liberal lawmakers -- Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- to the ranks of leadership. But he also added Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat who is one of many Democrats facing perilous re-election bids in just two years. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said expanding the ranks of Democratic leadership to span the ideology of the party from Sanders to the more conservative Manchin was important to rebuilding the party and its message.Pelosi could be in trouble as House Democrats delay vote""We need a much more bolder discussion of the economy, not just Donald Trump,"" said Klobuchar, a member of the Democratic leadership.Democrats also shuffled some veteran lawmakers into new positions to prepare for pending battles with the Trump White House.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a long-serving California Democrat, will take over her party's top seat on the Judiciary Committee -- putting her in place to lead the fight against any Trump nominee for the Supreme Court. Veteran Judiciary member Patrick Leahy of Vermont will head to the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""We are ready to go toe to toe with Republicans,"" Schumer told reporters, noting that Democrats ""can't flinch and can't ignore"" results of election.Senate Democrats picked up two seats last week, but it was just shy of enough to win the majority. McConnell was formally nominated by Sen. Marco Rubio and freshman Sen. Todd Young of Indiana -- a nod to his extensive efforts in both states which helped him keep their majority.McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, led the successful effort to hold the Senate Republicans and was rewarded with an easy victory in a private meeting with his caucus. ""It's an honor to once again have been chosen by my colleagues to continue serving as their leader,"" McConnell said in a statement Wednesday morning. ""We are eager to work with House Republicans and President-elect Trump to bring the national and economic security our nation is asking for.""The list of items that senators will likely tackle with the new administration includes at least one area of bipartisan support -- infrastructure spending -- but will include hot-button items, like immigration and Obamacare. Rubio, who was hammered by Trump during the campaign for his previous support of immigration reforms, said he would consider Trump's call to build a wall but wanted more from the new administration. ""The wall and other barriers are a key aspect of it, but that alone won't be enough,"" Rubio said Wednesday. ""I think the vast majority of Americans would be in favor of doing something reasonable with people who are not delinquents and criminals, who have been here a long time. Especially those who were brought here as children."""	Chuck Schumer elected Senate Democrats' leader as both parties line up ahead of Trump battles

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/trump-agenda-gop-leaders/index.html	"But walking the line between cooperation with Congress and consistency with campaign promises is no easy task.""Transitions are such perilous times, in the words of [former Harvard Professor] Richard Neustadt, because they are times of maximum ignorance paired with maximum arrogance,"" said Russell L. Riley, author of ""Inside the Clinton White House: An Oral History.""Who could be in Trump's cabinet?During his improbable journey from reality TV star to President-elect, Trump broke with members of his own party on a variety of issues ranging from immigration to trade, from protecting seniors to cleaning up Washington.  Now, like Bill Clinton in 1993, George W. Bush in 2001 and Barack Obama in 2009, Trump enters office with his party in control of both the House and Senate. But that doesn't guarantee smooth sailing.Bill Clinton, for instance, fashioned an independent political identity during his 1992 campaign and was quickly tested after his election, noted Riley, the co-chair of the Miller Center's oral history program at the University of Virginia.Following his victory, Clinton had dinner in Little Rock with the Democratic congressional leaders of his day: Tom Foley, George Mitchell, and Dick Gephardt. Clinton's goal was to win their support for reducing the deficit, overhauling health care, and enacting family and medical leave. They happily agreed.But the barons of the Beltway had an agenda of their own: they wanted Clinton to put two of his signature issues on the back-burner: welfare and political reform.During his campaign, Clinton had called for the line-item veto, campaign finance reform, and significant reductions in Capitol Hill staff. He also had called for ""ending welfare as we know it"" -- a key issue for branding himself as a New Democrat. Despite the promises he made on the campaign trail, congressional leaders persuaded Clinton that political and welfare reform should take a backseat.""Bill Clinton thought it was important to offer some concessions up front. He thought they would offer compromises over time,"" said David Gergen, a senior CNN political analyst who served as an adviser to four presidents including Clinton. The congressional leaders came away thinking, ""This is a guy we can push around.""In the view of former Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, the concessions Clinton made on political and welfare reform left him looking like a ""typical liberal Democrat"" during the first two years of his presidency, helping to set the stage for the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress.Throughout his campaign, Trump presented a vision of ""America first"" economic nationalism that put him at odds not only with Democrats but also with his fellow Republicans. There are already signs that Trump is backing away from two of his most inflammatory positions that could ease relations with Republican leaders.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump deflected when asked if he would make good on his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. ""It's not something I've given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform,"" said Trump.Trump's team also took steps during the campaign to diffuse the conflict over his call last December for a ""total and complete"" shutdown on Muslims entering the United States by morphing his religion-based test into a more nuanced pledge to ""suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.""But even as he re-calibrates those two positions, Trump will still come under scrutiny for how closely he adheres to five promises that separated him from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders. Building a wallTrump's pledge to ""build a wall"" between the United States and Mexico might be the most oft-repeated campaign promise in recent American history.""On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall,"" said Trump on August 31 in one variation of his speech.But there are already signs that Republican leaders want to duck the issue. Asked three times on Wednesday by CNN if he supports Trump's signature plan to build a wall, McConnell would only say: ""I want to achieve border security the way that's most effective.""For his part, Ryan said after the election that he sees the need for some kind of ""physical barriers on the border"" but he said he would ""defer to the experts"" on the right way to secure the border.What to do with undocumented immigrantsLast year, Trump called for setting up a deportation force to remove all 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.Later on in the campaign, Trump changed his focus to ""criminals."" Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" Trump said he is now focused on deporting or incarcerating the undocumented immigrants who are drug dealers or gang members -- a group that Trump estimates includes 2 to 3 million people.For now, congressional leaders are doing their best to paper over their differences with Trump on immigration by saying they are focused on border security.Ryan said this week the US must come up with a solution that does not involve mass deportation.""We are not erecting a deportation force,"" Ryan told CNN's ""State of the Union with Jake Tapper"" on Sunday.But down the line, Republicans will be faced with the question of what to do with the larger group of 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States who have not committed serious crimes while being here. During the campaign, Trump ruled out a pathway to legal status for this group if they do not first leave the United States.""There's no path to legalization unless they leave the country,"" Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper on August 26. ""When they come back in, then they can start paying taxes, but there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and then come back.""This position puts Trump at odds with Ryan, who supports a path to legal status without having to first leave the United States.""I'm a person who believes that for the undocumented, we have to come up with a solution that doesn't involve mass deportation, that involves people the opportunity to get right with the law, to come in and earn a legal status while we fix the rest of legal immigration,"" Ryan said at an April 27 town hall sponsored by Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service.NAFTA and trade Trump has changed stances over the years on a range of issues -- everything from guns to abortion to health care.But one area where Trump has been consistent since he emerged on the national scene in the 1980s is his belief that US trade deals have undermined American workers and put the country at a competitive disadvantage. On day one of his administration, Trump has promised to: (1) renegotiate -- or even withdraw -- from NAFTA; (2) to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership; and (3) to direct his secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. In his first 100 days, Trump has promised to pursue legislation he refers to as the ""End the Offshoring Act"" that would establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers and relocating overseas. But Ryan will not commit to passing tariffs.The ""smarter way"" to help workers is ""fixing"" the US tax code ""not tariffs, not trade wars,"" Ryan said on ""State of the Union"" Sunday.Ryan's ""Better Way"" agenda calls for implementing a ""destination-basis tax system"" that would exempt exports and tax imports.""There are better ways of dealing with making American products and workers more competitive,"" said Ryan. ""And really, that's fixing our tax code.""The future of MedicareAnother area where Trump broke from GOP orthodoxy is on the nation's entitlement programs for older Americans.""[Ryan] wants to knock Medicare way down ... I'm not going to cut it, and I'm not going to raise ages, and I'm not going to do all of the things that they want to do,"" Trump told WROK radio back in March. ""They want to cut it very substantially -- the Republicans -- and I'm not going to do that,"" Trump added, referring to Medicare and Social Security.Ryan's policy blueprint, however, calls for gradually raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 beginning in 2020. It also calls for capping overall government spending on the program that could make seniors financially liable for future cost growth.It would also transform Medicare into what Ryan calls ""a fully competitive market-based model known as premium support."" Traditional Medicare would compete directly with health plans offered by private insurance companies.In a sign that Trump might be moving in Ryan's direction on Medicare, the President-elect's new transition website -- GreatAgain.gov -- says: ""modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation -- and beyond.""Congressional term limitsIn the middle of October, following the release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape when many in the media had already written off his chances, Trump proposed a package of reforms to ""drain the swamp in Washington"" -- everything from congressional term limits to new restrictions on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyists.In his ""Contract with the American Voter,"" Trump promised quick action.""On the first day of my term of office,"" the contract read, ""my administration will immediately ... propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.""McConnell, one day after the election, said term limits would be a non-starter in the Senate.""It will not be on the agenda in the Senate,"" said McConnell. ""I would say we have term limits now -- they're called elections.""But despite McConnell's opposition, Trump renewed his push for amending the Constitution to include congressional term limits during a Sunday interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes."" ""We're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits,"" said Trump. ""We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system."""
