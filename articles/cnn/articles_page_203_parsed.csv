Michael McCaul, if the two squared off in 2018. It's unusual for senators not to endorse colleagues from the same party -- let alone from the same state.But Cornyn's decision to stay out of a primary challenge shows how frosty Cruz's relations have become with his GOP colleagues after three years of bitter infighting and name-calling from the campaign trail. Cruz himself declined to endorse Cornyn during the senior senator's 2014 primary campaign.""I'm not going to get involved in any primary races particularly with my colleagues in the Senate,"" Cornyn told CNN when asked about Cruz and McCaul squaring off. ""We'll see what happens, but we've got plenty to worry about between now and November 2016 before we start worrying about November 2018.""Reminded that senators typically back incumbents from their own party, Cornyn demurred.""I see no benefit to anyone to get involved in the contested Republican primary so I would sit on the sidelines and watch with interest,"" Cornyn said, adding that he is ""not recruiting anybody"" to get into the race.Cornyn's comments come as a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign to recruit McCaul into the race has begun to take shape, intensifying after Cruz's speech at the GOP convention in July when he refused to endorse GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump -- eliciting backlash in some quarters of the GOP.Yet defeating Cruz in a primary challenge would be a tall order, given the deep support he has from grassroots conservatives and the national fundraising network he built during his presidential campaign this year. McCaul, however, is one of the wealthiest members of Congress. And he has positioned himself as a leading GOP voice on national security issues as chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.On Wednesday, McCaul declined to say if he would rule out a run against Cruz after November.""I'm focusing on reelection,"" McCaul told CNN when asked if he was considering a run against Cruz. ""That's my focus right now.""Cruz has largely avoided weighing in on McCaul, but he sent out a fundraising notice last week saying that the establishment is looking to fund a primary challenge against him.On Wednesday, Cruz declined to comment about McCaul as he was walking into a hearing.""I'm headed to a Judiciary Committee hearing,"" he said."

And if some of his advisers have their way, not ever.Even as his running mate, Mike Pence, prepares his own much less interesting tax returns, and even as his opponent Hillary Clinton and all of her supporters rail on the issue -- and what Trump might be hiding -- Trump has stood firm.The stated reason is an ongoing ""routine audit."" ""Just so you understand I'm under audit. A routine audit. And when the audits complete I'll release my return,"" Trump reiterated Tuesday on Fox News.But Democrats point to a series of theories behind Trump's rationale to break with decades of major party nominee tradition -- and conversations with tax experts and officials indicate some, if not all, may have merit. First and foremost is the idea that the audit precludes Trump from releasing his returns. This, according to tax lawyers, is not correct. Now, Trump has made clear that he's operating under the advice of his lawyers, who recommended he not release his returns. Trump's view is backed up by his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who, in an earlier stage of the election, when she was supporting Sen. Ted Cruz, had called for Trump to release his returns.""I've learned since being on the inside that this audit is a serious matter and that he has said that when the audit is complete, he will release his tax returns,"" Conway said last month on ABC News.Trump's own tax counsel, in a letter released in March, said the review of Trump's taxes encompasses the ""2009 year and forward."" A previous review of Trump's returns from 2002 through 2008 is complete, according to the letter, ostensibly meaning Trump could release those returns at any point should he choose. But his campaign continues to maintain that as long as an audit is ongoing, there will be no release. Trump has appeared unconcerned about the whole thing.""Nobody cares about it except some of the folks in the media. Nobody cares about it,"" Trump said in his Fox News interview.Clinton's campaign, for its part, has continued to zero in on the tax issue -- with Clinton and running-mate Tim Kaine hitting Trump on the trail. Her campaign is also using the issue in in digital ads and tweets. And a ""Donald Ducks"" protest was arranged by Democrats in front of Trump Tower in New York.The reason, according to Democrats familiar with the strategy, isn't exactly a state secret: 64% of Americans surveyed think Trump should release his taxes, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. That includes 41% of registered Republicans. Those numbers appear to be having an affect even among Trump supporters. Rep. Mark Sanford, a South Carolina Republican, took to the opinion pages of the New York Times to call on Trump to release his returns.""Equipping voters with more, not less, information as they pick those who run for the highest offices in our land seems, to me, a reasonable requirement for anyone aspiring to those positions,"" Sanford wrote. He went so far as to say his future support for the GOP nominee may depend on the eventual release of his returns.Trump would be the first nominee not to release his returns in more than four decades. There's also precedent for the attacks on the issue serving as a potent political cudgel (see: Romney, Mitt). But Trump and his team have made clear they aren't in a hurry to fall into line with that trend. ""We just don't see much upside,"" one Trump adviser told CNN.Here are the reasons why:  Trump's tax rate is likely very low -- if not zeroJust because Trump hasn't released his returns doesn't mean there's no insight into his taxes. As a developer and a casino magnate, submitting his tax returns -- or the topline numbers from them -- is something Trump has had to do quite often throughout the course of his career. The picture it paints is one that may be contributing to Trump's reluctance to release his returns. A CNN review of the documents, most obtained through open records requests, show at least two years in the 1970s when Trump paid $0 in federal income tax. At least one year in the next decade Trump paid nothing at all in income tax, according to New York City tax documents obtained by CNN.An important point is this: as a real estate developer, Trump has had, over the course of his career, access to more tax breaks and loopholes than any other profession. From depreciation, to deductions and credits, and deferrals on sales, and like-kind exchanges, Trump has had ample opportunity to use the tax code to his advantage --- and he publicly acknowledges he has done just that.""I mean, I pay as little as possible. I use every single thing in the book,"" Trump told supporters in Iowa in January.Trump's charitable giving will be laid bare -- if it exists at allThere's also the issue of Trump's charitable giving. While Trump has repeatedly claimed charitable largesse, an in depth review by the Washington Post has raised questions as to whether Trump was as willing to give as he claims -- or if he gave anything at all. The details of what Trump has given individually would be shown in his tax returns. Trump's business relationships are voluminous -- and potentially problematicA glance at Trump's rather lengthy financial disclosure form, filed in May with the Federal Election Commission, makes clear: Trump's business empire has a long, global and rather complicated reach. As Trump's tax counsel put it in their March letter: Trump ""holds interests as the sole or principal owner in approximately 500 separate entities."" Those entities, Trump's lawyers said, ""engage in hundreds of transactions, deals and new enterprises every year.""This, more than anything else, is the area that piques the interest of Democrats looking to attack Trump. The reason, according to one adviser to the Clinton campaign, is both the ability to play on the fear of the unknown, and tie it to the known problems Trump has had in his business career. As Clinton told reporters on Tuesday, ""The list goes on and on, the scams, the frauds, the questionable relationships with business activities that has stiffed workers, refused to pay small business. Clearly his tax returns tell a story that the American people deserve and need to know.""Trump's annual income -- not as illuminating as one might thinkThe obsession over Trump's worth, both on his part and the part of outside observers, is something that would not get a definitive answer through Trump's tax returns. Trump's statement, along with those financial disclosure forms, that his ""net worth is in excess of $10 billion"" wouldn't be confirmed or proven false by Trump's annual returns. But the returns would provide a clearer window into Trump's individual finances -- most notably his adjusted gross income -- and shed more specific light on his finances than the disclosure form, which requires candidates only to list the values of the holdings in broad ranges.Trump, for his part, has said repeatedly he has no problem releasing his returns -- and downplays their potential political impact.""I don't know when that's going to be, but when the audit is complete, I'll release my returns. I have no problem with it,"" Trump said. ""It doesn't matter."""	Donald Trump's tax returns: Why won't he release them?	['Sanford', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]

So, I'm here with a message: It will be OK,""  Clapper told an audience at the Intelligence and National Security Summit in Washington, D.C. He said any presidential transition is always ""a volatile time for our country,"" and went on to describe the intelligence briefings that are being provided to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Clapper noted the briefs were provided by career intelligence professionals and not political appointees and that the topics discussed and the candidates' questions would remain confidential. That's because both the opposing campaigns and America's global adversaries would be interested in knowing what the candidate are thinking, Clapper said.He also lauded the transition process and Harry Truman's decision to brief the candidates after feeling unprepared upon assuming the presidency in 1945. ""I'm really glad as a citizen he made the generous decision to prepare his successor,"" he said.Clapper also said he was looking at the classification system and said ""we're guilty"" of sometimes overclassifying information. He indicated that the ""confidential"" classification could be eliminated.Clapper said he had sought recommendations from the intelligence agencies on the issue. ""I got an excellent response from CIA yesterday on what we can do to be more transparent, to not to overclassify. There's proposals going around, one of which is why don't we just not bother with 'confidential,' that would somewhat simplify the system.""Clapper discussed recent cyber attacks on the Democratic National Committee but said it was not the first time that kind of hack has been undertaken. ""Cyber will continue to be a large problem,"" he said.On threats the next administration will likely face, Clapper cited both climate change and terrorism.Clapper added that ISIS will eventually be suppressed but said that other extremist groups are likely to arise in its place.The US will be fighting terrorism for the long term, calling it a ""perpetual state of suppression for some time to come.""Clapper, who has over 50 years of experience in the intelligence community, struck a valedictory tone in his remarks, poking fun at his age (75) and joking about attending the inauguration of John Adams and briefing the first candidates to receive intel briefs during the campaign in 1952.Asked if anything still surprised him, he responded ""not really"" and said he plans to ""sleep"" when asked about his post-government plans."

There's been so much bloodletting, so much destruction,"" Brennan told the CTC Sentinel, a publication of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.""I question whether we will see, in my lifetime, the creation of a central government in both of those countries that's going to have the ability to govern fairly,"" he added in the interview which was published Wednesday.While Brennan has previously called into question Syria's long-term stability, his comments about Iraq, where the government in Baghdad has been a key ally in the fight against ISIS, are likely to rankle officials there. The US has long called for a unified Iraq, despite sectarian divisions that have led some to recommend a partitioned state.Brennan raised the possibility of autonomous regions being established in Iraq in lieu of centralized government control, adding that ""to have representative governments, something akin to a Western-style democracy, is going to be difficult.""In addition to supporting a centralized Iraqi state, the US has opposed the creation of autonomous zones in Syria.""We do not believe the answer is self-autonomous rule in certain zones,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters about Syria in March.The wide-ranging interview with Brennan was co-conducted last month by CTC Sentinel Editor in Chief Paul Cruickshank, who is also a CNN terrorism analyst, at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. It touched on a variety of issues concerning the evolution of the terror threat in the 15 years following the 9/11 terror attacks.Brennan said that compared to al Qaeda, ISIS is a lot less ""deliberate"" in its planning and more ""free-wheeling,"" willing to carry out attacks on shorter notice. ""You look at 9/11 and other major attacks, and it was very deliberate, methodical, a lot of planning went into it. I think ISIL tries to move from idea to bang within months or within weeks,"" Brennan said, using the administration's preferred acronym for ISIS. Brennan also said ISIS members are younger and better able to exploit technology to aid their terrorist activities.""The younger you are these days, the more adept you are at being able to use very sophisticated and leading-edge apps for your activity,"" Brennan said. He noted that ISIS has used chemical weapons on the battlefield in Syria and did not rule out the terror group using such weapons in its global attacks.""I would not put anything past these individuals who are so depraved and are dedicated to mayhem and carnage,"" Brennan said. The CIA chief also highlighted the long-term problem of foreign fighters, calling them ""astronomical"" in number and saying, ""Those not killed in the fighting are going to present a challenge for our governments for years to come.""And while Brennan noted that ISIS and al Qaeda have engaged in a rivalry in Syria and elsewhere and described them as ""visceral enemies,"" he also said that in war-torn Yemen the two terror groups were working together on local issues where they face shared enemies."

Bondi, who is now a top Trump supporter in Florida, decided not to pursue the case.The Washington Post revealed late last week that Trump paid the Internal Revenue Service a $2,500 fine because charitable organizations like the Trump Foundation are not authorized to donate to political groups. A Trump aide also told the Post that the real estate mogul had since reimbursed the foundation for the improper donation.The Republican nominee insisted Monday in a gaggle with reporters that he ""never spoke to"" Bondi about the investigations into Trump University.""I never even spoke to her about it at all. She's a fine person. Never spoke to her about it. Never,"" Trump told reporters aboard his plane in the skies of Ohio.Trump, who has said repeatedly that he made political contributions to Democrats and Republicans alike in order to further his own interests, rejected the notion that the donation was at all politically motivated.""I've just known Pam Bondi for years. I have a lot of respect for her,"" Trump said. ""I just have a lot of respect for her as a person. And she has done an amazing job as the attorney general of Florida.""Hillary Clinton's campaign team has grown frustrated that as focus is trained on Clinton's own family foundation, little attention -- in their eyes -- has been paid to Trump's donation to Bondi. Over the weekend, aides furiously tweeted about the attention discrepancy, getting into Twitter fights with reporters in the process.On Monday aboard her new campaign plane, Clinton weighed in.""I am quite taken aback by the foundation making a political contribution to the Florida AG who was just about to investigate Trump University and then ending the investigation,"" Clinton said. ""There's so many things that are questionable about that. And the IRS certainly thought so and said it was illegal and fined Trump for that set of facts."""

""He has a bizarre fascination with strongmen and authoritarian leaders in countries that are no allies of the United States, and with respect our allies, he would toss alliances aside, and says he wants to, quote, 'Take everything back from the world that we've given them,'"" Kaine said, speaking here at a historic USO building. Trump has expressed praise and expressed admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin, Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, among others, in the past. He has said Putin ""is a leader, unlike what we have in this country,"" believed Gadhafi was effective at killing terrorists and praised the young North Korean leader's rise to power, saying, ""It's pretty amazing when you think of it.""The Democratic vice presidential nominee, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees and has a son serving abroad in the Marine Corps, flexed his foreign policy muscles in remarks primarily focused on Clinton's Republican rival and the contrasts between the two candidates on national security. The push is part of a campaign focus of hitting Trump on national security, according to Clinton aides speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. They noted early voting begins in many states this month, and Clinton relishes going after Trump on the topic because she feels like she knows it well and he doesn't.At Tuesday's speech, Kaine called out Trump for his shifting stance on the Iraq War, saying he ""misled"" voters about his position. ""In Trump's first campaign speech, he claimed that he'd had the foresight to say, 'Don't hit Iraq,' because you're going to completely destabilize the Middle East ... It's one of the main rationales for his candidacy. And it's completely made up,"" Kaine said.""These days, he rails against the decisions to pull troops out of Iraq, a decision set in motion by the Bush administration, claiming that that decision led to the creation of ISIS. So here's the problem: In 2006, Trump believed we weren't pulling our troops out of Iraq fast enough. He said we should, quote, 'Get out of Iraq as quickly as possible.'""He poked the billionaire's credentials further, knocking him as a ""TV star.""""Trump has misled the American people over and over about his position on Iraq. He was for invading Iraq.  And then he decided he wasn't. He was for leaving Iraq. And then he decided he wasn't. He says whatever he feels like at any given time because you can do that when you're a TV star. But you can't do that when you're president of the United States.""Kaine also chided Trump for his meeting last week with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, with whom he later entered into an online spat over whether they discussed if Mexico would pay for a wall along the US-Mexico border.""Just hours after his first international foray into foreign relations, Trump was in an online feud with one of our neighboring heads of state, our second largest trading partner,"" Kaine said. ""Now, if you're going to get into a feud with an ally, how about dealing with an adversary? I guess we should be glad it was only a Twitter war, because In a few months, he could have control of the armed forces.""Kaine has increasingly stepped into the role of vice presidential attack dog for Clinton in recent days. Late last month, he said Trump was ""pushing"" the values of the Ku Klux Klan. He backed away from the comments a day later, telling reporters that Trump has some supporters ""connected"" with the KKK who are ""claiming him.""Last week, he suggested Trump wouldn't stand up to a Russian cyberattack of the American election, and then criticized the ""cozy bromance"" between Trump and Putin."

""The FBI resolved all of this, their report answered all the questions. Their findings included debunking his latest conspiracy theories.""Clinton added, ""I believe I have created so many jobs in the sort of conspiracy theory machine factory. Because honestly, they never quit. They keep coming back.""Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, called for an investigation into whether Clinton tried to impede Congress' initial investigation into her email server by deleting an archive of her emails.Indiana Gov.

""That was not something I was aware of and I think the fact point out that there was no connection. It wasn't something, as far as I understand, that was related.""Asked on Tuesday if she was worried about Chaffetz's call and whether she asked for the emails to be deleted, Clinton flatly said, ""No, of course not.""""I have no concerns,"" Clinton said of the deletion. ""And neither did the FBI.""RELATED: FBI director: Hillary Clinton 'extremely careless' but no charges recommendedClinton has spoken with reporters twice in the two days that she has had her campaign press plane, a pace that is far greater than any other time during her earlier time on the campaign trail.During a 23-minute question-and-answer session Tuesday, Clinton also sought to lower expectations around the first presidential debate held later this month and built up Trump's ability to debate.""I am preparing for the debates. I am doing my homework. Donald Trump is a self-proclaimed great debater who won every one of the Republican debates. So I take nothing for granted,"" Clinton said. ""I think this will be a difficult, challenging debate.""Clinton notably did not rule out going after Trump's personal life on the debate stage. The former secretary of state added that she was not going to comment on whether Libertarian Gary Johnson should be able to get into the presidential debates.Some polls have shown that Johnson close to qualifying for the debate, but experts say it is unlikely that he will.A CNN poll released Tuesday found Johnson at 7%, well below the needed 15%. The same poll found that Trump lead Clinton nationally by 2%, within the poll's margin of error.Clinton dismissed the poll, saying she doesn't pay attention to the non-stop sampling.""I really pay no attention to polls,"" Clinton said, adding, ""We are on a course that we are sticking with."""

Inside, volunteers use laptops set up on the kitchen table to register American-Israelis as absentee voters, and Marc Zell, co-chairman of Republicans Overseas Israel, hands out ""Trump for President"" pins. Zell, an American-Israeli who lives in the West Bank settlement of Tekoa, was an ardent supporter of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and a harsh critic of Trump during the Republican presidential primaries, blasting Trump often on his Twitter account: ""Trump is tripping over himself on foreign policy. How can we trust this guy to be Commander in Chief?"" and saying ""Trump is disgracing himself about 9-11."" But after Rubio dropped out, Zell switched sides and became a fervent Trump backer. With two months until the elections -- and six weeks until the deadline for voters to register -- Zell and his team are trying to sign up as many American-Israelis to vote as they can.Republicans Overseas estimates there are 300,000 American voters in Israel, with some 60,000 or more living in West Bank settlements. iVote Israel, a non-partisan group that helps Americans register to vote overseas, puts the number much lower at 200,000. Of those, 80,000 voted in the 2012 presidential elections, according to iVote Israel. The US Department of State does not track the number of voters overseas.READ: Trump finds support among Israel's AmericansSwing state focusThe Republican supporters will focus their efforts on Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida -- three swing states with relatively high Jewish populations.

That can make a difference,"" said Abe Katsman, one of the leaders of Republicans Overseas in Israel.The office in the West Bank, designed as a mobile unit of volunteers that will travel to settlements with large American populations, adds to Republican offices in Jerusalem, Modi'in, Tel Aviv and Raanana. Republicans Overseas plans on opening more offices soon, including in Gush Etzion, a settlement bloc in the southern West Bank. Republicans Overseas raises its money locally, not relying on funding from the Republican party or the Trump campaign, according to Zell, though he said they coordinate with the campaign daily.""Americans in Israel have had enough of the last eight years and don't want what many would perceive to be another four years of continuing those policies. I'm not claiming that they all love Donald Trump -- not at all -- but I think they see it as preferable [to Democratic nominee Clinton],"" Katsman said.Zell made the case in the Times of Israel that recent changes in the Republican Party's policy on Israel could boost support for Trump among voters there: ""[The Republican Party platform] eliminated any reference to Israel as an occupier.""""That wasn't just a play on words, that was a real statement that coincides with Donald Trump's own statements recently that when it comes to building homes and synagogues and schools for Arabs and Jews in Judea and Samaria, this is an issue for the Israeli government to decide and the Israeli people to decide,"" he said, using the biblical names for the West Bank.

He pointed specifically to college affordability which he said, ""didn't go quite as far as I wanted,"" but was happy enough with the position Clinton finally adopted.The Democratic convention may have given the impression of party disunity amidst an ousted chairwoman and protesting Bernie supporters, but attendees at today's rally saw authenticity in Bernie's message.Ellen Wood, a corporate finance consultant, was excited to see Sanders take the stage for Clinton and hopes he does more events for her in the future.
