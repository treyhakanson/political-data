Clinton has a large lead among women compared to Trump -- 57% to 30% -- and is close with Trump among male voters -- 40% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.First on CNN: Trump debuts 6 new TV ads, pledges an advertising blitzAdditionally, most voters in the Granite State have already decided whom they'll be voting for in November. The poll found that 71% of likely voters say they have definitely decided whom to support and 14% are leaning towards someone, with 15% still undecided.Both Clinton and Trump are unpopular in the state, according to the survey. The poll found that 43% have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, while 53% have an unfavorable opinion of her, and 4% are neutral. For Trump, only 26% of likely New Hampshire voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican nominee, while 69% have an unfavorable opinion, and 4% are neutral. The poll surveyed 907 randomly selected adults in New Hampshire and was conducted during October 11-17. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.

Trump enters the match-up in his weakest position yet in national polls and is losing ground in key battleground states. And he is making perhaps his most outlandish argument yet -- that the 2016 election is rigged to help Clinton win. Clinton, meanwhile, will have a fresh set of questions to answer around newly released hacked emails and fresh revelations about her use of a private email server at the State Department. If the last two debates are any indication, Wednesday night promises to be contentious, theatrical, and unpredictable. Here's what to watch:Will Trump insist the election is 'rigged?""With his national poll numbers sliding and Democrats making a strong play for Republicans strongholds like Arizona, Trump is issuing a fresh warning to supporters: If I lose, don't believe the results.His message that the election is ""rigged"" and that the political system is skewed to guarantee a Clinton victory, shows Trump taking his distrust of the media and propensity to fuel conspiracy theories beyond what even he has exhibited previously.It's a scorched-earth strategy that the Republican nominee appears likely to stick to before millions of viewers on Wednesday night, even though many of Trump's fellow Republicans have repudiated talk of a rigged vote.Trump's critics argue that his insistence that the election is rigged simply underscores the nominee's growing pessimism about his Election Day prospects.At a news conference in the White House Rose Garden on Tuesday, President Barack Obama mocked Trump for ""whining before the game's even over.""There is ""no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections,"" Obama said.Trump's theatrics -- and can Clinton ""go high?""Trump managed to catch almost everyone by surprise at the second debate in St. Louis last weekend. Less than two hours before the event, Trump convened a media availability featuring women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in the past. Trump then invited that group to sit inside the debate hall -- no doubt a move aimed at throwing Hillary Clinton off of her game.The entire spectacle was a reminder that there is nothing predictable about the nominee, and there's no telling what theatrics the GOP nominee might resort to in Las Vegas. His campaign has already announced they will bring Obama's Kenyan-born half-brother, Malik, and Patricia Smith, mother of Benghazi victim Sean Smith, to the debate.Trump could be in an especially volatile mood as he tries to beat back a flood of new allegations that he had inappropriately kissed or groped women and is on the defensive about his flailing poll numbers.Clinton has so far responded to Trump's bombast with a strategy most famously articulated by Michelle Obama: ""When they go low, we go high."" The Democratic nominee appears likely to stick to that theme Wednesday.At the very least, Trump's top advisers say that they would prefer a final debate focused on substance and policy, rather than the troubling accusations that have recently overwhelmed their candidate.""If it were up to me this entire conversation would be about what I know the people would want it to be about, which is the issues,"" Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. ""They want this debate to be about health care and terrorism and the economy and taxes and corruption and government.""Despite these comments from his own campaign manager, Trump has repeatedly struggled to stay focused on policy, choosing instead to unleash attacks on various foes like House Speaker Paul Ryan or former Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado.Steady and practiced: Will it work for Clinton again?If Trump's debate performances have been unpredictable and his debate preparations unconventional, Clinton has stuck to the most traditional playbook -- practice, practice, practice.The Democratic nominee has kept a grueling debate prep schedule ahead of each of the three debates, even clearing her calendar of campaign events for days at a time. (Sunday, she held a six-hour prep session at a hotel near her home in New York.)All of the time spent hunkered down with advisers appeared to pay off in the first two debates -- Clinton has avoided major gaffes; consistently fact-checked her opponent; and stuck to a collected demeanor on stage.But the political terrain on Wednesday night will be tricky to navigate, even for a practiced debate veteran.Over the last week, WikiLeaks has continued to release hundreds of pages of purportedly hacked emails of campaign chairman John Podesta. The documents include what appear to be transcripts of Clinton's past speeches at Goldman Sachs (the campaign has not commented on the authenticity of the transcripts).WikiLeaks releases transcripts of Clinton Goldman Sachs speechesIn one of the speeches, Clinton says it was necessary for Congress to beef up financial regulations ""for political reasons"" -- comments that will not sit well with critics who believe the former secretary of state is too cozy with Wall Street.Clinton's emails have also been thrust back into the spotlight.Newly released documents on Monday showed a top State Department official appearing to try to convince FBI officials to declassify contents of an email from Clinton's private email server. The revelation has raised questions about whether the State Department offered a ""quid pro quo"" in exchange for declassifying an email -- a charge that the FBI has denied. Clinton is posed to pivot any WikiLeaks talk to Russia. Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri told reporters that in addressing the issue, Clinton will discuss the ""disturbing role"" that Russia is playing in the U.S. election.""We think that important context for that should focus on the extraordinary and unprecedented and very disturbing role that Russia is playing in trying to influence our election,"" Palmieri said.Chris Wallace's monumental taskFox News anchor Chris Wallace has the prestigious assignment of moderating the election's final debate -- but he also faces tremendous pressure to hold Clinton and Trump accountable.Past debates have ramped up pressure on the debate moderators to resist playing the role of a passive referee. There is an expectation for Wallace to call out the nominees if they make false claims and aggressively keep them in check, particularly if they cut away from the questions that are asked.And at a point in the election where conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated allegations are threatening to become more than just fringe ideas, Wallace, more than ever, will be expected to remind viewers what is and isn't on the level.Complicating matters for Wallace is the fact that Trump has waged war against some of the anchor's colleagues at Fox News. Wallace acknowledged the weight of the task in front of him, saying on Sunday: ""This is not a TV show. ""He has announced six topics for the debate, including some on policy that have not been addressed in the two previous meetings. The topics: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, Supreme Court, foreign hot spots and fitness to be president.""This is part of civics, the Constitution if you will, in action, because this is helping millions of people decide who we're going to elect as the next president,"" Wallace said. Closing arguments: Clinton...Clinton's major challenge Wednesday night is not so different from the challenge she's confronted over the past few months: presenting the country with a positive vision for her presidency that is detached from her argument against Trump.The Democratic nominee's day-to-day feuds with Trump have at times obscured her own message. Her aides openly acknowledge that the process of running against such an unconventional candidate like Trump has made it hard for Clinton to stick to her talking points and share her personal story -- this is part of the reason the nominee has delivered a series of ""Stronger Together"" speeches in recent weeks centered around her decades in public life.Trump...Trump's challenge is even more significant. The debate is a final chance to try to convince skeptical voters that the first-time political candidate is capable of assuming the office of the presidency and turn around the deeply embedded narrative that he lacks the temperament to be commander-in-chief.Not only will that be difficult to do so close to Election Day, it's unclear that Trump will stray from his default position of throwing red meat to his existing base of supporters. At a campaign rally in Colorado the day before the debate, Trump ran through his usual list of grievances -- including questioning the accuracy of polls and accusing the media of bias -- and presenting himself as a Washington outsider.""Decades of failure in Washington and special interest dealing must and will come to an end,"" Trump said. ""Either we win this election, or we lose our country.""Will there be a handshake?And of course, the big question of the night: will Clinton and Trump shake hands this time?

Libertarian Gary Johnson received 8% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein registered 3%, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll released Wednesday.Clinton made significant gains in the new poll among demographic groups that she has struggled to win over during the campaign, and which have formed the bedrock of Trump's base. The Democrat is now winning male voters, 46% to 44%, and voters without a college degree, 48% to 44%. Clinton also maintained a large 17-point edge among women voters overall, and carries white women 46% to 45%.The poll also found that 56% of voters said the 2005 recording of Donald Trump talking about sexually assaulting women ""will be a concern"" as they vote, compared with 40% who said he had put the issues to rest. Clinton's lead is also helped by stronger partisan support. Ninety-three percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they back Clinton, while 85% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters support Trump. Clinton leads 39% to 38% among independents. Both candidates continue to shoulder net unfavorable ratings, though Clinton (-5, favorable vs. unfavorable) fares better than Trump (-25, favorable vs. unfavorable) on this measure. The new poll also found that Clinton supporters were more likely than Trump supporters (59% to 42%) to say they would be ""panicked"" if their candidate's opponent won the White House. Additionally, Trump supporters were found to be slightly more enthusiastic and slightly more certain of who they would vote for. The Bloomberg politics poll was conducted between October 14-17, and surveyed 1,006 likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 points.

I'd like to answer that question in another 15 years from now. I think she is going to go down at a minimum as a great senator. I think she is a great wife to a president. And I think Bill Clinton was a great president.""""You know you look at the country then,"" he continued. ""The economy was doing great. Look at what happened during the Clinton years. I mean, we had no war, the economy was doing great, everybody was happy. A lot of people hated him because they were jealous as hell.  You know people get jealous and they hate you.""While Trump and Clinton will go head-to-head in the final debate Wednesday night, he had nothing but nice things to say about her and Bill Clinton eight years ago. ""Bill Clinton was a great president. Hillary Clinton is a great woman and a good woman,"" he said in the interview. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment.Trump wrote about the interview in a blog post at the time, saying, ""Hillary is smart, tough and a very nice person, and so is her husband. Bill Clinton was a great President. They are fine people. Hillary was roughed up by the media, and it was a tough campaign for her, but she's a great trouper. Her history is far from being over.""Trump echoed those same sentiments in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer a year earlier, in March 2007, saying, ""I think she's a very, very brilliant person, and as a senator in New York, she has done a great job. Everybody loves her. She just won an election with a tremendous majority and she really — she's become very, very popular in New York. And it wasn't easy.""Trump has been attacking Clinton for her record as a senator in recent weeks, and going after her and Bill Clinton for the former president's sexual misconduct while in office and alleged misconduct before he became president. ""There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women,"" Trump said of Bill Clinton, adding, ""Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously."""

""It's not rigged, @realDonaldTrump,"" Warren added in another tweet. ""You're losing fair & square. Put on your big-boy pants because this is what accountability looks like."" The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Warren's latest salvo.Warren has drawn the ire of Trump with her fiery criticisms both on Twitter and the campaign trail. Trump has responded in kind, repeatedly referring to Warren as ""goofy"" and ""Pocahontas"" -- the latter a reference to the controversy surrounding the senator's claims of Native American roots.Warren's Wednesday tweetstorm came hours before the third and final presidential debate, and a day after President Barack Obama also chided Trump over his rigged election claims.""You start whining before the game's even over?"" Obama said during a news conference. ""If whenever things are going badly for you, and you lose, you start blaming somebody else then you don't have what it takes to be in this job."" As his poll numbers have cratered in recent weeks, Trump has claimed that the election is being corrupted by voter fraud and a coordinated media campaign designed to sink his campaign. The candidate has urged supporters to monitor polling sites on Election Day.Many Republicans have repudiated those claims, but Warren said Wednesday that Trump ""didn't come up with the 'rigged' election himself.""""It's a longtime effort by the @GOP to delegitimize @TheDemocrats,"" she said."

""My opponent keeps saying I'm gonna run for president.

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/politics/nevada-2016-election-results/index.html	"Nevada has been kind to Trump, handing him a resounding victory in this year's caucuses that helped him clinch the Republican nomination, even though he had little in the way of a campaign apparatus and hundreds of volunteers who were entirely new to the presidential process. The Republican Party is trying to match the enthusiasm of Trump's Nevada supporters with resources, conducting volunteer trainings all over the state this year  in an effort to turn Trump's eager supporters into phone-banking and door-knocking regulars. Their biggest challenge will be to catch up with the formidable Democratic machine, powered by labor in a state where union power is strong. In the latest CNN/ORC poll this week, 46% of likely voters planned to support Clinton, 44% said they would support Trump and 7% said they would support Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson.Those numbers showed Trump's resilience in Nevada, given that the CNN/ORC survey was conducted after the release of an ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump boasted about groping women, and as a number of women stepped forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct -- allegations that he has denied. Mysteries of 2016: 7 unanswered questionsThe numbers also show Clinton's challenge here. During the primaries, many voters in Nevada, including Democrats, expressed reservations about the former secretary of state — questioning her trustworthiness, as well as concerns she was too liberal on Second Amendment issues, which are critical in this state. Nevada is growing in importance as the campaign reaches the final weeks, in part because it's a state that President Barack Obama carried twice and where Trump shows signs of strength. Clinton's strong advantageClinton enters this final stretch with a strong advantage in the race to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency. That means Trump must win all the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012, while also making incursions into blue states that could tip the map in his favor. But his potential paths have narrowed, particularly as Clinton has held on to her advantage in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, Wisconsin and Virginia. And a new poll released Wednesday found Clinton leading in the traditional Republican stronghold of Arizona.Trump has nudged Iowa in his direction despite Obama's two wins there, but the Republican nominee's path to victory relies on him making a clean sweep of Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Nevada. Even if all those states were to fall into Trump's column, he would still need to pick up at least five additional electoral votes, which is why he continues to campaign intensively in Pennsylvania and Colorado despite long odds there. But Clinton has many built-in advantages here -- most notably the growing Hispanic and Asian populations that tilt in her favor. Democratic and labor groups have made huge efforts this year to register new Hispanic voters, and to help others achieve citizenship through special workshops. Trump's rhetoric about Mexicans and his vow to build a wall have helped accelerate those Democratic efforts. The CNN poll shows Clinton holding a 21-point lead among Hispanic registered voters over Trump in Nevada. Obama: Trump's rigged election claim 'whining before the game's even over'The support for the two candidates in Nevada is also split dramatically by education level. Trump holds a huge lead over Clinton among whites without college degrees, who favor him 58% to 33% for the former secretary of state. Clinton leads among whites with college degrees 49% to 41%. As in other states, Clinton leads Trump among women by 15 points; while Trump leads Clinton among men by 10 points. Outspending TrumpClinton and her allies are also outspending Trump. They have spent at least $8.4 million in Nevada, in addition to nearly $50 million on national cable which touches many Nevada households, making the state among the top five of Clinton's targets. One of the ads running frames Trump as ""America's bully,"" featuring him alongside some of the most well-known bullies from the movies. Trump and his allies have spent $2.5 million in Nevada, making it the sixth most targeted state on his list. Debate guests: Trump takes Obama's half-brother, Clinton picks CubanOne thing that polls cannot measure is the power of the well-organized turnout operations led by labor groups here, which could lead Clinton to victory.As the political universe descends on Las Vegas for the final debate, the powerful Culinary Union is staging a series of demonstrations against Trump, calling 2016 ""the year of the immigrant voter."" Their members plan to protest at the Trump Hotel Las Vegas, calling for a boycott of his properties, and to build a wall outside the property with taco trucks -- a tongue-in-cheek reference to the controversial rhetoric of the founder of ""Latinos for Trump"" this summer.

Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein picked up the support of 7% and 4%, respectively. There are increasing signs that Clinton could be poised for an upset in Arizona, which has a large Hispanic population unreceptive to Trump's hardline immigration rhetoric. A Democrat hasn't carried the state since 1996, when Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, won re-election in a landslide. Trump heads into the third and final debate in Las Vegas Wednesday night amid slipping fortunes, as an avalanche of sexual misconduct allegations have clouded his campaign in recent weeks. A new national poll from Bloomberg Politics found Clinton leading Trump by nine nationwide. And as her lead as swelled nationally, Clinton has cut into Trump's support in longtime red states. A poll published Tuesday from the University of Houston showed Clinton and Trump neck-and-neck in Texas, a state that hasn't voted for a Democrat since 1976.The Arizona poll was conducted October 10-15 using live phone interviews with 690 likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.	Arizona presidential poll: Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 5 points

""He was embarrassed that he had said those things and he apologized."" Ivanka Trump, the Republican presidential nominee's oldest daughter, said her father does not consistently speak the way he does on the tape.""That's not language consistent with any conversation I've ever had with him, certainly, or any conversation I've overheard. So it was a bit jarring for me to hear,"" she said. ""And he was very sincere in his apology.""Trump apologized for bragging in a private conversation about being able to grope women and get away with it, actions that would amount to sexual assault, in a tape first reported by the Washington Post, though he's also used the report as pivot to talk about former President Bill Clinton's past indiscretions. At the second presidential debate just days after the footage went public, Trump dismissed his words as ""locker room talk"" and denied ever grabbing a woman's private parts without her permission.However, since then at least nine women have gone public accusing Trump of various degrees of sexual misconduct including touching them in a sexual way uninvited. Trump has completely denied all of the allegations and CNN has been unable to independently verify their accounts. As Trump's place in the polls has declined, he has increasingly complained about elections being rigged, something even many within his own party have dismissed.But when asked if she agreed that the election was ""rigged,"" the candidate's daughter chose to focus on media coverage. ""I will tell you that the media has been vicious,"" she said. ""And we take it personally.""Trump was also spotted speaking with Anita Hill, most well known for testimony against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas during his nomination hearing in 1991, in a photo tweeted out by Fox News' Nine Easton. When reached by phone, Hill declined to comment to CNN on the discussion she had with Trump, and Trump didn't mention it during her remarks.Trump's children have very publicly been on board with their father's campaign, but Trump said nothing could have readied her for the political journey of the past year and a half.""I may have been naïve going into this but nothing in life prepares you for a parent running for the president of the United States of America nothing,"" she said. ""There's no training.""Trump's words come a couple of days after Melania Trump defended her husband in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. Melania Trump, in her first interview since the Republican nominee faced allegations of sexual misconduct, called those accusations ""lies"" and saying Trump was ""egged on"" into ""boy talk"" during a 2005 tape in which he made lewd comments about women.""I believe my husband. I believe my husband,"" she said Monday. ""This was all organized from the opposition. And with the details ... did they ever check the background of these women? They don't have any facts."" While Ivanka Trump has often hit the trail on behalf of her father and promoted some of his policies, she rejects the idea that she is his surrogate.""I hate the word surrogate cause what does that mean,"" she said. ""I don't express my views on policy with one exception as it relates to child care and advocating for women because I never thought I'd have this platform but it was incredibly important to me that I contribute to that conversation."" ""But no I'm not a surrogate. I'm a daughter,"" Trump added. ""I do dismiss this idea of a surrogate because I don't think it appreciates the role that I'm playing as my father's daughter."""
