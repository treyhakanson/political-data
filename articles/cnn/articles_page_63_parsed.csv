If Trump were a traditional politician, he'd be telling supporters about now that the only poll that matters is the one on Election Day. In fact, Trump has been telling supporters the polls are ""rigged.""They're not. But what if the polls are simply wrong? Brexit surpriseOne vocal Trump ally says pollsters get things wrong -- and he has personal experience to prove it.Nigel Farage was one of the loudest voices campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in the crucial national referendum held in the United Kingdom in June.His side won the vote on ""Brexit"" to the surprise of much of the world. (The site that already paid out on a Clinton victory said there was only a 10% chance of the pro-Brexit side winning.)""On the day of the vote, there was an opinion poll that put us 10 points behind, but we won,"" Farage claimed in an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin.The polls were wrong because people who don't usually vote turned out, Farage argued.""Modern polling companies cannot get to non-voters who are re-entering the system. The question is, is Trump reaching non-voters? I'm told that new registration of voters is quite high. It could be that Hillary's ahead, but maybe by not so much."" Trump even said as much at a rally Sunday, describing his would be victory as ""called Brexit plus plus plus.""        Big enough lead for Hillary? Unfortunately for Trump, Farage doesn't quite have his facts right.John Curtice, the dean of British polling, said Brexit surveys were actually pretty accurate.""In the end, the average of the opinion polls was 51-52% for Remain, but we had some putting Leave ahead, and the Internet polls said it was a 50-50 shot from the beginning,"" Curtice said. The vote turned out to be 51.9% for Leave to 48.1% for Remain.""The polls in the UK, we can say, were 2 or 3 points out, but you wouldn't want to say more than that,"" Curtice added. Trump is not polling that close to Clinton, at least in the immediate aftermath of the renewed FBI interest in her email server.But there have been two British polling humiliations in recent memory, with errors big enough for Trump to draw comfort from, Curtice conceded.""There are certainly historical precedents in the UK: 1992 (and) 2015, where the average error of the polls is roughly 7-8 points, the kind of lead that Hillary currently has in the polls,"" he said.""So, sure, if anybody has any sense, you wouldn't want to say that Trump's chances are zero.""And Curtice said Farage may have something else right: British pollsters may have failed to pick up people who don't normally vote but did show up to vote Leave in June.""We don't have the data,"" he said. But ""if Trump does get the people who don't normally turn out to vote, who don't normally get called by the pollsters, then the polls may be wrong.""The art of pollingThat's because polling is not just number-crunching, said Robert P. Jones, the head of PRRI, a Washington-based opinion research organization.""It is some part art as well as science,"" he said. ""We have to start modeling 'likely voters.' You have got to make some judgments: Is the electorate like 2008 or 2012?""Farage has argued that some Trump supporters may be embarrassed to say they are backing him, which would mess with the pollsters' models.""Maybe also people aren't telling pollsters the truth. Thinking, I don't want to tell a pollster I'm voting for Trump, but in private, that's how I feel and that's what I'm going to do,"" he said. Steve Hilton, who was a political strategist for former British Prime Minister David Cameron, thinks that's very possible.""There is highly likely to be a secret Trump supporter phenomenon. I don't think it's possible to estimate how many, and polls will by definition not pick them up,"" said Hilton, who is now the chief executive of political crowdfunding and data site Crowdpac.He sees a parallel between ""the widespread moral shaming directed at Brexit supporters there and Trump supporters here, most obviously seen in Hillary Clinton's 'basket of deplorables' speech, which mirrored accusations in the UK that Brexit supporters were racist, xenophobic, bigots and so on.""There is no way to predict how much impact they will have, if they exist, Hilton said.""I think it's unlikely that the secret Trump supporters are numerous enough to sway the entire election, but in tight races in places like Ohio and possibly even Michigan, they could deliver a real surprise next week,"" he said. What's socially acceptable?But Jones, the opinion pollster, doubted there is a mass of secret Trump voters.Pollsters know that people are more likely to give socially acceptable answers when they're contacted in a telephone survey -- there's even a name for the phenomenon. It's called the Bradley Effect, after Tom Bradley, an African-American candidate for governor of California in 1982. Polls incorrectly predicted he would win. Looking back, experts think that's because at least some people told pollsters they would vote for Bradley, even though they didn't plan to, in order to avoid sounding racist.Internet polling can help control for such misdirection, Jones said, because people who fill out online surveys don't have to interact with a live person.""There is no evidence that there are secret Trump voters who are systematically lying to pollsters because they believe it is socially unacceptable to tell a live interviewer they are supporting him,"" Jones said""This fall, PRRI conducted both self-administered online polls and live interviewer telephone polls and we saw no significant differences. So I see no evidence of secret Trump voters who are simply reluctant to admit they are voting for Trump.""In fact, the only firm data available at the moment -- early voting statistics -- suggest that the Democrats, not the Republicans, have the advantage nationwide.But in the end, Curtice said, the politicians' clich√© about unfavorable polls is true: ""The only way to find out is on the day itself."""

The Montgomery (LCS-8) was traveling from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean through the canal's series of ""locks"" when it hit a cement structure known as the ""center lock wall"" while under the control of a local Panama Canal pilot, according to a statement to CNN from the Navy. ""The crack is located 8-10 feet above the waterline and poses no water intrusion or stability risk,"" the Navy said, adding that the ship has since exited the Panama Canal to continue its trip to San Diego as scheduled. USNI News first reported the damage, which didn't require immediate repair.The incident is the latest in a run of bad luck for the $360 million state-of-the-art warship since it was commissioned in September.In fact, the Montgomery experienced a separate mishap just weeks ago that also resulted in a crack to its hull. It  sprang a leak after it was hit by a tug boat pulling it out of the path of Hurricane Matthew. An investigation into possible causes of that October 4 incident is under way, according to a statement that was made to CNN last month by Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Haggard, a spokeswoman for the Naval Surface Forces Pacific. Earlier, just days after its commissioning, the Montgomery also experienced a seawater leak into the vessel's hydraulic cooling system, and then lost one of its gas turbine engines later that day.The Montgomery's Panama mishap is just the latest in a string of incidents that have dogged the LCS program.In September, the service announced a major overhaul of the LCS program that will include designating the first four of the ships as testing vessels and limiting their overseas deployments to emergencies.That announcement came less than two weeks after the Navy had revealed breakdowns in two of the ships, the USS Freedom (LCS 1) and USS Coronado (LCS 4). Those followed mechanical failures in the USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) and USS Milwaukee (LCS 5), all since December.The new deployment plan for the LCS fleet isn't a response to the breakdown issues, Navy spokesman Lt. Kara Yingling told CNN.""The review was a comprehensive look at maintenance, training, and manning across the class -- not limited to one ship or one incident. As with any new ship class, the Navy constantly looks for ways to improve employment and deployment of its ships,"" she said."	Another mishap for Navy's $360 million warship	[]	[]
2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/north-carolina-clinton-trump-2016/index.html	"Clinton has held a small but persistent lead in the state in recent weeks. A Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday showed Clinton ahead, 48% to Trump's 46%. It's made North Carolina's 15 electoral votes Democrats' best chances of winning a state Mitt Romney carried -- albeit by just 2 percentage points -- in 2012. And for Trump, whose path to 270 electoral votes is already precarious, North Carolina is essentially a must-win -- a test of whether he can turn out working-class white voters and survive organizational and TV ad spending disadvantages to the Clinton campaign. The races that could flip the SenateIf Trump can't do it in North Carolina, he has little shot of remaining within striking distance of Clinton and pulling off the same feat in some combination of states like Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- all even more difficult to win. Here's why North Carolina matters so much -- and what to watch there in the days ahead:By the numbers: Why Trump has to have itEvery Trump path to 270 electoral votes starts with one reality: There are four battleground states he simply cannot afford to lose.  ""Our path to victory is through Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Iowa. And we believe 100% that we're winning all four of those. And once we do that, then we put ourselves in a position to win one of those other swing states,"" Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie said this week.North Carolina is the only one of those four that Romney won in 2012 -- yet it's also the one where Clinton's poll numbers are the best in 2016. Say Clinton wins North Carolina. Trump could win every other Romney state -- plus Florida, Ohio and Iowa -- and that still only puts him at 244 electoral votes. He's competitive elsewhere -- in states like Nevada, Colorado in New Hampshire. He's bet big on Pennsylvania, and made a late push in Wisconsin. But none of those states alone would get him to 270 without North Carolina -- and in most cases, even a combination of two of them wouldn't get him there. There's also the reality that Clinton outperforms Trump in most other battleground states by more than she does in North Carolina. If he loses North Carolina, it likely means he's already lost the election. African-American turnoutOne trend that has alarmed Democrats is a dip in African-American turnout across the country -- particularly in states like North Carolina, Georgia and Florida -- compared to the 2008 and 2012 elections. A surge in Latino voters has helped make up for it in some states, particularly in the West. But polls show the demography of the electorate is crucial: The more ethnically diverse a state's voters are, the better it is for Clinton; the whiter the state's electorate, the better for Trump. Clinton is leaning on President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama to make the case to their African-American supporters that 2016 is just as important as the last two elections -- particularly in North Carolina, a state that had been reliably Republican before Obama carried it in 2008 and nearly repeated the feat in 2012. ""If the African-American vote is strong in North Carolina, then you will decide this election,"" Obama said in an interview with North Carolina-based WQMG radio on Thursday, adding that Clinton will win if the state's black turnout matches its 2012 numbers. ""Your vote from '08 and '12 will be negated if you don't vote this time out. This is what seals the deal,"" Obama said. ""Show the country and the world this isn't just about me and my campaign or Michelle, but it's about a community that is empowered and wants its voice heard.""Obama also raised the stakes Wednesday during a campaign stop on Clinton's behalf in North Carolina, saying: ""I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders. The fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.""Voter purge lawsuitThe backdrop for North Carolina's 2016 election is a lawsuit that voting rights advocates filed this week alleging that at least three counties have purged their voter rolls of a disproportionate number of African-American voters. NAACP files suit in North Carolina on voting registration purgeThe NAACP filed the lawsuit, arguing that boards of elections in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties have canceled thousands of voter registrations after a small number of individuals challenged the registration of approximately 4,500 voters based ""exclusively on mass mailings that were returned as undeliverable.""They argue the ""en masse"" cancellation was done in violation of the National Voter Registration Act that prohibits systemic voter removal programs within 90 days of a federal election.On Wednesday, US District Judge Loretta Biggs said North Carolina's process of removing voters sounds ""insane"" and ""like something that was put together in 1901."" But she has not yet ruled, with just days until the election.Early voting In 2012, 61% of North Carolina voters cast their ballots before Election Day -- a number expected to rise this year.So far, early voting numbers, based on a breakdown of the party registration of those who have voted already, show Democrats have reason for worry. African-Americans made up 28% of the state's early voters at this point in 2012 -- but are just 22.7% so far this year, according to data from CNN's partner Catalist. White voters, meanwhile, make up 73% of the state's electorate to date, compared to 67% at this point four years ago. Overall, though, Democrats still have a lead of 243,000 ballots cast so far in the early vote.  But that's off their 2012 pace -- when Democrats led at this point by 307,000 votes, and still lost the state to Romney. Surrogates aboundPerhaps the best evidence of North Carolina's importance is how much attention each campaign's top surrogates are paying it. Ivanka Trump was in the state Wednesday for an event. Clinton's campaign has sent the Democratic nominee herself, husband Bill Clinton and the Obamas there. It's also where Hillary Clinton held her first joint event with Michelle Obama of the 2016 campaign. The candidates are putting a particular emphasis on targeting millennials and North Carolina's swelling ranks of college graduates. President Obama's event Wednesday was at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The joint Hillary Clinton-Michelle Obama event was held at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem.

""We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.""The Republican nominee criticism of Obama comes just five days from the election and as Obama, who enjoys 55% approval rating, has spent more time on the campaign trail to boost his would-be Democratic successor.""He's down here campaigning for Crooked Hillary. Now, why isn't he back in the office -- sometimes referred to as the Oval Office -- why isn't he back in the white house bringing our jobs back and helping our veterans? Why? Why isn't he back working?"" Trump said Thursday.Even as Trump continued to raise and exaggerate the scope of the FBI's inquiries, the Republican nominee also questioned whether ""justice"" would be done.""Just remember, the system is rigged,"" Trump said as he raised disagreements between FBI and Justice Department officials, including over the decision to announce the review of new emails potentially linked to the Clinton email server investigation.The real estate mogul capped off his rally here by polling the crowd as to whether the FBI's latest email review would result in action being taken against Clinton.""Will justice be done, yes or no?"" Trump said, drawing a mixed reaction from the crowd.""We're going to have to see,"" he replied. ""Who knows, we're going to see.""

McMullin notches just 24% in the new survey from Monmouth University on Thursday, 7 percentage points behind Hillary Clinton at 31% and double digits behind Trump at 37%.McMullin, a former Republican aide and CIA operative mounting a #NeverTrump independent challenge, is Mormon and a Utah native. He seems to have found a foothold in one of the most Republican states in the country, a sign of Trump's trouble with conservative voters and especially with Mormons.Utah voters who identify as Republicans back Trump over McMullin 56% to 34%, according to the poll. Yet McMullin is not even leading among Mormons in the survey: Trump edges him out 43% to 37%.Despite the tight polls, neither the Clinton nor Trump campaigns have significantly invested in the state -- visits by members of their ticket have been few, and neither has aired advertisements there.The poll was fielded from October 30 to November 2 and surveyed 402 likely voters for a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.
