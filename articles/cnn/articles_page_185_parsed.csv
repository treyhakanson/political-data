CNN's Jake Tapper asked Pierson on ""The Lead"" Tuesday.""Absolutely. And that's exactly why the campaign wants nothing to do with him and we've said that a number of times on a number of networks. The only reason David Duke gets play is because the media keeps him out there, not the Trump campaign,"" Pierson said. Tapper pointed out to Pierson that Pence's interview was earning praise from racists, neo-Nazi websites and even Duke himself, who told BuzzFeed, ""It's good to see an individual like Pence and others start to reject this absolute controlled media."" When asked whether hearing praise from these people made her uncomfortable, Pierson said, ""No. You can't control what people do."""

Have we overcorrected, so to speak?"" Lynch said at the Washington Post Criminal Justice Summit in Washington.""We were struggling with an epidemic of crime, violent crime in particular, and drug crime also. And people were trying to find a way to deal with that and as we talked about the time, many of us thought we had gone too far at that time, and now we're seeing the consequences,"" she continued.At the event, Lynch remarked on a range of issues facing the Justice Departments, while announcing almost $20 million in grants to multiple states to focus on criminal justice issues, such as funding for more drug courts to lower incarceration rates.And though Lynch said the Justice Department has seen success in lowering state incarceration rates through grants, she is not counting on criminal justice reform on a federal level being passed this year. Despite broad bipartisan support of many reforms that aim to ""restore a fundamental fairness to our system,"" the impending presidential election will likely delay such actions, according to Lynch.When asked if she had been approached or if she would stay on as attorney general should Democrat Hillary Clinton win the presidency, Lynch said that ""the transition is working independently of me, so I have not had those conversations.""Lynch also touched on the recent decision by the Supreme Court to overturn the conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell on public corruption charges, saying that although she was ""incredibly proud"" of the case her office brought ""with integrity,"" the reversal of his prosecution ""set a standard for public corruption cases."""

Her campaign later revealed she'd been diagnosed Friday with pneumonia -- a disclosure that fueled arguments that the Democratic nominee isn't sufficiently forthcoming about important details. But during her interview Monday, Clinton sought to turn criticism of her secrecy over her illness into an attack on Republican rival Donald Trump.""Compare everything you know about me with my opponent. I think it's time he met the same level of disclosure that I have for years,"" Clinton told Cooper.""It's really past time for him to be held to the same standards, not just as me, but as anybody else who has sought this job,"" she said.Clinton had a cough last week, and chalked it up to allergies -- joking at an event that she was allergic to Trump.She said Monday night she'd thought at the time it was allergies, because she experienced a similar cough in the spring and fall due to seasonal allergies.""What happened this time, though, was it didn't dissipate, and that's why when I got off the road on Friday, I did go to see my doctor, and that's when I was diagnosed with pneumonia,"" Clinton said.She said her campaign didn't publicly reveal her diagnosis because ""I just didn't think it was going to be that big of deal.""""Obviously I should have gotten some rest sooner -- I probably would have been better off if I just pulled down my schedule on Friday, but like a lot of people, I thought that I could just keep going forward and power through it. And obviously that didn't work out so well,"" she said.Cooper asked about Bill Clinton's remark in an interview with Charlie Rose that she has occasionally become dehydrated and gone through episodes like Sunday's, and how many times that has happened before.""I think really only twice that I can recall,"" Clinton said.""You know, it is something that has occurred a few times over the course of my life, and I'm aware of it, and usually can avoid it,"" she said. ""What happened yesterday was that I just was incredibly committed to being at the memorial -- as a senator on 9/11, this is incredibly personal to me.""""I could feel how hot and humid it was. I felt overheated. I decided that I did need to leave. And as soon as I got into the air-conditioned van, I cooled off, I got some water, and very quickly, I felt better,"" she said.""I felt fine, but I'm now taking my doctor's advice -- which was given to me on Friday, that I ignored -- to just take some time to get over pneumonia completely."""

He's not doing the exam, he's going to analyze what the doctor did,"" Kilmeade explained to ""Fox and Friends"" co-host Steve Doocy. ""I know this -- that Donald Trump will turn over those records right to Dr. Oz, who will analyze it and it will be a surprise to Donald Trump what Dr. Oz is going to say.""When presidents and candidates kept their medical maladies secretDoocy added, ""You mean, Donald Trump isn't going to eyeball it first, like oh my goodness, look at my cholesterol?""""My sense is there could be something like that,"" Kilmeade added. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign to confirm the details of the planned appearance but has not yet received a response.Kilmeade's interview with Oz aired later Tuesday morning on his radio show, ""Kilmeade and Friends,"" and the celebrity doctor explained that there would be some limitations on what he will reveal and ask about.""If he puts limitations, I'll acknowledge them,"" Oz said. ""It's his decision. Look -- the metaphor for me is, it's a doctor's office. The studio. So I'm not going to ask him a question he doesn't want to have answered.""Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday that she stood with ""Dr. Oz and millions of Americans on this.""""I don't know why we need such extensive medical reporting when we all have a right to privacy,"" Conway told MSNBC.Asked what would happen if there were embarrassing medical disclosures revealed in the physical, Oz said, ""I bet you he won't release them."" Still, Oz said he hoped to ask Trump ""pointed questions about his health."" He also clarified again that he would not be examining Trump himself, but reviewing a physical conducted by Trump's doctor.Trump's appearance comes in the wake of revelations that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton failed to disclose that she had pneumonia until two days after he diagnosis. The condition was revealed after she stumbled at a September 11 memorial event in New York City."	Dr. Mehmet Oz to analyze new Donald Trump medical records on TV	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""It's really quite shocking. Something like 62% of white voters have these sorts of sentiments, and by better than two-to-one, they vote Republican.""Clinton said in a statement Saturday she regretted calling half of Trump's supporters ""deplorable,"" though she vowed to continue to call out ""bigotry"" in his campaign."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/kellyanne-conway-liar-donald-trump/index.html	"CNN's Alisyn Camerota asked Kellyanne Conway on ""New Day,"" ""Will Donald Trump release anything from the IRS proving that he's under audit?""  ""I'm sorry,"" Conway said, as Camerota repeated her question. ""Are you calling him a liar?""Conway continued, ""Seriously, we're running against a Clinton, and we're going to challenge someone's veracity?""The sharp exchange came as Conway pushed back against criticism of Trump for his ongoing refusal to release his tax returns, a disclosure made by every presidential candidate for over 40 years. Conway repeated the campaign's talking point -- that Trump's lawyers have advised him not to release his tax returns while an audit is being conducted, despite assurances from outside tax experts who have said no such conflict exists -- and declined to say whether any more information would be forthcoming.Later in the interview, when the issue of Donald Trump's tax returns came up again -- this time, when Camerota asked for proof of Trump's charitable giving claims -- Conway once again expressed frustration with the subject.""Part of why people are calling for him to release his taxes is so we do know how much he himself has given to charity. Will you or the campaign release exactly what that number is?"" Camerota asked. ""I doubt it,"" Conway said.""Why would you doubt it?"" Camerota asked. Conway argued back, ""I doubt it. This is like badgering. I don't see it as journalism, I see it as badgering. We've had this conversation so many different times on so many different networks, yet we're not having a conversation about what the middle class tax relief would mean for people's wage stagnation."""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/obama-campaign-trail-2016-election/index.html	"Obama didn't directly address Hillary Clinton's bout with pneumonia, which has kept her housebound as the campaign enters its final stretch. But he did issue a warning for anyone who's questioning the Democratic candidate's ability to perform the job.""You want to debate who's more fit to be president? One candidate has traveled to more countries than any other secretary of state has. Has more qualifications than any candidate in history. And the other who isn't fit in any way shape or form to represent this country abroad or to be its commander in chief,"" Obama said at roaring campaign rally in Philadelphia.He dismissed questions about Clinton's transparency, which arose after she kept quiet her pneumonia diagnosis for several days. Instead, he ripped into Trump's decision to withhold his tax returns, a historic break from precedent. ""You want to debate transparency? You've got one candidate in this race who's released decades' worth of her tax returns. The other candidate is the first in decades who refuses to release any at all,"" Obama said.For Obama, Tuesday's event was a return to the rollicking campaign events that thrust him into the White House eight years ago, and won him reelection in 2012. He exclaimed as he took the stage here it was ""good to be back on the campaign trail,"" a sentiment that was returned by loud cheers by the crowd of hundreds.""Can I just say I am really into electing Hillary Clinton?"" Obama told the crowd, which enthusiastically greeted him. ""This is not me just going through the motions here. I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton.""Obama is just one of a cavalry of top White House Democrats -- also including First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden -- who are arguing Clinton's case this week as the Democratic nominee herself is convalescing from pneumonia and absent from the trail.The timing is opportune for a campaign eager both to spotlight its most popular surrogates and to move past a rocky patch. While Obama's Philadelphia stop was planned well ahead of Clinton's declaration that half of her rival's supporters were ""deplorable"" and new worries about her transparency, the campaign hopes the President's rally can at least provide a new storyline.But even an appearance from Obama -- whose approval rating reached a nearly eight-year high of 58% in an ABC/Washington Post poll Monday -- won't necessarily cure all of Clinton's woes as the campaign enters its busiest stretch. The White House Monday said Obama would not be relegated to ""damage control"" for Clinton's stumbles, and he declined to address either the ""deplorable"" dust-up or her illness directly.Instead, Obama leaned hard into his criticisms of Trump, using his stature as commander in chief to disqualify the Republican candidate.Hillary Clinton stumbles — but will her campaign follow?""You've got the Donald, who just last week went on Russian television to talk down our military and curry favor with Vladimir Putin,"" Obama said, referring to an interview appearance on RT. ""He loves this guy! Think about what's happened in the Republican Party,"" Obama said. ""They used to be opposed to Russia and authoritarianism and fighting for freedom. Now their nominee is out there praising a guy, saying he's a strong leader, because he invades smaller countries, jails his opponents.""""This isn't Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party,"" Obama added later. ""This is a dark, pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against one another, where we turn against the world. They aren't offering serious solutions, they are fanning resentment, and hate. That is not the America I know.""Michelle Obama is also stumping for Clinton this week. The first lady makes her first campaign appearance for the Democratic nominee on Friday, promoting voter registration in Northern Virginia. Loathe to engage directly in bitter partisan politics, the first lady is more likely to spell out a more affirmative case for Clinton, according to aides.Biden, who talked up Clinton during a stop Monday in Charlotte, was more candid in his assessments, suggesting the candidate gets a ""bum rap"" when he was asked about her remarks casting some of Trump's supporters as deplorable.""For every time she will say something where she says, 'Well, maybe I should have said something different,' think if they held Trump to that standard,"" Biden said. ""He'd be in trouble. He is in trouble.""Obama's busy schedule a factorEven as Clinton is increasingly relying on Obama to carry her message to young and minority voters, the demands on the President's time have largely forestalled an aggressive campaign schedule thus far.Tuesday's event in Philadelphia is only Obama's second campaign stop for Clinton, after a joint appearance in Charlotte in July. Since then, Obama has helped raised money from Democratic donors, including during his vacation on Martha's Vineyard last month, but he hasn't headlined another rally until now.White House officials point to a largely inflexible schedule of presidential commitments this month as a barrier to more frequent campaigning. While past presidents have faced similar obligations in the waning days of their tenures, Obama is more popular -- and thus in higher demand as a campaigner than his most recent predecessors.In August, Obama's aides made a day-by-day assessment of the President's commitments until election day, discovering few moments in September that would allow for rallies in key battleground states on behalf of Clinton. Obama on Friday concluded a week-long swing through Asia, with stops on the front end in Nevada, Hawaii and Midway Island meant to burnish his environmental legacy.Even Tuesday's rally was restricted to a relatively close-by location. Obama had business at the White House Monday evening when he met with congressional leaders, and is due to meet Burmese State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi in the Oval Office on Wednesday.Obama's four-day obligation at the United Nations General Assembly next week makes adding a campaign stop difficult before the end of the month. And while the campaign may arise implicitly during Obama's final address to the gathering of world leaders -- he's expected to recap eight years of foreign policy, providing a contrast to Trump's proposals -- it's hardly the setting for a fiery political throw-down.Even in October, when the race will enter its frenzied sprint, the demands of the presidency mean an all-out, every-day-on-the-trail presence for Obama is unrealistic. Already the President's schedule is filling up. The White House announced Monday that Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi would visit on October 18, a day-long affair that will stretch into a late State Dinner. A government funding battle also seems likely to occupy the President's time this month.Many of the states that officials say Obama will target -- including Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- are easily accessible in a single day-trip on Air Force One, but would leave few moments for other business at the White House.Given Obama's sway among young and minority voters -- populations historically difficult to get to the polls -- there is pressure for the President to hit many states before their voting registration deadline passes. In Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, that means showing up before October 11.""I think what is clear is that the President does have a lot of influence over a large number of voters that haven't previously been regularly engaged in politics,"" Earnest said Monday, adding the Clinton campaign is ""hoping that the President will be helpful in making the case on their behalf to motivate voters to get registered and to participate on Election Day."""

JetBlue and Alaska airlines' representatives spoke at Airlines for America's commercial aviation summit Tuesday, a trade organization for the airline industry.In an effort to improve passenger experience on flights, airlines say they're mining your data to figure out consumer preferences and behaviors.  Joseph Sprague, a spokesman for Alaska Airlines, said the carrier's data collection on consumers ""rivals the (Donald) Trump and (Hillary) Clinton campaigns.""Marty St. George, who oversees JetBlue's innovation efforts, said his airline works with credit card companies to analyze things such as consumer purchases to better understand their passengers and potentially predict services those passengers would enjoy. When it comes to flyers' data, airlines are also pulling consumer details from information provided when passengers sign up for loyalty programs and social media clicks and ""likes."" Airlines say using that information helps them offer tailored promotions to passengers and provide more personal consumer service. Sprague said he understands some consumers' concerns about privacy. He says Alaska Airlines makes it a priority to ""protect consumers' data.""Alaska Airlines says it hopes to venture more into using data collected from flyers' social media clicks. Charlie Leocha, the chairman of Travelers United, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit watchdog group, said consumer privacy is always a concern but ""so far, there have been no reports of abuse of consumer data on behalf of the airline industry.""He said the information credit card companies share with airlines is not personally identifiable and is more general. For example, Leocha said, ""If there are three flights to a particular city and 50% of passengers checked into hotels,"" that sort of general information allows airlines to find new corporate partners to work with. Data collected through loyalty programs is more specific and directly linked to passengers. ""Although the airlines say this data collection is to benefit the consumer, it's really to benefit the airlines and their bottom line,"" Leocha said, calling it a marketing tactic to get more of consumers' dollars."

Vincent K. Brooks, U.S. Forces Korea commander, said in a statement Tuesday. ""The United States has an unshakable commitment to defend allies in the region and will take necessary steps to do so, including operations like this one today.""The B-1s were joined by US F-16 and South Korean F-15 fighters in the low-level flyover of Osan Air Base, 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of the South Korean capital of Seoul.""Today's demonstration provides just one example of the full range of military capabilities in the deep resources of this strong alliance to provide and strengthen extended deterrence,"" Brooks said.On the diplomatic front, the US special envoy on North Korea, Sung Kim, said Tuesday that the US and South Korea will be considering ""additional unilateral measures"" in response to Pyongyang's latest nuclear test. Kim also said Japan may be included in additional initiatives.The B-1s that flew over South Korea Tuesday were moved to the Andersen Air Force base in Guam in August as part of what the U.S. Pacific Command calls it Continuous Bomber Presence.It is the first time the B-1s, which have the largest payload of any US bomber, have been part of the Pacific bomber force in a decade.Bombers hit targets in Syria, IraqThe bombers are from the 34th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron, which dropped more than 2,000 ""smart bombs"" during more than 630 missions over Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan from January to July of 2015, officials at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam said in August.Those missions covered more than 7,000 hours of flight time.""The B-1 units bring a unique perspective and years of repeated combat and operational experience from the Central Command theater to the Pacific,"" said the August statement from Pacific Air Forces headquarters in Hawaii.Guam is a U.S.-controlled island territory in the western Pacific, some 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) east of the Philippines, and about 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) from the Korean Peninsula.""Bombers in general are well-suited to the vast distances and challenges of the Pacific. The B-1 bomber is specifically suited for the Pacific region,"" Lt. Col. Seth Spanier, commander of the B-1 squadron on Guam, said. ""With a large weapon capacity and exceptional standoff strike capability, the B-1 will provide U.S. Pacific Command and its regional allies and partners with a credible, strategic power projection platform,"" the statement said.'They absolutely took notice'The US use of Guam-based bombers to make a statement on the Korean Peninsula is not new. After North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January, a Guam-based B-52 made the flight.CNN's Will Ripley was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang then.""They absolutely took notice,"" Ripley said of the North Koreans. ""A lot of North Korean military commanders find U.S. bombers especially threatening, given the destruction here in Pyongyang during the Korean War, when much of the city was flattened,"" Ripley said.In February, after a North Korean rocket sent a satellite into space, the US Air Force flew four of its top-of-the-line F-22 Raptors over South Korea in a show of force. The stealthy F-22s were joined by South Korean F-15s and US Air Force F-16s in that display at Osan AB.While the B-1s made a strong US statement Tuesday, Brooks, the US commander, pointed out they aren't the only weapon in the US arsenal.In his statement, the US general also mentioned the deployment to South Korea of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), which is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles, just the type of weapons North Korea claims it has.But the presence of the THAAD system has drawn criticism, particularly from China, which tends to view any increase in U.S. military presence in Asia as an attempt to contain it and reduce its influence in the region."
