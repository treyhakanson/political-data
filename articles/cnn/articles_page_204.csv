Olivieri probably will be imprisoned for between eight and 14 months, the Justice Department said in a press release.Prosecutors said he was holding a silver handgun as he approached the building.""Secret Service officers repeatedly ordered him to stop, but he ignored their commands and continued to walk toward the White House,"" according to the statement. ""At that point, a Secret Service agent confronted him, again ordering him to halt and drop the weapon. When Olivieri refused, the agent shot him once.""Olivieri also stashed 15 rounds of additional ammunition and pepper spray in his vehicle, and a shell casting was later located nearby, authorities said.A message left with Olivieri's attorney, Loui Itoh, was not immediately returned Tuesday.Because Olivieri is still recovering from the shooting, his plea hearing had to take place in a local hospital.A sentencing date has not yet been set, but he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison."

I can't believe that they would do what is such a patently political move. It makes them look like political operators versus law enforcement officers,"" Ryan said in a radio interview with WRJN's Glenn Klein. ""The fact that they chose the Friday before Labor Day to put all this out there -- it mystifies me as to why they thought that was a smart thing to do.""Asked about FBI Director James Comey, Ryan said, ""He is a credible guy who has a credible background. I disagree with his conclusion.""Ryan added that the question remaining about the Democratic presidential nominee is ""the connection between the Clinton Foundation and official acts of the State Department.""The speaker didn't mention Donald Trump's name during the interview, and wasn't asked about the GOP nominee. But when asked by Klein about potentially dealing with Clinton in the White House, Ryan said, ""That's the last person I want to see become president: Hillary Rodham Clinton. I think she has real trust issues, real credibility issues.""The Wisconsin Republican also used the interview to blast the Obama administration's decision to hand over $400 million in cash to the Iranian government in conjunction with the release of American prisoners earlier this year. ""The last thing you want to be the lasting impression of America is that we will pay cash for hostages because all you are doing is encouraging more hostage taking,"" Ryan said.He added that the money, which he and other Republicans denounced as a ransom, ""is more than appeasement. This more than accommodating what I think is a really bad agreement. They are bending over backwards to accommodate Iran, and let's just remember who they are: they are the world's No. 1 sponsor of terrorism -- they finance terrorism all across the world."""

""He is the nominee and has to come up with rational and workable plans, has to work with various advisers and experts in terms of the best way to do this and it needs to be done in a fair and compassionate way that is consistent with the way we in America do things.""Trump refuses to rule out legal status for undocumented immigrantsWhen Tapper pushed back on Carson's argument that promises made to voters were irrelevant, Carson said campaign policies were often refined once a candidate took office.""Well, I didn't say that they were irrelevant but bear in mind, what you talk about during a campaign and what actually happens, as you know, in all administrations are different,"" Carson responded. ""You get different information, you learn things along the way, and you make adjustments along the way.""Giuliani: Trump no longer wants mass deportationsCarson added: ""Perhaps there were others who had already learned those things. It doesn't matter. The important thing is that it does get learned and it does get integrated into the process of decision-making.""Carson denied that Trump's shift to policies similar to his Republican opponents undermined the sincerity of his campaign promises.""Well, very much like the promises that have been made to people in our inner cities for decades and yet their condition is not getting any better,"" Carson said. ""Those matter too.""'Birther' apology?Carson said Trump's appeal among African-American voters could be improved if the real estate mogul apologized for his persistent claims that Obama was not born in the US.""I think that would be a good idea, absolutely,"" Carson told Tapper. ""I suggest that on all sides.""Trump was a prominent mouthpiece for the ""birther"" conspiracy theory in 2011, leading the push for the Hawaiian-born Obama to release his birth certificate as proof that he was not born in Kenya. Asked about the so-called ""birther"" issue during a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane Monday, Trump replied, ""I don't talk about it.""Donald Trump's history of suggesting Obama is a Muslim""Let's get all of the, you know, the hate and rancor out of the way so that we can actually discuss the issues,"" Carson said, adding that both candidates should focus on issues such as the economy, national security, criminal justice reform and education.Carson continued: ""These are the big issues and how we get caught up in all this other stuff is a reason that we will go down the tubes if we don't correct it.""African-American voter outreachBut Carson said he was pleased Trump was engaging with voting blocs who usually support the Democratic Party, despite recent polls suggesting his efforts among non-white voters has so far been in vain.""But wouldn't you agree, Jake, that it's better that he do some outreach?"" Carson said. ""You know, traditionally the Republicans have pretty much left the African-American vote to the Democrats and assumed that there was no point in even trying for it. He is at least making an effort and putting out some proposals that are actually pretty darn good, you know, in terms of school choice and school vouchers.""Trump brings message of unity to black church in DetroitCarson accompanied Trump on his highly anticipated visit Saturday to Great Faith Ministries, a nondenominational church in Detroit, Trump's first major pitch made directly to the black community as a presidential candidate.Carson added Trump's corporate tax reforms, however, would appeal to the entire electorate, not just voters in the country's inner cities.""I think a lot of this stuff is not Democrat or Republican stuff. This is what works for America,"" Carson said. ""And if our inner cities are not functioning at a high level, there is absolutely no way that our nation will succeed.""IRS fineCarson shrugged off suggestions that a recent IRS fine against Trump for a donation he made to Florida's attorney general undermined his argument against Clinton's record at the State Department. Trump recently paid the IRS $2,500 after he donated $25,000 to a group backing Pam Bondi while she was deciding to investigate Trump University over allegations of fraud. Meanwhile, Trump has accused Clinton of engaging in ""pay-to-play"" practices at the State Department involving donations to the Clinton Foundation.""Pam Bondi is a very meticulous lawyer and would be looking very carefully at anything that looked askew,"" Carson told Tapper. ""So I say if people want to investigate it, they certainly should, but it would not be consistent with what I know.""Trump says donation to Florida AG Pam Bondi not connected to Trump UniversityWhen Tapper informed Carson that Trump had already been fined by the IRS for making the donation using money from the Trump Foundation, Carson said he did not have a problem with Trump incurring the penalty if the contribution was in fact illegal.""Well, you know that Donald Trump has admitted that he knows how the system works and that he has worked with both Democrats and Republicans and that money has been exchanged,"" Carson replied. ""You know he's not tried to hide the fact that has occurred. A lot of times the rules become more clear after you've done something."""

3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/politics/congress-zika-budget-trump-clinton/index.html	"The four-week stretch will play out against the backdrop of this year's unusual and unpredictable presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, which could impact the sensitive congressional negotiations that lie ahead. Republicans, who control the House and Senate, want to demonstrate they are responsible stewards of the Congress and deserve to be returned to power. As evidence, they point to passage of a list of bipartisan bills -- to fight opioid abuse, fund highway construction, reform education programs and even raise the debt limit, an often politically difficult task. By the end of September they must also find a way to keep the government open because a shutdown would be a political catastrophe just weeks before voters go to the polls. ""We've passed legislation to grow the economy, protect our communities, strengthen national security, and serve our veterans,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said in a memo to his caucus outlining the September agenda. ""And in the coming months we can continue to look forward to making more progress.""But Democrats, who could be on the cusp of taking back the Senate, argue the unresolved Zika funding, stalled Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, and lack of action on gun control, are proof of GOP recklessness and negligence and reasons why Republicans should be tossed from power.""The Republican Senate will be remembered for how little it did,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said last week. ""The Senate is being run into the ground.""Government Shutdown?Because the normal appropriations process broke down months ago over disputes about funding levels and controversial policy riders -- related to gay rights, abortion funding and other issues -- Congress has until September 30 to reach a deal to keep the government operating.Democrats want to extend current funding levels until the end of the year, which they say would give them time to negotiate with Republicans on a broader spending package during the lame duck session after the election. They prefer to use that period to fashion a measure that funds the government through September of next year so that if Hillary Clinton is elected she would not need to wrestle with the thorny issue in the opening months of her administration. Republicans haven't settled on a strategy yet and are expected to discuss their options in private sessions this week, according to aides. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R- Wisconsin, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, hope to find a quick resolution that ensures there is no real threat of pre-election shutdown.  That task got much more complicated last week when a collection of outside groups aligned with the ultra-conservative and powerful House Freedom Caucus pushed to extend current funding levels into the spring and not have any lame duck session at all. ""History shows that end-of-year legislative packages are routinely rushed through Congress and to the President's desk under the threat of a government shutdown -- too fast for lawmakers and the taxpayers footing the bill to determine what's in them,"" said the letter signed by 30 conservative organizations.  But Reid, whose caucus has the power to filibuster a spending bill it doesn't support, rejected that approach. ""Everyone should be alerted today that we're not going to do a long-term CR,"" the retiring Democrat from Nevada told reporters last week referencing the proposed continuing resolution that would last into the spring. That approach might not be appealing to Ryan or McConnell either.  Because if Clinton wins the White House and/or Democrats take control of the Senate, the two GOP leaders will lose considerable leverage if they've already passed a bill that locks in spending for several months. Ryan is likely to face some tensions with members on the right of his conference when the session resumes, beyond their reluctance to negotiate on any short-term funding bill. House conservatives are still fuming over the loss of Kansas Rep Tim Huelskamp, who was defeated in a primary in August. Some House Freedom Caucus members believe that Ryan didn't help protect the incumbent in his race against another Republican who was backed by some establishment groups, and want to have a discussion about the role party leaders play in contested primaries.Zika is spreadingBoth sides are pointing fingers at each other over the long-stalled bill to fund the federal response to Zika, the dangerous virus transmitted by mosquitoes and sexual contact that can cause debilitating and deadly birth defects.While public health officials are trying to contain the rapidly spreading virus -- now found in mosquitoes in Florida -- the Senate will vote Tuesday on a $1.1 billion bill that Democrats have already blocked once because it contains restrictions on funding for Planned Parenthood. The move is designed to pressure Democrats because the same bill already passed the House and Republicans argue it is the fastest way to get the money flowing.Democrats say they will again block the bill. They charge Republicans are holding the Zika money hostage to an ideological fight over abortion.  Republicans counter that the bill provides more than enough money to respond to the public health crisis and accuse Democrats of protecting their political ally Planned Parenthood at the expense of battling the disease. Meantime, CDC Director Thomas Frieden is warning his agency is almost out of the money needed to kill mosquitoes and find a vaccine. ""We don't have the resources we need to mount the kind of robust fight against the disease,"" Centers for Disease Control Director Thomas Frieden warned last week.  ""Without additional funding we will not be able to fully understand the impact of Zika.""Some Senate Republicans are pressing the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram funds from other accounts to fund the Zika response while Congress hashes out the legislation.  But HHS Secretary Burwell said in a letter Friday her department has already ""exhausted our ability"" to utilize other funds. Trump vs. ClintonThe presidential election will be a dominating presence in the Capitol in September.House and Senate Republicans will use the month to keep the pressure on Clinton for her use of a private email server and for allegations foreign donors to the Clinton Global Initiative got special treatment while she was secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey, who frustrated Republicans with his recommendation not to prosecute Clinton for her handling of classified emails, is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee later this month. Republicans will press him about the decision and whether the FBI is pursuing a perjury charge against Clinton for lying in testimony before Congress, as many Republicans believe she did.For their part, Democrats plan to continue their vocal criticism of Trump through news conferences, floor speeches, and other venues. Democrats want to tie the controversial nominee to many of the swing state GOP senators up for re-election. Republicans currently have a 54-46 advantage but Democrats are positioned to retake the chamber especially if Trump falters in those battleground states. House Republicans, who don't face a serious takeover threat from Democrats, will use the time to highlight their ""Better way"" agenda, which Ryan and top leaders rolled out in the early summer months. These policy proposals included plans to reform the tax code, overhaul health care, reduce poverty, assert the legislative branch's authority, and promote economic growth. The agenda, which Trump has largely ignored, gives GOP members a way to separate themselves from the controversial nominee and point to specific plans they intend to pursue in the next Congress.EpiPen, IranTwo top issues not expected to come up are the nomination of Garland to the Supreme Court and the Trans Pacific Partnership, the trade pact President Barack Obama negotiated that is now opposed by both Trump and Clinton. It's possible they could come up after the election in a lame duck session although GOP leaders insist they won't.Investigators on both sides of the Hill plan to press the administration on a $400 million payment that was made to Tehran as part of the nuclear deal with Iran. Republicans charge the White House paid that country ransom for the release of three Americans held there, something the administration strongly denies. House Republicans plan a vote on legislation to prevent such ""ransom"" payments in the future.Republican leaders also want to pass final versions of an energy modernization bill and water development bill that had already cleared each chamber. Democratic leaders are pressing for votes on gun control, college affordability, campaign finance, and other party priorities but are unlikely to get much traction. Finally, the skyrocketing cost of the EpiPen that got a lot of attention while lawmakers were away will be the subject of more congressional scrutiny as well. Congressional investigators are demanding answers from the manufacturer Mylan about how the life-saving medicine's price soared from about $100 to $600 in ten years. Mylan's answers are due to a Senate committee in early September."	Congress returns with deadline looming on Zika, budget

""Ancient plains were devastated. Countless civilians were killed. That conflict was another reminder whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children.""Obama is beginning a three-day stop in Laos. He's the first US president to visit to country.The money Obama pledged Tuesday will be spent surveying the Asian nation for some 80 million unexploded cluster bombs dropped during a secret US bombing campaign as part of the Vietnam War 40 years ago.""The remnants of war continue to shatter lives here in Laos,"" Obama said. ""Many of the bombs dropped never exploded. Over the years thousands of Laotians have been killed or injured, farmers tending fields, children playing. The wounds, a missing leg or arm, last a lifetime. That's why I've dramatically increased or funding to remove these unexploded bombs.""The move was welcomed by Laos President Bounnhang Vorachit as a way of strengthening mutual trust after the devastating campaign, that still maims or kills 50 people who stumble upon unexploded mines each year. In return, the Lao government pledged to ramp up assistance in locating and returning of Americans missing in war.Efforts to find the bombs will be aided the Pentagon, who will supply records of where they were dropped. Between 1964 and 1973, US warplanes rained more than two million tons of bombs on Laotian villages and countryside to try and cut off the Vietnamese army's supply trail.To this day, less than 1% of the bombs have been cleared, according to US-based non-government organization Legacies of War.US funding for clearance of unexploded ordnance and victims' assistance has steadily grown since 2010, when Congress mandated that the US government give at least $5 million for unexploded ordnance removal.This year, Congress allotted $19.5 million, but now, for the first time, an American president has publicly recognized that the US has a responsibility to do more.""That conflict was another reminder that whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children,"" Obama said.

""And then, if we are successful and are elected, President [Bill] Clinton will sever the tie with the foundation [he] created.""Kaine's comments are incorrect. CNN confirmed with the Clinton campaign that the Clinton Foundation is continuing to accept foreign and corporate money. The foundation would only give up these sources of funding if Clinton and Kaine are elected on November 8.The Clinton Foundation's policy of continuing to accept foreign money through the election has raised concerns from some good government groups and newspaper editorial boards because it is seen as a legally permissible way to curry favor with the Clintons that would not be permitted through direct political giving.Foreign entities are barred from making direct contributions to political candidates in the US but have given hundreds of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, a charity that fights HIV/AIDS, climate change, malaria and childhood obesity.Forty percent of the foundation's top donors, those giving more than $1 million, are foreign. Kaine's answer was prompted by a television reporter asking if the Clinton Foundation's decision to continue to accept foreign money through the election was akin to someone shouting ""last call"" at a wedding and everyone running for the bar.Kaine's office said the Virginia senator simply ""misspoke.""""Senator Kaine knows what the policy is but misspoke at the end of a long day,"" said Kaine senior adviser and national spokesperson Amy Dudley.The Republican National Committee pounced on Kaine's bungled answer.""Team Clinton has resorted to doing what they do best: not telling the truth,"" said RNC research director Raj Shah. When asked why the Clinton Foundation is not immediately renouncing foreign sources of funding, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's ""State of the Union"" last month that ""there were some foreign governments, like Australia and Norway, that had existing donations to the foundation, and the foundation wanted them to be able to follow through on their commitment, so that this work could be protected.""""This is important, life-saving work,"" Mook said."

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/05/politics/obama-laos-speech/index.html	"In eight years of trips overseas, President Barack Obama has sought to use the soaring, bridge-building rhetoric that rocketed him to the top of the political world in the United States on audiences overseas. He reaches past the leaders he meets at summits and state dinners to their people, trying to forge an emotional bond across barriers of language, ideology and culture.The tradition continues when Obama addressed the Lao people Tuesday as he seeks to close a historical circle in a reclusive, Communist nation that was saturated by US bombing during a secret war linked the conflict in neighboring Vietnam. ""I realize that having a US president in Laos would have once been unimaginable,"" Obama said. ""That conflict was another reminder that whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children. Today I stand with you in acknowledging the sacrifices on all sides of that conflict. From the anguish of war, there came an unlikely bond between our two peoples.""It was one of the last major foreign policy speeches of Obama's administration. He summed up the pivot to Asia that is at the center of his global agenda as a lasting shift and not a ""passing fad.""""The United States is more deeply engaged across the Asia Pacific than we have been in decades,"" Obama said. ""We've sent a clear message that as a Pacific nation we're here to stay.""Taken together, the carefully crafted speeches and town hall meetings that Obama has held overseas chart an oral history of his international vision and personal worldview.RELATED: Obama has 'blunt' meeting with Putin All presidents use speechmaking as a tool of power -- especially those like John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan who appreciated the politics of the grand gesture. But Obama's attempts to engage foreign populations -- especially young ones -- have been especially overt, reflecting the political method of a president who as a former community organizer looks to build coalitions from the bottom up and who has been shaped by diverse ethnic and family heritage and an unusually peripatetic upbringing. And while Obama's speechmaking may have become mundane through repetition at home, and his more aloof disposition with foreign leaders abroad have led to mostly distant relationships with his counterparts, his lofty turns of phrase can still move audiences who are seeing him for the first time and for whom he remains a hero.""Your voice matters -- your ideals, your willingness to act on those ideals, your choices can make a difference,"" Obama told young people in South Africa in 2013. Obama's speech in Laos, where Air Force One touched down on Monday making him the first US President to visit the country, will be a bookend to one he delivered in Tokyo right at the start of his presidency, where he first claimed a kinship to a region with which he was familiar as a child. ""I have never forgotten the warmth and the hospitality that the Japanese people showed a young American far from home,"" he said then. In some instances, Obama is the first sitting US president to visit a country and address a nation, using the weighted symbols of a presidential trip to appeal to a country's pride. In Myanmar in 2012, the President's motorcade drew hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets in an explosion of joy that made a remarkable contrast to the decades of junta dictatorship from which the nation was emerging. Putting down a historical marker in Laos, Obama will spend time in the capital Vientiane and also travel to the ancient northern city of Luang Prabang to convene a town hall at Souphanouvong University. Campuses are a well-worn setting for speaking directly to a nation's youth. Obama has also taken his case to the people in parliaments, in concert halls and convention centers, in countries ranging from Canada to Israel to Australia. He didn't even wait to be president to stake out this oratorical approach to foreign policy, beginning with a speech in Berlin during the 2008 presidential race. That was also the start of an effort to leverage Obama's biography and historic potential as someone who breaks down racial barriers to woo populations estranged from the United States in the wake of the Iraq War. ""Tonight, I speak to you not as a candidate for president, but as a citizen -- a proud citizen of the United States, and a fellow citizen of the world,"" he said to 200,000 Germans at Berlin's Victory Monument. Since then, Obama has frequently used iconic historical backdrops. He returned to Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, no longer a symbol of a city divided, for an address as president in 2013 -- though it only drew a fraction of the crowd he commanded five years before. In Hiroshima, Japan, earlier this year, Obama stood below skies where the first atomic bomb burst and changed the face of warfare. ""The world was forever changed here, but today the children of this city will go through their day in peace,"" Obama said. ""What a precious thing that is.""RELATED: Obama in Hiroshima calls for 'world without nuclear weapons'His speech at the site of the atomic bomb followed Obama's pattern of attempting to stitch up long festering wounds using his skills as an orator. He told Cubans in Havana this spring it was ""time to leave the past behind"" during an address broadcast live on state television. In Myanmar, Obama told a crowd at the University of Yangon he had ""come to keep my promise and extend the hand of friendship"" after decades of estrangement. Trying to forge a new beginning with the Muslim world in 2009, Obama traveled to Al-Azhar University in Cairo, one of Sunni Islam's most prestigious seats of learning.That speech built on the Berlin speech of the year before and the presumption that owing to his unique background, upbringing and global appeal, Obama was a different kind of US leader -- and would enact policies that reflected an internationalist outlook.In his speech for the Muslim world, Obama mined his childhood to suggest in particular that he, unlike other US presidents, had a special appreciation and understanding for Islam.""As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan (to prayer) at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk,"" Obama said in Cairo. He hoped the appeal would lead to renewed partnerships between Arab nations and the US, though the ensuing Arab Spring led to widespread instability.Obama has repeatedly used his background and internationalism to ingratiate himself with his audiences and to advance his agenda.He told the people of Japan that he was the first ""Pacific President"" in 2009, a nod not only to his childhood but to his vow to shift American foreign policy toward Asia.In Jakarta a year later to highlight his Asia pivot policy, Obama won over the audience by recalling his boyhood in the sleepy capital, now unrecognizable in the gleaming tiger economy city it has become.""We had a mango tree out front. And I learned to love Indonesia while flying kites and running along the paddy fields and catching dragonflies, buying satay and baso from the street vendors,"" he recounted.And in Africa he claimed a blood kinship with the continent of his father's Kenyan ancestors.""I stand before you as a proud American. I also stand before you as the son of an African,"" Obama told the African Union during a speech in Ethiopia last year, using his status as the first US president of African descent to call for reforms in the continent's corrupt capitals. ""Africa and its people helped to shape America and allowed it to become the great nation that it is. And Africa and its people have helped shape who I am and how I see the world.""Sometimes Obama's reconciler-in-chief approach to discussing his own country while abroad has caused trouble.In Strasbourg, France, in 2009, his comment that the Germans and French view their countries as just as exceptional as Americans view theirs angered his critics back home.In his speech in Cairo, Obama's comment that the trauma of 9/11 had ""in some cases ... led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals"" helped fuel claims by his opponents that he had embarked on an apology tour to criticize his own country abroad.And one lesson of his administration is that the interests of world powers and the depth of global crises are rarely swayed by the personal charms of a US president, no matter how worldly they may be.And as in the domestic arena, Obama has sometimes been criticized for not following up a big speech with the unglamorous work of implementing policy.But even if he doesn't always win policy changes and political plaudits, he often earns goodwill and laughter -- occasionally at his customary, and sometimes mangled, attempts to close his speech with a remark in the local lingo.It's a way of cutting through the formality of a prepared speech and connecting with an audience.""Mingalaba!"" he proclaimed, using a local greeting in Myanmar to the delight of the audience during his 2012 stop.In Canberra, he told his audience he had been practicing ""strine"" -- the Australian accented form of English -- quickly getting the crowd on his side.And in South Africa, he attempted not just one but multiple greetings in local languages, proclaiming he'd been practicing.""How-zit?"" he inquired, using the Afrikaans slang word for hello."

""You never have any idea what is going to come,"" Garland said.It was pretty good advice from a man with a glittering legal career who may or may not be the next justice to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. It's been seven months since President Barack Obama nominated Garland to replace conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia and in doing so, launched a constitutional showdown when Republican senators refused to hold hearings. But after a public effort to move the nomination forward last spring, the debate has fallen largely silent.Supporters of Garland, the chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, say that is about to change. ""With the Senate wrapping up its longest recess of the year, communities are refusing to allow senators to go back to the Capitol quietly,"" said Michele Jawando, of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning group that is launching demonstrations in eight states to urge senators to act.And some court-watchers say a change is possible from Republicans should Hillary Clinton win the presidential race. In May, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley was asked point blank by CNN whether he'd take action in a lame duck session if Clinton were to win in November. His answer: ""no.""But late last month in Sioux City, Iowa, Grassley seemed to soften and suggested to a Rotary Club audience that his stance might change if a large number of senators strongly urged him to consider the nomination, the Globe Gazette reported. Beth Levine, Grassley's spokesperson, said later there had been no shift. She reiterated that Grassley believes a hearing should occur after a new president is sworn in. ""Giving the people a voice is the position of 52 of 54 Republican senators and he doesn't foresee any shift in that position,"" Levine said. But that won't stop any speculation for a post-election lame-duck session. Jason P. Steed, an appellate attorney at Bell Nunnally & Martin in Texas, believes part of the calculation that Republicans might be considering now is what might happen if they were to lose both the White House and the Senate. ""They might re-consider how committed Hillary Clinton is to a Garland nomination,"" he said. ""If she wins by large margins, she might feel pressure from the left to nominate someone who is younger or more progressive.""Possible liberal nominees could include appellate judges Sri Srinivasan of the D.C. Circuit and Paul Watford of the 9th Circuit. Both are under 50, while Garland is 63. On the campaign trail, Clinton has praised Garland and urged the Senate to act. But she has not made a firm commitment to putting his name forward again if she were to win the presidency. And then there is pressure from some key constituents. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka praised Garland at a recent breakfast according to USA Today, but he said he would not necessarily back his re-nomination if Clinton were to win. ""There could be somebody better, and if somebody better comes along, we'll support him,"" Trumka said. Clinton will inherit the vetting books compiled by lawyers in the Obama administration concerning other candidates who were discussed before Obama picked Garland, such as Srinivasan. And progressives have plenty of favorite outside-the-box candidates in mind. Someone like Judge Pamela Harris -- who was placed on the DC circuit after the so called ""nuclear option"" was triggered. Or Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who sits on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Or Sen. Elizabeth Warren? But if Clinton were to win, she may not want to engage in an immediate battle royale over the Supreme Court. Garland is eminently qualified, and given the fact that the next president will likely have an opportunity to fill more than one vacancy on a bench that currently consists of three justices in their late 70s and early 80s, she would likely have other opportunities. ""She might stick with Garland because it's easy -- there would be less risk of a fight,"" Steed said. Jawando said Clinton will make the court a priority. ""Secretary Clinton has always been very engaged in the nominations process because she understands how much is at stake in the courts,"" she said. ""The next president may have the opportunity to dramatically reshape the Supreme Court."" And what about Republican nominee Donald Trump? He broke it down for an audience in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in July. ""Here's the story,"" he said. ""If you really like Donald Trump -- that's great -- but if you don't you have to vote for me anyway -- you know why? Supreme Court judges! Supreme Court judges!""Trump has taken the unusual step of releasing a list of state and federal judges that might be among his picks, including conservatives such as Judge Diane Sykes of the United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and Judge Steven Colloton who sits on the 8th Circuit. Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, said at the time that the names on the list would need to be vetted but ""they all seem to share in common a record of putting the law and the Constitution ahead of their political preferences."" As for Garland, he has met with senators and offered up an unsolicited Senate questionnaire. As he said, ""You never have any idea what is going to come.""
