How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities,"" Trump said during a speech here to a conference of shale oil and natural gas producers.After police shot a man officials say was armed, two nights of protests followed there, slipping into violence Wednesday night with numerous civilian and police injuries reported, as well as looting and property destruction.Trump, who has focused on restoring ""law and order"" in his presidential campaign, seized on the unrest in Charlotte to renew his call for tough-on-crime policies to bring down crime rates in major American cities and once again appeal to African-Americans to join his campaign.""The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where crime is so rampant,"" Trump said. ""There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration, ever, ever.""RELATED: Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violenceTrump also tied the eruption of violent protests on Wednesday night to drugs, saying in Pittsburgh that ""drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night"" -- though he offered no evidence to back up that claim.Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, later said it was ""obvious"" Trump was ""referring to the recent increase in drug related deaths and subsequent news reports, thus making it a hot button issue.""Praised stop-and-friskTrump praised the policing practiced under former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, which included the use of ""stop-and-frisk"" and a greater crackdown on misdemeanor offenses and has been credited with helping bring down the city's crime rate during the 1990s.""Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache possible,"" Trump said of Giuliani, who is now a top adviser and surrogate.Speaking to Fox News a day earlier, Trump spoke out in favor of the controversial stop-and-frisk policy Giuliani put in place in New York which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013 for being a ""policy of indirect racial profiling."" Trump said Thursday morning that he was calling for that policy to be implemented in Chicago, where gun violence has skyrocketed, with more than 3,000 people shot in that city so far this year.RELATED: New York mayor: Donald Trump wrong about 'stop-and-frisk'During that interview, Trump also highlighted what he saw as a ""lack of spirit"" between communities. ""It just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing,"" he said. Trump offered few details in his Pittsburgh speech of what would be included in his ""national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again,"" beyond saying that he will ""make reduction of crime a top priority"" and appoint ""the best"" prosecutors and federal investigators to go after criminal gangs and cartels.Trump has previously said that he would look to increase the number of police officers in inner cities to bring down the crime rate and improve training, but has offered little other specifics on this policy front.""Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success,"" he said.Asked Wednesday about the police shootings in Charlotte and Tulsa, Oklahoma, that have reignited the debate over race and policing in the country, Trump did not address the Charlotte incident but said he was ""very, very troubled"" by the shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, in Tulsa on Friday night.Trump suggested the police officer who fatally shot Crutcher ""got scared"" or ""was choking,"" referring to individuals who fail under pressure."

The latest attempt with Russia to broker peace in Syria is unraveling amid mutual recriminations.""The conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong,"" he said. ""But I do ask myself, 'Was there something that we hadn't thought of? Was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a Churchill could have seen, or an Eisenhower might have figured out?'""""That's the kind of thing that tends to occupy me when I have the time to think about it,"" he said. ""Usually, I'm pretty good about sorting through the options and then making decisions that I'm confident are the best decisions in that moment, given the information we have. But there are times where I think I wish I could have imagined a different level of insight.""Obama 'skeptical' of policy changesOver the course of the civil war, Obama has considered taking strikes against Assad's positions as a consequence for the regime's use of chemical weapons on civilians, and has weighed arming various rebel factions who are battling the government.In the interview, Obama said he was ""skeptical"" taking those actions could have made any real difference in the war.Syria's crisis consumed much of the President's time this week at his final United Nations General Assembly, where he worked to convince his foreign counterparts to step up their commitments for accepting refugees from the war-torn country. He said during a special session on the refugee crisis that the world had come up short in its response.""We all know that what is happening in Syria ... is unacceptable,"" he said. ""And we are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop.""But in those remarks, and during his interview with Vanity Fair, Obama didn't lay out any specific changes to his approach in Syria to bring an end to the country's strife. His spokesman said Thursday that Obama would continue making choices based on the national security interests of the US.""The President's Syria policy has been second-guessed by many, many people. I think the President acknowledged in the interview that he himself has reviewed the decisions that he has had to make with regard to US policy in Syria,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. ""And as he has reviewed those decisions, he's concluded that each time he made a decision that was squarely within the national security interest of the United States and even advanced our national security interests."""

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/electoral-college-split-votes-maine-nebraska-proportional/index.html	"Maine and Nebraska are the only two states in the nation that don't have a winner-take-all system for their Electoral College votes. That means that even if a candidate doesn't win the statewide popular vote in those states, they could pick up one or two Electoral College votes if they win in congressional districts.And with an increasingly close election, both Republicans and Democrats see an opportunity to add purple to the map. Brief civics lesson: You're not technically voting for president on Nov. 8; you're voting for electors. It's those people -- 538 of them -- who technically pick the president. There's a math equation used to calculate how many electors each state gets: three Electoral College votes based on the total number of US senators and US representatives it has (and three extras for the District of Columbia). While individual electors may technically cast those votes for whomever they choose, it is virtually unheard of for a candidate who wins the popular vote in a state to not get all the electoral votes, and many states have laws enforcing that electors must respect the statewide vote. Except, that is, in Maine and Nebraska, where things can get complicated. In those states, the votes are tallied by congressional district.The road to 270In Maine, which has two senators, two congressmen and so four electoral votes, the statewide winner automatically gets two votes. And then the winner of each of the two congressional districts gets one electoral vote, respectively. In Nebraska, there are three congressional districts, meaning two votes go to a statewide winner and the three districts each award one electoral vote. So even if a candidate wins the majority of either state, Maine could have a 3-1 split and Nebraska could have a 4-1 or 3-2 split. This has almost never mattered -- but this year it might. If things get really close.They're not that close right now. Hillary Clinton has a strong advantage in the Electoral College. But CNN rates one congressional district each in normally red Nebraska and normally blue Maine as a ""battleground."" Maine has had the proportional system in place since 1972 and Nebraska since 1991, and only once have the votes ever split. Barack Obama in 2008 got one electoral vote from deep red Nebraska from the Omaha area. The President reflected on the unprecedented feat from 2008 while visiting Omaha in January. ""That year, in the primary, I won the Nebraska caucus, and there some people, I saw the signs calling the city 'Obamaha,' and then in November of 2008, Joe Biden and I won the electoral vote,"" Obama said during a trip to Nebraska. ""And then four years later I got whooped, all across this state.""Republicans in Nebraska have tried to change the law but failed by one vote this April to switch back to a winner-take-all.Both sides have their eyes on those single, accessible electoral votes.Trump has paid attention to and campaigned in Maine, a traditionally blue state in presidential years. He has reserved $47,000 in campaign ad time there from later this month through Election Day. Clinton, on the other hand, has paid attention to Nebraska, a traditionally red state in presidential years. She held an event with billionaire investor Warren Buffett in Omaha in early August, and has spent more than $500,000 on ads in the Omaha market. She has more than $120,000 reserved there through Election Day.Polls have tightened since early August, when Clinton had an advantage in many swing states that could have made for a landslide victory. Since then, races in many states have been toss-ups, making every electoral vote important.

""And we've seen that in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey where they'll try to insert themselves into the population.""The acknowledgment comes amid criticism the Obama administration's refugee resettlement policy poses security risks to the US, a charge made often by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on the campaign trail.""Is it perfect?"" Kirby asked of the vetting process. ""Can it be perfect? Can it be foolproof? Well, probably not. No. But it is very, very serious.""""I can tell you that the vetting is tough,"" he added. ""It is very, very stringent.""Kirby's statement also comes as the State Department is preparing to set new resettlement goals for 2017. Officials tell CNN the US next year plans to take in 110,000 refugees, up from 85,000 in the 2016 fiscal year, but it's unclear how many of these will be from Syria or the surrounding region.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/massachusetts-court-ruling-fleeing-police/index.html	"The Supreme Judicial Court held unanimously that a black male in Boston, when approached by the police, ""might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity.""The court pointed to statistics in a recent Boston Police Department report that revealed that ""black men in the City of Boston were more likely to be targeted for police-civilian encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations and interrogations."" The case at issue concerned Jimmy Warren, who was stopped in December 2011 by a Boston police officer responding to a break in that had occurred in the neighborhood.Responding police officer Christopher R. Carr saw Warren and a friend and called out, ""Hey fellas."" Warren turned and ran up a hill into a park and Carr observed him clutching the right side of his pants. Carr lost sight of Warren, but eventually caught up with him in the backyard of a house. Carr drew his weapon and yelled for him to get down. After a struggle, Carr arrested Warren and found no gun on his person. Minutes after the arrest police recovered a Walther .22 caliber firearm in the front yard. Warren told the officer that he did not have a license to carry a firearm and he was later charged with unlawful possession.   Nelson P. Lovins, brought the case to the state's high court after Warren lost below. Lovins argued that police did not have the reasonable suspicion to issue a stop, and the gun evidence had to be suppressed. He argued that the police pursued his client with the intent of questioning him, but they lacked the basis to do so. ""My client was never charged with a break in -- only with illegal possession of a gun, "" Lovins said in an interview. The court ruled in Warren's favor, noting that a stop has to be grounded in an officers' ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person was involved with a crime. That suspicion, the court said, had to be grounded in ""specific, articulable facts."" ""We are not persuaded that the information available to the police at the time of the seizure was sufficiently specific to establish reasonable suspicion that the defendant was connected to the breaking and entering under investigation,"" the court held, then walking through all of the factors the police had considered including the description of the suspects, the proximity to the crime, and the fact that Warren had run. On the last factor, the court pointed out a ""cautionary note"" pointing to statistics specific to Boston. The court warned that a reasonable suspicion calculus ""cannot be divorced from the finding in a recent Boston Police Department report documenting a pattern of racial profiling"" of black males in the city. The court said it did not eliminate flight as a factor for the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop, but in those circumstances ""flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt."" ""Rather, the finding that black males in Boston are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted"" the Court said, ""suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt."" Lovins hopes that this case will influence trial judges down the road that just because a black man is fleeing that doesn't necessarily mean he is guilty. ""We've demonstrated that there are other reasons for flight, certainly in the case of black males who have been targeted for stops and searches disproportionally,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Boston Police Department issued a statement saying the court's decision was ""very troubling."" ""For it to consider studies that were never introduced into evidence or offered into the record is concerning,"" the statement said, ""At the very least the court should have heard from experts who compiled and analyzed the data."" Matthew Segal, the legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, says that the police and prosecutors invited the data into the discussions because they are the ones who asserted that flight was automatically suspicious. The ACLU used the same statistics from the Boston Police Department to conclude that black people and communities in Boston were not being treated the same as white people in white communities. ""This is a potentially huge decision,"" said Segal. ""The Black Lives Matter movement can change the law in this country, if more courts follow the lead of the Supreme Judicial Court and look at the reasonableness standard from the perspective of the civilian.

And that requires being peaceful,"" Obama said during an interview with ABC News. ""The overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police community relations doing it the right way. Every once in awhile, you see folks doing it the wrong way.""Obama -- who also offered debate advice to Democrat Hillary Clinton in the interview -- said the violence that has raged in cities such as Charlotte, Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, shouldn't distract Americans from real concerns about systemic biases within US law enforcement agencies.""I think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of African-Americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always always, you know, colorblind,"" he said.Obama has sought to encourage reforms in police departments by convening a policing commission and recommending a set of common practices. But the White House says specific reforms should be left to local forces who best understand their communities' needs.""It's the responsibility of local law enforcement leaders and local elected officials to determine how and whether to pursue the implementation of these best practices,"" Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday. ""It's not something that can be imposed by the federal government.""Clinton spoke with Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts and Democratic North Carolina Rep. Alma Adams, whose district includes Charlotte, about the shooting and protests today, a Clinton aide said. They discussed ""steps we must take to ensure that everyone is respected by the law, and everyone has respect for the law,"" the aide added.Meanwhile, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is considering a trip to Charlotte next week after Monday's debate, two aides told CNN. Campaign officials are looking at the logistics involved in such a trip, which would also bring Trump to a critical battleground state.In his interview with ABC, Obama also offered debate advice for Clinton, his preferred successor.""Be yourself and explain what motivates you,"" he said. ""I think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers.

Sean Thompson, 32, approached the mayor, pulled a pie out of the bag and shoving it in his face -- setting off a short scuffle, in which Johnson punched Thompson in the face several times, according to witnesses descriptions of the scuffle in local media reports. ""There was an altercation that occurred after he got the pie in the face,"" Sgt. Bryce Heinlein, a Sacramento police spokesman, told CNN.""There were some punches thrown, and then the subject was quickly taken to the ground by one of the officers that is on the mayor's security detail"" and some event attendees, Heinlein said. Thompson was arrested and faces felony charges of assaulting a public official, Sacramento police said. The Sacramento Fire Department transported him to a local hospital after the scuffle. A booking photo shows him with two sets of stitches around a blackened left eye. Crystal Strait, Johnson's chief of staff, was on hand for the incident Wednesday night, and described a briefly chaotic scene.She said in an email that ""the Mayor was attacked and grabbed him from behind and struck with what we afterwards learned was a pie from an unknown man.

Chris Collins, a New York Republican, as he walked out of what could be the final meeting of Trump's congressional supporters. ""He's likely to bring up some Clinton issues. I think we're going to see some give and take there,"" Collins said. ""We all know Mr. Trump is a little quicker on his feet than Mrs. Clinton.""The group met for close to an hour at the Republican National Committee headquarters and discussed the Trump campaign's plan for battleground states as well, but the debate prep stood out in the meeting led by top Trump advisers.Collins, the first congressman to endorse Trump and an early leader of efforts to rally highly reluctant House Republicans to Trump's side, said that he will be flying to New York Monday to help the Trump campaign after the debate against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the media spin room. ""Donald Trump knows that Monday night is absolutely critical,"" he said. ""And I think with that in the back of his mind, I'm confident we'll see presidential Trump Monday night.""Clinton supporters offer advice ahead of first debateShortly after Collins talked Thursday, the Trump campaign sent out a debate prep survey to supporters, asking them what issues he should focus, whether he should attack Clinton's policies or defend his own and more. ""Do you think Trump should refer to Hillary as 'Crooked Hillary' on stage?"" Trump asked, in question #4 of the 30-question survey.Questions about Trump's use of charitable donations to pay off personal legal debts have hounded him this week, but Collins dismissed them and tried to put the focus back on the Clinton Foundation, which has been a source of consternation across the aisle.""I'm sure there will be these kinds of volleys, we'll hear more about, but the fact of the matter is Trump's Foundation made donations to not-for-profit, 501(c)3s -- that's what foundations do. And I think the more important question, or issue is there's no Trump family members being paid by the foundation,"" Collins said. ""It's not a patronage pit like the Clinton Foundation is."" How to watch the first presidential debateCollins said Trump's Hill supporters also got an update on the battleground plans, with just six weeks left in the race, and said they are confident Trump has multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win.""There are six different ways for him to get to 269, he's right now leading in Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire, that takes him to 269, he might win one in Maine, there's 270, he might lose one in Nebraska, he's back to 269,"" he said. Collins cited other states in play -- Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia -- that could tip the balance to Trump.The focus now, he said, has turned from rallying conservatives to winning over independent and undecided voters.""It's all about the undecideds, they don't like Hillary Clinton, they don't like her with her character flaws, they haven't warmed up to President Trump and that's where the debate is going to be so critical Monday night for President Trump to address the nation for all those people who want no part of Hillary Clinton."""

We asked what they think Clinton needs to do to outperform Trump, and what her biggest vulnerability might be under the spotlight. One woman said Clinton should keep her cool if Trump tries to provoke her. Another urged Clinton to stick to what she knows best -- policy. Some Clinton supporters expressed concern that Trump will try to hit her on issues like the email controversy and Benghazi.Here's a look at their advice for the Democratic nominee.Pat Fagan, 73, retired county parks and recreation director who lives in Clermont, FloridaWhat does Clinton need to do at the first debate?""She needs to continue being herself. I personally think how she handles herself with the public is the only way to go. Getting up there and then calling each other names and so forth -- I don't think that gets you anywhere.""What vulnerability do you think Clinton has at the debate?""Personally I don't really know of any vulnerabilities she has. I think she's going to win the election by at least 10 points. I think she is going to rip him a new one in the debate.""Patti Fagan, 60, retired, lives in Clermont, FloridaWhat advice do you have for Clinton heading into Monday's debate?""I would like her to listen to her own heart and not to be afraid of Donald Trump because he's just a punk. I just wish her well and I know he's going to ... anger her, he's going to try to antagonize her. I've seen him when he debates others and he gets really low and I just hope she remains high.""What do you think will be Clinton's biggest vulnerability at the debate?""Her biggest vulnerability is she overthinks. She's trying to say everything so perfectly and so correctly that I think some people take that as -- they don't trust her, they feel that it's forced. ... Don't overthink it because she's got it right and her instincts are right.""Mary Sharpe, 73, retired, lives in Lady Lake, FloridaWhat does Clinton need to do to have a successful first debate?""He's a pushover for baiting. I'd love to see her bait him into some crazy discussion. I think his tax returns, get him off on a tangent about his tax returns -- I think that'd be fun.""What do you think will be Clinton's biggest challenge at the debate?""I think he is probably going to go for the Benghazi thing that they are trying to keep going. I don't think he will bring up the Clinton Foundation because now he's in trouble with his foundation. So I don't think he's going to go there.""Joe Caldwell, 80, Vietnam War veteran from Orlando, FloridaWhat would you like to see Clinton do at the first debate?""I would really like to see her (discuss) the health care issue, the (Americans with Disabilities Act), the veterans and social issues -- those types of issues because there are so many veterans out there that can't get the care that they need not because they don't know where to go but because it's not available to them and it's pitiful.""What do you think will be Clinton's her biggest vulnerability at the debate?""I really hate to say this -- I do think that the most serious vulnerability is this thing that they keep bringing up that's history. Like the tapes, like the cell phone issues ... that's history. Let bygones be bygones. Start anew. It's a new day! She can handle it. Oh yes, she can handle it.""David Rucker, 70, retired from the Orange County public schools and lives in Orlando, FloridaWhat do you want to see from Clinton at the debate?""What I'd like for her to talk about is the police department. I think that needs to get into depth a little bit more to try to get an understanding between the two: the community and the police and sheriff's department. We need to have that camaraderie and we don't ... There are too many young black males getting killed for no reason at all. I realize that they're real nervous sometimes when confronting us but there still has to be a better way.""What do you think is Clinton's biggest weakness?""I don't know if she's going to have a weakness ... I think she'll come out on top. I'm not worried at all. He's more of a reactionary guy and he'll try to follow Hillary and I think she'll eat him up.""Brittany Arroyo, 27, works at an engineering company and lives in Melbourne, FloridaWhat is Clinton's biggest strength as she head into her first debate against Trump?""Her biggest strength is her experience and intelligence. Ultimately she knows the most about every political issues especially compared to Donald Trump. Her level of experience just far outweighs almost any other political figure and even if she's not prepared for a question, she'll have plenty of knowledge on it.""What will Clinton's biggest challenge be at the debate?""Unfortunately, I hate to say it, but as a woman I've seen it. She has to walk this fine line between being cute and likeable but also being tough and wise and intelligent and it's too hard -- you can never win. Even though we'll be watching and we won't care if she smiles, I know a lot of Republicans apparently do."""	Clinton supporters offer advice ahead of first debate	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

That is tragic. But between 1882 and 1931, there were 3,318 black people lynched. That's, on average, more than 1 black person strung up without a trial every week during a 50-year-period.- Last year 32.7% of black children lived in families with incomes below the poverty line. Pretty horrible. But in 1965, it was 65.6% of all black kids who were living in poverty.- The shooting of an unarmed black man in Tulsa is horrible. But in 1921, marauding white mobs, some dropping dynamite from airplanes, killed scores of black people - some estimates range up to 300 - in Tulsa's Greenwood neighborhood. Authorities detained more than 6,000 black folks just to protect them from being slain.　History is loaded with examples of how while things may be tough for black people now, times were infinitely more difficult in the past.　"	Reality check: Trump's view of state of black America really, really, really wrong	[]	[]
