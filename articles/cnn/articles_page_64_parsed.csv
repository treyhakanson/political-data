Pappert of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In the ruling Pappert cautioned, ""Allowing poll watchers to work in any county in the Commonwealth could result in certain counties being inundated with prospective poll watchers seeking credentials."" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly invited his followers to watch polling areas.""Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don't come in and vote five times,"" he said at a rally in Pennsylvania this summer.Pappert also criticized the party for waiting until 18 days before the election to bring the case. ""There is good reason to avoid last-minute intervention in a state's election process,"" he ruled, adding, ""any intervention at this point risks practical concerns including disruption, confusion or other unforeseen deleterious effects."" He scolded GOP lawyers and wrote, ""there was no need for this judicial fire drill and Plaintiffs offer no reasonable explanation of justification for the harried process they created."" Lawyers for the Republican Party asked for a preliminary injunction arguing that ""citizens have a fundamental right to a fair and honest election process"" and that the state rules ""illegally and arbitrarily"" restricted poll watchers from serving only in the county of their residence.

Darrell Issa, who is facing a tough re-election in California, shot down the idea on Wednesday, and a top Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn, called such discussions ""premature."""

In a rare appearance on the campaign trail -- and her first solo speech since the convention this summer -- the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump discussed her vision for her role in the White House for the first time Thursday in suburban Philadelphia. ""It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is terrible when it happens on the playground, and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet. We have to find a better way to talk to each other,"" Melania Trump said. Why North Carolina is so important in 2016""We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,"" she said. ""It will be one of the main focuses of my work, if I am privileged enough to become your first lady.""Not mentioned: Her own husband's long history of cyberbullying.In September, after Clinton cited Trump's reference to 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado as ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeper"" during their first presidential debate, Trump said in a 3 a.m. Twitter rant that Machado is ""disgusting"" and a ""con"" and directed followers to check out a non-existent Machado sex tape.Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Melania Trump's speech will not serve to highlight her husband's most controversial and inflammatory tweets. ""It won't for responsible journalists who wish to cover her entire speech/life journey,"" Conway said, adding a shot at the Democratic nominee and the FBI investigation into her private email server. ""And under that premise, would President Hillary Clinton never be able to talk law enforcement or corruption investigations again? Would she just abolish the DOJ and FBI?""It was Melania Trump's first speech since her appearance at the Republican National Convention, where her remarks triggered controversy because one section plagiarized Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Committee speech. A speechwriter later apologized. She cast her husband as someone who's in touch with America's working class.""Every time my husband learned of a factory closing in Ohio or North Carolina or Pennsylvania, I could see him get very upset,"" she said as she made the case that the Republican nominee can fix the nation's economic woes. Trump opened the speech by discussing her youth in Slovenia before immigrating to the United States, saying that ""America meant if you could dream it, you could become it."" She said she went through a 10-year process of becoming a United States citizen, which she called ""the greatest privilege in the world.""""I'm an immigrant, and no one values the freedoms and opportunities of America more than me,"" she said. Melania Trump hasn't had a very public role on the campaign trail and has made it clear, publicly and privately, that her first priority is raising their 10-year-old son, Barron.But her speech Thursday was the first of what Donald Trump said in an interview with ABC would be two or three major speeches before the November 8 election. The speech took place in Berwyn, Pennsylvania -- in the suburbs of Philadelphia -- and was designed to help Trump win over the middle-class women in the region who could tip the balance of Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes for Trump or Clinton. Conway worked with Melania Trump on the speech and was in attendance Thursday. Conway, Trump advisers said, has built a positive relationship with Melania over the course of the campaign. And Melania has privately been very supportive of Conway's role as the head of her husband's campaign. Melania Trump was introduced by Karen Pence, the wife of the Republican nominee's running mate Mike Pence. ""I know that America will fall in love with her just as much as she loves the American people,"" Karen Pence said. "	Melania Trump defends husband in rare speech	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/what-is-a-presidential-transition/index.html	"The operatives were joined by current administration staff and past presidential personnel to focus on a common goal: November 9 and beyond.The presidential transition is one of the least public but most important parts of any presidential election. With only 72 days between Election Night and Inauguration Day, good governance experts and recent federal officials have been pushing for candidates to start planning a potential administration earlier and earlier in the election calendar.Here's how it all works:What is transition?Presidential transitions have always existed in some capacity, enshrined in law in the Presidential Transitions Act of 1963.But while for years the efforts were privately funded and ad hoc, the federal government has been formally supporting transition operations since 2010.For starters, a new White House has to fill approximately 4,000 government positions, including roughly 1,100 that require Senate confirmation. Most new administrations only manage to fill a few hundred in its early months, and only about 80% of the positions are full at any given time in an administration, on average.In addition to the massive personnel undertaking, a transition has to figure out how to turn the candidate's campaign promises into actual policy.A new president is also expected to deliver a budget request for the entire government in early February, and give a State of the Union (or similar) address, undertakings that cannot be completed without starting well ahead of Inauguration Day.In 2012, the transition effort for Republican candidate Mitt Romney had upwards of 400 staffers who were organized into policy groups mimicking federal agencies, who were starting to draft a 200-day plan for a potential Romney administration.Trump transition Chairman Chris Christie has told lobbyists and influencers in Washington meetings that their operation is reviewing executive orders and regulations to see what could be changed in the first 100 to 200 days of a new administration.Why is it important?The time in which the US government is handing over power is arguably the most vulnerable period in our democracy.While some federal officials may be held over between administrations, even when parties change power, the vast majority of federal agencies -- covering homeland security to public health to the economy -- will be operating without permanent leadership in place or with brand new leaders.The workforce made of non-appointee career officials will remain in place, but coordinating a response to an event that threatens the public can be hampered by principals from different agencies working together for the first time.Transitions are encouraged to develop response plans for possible national emergencies -- be they health, weather, terrorism or other dangers -- and conduct table-top exercises to prepare.""You don't want the president with his or her staff sitting in the Sit Room, doing it for real, when it's the very first time,"" said Clay Johnson III, the former transition executive director and White House official for President George W. Bush. ""You can just imagine if 9/11 had been 2/11 or 1/21/11, how important it would have been to have a president and his national security people in place, really briefed, having had some at least prior exposure to the process and the other people they would be in that room with, if and when something awful like that happened.""So the transition starts before the election is over?For years it was considered ""measuring the drapes"" to begin planning for a potential administration before the race was won, but it has become more accepted in recent years to begin well before votes are cast -- even before the nomination is secured.With the amount of work a transition must do, the operation is seen as in the public's interest, even though one candidate will lose and the work will be for naught.Barack Obama and John McCain were both encouraged to stand up transition operations formally before the election, and starting with the 2012 election, the government has provided resources to do so.According to memoranda of understanding signed by representatives of Clinton and Trump with the General Services Administration, obtained by CNN through the Freedom of Information Act, federal office space was made available for both candidates' staffs starting August 1, 2016, after their formal nomination by the parties' conventions.After the election is over and a winner is apparent, the loser must move out within five days and the victor will have two weeks to transition to space provided for the president-elect, according to the MOU.Before the election, the transition remains largely separate from the campaign, so as not to distract from the primary goal of winning. Past transition leaders told CNN they provided periodic updates to the candidates, but largely stayed out of their hair.While the transition will prepare a list of potential names for the top positions the president-elect will need to fill, vetting is kept to open source information so as not to tip off individuals to their consideration prematurely.Still, preparations can advance significantly before the election. Emails hacked from the private account of Clinton's campaign Chairman John Podesta and posted by WikiLeaks date back to 2008 -- when Podesta chaired Obama's transition.The emails reveal a humming operation before Election Day, increasingly confident in its chances.On the afternoon of Election Day in 2008, Susan Rice emailed Obama's transition executive director Chris Lu about fielding calls from foreign leaders post-election.""In anticipation of the many calls from foreign leaders, we have prepared a list of priority calls to return and the briefing memos,"" Rice wrote. ""Our view is that he should return the calls through the State Dept. Ops center, which is comparatively apolitical and professional, has translation capabilities and can assist as desired with notetaking.""She added that someone from the team should contact State first thing Wednesday morning. Obama, of course, went on to win that night. The Clinton campaign has declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails being released every day in batches by WikiLeaks, blaming the Russian government for their release, which Moscow and WikiLeaks have denied.Who pays for all this?The transition is paid for by a combination of federal and private funds.The GSA provides both the candidates 16,000 square feet of office space -- enough for 114 people -- before the election, along with office equipment, technology and furniture, according to the MOUs. They also provide security staffing and IT support within pre-established hours.The GSA got more than $13 million for pre-election transition activities in the fiscal year 2016 budget.To pay for staffing, presidential transitions are allowed to set up tax-exempt organizations to fundraise. Per GSA agreements, they are only allowed to accept $5,000 per person or organization and are required to disclose all donations by February 19, 2017.Romney raised nearly $4 million for his transition team, as did Obama in 2008, though Christie has told potential donors that Trump wanted to run a leaner effort and that the target was closer to $2 million.Though money has yet to be formally allocated by Congress, the requested budget for the incoming president's transition is $7 million -- $6 million for the president-elect and $1 million for appointee orientation, the MOUs say. But that money can only be used after the election.Post-election, the GSA will continue to provide space and equipment, and the money can also be used for travel for employees or official guests -- for example inviting candidates to be interviewed or vetted for appointments. Past candidates for Cabinet positions often spent their own money to be interviewed."	What is a transition?

The Montgomery (LCS-8) was traveling from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean through the canal's series of ""locks"" when it hit a cement structure known as the ""center lock wall"" while under the control of a local Panama Canal pilot, according to a statement to CNN from the Navy. ""The crack is located 8-10 feet above the waterline and poses no water intrusion or stability risk,"" the Navy said, adding that the ship has since exited the Panama Canal to continue its trip to San Diego as scheduled. USNI News first reported the damage, which didn't require immediate repair.The incident is the latest in a run of bad luck for the $360 million state-of-the-art warship since it was commissioned in September.In fact, the Montgomery experienced a separate mishap just weeks ago that also resulted in a crack to its hull. It  sprang a leak after it was hit by a tug boat pulling it out of the path of Hurricane Matthew. An investigation into possible causes of that October 4 incident is under way, according to a statement that was made to CNN last month by Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Haggard, a spokeswoman for the Naval Surface Forces Pacific. Earlier, just days after its commissioning, the Montgomery also experienced a seawater leak into the vessel's hydraulic cooling system, and then lost one of its gas turbine engines later that day.The Montgomery's Panama mishap is just the latest in a string of incidents that have dogged the LCS program.In September, the service announced a major overhaul of the LCS program that will include designating the first four of the ships as testing vessels and limiting their overseas deployments to emergencies.That announcement came less than two weeks after the Navy had revealed breakdowns in two of the ships, the USS Freedom (LCS 1) and USS Coronado (LCS 4). Those followed mechanical failures in the USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) and USS Milwaukee (LCS 5), all since December.The new deployment plan for the LCS fleet isn't a response to the breakdown issues, Navy spokesman Lt. Kara Yingling told CNN.""The review was a comprehensive look at maintenance, training, and manning across the class -- not limited to one ship or one incident. As with any new ship class, the Navy constantly looks for ways to improve employment and deployment of its ships,"" she said."	Another mishap for Navy's $360 million warship	[]	[]

Cruz would later mention Trump's name at a rally in Portage, Michigan.The former Republican presidential contender, instead, focused his comments on what he considers the three main issues of the election: jobs, freedom and security. He dovetailed with Pence's message at time -- talking about rising health care premiums and Clinton scandals -- but also weaved in parts of his stump speech from his days on the trail.""We need to pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS,"" Cruz said, recycling a campaign line. The crowd greeted the Iowa caucuses winner enthusiastically, waving ""Iowa Agriculture for Trump"" signs in the air.Cruz, like Pence has been going for two weeks now on the trail, urged attendees to support down-ballot candidates like Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is up for reelection, in the Hawkeye State.As he concluded, Cruz circled back to a favorite line of his on ""strong, principled conservatives.""""Together, we're going to keep Republican control of the Senate and we're going to defeat Hillary Clinton in this presidential election,"" and continued, ""He is someone who today I call my friend and I very much look forward to calling him Mr. Vice President,"" he said as Pence strode on stage.Later, Pence and Cruz spoke to the traveling press, where Cruz pinned blame on the media for creating divisions in the party.""Well, I am here campaigning for Donald Trump for Mike Pence. I recognize some of you guys are wanting to write stories suggesting divisions among Republicans,"" Cruz said.On the Des Moines Airport tarmac, Cruz pointed behind him to the ""Trump-Pence""-emblazoned plane in the background, ""I'll make a point I am getting ready to get on a gigantic airplane that has Donald Trump's name painted on the side of it. On Monday of this week, I voted for Donald Trump. I voted for Mike Pence.""He added that he was ""doing everything I can to defeat Hillary Clinton because I think Hillary Clinton could be an absolute disaster.""CNN pressed Cruz on why he didn't mention Trump's name on stage to Iowa voters.""Well, I am here standing -- as I said -- in front of the 'Trump-Pence' plane campaigning for the Trump-Pence ticket and I voted for Donald Trump and Mike Pence this week,"" Cruz explained.Speaking at the Michigan rally, Cruz finally invoked Trump by name before supporters.""If your health insurance premiums have gone up, like just about every person's in America, then you ought to vote for Donald Trump and Mike Pence and Republicans up and down the ticket,"" Cruz said."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/senate-races-flip-2016/index.html	But a new wildcard has entered the mix: Wisconsin -- a seat long thought to be a Democratic lock that has now become a lot more uncertain. To win the Senate, Democrats need to pick up four seats if Hillary Clinton takes the White House; five if Donald Trump becomes the next president, since the vice president breaks a 50-50 tie. And no matter which party controls the chamber, the party in power will almost certainly have a very small majority -- a handful of seats, at most -- a recipe for gridlock in the new Congress. Here's CNN's latest breakdown of the race for the Senate: Republican-held seat in Illinois. Verdict: Likely to flipGOP Sen. Mark Kirk was always a long shot, running in a blue state in a presidential year. And all year long, he's been running behind his Democratic foe, Rep. Tammy Duckworth. But when he took a dig at Duckworth's ethnic background at a debate last week, the wheels seemed to have fallen off his campaign. Kirk winning now would be seen as the biggest upset of the cycle. Republican-held seat in Wisconsin. Verdict: Leans DemocratSpeaking of upsets, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is trying to pull one off himself, taking out the man who had long been a heavy favorite in the race, former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold. Johnson has shifted his campaign tactics with a mix of positive ads about himself and attacks against Feingold, and seems to have caught Democrats off guard. Buoyed by an influx of outside spending, and Trump outspending Clinton on TV in the state, Johnson has suddenly found himself down by just 1 point, according to a new Marquette University poll. Still, both sides acknowledge that Feingold is the favorite heading into Election Day, especially given that no GOP candidate has won a Wisconsin Senate seat in a presidential year since 1980.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's super PAC plans to invest $2.2 million in the state as well to boost Johnson, it announced Thursday.Republican seat in Pennsylvania. Verdict: Leans DemocratPolls over the last couple weeks have consistently shown Democrat Katie McGinty holding a slim lead, including a CNN-ORC survey from Wednesday reporting that Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is now down five points. Toomey has been working the Philadelphia suburbs hard to appeal to moderate, middle-of-the-road voters -- namely women -- to help power him to a victory. But the national headwinds may end up being too tough for Toomey to overcome. Is Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a brick in Clinton's firewall?Republican-held seat in Indiana. Verdict: Toss-upFormer Sen. Evan Bayh had long been viewed as the heavy favorite when he made a surprise entrance into the race to win back his old seat against Republican Rep. Todd Young. But Bayh has been badly damaged by a series of stories about his post-Senate life, his inactive voter status and damaging revelations about meetings with donors and lobbyists during his time in the Senate. And now polls show the race in a dead heat, and Bayh stumbling to the finish line. Republicans are feeling bullish about Indiana.Vigo County, Indiana, knows how to pick 'em Republican-held seat in Missouri. Verdict: Toss-upUnlike in Indiana, Democrats are making the case that Republican Sen. Roy Blunt is the true Washington insider with deep ties to lobbyists, and has lost touch with his state, banking on the fresh-faced, 35-year-old Jason Kander to present himself as the outsider. Republicans privately say that Kander is perhaps the best Democratic recruit in the country -- and that Blunt has struggled to define him, prompting GOP fears that the veteran could cost them a critical seat. But Blunt is relying heavily on the fact that Missouri is still a red state and Trump is likely to win there, hoping to ride the GOP nominee's coattails to victory.  Republican-held seat in North Carolina. Verdict: Toss-upSen. Richard Burr's candidacy has been a constant cause of stress for GOP leaders. They don't think he has worked hard enough to define his Democratic opponent, Deborah Ross, or make the case that he should be reelected. More money has started to pour into the state to define Ross as an out-of-touch liberal elite, picking apart her record working as a top attorney for the North Carolina chapter of the liberal American Civil Liberties Union. Burr is also struggling because Trump is underperforming against Clinton, who leads there. And new scrutiny over Burr's private comments at a fundraiser last weekend -- suggesting some gun owners may want to incite violence towards Clinton -- has put him on the defensive in the closing days of the campaign. Democratic-held seat in Nevada. Verdict: Toss-upNevada's race has been remarkably tight for the duration of the campaign. Polls have either shown Republican Rep. Joe Heck with a lead within the margin of error, or shown Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto with a slight lead.But Heck has had a rough few weeks in his handling of Trump, getting negative scrutiny from the right for his disavowal of the GOP nominee -- but also saying privately and publicly he's not sure for whom he would vote. Democrats are banking on Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's political machine to help turn out Democratic voters. But the GOP believes Reid's unpopularity will be a stain on Masto's chances. Republican seat in New Hampshire. Verdict: Toss-upThe race between Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan has swung back-and-forth for months, and Election Day is bound to be a true nail-biter. Ayotte had a rough October, with a poor debate performance where she called Trump a role model -- only to take it back -- and then being bombarded by an influx of Democratic money across the airwaves. But Republicans have struck back, dropping major dollars across the airwaves in recent days, helping to fortify Ayotte's position, making the race the truest of toss-ups.Republican seat in Florida. Verdict: Leans RepublicanSen. Marco Rubio heads into Election Day as a favorite against Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, buoyed by GOP money, name recognition and winning over Latino voters in Miami-Dade County. But Florida is the ultimate swing state -- and no statewide race there can be taken for granted. Murphy has benefited by a renewed push by the top of the ticket -- and by President Barack Obama -- hoping to ride Hillary Clinton's coattails into office, even though Democratic groups have mostly avoided spending in the expensive state. A CNN-ORC poll out Wednesday showed Rubio clinging to a one-point lead, but most operatives on both sides believe the GOP senator is in a more comfortable position.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/polls-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-florida-pennsylvania-nevada-arizona/index.html	" Clinton holds a 4-point edge among likely voters in the historically blue-tilting Pennsylvania, and Trump tops Clinton by 5 with voters in red-leaning Arizona. Though both states tilt in the same direction as their 2012 results, the leaders' margins are tighter than their predecessors' final leads were in each state. Florida appears to be as tight a contest as ever, with Clinton at 49% among likely voters and Trump at 47%. That's an apparent shift in Clinton's direction since the last CNN/ORC poll there in September before the presidential debates began, but still a within-margin-of-error race. In Nevada, the poll suggests the race has also shifted, with Trump now ahead there 49% to 43%, with 5% behind Libertarian Gary Johnson, compared with a two-point Clinton edge in mid-October. The path to victory is right here in this mapWhile that shift is statistically significant, it could be reflective of timing: The mid-October poll came at a particularly bad time for Trump in most polls, following the second presidential debate and the revelation of a tape in which Trump talked about sexually aggressive behavior toward women using vulgar language. The new poll comes at a challenging time for Clinton in many polls, with national and some state polling narrowing amid news that the FBI has obtained additional emails that could be relevant to their investigation of the private server she used while secretary of state. Across all four states, women are more apt than men to support Clinton, men tilt to Trump in each place. White voters break heavily in Trump's favor in each state, while non-whites favor Clinton by wide margins. And voters who say they have already cast ballots in Arizona and Nevada are about evenly split, with a narrow advantage for Clinton, while she holds a wide margin among those who say they have already voted in Florida. Trump tops Clinton by double-digits in all three states among those likely voters who say they plan to cast their ballot on November 8. In Pennsylvania, where votes cast before election day come only from those who apply for an absentee ballot and have a reason why they can't vote on Election Day, there were too few early voters to analyze. In Florida and Nevada, there are sharp enthusiasm gaps between Clinton voters and Trump voters, with the Trump backers far more likely to say they're enthusiastic about voting this year in both Florida (58% among Trump supporters, 48% among Clinton backers) and Nevada (61% for Trump voters, 48% for Clinton supporters). In Arizona and Pennsylvania, there isn't much of an enthusiasm gap, but also not much enthusiasm either, with fewer than half of voters saying they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president this year. A split on issuesOn the issues, Trump's advantage on the economy spans all four states, while Clinton continues to top Trump on foreign policy. The landscape on the issues has changed little compared with earlier polling in each state, with voters closely divided on whether Trump or Clinton would better handle immigration or terrorism. Clinton has the edge on health care across states, an issue that has emerged as a recent campaign touchpoint as open enrollment for 2017 approaches. Clinton holds her narrowest margin on the issue in Arizona, where she is ahead by a statistically insignificant 1 point. Arizona is seeing some of the largest increases in Obamacare premiums for the coming year, and it's an issue Trump has been raising on the campaign trail recently. Clinton also tops Trump in all but Arizona on having a clear vision for the country's future, and tops him in all four states as having the temperament to serve effectively as president and handle the responsibilities of commander-in-chief. Despite those advantages on ""presidential"" attributes, Clinton continues to be dogged by questions about her honesty, and lags well behind Trump on honesty and trustworthiness in each of these four states. Clinton's disadvantage on that issue, though, has only worsened in Nevada. In the rest of the states, the resurfacing of the email server issue appears not to be shifting those numbers. Tight Senate races, tooAll four of these states also have senate seats up for grabs this year, three of the four are incredibly close contests. In Florida, Marco Rubio's once wide lead over Patrick Murphy has evaporated, and the race is now a 1-point contest, 49% back Rubio, 48% Murphy. The Nevada race to replace the Senate's top Democrat Harry Reid has swung back toward Republican Joe Heck, but here too the race is within margin of error, with Heck at 49% to Catherine Cortez Masto's 47%. The margin widens slightly in Pennsylvania, where Republican incumbent Pat Toomey lags behind challenger Katie McGinty by 5 points. In Arizona, John McCain holds a wide lead over challenger Ann Kirkpatrick, topping her 52% to 39%.Full results for Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania.The CNN/ORC polls were conducted by telephone Oct. 27-Nov. 1. Results reflect interviews with 867 registered voters and 769 likely voters in Arizona, 884 registered voters and 773 likely voters in Florida, 860 registered voters and 790 likely voters in Nevada and 917 registered voters and 799 likely voters in Pennsylvania.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/republican-democrat-poll-watcher/index.html	"Trump has repeatedly invited his followers to watch polling areas. ""Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don't come in and vote five times,"" he said at a rally in Pennsylvania this summer. Now, a federal judge wants to hear more. A hearing is scheduled for Friday in New Jersey, and the RNC has been directed to provide information detailing ""any efforts regarding poll watching or poll observation.""The RNC is forbidden from engaging in any ballot security activities that might deter qualified voters from voting because of a decades old consent decree that has been modified over the years and is set to expire at the end of 2017. The consent decree arose in the early 1980s after the RNC was accused of intimidating registered voters in predominately African-American precincts in New Jersey. The RNC allegedly enlisted the help of off-duty police officers to intimidate voters by standing at polling places with ""National Ballot Security Task Force"" armbands. To settle the lawsuit, the RNC entered into the agreement. Democratic lawyers have already gone to court in New Jersey asking that the judge extend the consent decree for several more years arguing that the RNC  has enabled Trump's efforts to ""intimidate and discourage minority voters"" from voting. It submitted to the court a statement from a DNC volunteer in Nevada, Ellyn Lindsay, who said she had met a poll observer, Kishanna Holland, who said she worked for the RNC. According to Lindsay, Holland told her, ""This is Shana from RNC."" Joshua A. Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky School of Law, points out that under the decree, Holland would not be allowed to represent the RNC in undertaking 'ballot security' activities as a poll observer. ""The RNC has coordinated with the Trump campaign in its unlawful 'ballot security' efforts,"" DNC lawyer Angelo J. Genova argued in the lawsuit. ""Trump's running mate, Gov. Mike Pence has publicly confirmed that both the RNC and the Trump campaign are working directly with state Republican parties on so called 'ballot security measures' "" he said. Lawyers for the RNC disagree. ""The RNC has scrupulously complied with its obligations under the consent decree,"" wrote RNC lawyer Bobby Burchfield,. Burchfield outlined that the RNC has ""reminded"" the Trump campaign of the restrictions imposed on the RNC under the consent decree. ""In a letter to Donald F. McGahn II, the lead attorney for the Trump campaign,"" Burchfield argued, the RNC's chief counsel ""explained that the RNC is covered by , and strictly complies with, the consent decree and thus would not engage in any ballot security efforts."" The letter went on to inform the Trump campaign that ""anyone associated with his campaign are not agents of the RNC.""Judge John Michael Vazquez has scheduled a hearing for Friday morning to discuss the fillings, as well as to inquire about the statements made by Pence.  ""The legal issues are important, especially if the court extends the consent decree beyond this election,"" Douglas said. ""But for election day, the case is more a political story than a legal one."" ""If the court rules in favor of the DNC, it might order the RNC to take certain active measures which could divert resources from its get out the vote efforts in the crucial last days before the election,"" he said. ""It would also counter balance the election rigging theme coming from the Trump campaign, with a federal judge essentially saying that 'no, it's the Republicans and Trump doing it.'"" Democratic lawyers have filed four related lawsuits in the states of Nevada, Ohio, Arizona and Pennsylvania. These lawsuits target the Trump campaign and the state republican parties for ""voter intimidation"" the lawyers say is in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. In court papers they argued ""Trump has made an escalating series of statements, often racially tinged, suggesting that his supporters should go to particular precincts on election Day and intimidate voters.""  ""This planned course of intimidation,"" they argued, ""violates the Voting Rights Act."" Roger Stone activitiesThe Democrats also targeted Roger Stone, who they call a ""longtime associate"" of Trump who they say runs a website called ""stopthesteal.org."" ""Defendant Stop the Steal Inc is a 'super PAC' formed by Stone on April 6, 2016,"" they said, ""devoted to promoting Stone's conspiracy theories regarding voter fraud, and to using fears of a 'rigged' election to organize and recruit poll watchers to harass and intimidate perceived Democratic voters on Election Day."" They also link Stone to activities that caused the RNC to sign the consent decree in 1981. ""Stone was a key advisor to the 1981 campaign of former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, in which a 'ballot security"" force wearing black armbands engaged in widespread voter intimidation in Democratic areas of the state, leading to the above-described nationwide consent decree barring supposed ballot security efforts by the Republican Party."" Stone did not immediately return emails requesting comment. Election law expert Richard Hasen who runs the Election Law Blog, says it is ""not clear"" that a court would issue a vague order to stop ""voter intimidation"" as requested by the Democrats in the four lawsuits. ""But the suits will first bring publicity to the activities, and second get these parties on record stating that they do not plan on engaging in voter intimidation, which itself could be useful in the event of problems on Election Day,"" he wrote.

""I am not sure you should be making references to [missing cell phones],"" Cooper jokingly interjected, prompting an outburst of laughter from the other panelists.  Cooper was likely referring to emails missing from Hillary Clinton's private server, and discarded cell phones she used during her tenure at the State Department, which were reportedly destroyed with a hammer. ""She can hammer it home,"" Cooper punned a few moments later, as King pressed on with the analogy. "	Anderson Cooper mocks John King over phone analogy	['Clinton', 'Cooper']	[]
