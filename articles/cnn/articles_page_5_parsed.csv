It was written by CNN's Thomas Lake with reporting from Jodi Enda, Susan Baer and CNN's political team.'Unprecedented': Clinton worried about striking balances in debates""Cruz was serious enough about the alliance that he authorized Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to go to Miami ahead of the CNN debate there on March 10 to help work out a deal,"" the authors write.""I think the two of them as running mates would have been unstoppable,"" Lee later told CNN. ""They would have united the party.""The battle between Cruz and Trump became increasingly bitter as the election progressed, with Trump repeatedly attacking Cruz's family and Cruz eventually withholding his endorsement from Trump at the Republican National Convention. Cruz did eventually give him his nod of approval in September, and he is now a possible attorney general nominee.Though Rubio was initially open to the unity idea, according to two sources familiar with the talks, he declined the meeting with Lee, who bought the ticket at his own expense. 'Unprecedented': Trump told Christie he didn't think he'd last past October 2015""I don't think I can do this,"" Rubio told Lee, according to one of the sources. ""I don't think I can back out and not be a presidential candidate prior to the primary in Florida.""And so he didn't. Five days after the debate, Trump won Florida by 18 points and Rubio immediately dropped out of the race.He never endorsed Cruz. And Cruz never was able to keep Trump from becoming the Republican nominee."

This should indicate to all of us that keeping our leadership team completely unchanged will simply lead to more disappointment in future elections,"" Ryan said in a statement announcing his bid.Earlier Thursday, Ryan told CNN Pelosi does not have enough support to remain atop the caucus.""The definition of insanity,"" he said, is to do the ""same thing over and over again and keep getting the same results.""Ryan added: ""I think there's a lot of support for going in a different direction. I really do.""Earlier, a quiet lobbying push emerged to recruit the fifth-ranking Democratic leader, Joe Crowley of New York, to challenge Pelosi. He said later Thursday he would not challenge her.The discussions come as Democrats are struggling to chart a path forward after Trump's stunning victory last week. Even Pelosi loyalists, like GK Butterfield of North Carolina, say she needs to present a more specific vision about where she wants to take the party. ""Well, we've lost 60 seats over the last few years,"" Butterfield, head of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN. ""We cannot continue to lose seats here in the House.""Leadership elections were already delayed until after Thanksgiving. She initially resisted shifting the date but was forced to back down after House Democrats demanded more time.As Pelosi walked into a Democratic caucus meeting Thursday, she projected an aura of confidence.""No,"" she told CNN when asked if she was concerned about a leadership challenge.At a news conference later in the day, Pelosi predicted she would be overwhelmingly re-elected as the party's leader, saying she has the backing of two-thirds of her caucus. And she strongly defended her record, pointing to how the Democrats got back into the House majority in the 2006 midterms during the Bush years and suggesting the same would be true in the Trump years.""I am very proud to have the opportunity"" to get the Democrats back to the majority, she said.Yet Democrats are still frustrated at Pelosi, according to members and aides.""Instead of listening to members and hearing their thoughts about what went wrong, and what we should do instead, she instead presented a new agenda,"" one Democratic source said. ""That is not what members want ... That is going to really frustrate people."" The 43-year-old Ryan, who joined the House in 2003, is trying to tap into the angst among some younger members who believe it's time to take the reins from the 76-year-old Pelosi. After Ryan entered Congress, Pelosi recruited him along to serve in a group to elevate the profile of younger members.Now he believes it's time for the party to sell itself to the Rust Belt in light of Trump's victory in states decimated by the downturn of the manufacturing sector, saying he would bring a ""real connection to blue-collar people"" if he became Democratic leader."

Jeb Hensarling on Thursday, according to Trump's communication director Jason Miller and Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer.RNC aide: Trump will avoid business 'conflicts of interest'Haley, South Carolina's first female and Indian-American governor, had spent most of the election season criticizing Trump, including taking aim at him during her high-profile role giving the Republican response to the State of the Union.""During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,"" Haley said at the time from the governor's residence in Columbia. ""We must resist that temptation. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.""Trump struck back at the South Carolina governor after her speech, saying at the time she was being ""weak"" on immigration.Why hasn't Trump's transition team called the Pentagon?""She's very weak on illegal immigration,"" he said on Fox News' ""Fox & Friends."" ""I feel very strongly about immigration. She doesn't.""And ahead of the Republican South Carolina primary, Haley said Trump represents ""everything a governor doesn't want in a president."" She endorsed Trump's former presidential rival Florida Sen.

Spicer also said anyone being vetted for a high post in the administration must provide a termination of lobbying form if they are registered lobbyists. In addition, when they leave the government, they will be banned from being a lobbyist for five years."

Tom Cotton R-Arizona, with the aim of demonstrating support for Hong Kong's autonomy as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. Rubio, who is co-chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, said in a statement that the bill ""would renew the United States' historical commitment to freedom and democracy in Hong Kong at a time when its autonomy is increasingly under assault.""The bill comes about after it emerged last year that five booksellers from the SAR were either arrested in China or taken into the mainland by Chinese authorities. One bookseller was abducted in Thailand and another from the SAR itself. One is a Swedish citizen, and another holds British passport.Its legal independence was again rocked in recent weeks when the High Court chose to uphold a Beijing-issued ruling barring two elected lawmakers from taking office after they pointedly refused to swear an oath of allegiance to China. The two will appeal.Hong Kong bookseller case shows weak international community: reportPunitive measures proposedThe proposed legislation would allow the US to freeze assets and bar entry to people deemed responsible for ""the surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of certain booksellers and journalists in Hong Kong, and other actions suppressing basic freedoms."" It would also ensure that those with criminal records resulting from pro-democracy activities, and would reinstate a requirement for an annual State Department report on the region. Political analysts in Hong Kong welcomed the bill.""At this stage we are not sure it will be passed but good sign that prominent members of congress are paying attention to freedom of expression"" in Hong Kong, said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Centre for China Studies, Chinese University of Hong Kong.""There are fears that after (President-elect Donald) Trump becomes President he might not be as concerned about China's human rights, as reports suggest that he wants to focus on the US,"" Lam told CNN. ""(Trump) has spoken out about China's (economic) behavior -- for example, currency manipulation -- but hasn't spoken out on China's human rights violations."" The same -- but differentHong Kong's de facto constitution, the Basic Law, guarantees freedoms unknown in mainland China. It also prevents mainland officials from operating in the territory, which reverted from British rule to China in 1997. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's autonomy -- an arrangement known as ""one country, two systems"" -- is guaranteed for 50 years.  Hong Kong's legal separation from Beijing is a key factor for the city's economic well-being, with the rule of law which is enshrined in the document and its independent judiciary important considerations for the many multinational companies which operate out of Hong Kong.""in recent years, Beijing has consistently undermined the 'one country, two systems' principle and infringed on the democratic freedoms the residents of Hong Kong are supposed to be guaranteed,"" Rubio's statement reads. ""This was on stark display over the last year with the abduction of the Hong Kong booksellers, the required loyalty oaths in the lead-up to the September LegCo elections, and last week with Beijing's unprecedented intervention in Hong Kong's legal system to block two democratically elected politicians from assuming office. 'Assault on democracy'""China's assault on democratic institutions and human rights is of central importance to the people of Hong Kong and to its status as a free market, economic powerhouse and hub for international trade and investment.""His co-sponsor, Cotton, added that the bill would bring Hong Kong's political status was brought to the fore of the international community's attention. ""The United States must lead the world in ensuring that the Chinese government ceases any repressive acts in Hong Kong and abides by its three-decade-old international commitment to respect the autonomy of Hong Kong,"" he said."

Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. Many legislatures convene in January. Here are a few of the bills that may be discussed.Indiana: Bill would criminalize abortionA legislator says he will file a bill that will outlaw all forms of abortion and allow criminal charges to be filed against people who participate in an abortion procedure.""You would treat the death of an unborn child like you would any other human being,"" state Rep. Curt Nisly told the Indianapolis Star.Though such a law would conflict with Roe v. Wade, which allows abortion, and probably be declared unconstitutional, Nisly said he doesn't care. ""My position is that the Supreme Court is wrong with Roe v. Wade,"" he told the newspaper. ""This is the state of Indiana asserting the powers that are given to them, specifically in the 9th and 10th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.""Trump says he will appoint anti-abortion Supreme Court judges and hopes abortion rights will be regulated by states.Iowa: 'Suck it up, buttercup' billIowa Rep. Bobby Kaufmann is upset that college students reacted to Donald Trump's election by retreating to ""cry rooms"" and blocking Interstate 80 with their protests.Kaufmann says he'll file a bill that will penalize state colleges that fund election-related sit-ins and grief counseling beyond what is normally available, the Des Moines Register reports.Schools would be subject to a budget cut twice what they spent on such an activity. His bill would set new criminal penalties for protesters who shut down highways. ""You've got a right to be a brat,"" Kaufmann said, according to CNN affiliate WQAD. ""You've got a right to protest, that's constitutionally protected.  But you do not have a right to throw a temper tantrum on I-80 and put my constituents' lives in danger.""Kaufmann said he'll name the bill ""Suck it up, buttercup,"" after a catchphrase he's heard farm hands use.Georgia: Tax proposed on money wire transfersImmigrant workers -- including those in the United States illegally -- often send money back home through wire transfers. State Rep. Jeff Jones wants to tax those transfers and says he'll introduce a bill to do this.  A transfer under $500 would incur a $10 fee. A transfer over $500 would incur a $10 fee, plus 2% of the transaction amount.The fee would be reimbursed when individuals file a Georgia income tax form or the proper paperwork.  The state could make $30 million-$40 million in in revenue a year, Jones says.Of course, illegal immigrants are often hesitant to provide personal information about themselves to the government. Congress: Bill to eliminate Electoral CollegeTrump won the Electoral College but Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton took the popular vote. Same thing happened to Democratic nominee Al Gore in 2000, when he lost to George W. Bush.Retiring U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer of California wants to change that, and has entered a bill to do so.""The Electoral College is an outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society, and it needs to change immediately. Every American should be guaranteed that their vote counts,"" she said.Trump praised the Electoral College, despite having criticized it in the past.Georgia: Burqa bill withdrawnA state House member filed legislation that would would effectively not allow women to have their driver's license photos shot while wearing burqas, the full-body garment that many Muslim women wear, or drive while wearing a burqa. But Rep. Jason Spencer said Thursday he'd withdraw the bill.""While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety,"" he wrote on his official Facebook page.The bill would have amended Georgia's anti-masking statute, which was intended to ban Ku Klux Klan hoods and robes.Critics say the bill targeted Muslims.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/dni-james-clapper-submitted-his-resignation/index.html	"""(I) submitted my letter of resignation last night, which felt pretty good,"" he said before the panel of lawmakers, in response to the top Democrat on the panel joking he hoped he would stick around for another four years.""I have 64 days left and I'd have a pretty hard time with my wife going past that,"" Clapper told California Rep. Adam Schiff, who also paid his respects to Clapper's service as the hearing opened.All members of an outgoing administration must submit a resignation at some point. Clapper's announcement wasn't a surprise to those around him and was expected at the end of his term. For months, the intelligence director has been updating those around him on his own personal countdown clock, telling them exactly how many days he has left until retirement. ""He signed his letter as required by all appointed administration officials but is finishing out his term,"" said a spokesperson from the Office of Director National Intelligence. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence announced via Twitter that the resignation will be effective at noon on January 20, 2017.US faces most challenges now Clapper's announcement comes as president-elect Donald Trump's transition team is trying to hammer out the people who will lead and set the tone for national security agencies during his administration. Sen.Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat and incoming vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said Clapper's announcement ""underscores the need for the new administration to move expeditiously in making key national security appointments."" ""As that process continues,"" Warner said in a statement, ""I hope President-Elect Trump will seek out personnel that embody the same experience, gravity of purpose and service to country that have been a hallmark of James Clapper's career.""While Clapper's job is focused on policy and security, politics intruded at Thursday's hearing when he was asked whether he had any concerns about FBI director James Comey's announcement late in the presidential election campaign that his agency was reopening an investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's use of email while at the State Department.Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro described Comey's act as an ""unprecedented intrusion by a director within our own intelligence community in our democratic process,"" and asked Clapper if ""you believe that Director Comey breached any protocol.""""I have no reason to question Director Comey,"" Clapper said. ""I think extremely highly of him so whatever actions he took he did so what he felt was best and I have no basis for questioning him."" Clapper has said that in over 50 years of military and intelligence work, he has never seen the breadth of challenges facing the US as he does today. ""Our nation is facing the most diverse array of threats that I've seen,"" he told the committee Thursday.At the hearing, Clapper was asked which threats will be of most concern to the US in the next 5-10 years. ""I'm hesitant to pick one,"" he said. Clapper listed the challenges posed by nation states like Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, as well as transnational threats like terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ""which is personally a growing concern for me,"" he said, and ""the challenges posed in the cyber dimension.""Clapper also said that preventing attacks like the June attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was among the issues that concern him. ""I will leave this job concerned about the impact of so-called lone wolves and home grown violent extremism,"" Clapper said. ""That is a very complex problem.""Clapper's early careerAs Director of National Intelligence, Clapper acts as the principal intelligence advisor to President Barack Obama. He oversees 17 intelligence agencies that range from high-profile places like the CIA, NSA and FBI to groups that were less well-known, like the National Reconnaissance Office. The office was created in part to end stove-piping within the intelligence community and improve information sharing. Clapper began his career of 50-plus years in the military, serving as a rifleman in the Marine Corps. He served two combat tours during the Vietnam War, flying 73 combat support missions over Laos and Cambodia. He went on to serve as Director of Intelligence for the war-fighting commands of US Forces Korea, Pacific Command, and Strategic Air Command.He wrapped up his first government career as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency before retiring and working in the private sector. He returned to government September 2001 to be the first civilian director of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. He was sworn in as the fourth director of the ODNI in August 2010."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-allies/index.html	"""If Mr. Trump has the guts to stand up to those corporations,"" said the former Democratic presidential candidate, ""he will have an ally with me.""The willingness on the part of Sanders, a longtime democratic socialist, to work with Trump on a series of economic issues underscores the unorthodox and strikingly populist message that Trump used during his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton.Sanders, speaking with reporters at a Christian Science Monitor sponsored breakfast, said he is ready to embrace Trump on a handful of campaign promises. Those include protecting Social Security and Medicare, negotiating for lower drug prices, raising the minimum wage to $10, imposing tariffs on companies that ship jobs overseas, and re-regulating Wall Street by re-establishing Glass-Steagall.On these issues, Trump's promises put the President-elect closer to Sanders than to most Republican Party leaders. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for example, would not commit to passing Trump's tariff plan during a Sunday appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union with Jake Tapper,"" saying that the solution is reforming the US tax code, ""not tariffs, not trade wars.""  By embracing Trump's left-leaning stands, Sanders is hoping to make progress on issues of long-standing concern to the Vermont senator. If Trump backs away from these promises and sides with the conventional conservatives who lead the Republican Party in Congress, Sanders believes that Trump will be exposed as a ""fraud.""Sanders has not spoken one-on-one with ClintonSanders, who is promoting his new book, ""Our Revolution: A Future To Believe In,"" during a series of appearances across Washington, is stepping into the leadership vacuum of the Democratic Party.He said it was not productive to look backward, waving off a question about whether he could have defeated Trump if he had won the Democratic nomination with a ""who knows?"" response.Long-running tensions between Sanders and Clinton have not fully cooled. Sanders said he had not spoken directly with Clinton following her loss, but only on conference call with other Senate Democrats.Several Clinton advisers have blamed the primary campaign with Sanders for weakening Clinton's candidacy in the general election, a suggestion Sanders dismissed.""At the end of the day, my candidacy ended up being helpful to her -- if we believe candidates should not be anointed,"" Sanders said. ""I'm happy to say my campaign brought millions of people into the political process, the vast majority of whom ended up voting for Hillary Clinton. I think it played a very positive role.""Sanders said Clinton ""has a very important role to play"" in rebuilding the Democratic Party, noting that she received more votes than Trump.""Does that mean she and I are going to agree on every issue?"" Sanders said. ""Frankly, we are not going to agree on every issue, but her voice is important to be heard.""Sanders vows to hold Trump accountableEven as Sanders offers to work with Trump on the populist components of his economic program, critical differences remain.Sanders is calling on Trump to fire Steve Bannon, the controversial former Breitbart executive who was recently named chief strategist of the Trump White House.Sanders is promising to fight Trump ""tooth and nail"" on climate change, an issue that Trump has dismissed as a ""hoax."" The Vermont senator opposes Trump's tax policy, which would cut taxes for the top 1% of earners by $317,000 per year, according to the Tax Policy Center.And Sanders said it would be ""an outrage"" that would ""completely divide the country"" if Trump were to make good on his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to ""lock up"" Clinton.But on a series of bread-and-butter issues, Sanders said that Trump's campaign spoke to the concerns of the working class and promised to work with the President-elect ""if Mr. Trump was sincere.""Asked by CNN about Trump's call to establish tariffs on companies that relocate jobs overseas, a promise that Trump set forth in his ""Contract with the American Voter,"" Sanders said that Trump was right to stand up to corporations like Carrier and Nabisco that want to outsource jobs and vowed to work with Trump on this issue. ""A tariff may well be one of those options,"" Sanders said.""(Trump) talked about a collapsing middle class in America,"" said Sanders. ""He is right."""

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/chuck-schumer-donald-trump/index.html	"Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer are spoiling for a clash once the President-elect takes office next year and the new Democratic Senate minority leader gets his hands on his caucus after winning election on Wednesday.Schumer had hoped to be directing a Senate majority to implement Hillary Clinton's agenda, but the stunning upset in last week's election means he is the lone hope for Democrats as they resist an unexpected Republican presidency and GOP dominance on Capitol Hill.""Chuck Schumer is going to be the single most influential Democrat in Washington,"" said Jim Manley, a former top aide to retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. ""He is, as leader of the Senate Democratic caucus, the only thing standing between the Trump-Ryan legislative agenda and those who are opposed.""Trump and Schumer -- both flamboyant, media savvy, outspoken, deal-making larger-than-life New York personalities have history. In fact, Schumer is one of the few political figures in Washington who Trump actually knows well, and the billionaire contributed to several of his new rival's election campaigns. Schumer even rode to Trump's defense when he got embroiled in a primary spat earlier this year with Ted Cruz over ""New York values."" Schumer (Brooklyn) and Trump (Queens, then Manhattan), had common cause against the Texas senator.Schumer could never have expected he would be matching wits against Trump in the White House -- but the next stage of their political relationship promises to be one of the most intriguing stories of 2017.Given their common experience in the New York fishbowl, where business and politics mix, both probably have an idea of what makes the other tick. That alone contrasts with the awkward relationship between President Barack Obama and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who lacked a common political language. McConnell would prefer to work with Vice President Joe Biden instead.Skirmishes between Trump and Schumer will also reflect the ironic influence of the elite East Coast haven of New York on top-level politics in Washington -- after an election decided in the industrial heartlands of the Rust Belt.Expect fireworksTrump, with his reality television background, promises to dominate the conversation once he moves to Washington in January.But in Schumer, Democrats also possess a megaphone, and a contrast to the soft-spoken Machiavellian Reid, who was more of an inside player.Schumer's facility with the media led to the Washington cliche that the most dangerous place in the city was between him and a camera, but in recent years he has refashioned his image and spent less time in television green rooms.He's promoted other Democrats from his spot on the party's Senate Democratic leadership team and become a more rounded political figure.""He has become a much more serious legislator and I think Republicans understand that,"" Manley said.Still, Schumer's capacity to drive a sharp political message and sense of shifting political winds will be vital to Democrats as they climb off the canvas.Schumer the politician is known as a schmoozer, who is willing to engage the other side but to also fight tenaciously.Schumer ""has generally worked well with Republicans even though he can be a fierce partisan,"" said Jim Kessler, who was a senior aide to Schumer on Capitol Hill for eight years and now is senior vice president for policy at Third Way.""He has a belief that politics is a rough sport but it can be played fairly and cleanly. If you play the game that way even if you take a shot at him he feels that it is fair and doesn't ruin the relationship,"" Kessler said.If it comes to a knife fight with Trump, Schumer is unlikely to shirk from a confrontation and will marshall his Democrats behind him.""This is a guy -- he wants to win,"" said Jim Battista, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo, New York, where Schumer is a fixture at commencement ceremonies.""It's not much use being the minority leader, if ... he is not winning.""Dealmaking possible?Still, if common ground does emerge in the new Washington, Schumer is likely to explore it.In recent years, he has built relationships with Republicans like Sen John Cornyn of Texas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. And it's likely his interactions with McConnell will not be as publicly acidic as those between Reid and the Republican leader in recent years.The Democratic leader in waiting's first task is to restore equilibrium to his traumatized party. By January, he must chart a strategy for their efforts next year to emerge as a roadblock to Trump and to salvage as much as they can of Obama's legacy by wielding the Senate filibuster.Then, Schumer must steel his party for a tough set of re-election races in the mid-terms in 2018.Fresh from his uncontested election on Wednesday, the product of years of behind-the-scenes maneuvering that speaks to Schumer's political shrewdness, the New York senator vowed to stand firm against Trump but to also seek areas where the next president and Democrats can work together.""When we can agree on issues, then we're going to work with them,"" Schumer said. ""But I've also said to the President-elect on issues where we disagree, you can expect a strong and tough fight.""Possible common ground includes Trump's proposals for a massive infrastructure building program and a plan to censure China for what critics says is currency manipulation.But hopes for cooperation hit a reality check this week, with the appointment to a top White House job of Stephen Bannon, a Trump ally who has links to the white nationalist movement.The move alarmed some Democrats because it appeared to suggest that the Trump administration would embrace some of the darker aspects of the Republican's campaign — but it also energized a party that had spent the days since the election wallowing in grief.""We're going to keep a really careful eye on the president and on him. If they do anything from this day forward -- they've done so much awful from this day back -- and we're going to go after them in terms of bigotry,"" Schumer said.Rebuilding the Democratic brandOne of Schumer's most important duties -- as the effective leader of his party in Washington, will be to repair Democratic links to blue collar and middle class Midwestern voters who defected to Trump.With that in mind, he expanded the Senate Democratic leadership team to include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose populist primary campaign tapped into the sense of economic malaise and anti-establishment fervor exploited by Trump. Schumer's critics have long pointed to his ties to Wall Street finance and big money donors to question his fealty to working class Democratic values.But Kessler said no one in American politics has a better understanding of the economic challenges facing voters.""He has the best intuitive sense of the middle class of any politician I have ever met,"" said Kessler.""He comes from the middle class, he still lives in a middle class area, and he obsesses about them and their well being. If there was ideology called middle class it would be his.""As he reaches out to disaffected Democratic voters, Schumer might be influenced by his own dealings with economically challenged areas of his own state, where he won a thumping 70% of votes in his re-election race.""He's a broadly seen as a Manhattan guy who is working at not appearing so much of a Manhattan guy,"" said Battista, who said Schumer had taken pains to understand the concerns of Western New York, including campaigns to keep the Buffalo Bills from relocating. ""He's somebody who has always seemed to be comfortable sitting down and talking to the Rust Beltier parts of New York."""

Tom Cotton said at the Defense One summit in Washington. Cotton, a former Army infantry officer and veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, was submitted as a potential pick by Vice Presidential-elect Mike Pence who is now leading transition efforts, a source told CNN Tuesday.""NATO is not a charity,"" he said. ""We are in NATO because it's a security alliance that protects our interests.""Trump has not publicly commented on NATO since winning the election, but during the campaign, the President-elect questioned whether the US would come to the defense of an alliance member if that country was not meeting its commitment to defense spending.Only five of the 28 NATO members currently meet the recommended defense spending levels, which is 2% of GDP, though additional countries plan to meet that target in the coming years.Cotton, though, drew a distinction between these financial commitments and the need to come to the defense of any NATO member that comes under attack.""Article V is a treaty commitment. The 2% defense spend is a political commitment. There is a difference,"" Cotton said, referring to the mutual defense clause in the NATO founding treaty.His strong endorsement of the defense alliance followed comments made by President Barack Obama Tuesday, where the President said that Trump had expressed support for NATO. ""I am encouraged by the President-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change,"" Obama said Thursday while appearing alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. Cotton echoed this point in his comments.""Donald Trump has spoken about, about upholding our obligations and our alliances as part of our core interests,"" he said.Cotton also sounded a tough line on Russian and its leader Vladimir Putin.""To improve our relations with Russia, what needs to happen foremost is that Vladimir Putin has to have a new sense of boundaries,"" he said.Asked about whether he might be a candidate to head the Pentagon, Cotton demurred.""President-elect Trump will make these decisions in his own due time,"" he said."
