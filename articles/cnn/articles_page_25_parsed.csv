Since it published, she told Costello, she has received a torrent of abuse on social media. It's a symptom, Nomani insisted, of an increasingly hostile ""liberal honor brigade.""""You know, I felt like this entire election year, we have just silenced so many people,"" Nomani said. ""Even now the idea of speaking out as somebody who voted for Trump is earning me all sorts of lovely labels like 'idiot' and 'f***er' and all these other ideas that I think violate liberal values of free speech and self-determination. So I spoke out because I also believe we have to stand up for the dignity of all people and Trump voters are human beings, too,"" she insisted.At the forefront of her reasons for voting Trump, Nomani said, was her fear of what she dubbed the ""very real and serious threat by extremist Muslims.""""This is a reality that we haven't confronted directly for the sake of political correctness,"" Nomani explained.""If people would hear out the concerns and fears that others have about the issues to refugees and extremists, I think we could find a path that's in the middle. But unfortunately, what happens is that this liberal honor brigade shuts down all conversation, calls you bigot or racist or Islamophobe if you dare to speak your own concerns,"" she added.Asked by Costello what she thought about the fact that Trump's talk of a Muslim ban had made many Muslim-Americans afraid, Nomani replied that the country needed a ""middle path"" in order for true dialogue to take place.""He's indelicate. We got that. But he expresses a truth that people speak,"" Nomani said.""I believe that the left must move to the middle, the right must move to the middle. Then we are going to come up with actually healthy solutions that protect national security as well as human rights"" she added."

""But the American instinct has never been to find isolation in opposite corners. It is to find strength in our common creed, to forge unity from our great diversity, to sustain that strength and unity even when it is hard.""""When the election is over, as we search for ways to come together, to reconnect with one another and with the principles that are more enduring than transitory politics, some of our best examples are the men and women we salute on Veterans Day,"" he added.It was Obama's final Veterans Day at Arlington National Cemetery, where he's laid a wreath and delivered remarks for seven of his eight years in office. (In 2010, he was abroad in South Korea and marked the occasion at the Yongsan Army Garrison in Seoul).He's often remarked that one of the most cherished privileges of the presidency is meeting and interacting with US servicemen and veterans. He's said he'll miss those opportunities when he leaves office in January.But he's also faced criticism from the ranks, who have questioned his strategy to withdraw troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. And his administration confronted a scandal when it was revealed by reporting including that of CNN that Veterans Affairs hospitals were concealing wait times for care.RELATED: VA moves to fire executive who used office for veterans charity for lavish spendingIn Tuesday's election, veterans went overwhelmingly for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, according to exit polls. Sixty-one percent backed the real estate mogul, as opposed to 34% who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton. Veterans represented 13% of the voting population.That's a rightward shift from 2008, when 54% of voters who had served in the US military backed Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee, and 44% backed Obama.On Friday, Trump had no public Veterans Day events scheduled, though his transition team has not yet begun releasing the President-elect's daily schedule in advance.Speaking at Arlington, Obama acknowledged that speeches and wreath-layings were an inadequate way to repay members of the armed forces.""On Veterans Day, we acknowledge humbly that we can never serve our veterans in quite the same way that they served us, but we can try,"" Obama said. ""We can practice kindness. We can pay it forward. We can volunteer. We can serve. We can respect one another. We can always get each other's backs."""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/donald-trump-obamacare-interview/index.html	"But the openness was complicated by a shift in the official positions listed on his website.The comments, made in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, signal less of a policy shift for Trump than a change from the rhetoric that helped win him the presidency just three days ago and could set up a fight with conservatives.Trump told the paper he was reconsidering his stance after Thursday's meeting with Obama, who urged him to protect parts of the law. Trump said he would like to keep the provision forbidding discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and to allow young Americans to remain on their parents' healthcare plans.""Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,"" he said, acknowledging that it was Obama, who met with Trump in the Oval Office for 90 minutes, who encouraged him to reconsider. ""I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that.""Trump reiterated his plan in an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" to ensure individuals with pre-existing conditions continue to have coverage.""Yes, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets,"" Trump said.Trump went on to explain to CBS that he would also try to keep the measure that allows young people to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.Americans are freaking out about losing Obamacare""We're going to very much try to keep that. It adds cost but it's very much something we're going to try to keep,"" Trump said.   When pressed about the time between repealing and replacing Obamacare, Trump assured CBS correspondent Leslie Stahl that the two would happen ""simultaneously."" ""It will be just fine. That's what I do, I do a good job. You know, I know how to do this stuff. We're going to repeal it and replace it. We're not going to have, like, a two-day period, and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced and we'll know. And it will be great health care for much less money,"" Trump said. But the President-elect did not offer a replacement plan.Trump also told the Journal that he would bring the country together and that ""I want a country that loves each other."" But that grace did not extend to any reflection on his coarse rhetoric. When asked about whether his language was inappropriate, Trump said: ""No. I won.""Echoes previous statementsTrump's positions on Friday are not entirely new, as he's previously voiced support for certain parts of Obamacare as a candidate. But the statement, three days after Americans elected him president, is a fresh sign that he may be willing to distance himself from some of his campaign positioning, such as calling for the immediate repeal and replace of Obamacare.And it's a far cry from what Trump uttered during the primary to his boisterous fans at rallies.""Look at the mess, and look at the corruption,"" Trump said at a rally just a day before Election Day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""Real change begins immediately with the repealing and replacing of the disaster known as Obamacare."" Also on Friday, The Washington Post reported that Trump has revised his health care agenda to steer it more in line with Republican Party orthodoxy.The paper said the presidential transition website has been edited to now include allowing health care workers to not perform acts that would violate their religious or moral beliefs and to ""protect innocent human life from conception to natural death.""The paper also said the website omits Trump's call to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from other countries where they are sold at lower prices.Trump has previously voiced support for other provisions of Obamacare.Universal health careAt CNN's town hall in February, Trump said he likes the Obamacare mandate that requires every American to be insured. He went even further in a ""60 Minutes"" interview last year.""Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say,"" he told CBS's Scott Pelley. ""I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.""But in his plan, he says: ""Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.""Pre-existing conditionsAt CNN's GOP debate in February, Trump said he would get rid of Obamacare but maintain the provision that insurers must cover people with pre-existing conditions.""I want to keep pre-existing conditions. I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it,"" he told Dana Bash.His plan, however, offers no defense of those with pre-existing conditions. Instead, he said Obamacare must be repealed ""completely.""Not letting people 'die in the streets'Trump was most emphatic when talking about having the government take care of poor people who are sick.""You cannot let people die on the street, OK? Now, some people would say, 'That's not a very Republican thing to say.' Every time I say this at a rally ... it got a standing ovation,"" he said at a CNN town hall in February. ""The problem is that everybody thinks that you people, as Republicans, hate the concept of taking care of people that are really, really sick and are gonna die. We gotta take care of people that can't take care of themselves.""On the trail, Trump sketched different ways of accomplishing this. He's mentioned making deals with hospitals and ""concepts of Medicare.""But in his plan, he only says that no one should slip through the cracks because they can't afford coverage. While he wants to repeal Obamacare's Medicaid expansion provision, he says it could be accomplished by reviewing ""basic options for Medicaid"" and working with states to ensure health care is provided to those who want it."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/5-reasons-not-to-expect-hillary-clinton-prosecuted/index.html	"But should we really expect to see movement on this front after Trump is inaugurated January 20? For five different reasons, the answer is almost certainly ""no.""The LawTaking the most important point first, there simply isn't sufficient evidence to suggest that former Secretary of State Clinton actually broke the law -- which, for better or worse, does not make it a crime simply to communicate about classified information over an unsecured medium. Nothing on that front has changed since FBI Director James Comey's July statement and subsequent congressional testimony. Although a President Trump could always overrule the FBI -- raising the issue of White House interference -- the fact that the original investigation ended the way it did provides both powerful evidence of the absence of a smoking gun and a potentially insurmountable obstacle for even more prosecution-minded government officials to overcome.Perhaps those who believe Clinton's actions should have been illegal will push Congress to reform the relevant laws -- including the Espionage Act. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has already announced that he plans to continue investigating the issue. But while Congress has an oversight prerogative, it cannot do what the Justice Department can -- initiate criminal prosecutions.  The Justice DepartmentClosely related to the first obstacle is the need for any such prosecution to receive the sign-off of the Justice Department, which, though staffed by political appointees in its upper echelons, is primarily comprised of career government lawyers.Thus, career lawyers played an important voice in recommending against the prosecution of former Bush administration officials for their role in the torture of terrorism suspects early in President Barack Obama's tenure, and similar opposition might also arise from efforts by the new attorney general to pursue a prosecution.There is also important historical precedent for even political appointees in the Justice Department to stand up to the President -- most notably the ""Saturday Night Massacre,"" when the attorney general and his deputy both resigned rather than comply with President Richard Nixon's order that they fire the special prosecutor investigating Watergate.On the trail, Trump has also called for appointment a special prosecutor -- which might allow him to sidestep the career lawyers in the Justice Department's Criminal Division. But such a maneuver is usually reserved for cases in which the Justice Department would have a conflict of interest (including, for example, investigations of current Executive Branch officials as with what happened with President Bill Clinton), which does not seem to be at issue here.The Grand JuryEven if the Justice Department signs off on a prosecution under these circumstances, the Constitution creates a series of significant structural checks on the Executive Branch in such cases, the first of which is the Fifth Amendment's requirement of a grand jury indictment for serious offenses -- such as those Secretary Clinton has been accused of committing.Under federal court rules, the grand jury is comprised of somewhere between 16 and 23 citizens from the district in which the case is being brought (which would likely have to be either the District of Columbia or the Southern District of New York) -- 12 of whom must vote in favor of an indictment for the case to go forward.Of course, the standard the prosecution must meet is relatively modest -- demonstrating only that there is ""probable cause"" to believe that the accused is guilty of the charged offense. But even then, the grand jury serves as an important check on potentially overzealous (or politically motivated) prosecutions. Thus, even if Trump were to overrule the objections of the FBI and the Justice Department, he could not force a grand jury to return an indictment.The Trial CourtThe last legal obstacles to such a prosecution would come from the trial court -- from an independent, life-tenured federal judge who could dismiss any indictment that he found to be legally insufficient, and from a jury of 12 of Clinton's peers, which would have to be unanimous in its belief that she was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict her of a crime.Although it is all but  impossible to fathom a prosecution getting even this far because of the obstacles discussed above, these last two checks are perhaps the most significant -- and the reason why even the most politically motivated government prosecutors would almost certainly balk before bringing such a case. Indeed, federal district judges may have no more important single function than ensuring that criminal cases are brought only when there is sufficient evidence to sustain an indictment -- and the guarantee of criminal trial by jury has long been viewed as one of the most fundamental of all of the Constitution's protections of individual rights.The PrecedentBut whereas the above considerations go to the legal and bureaucratic obstacles to a prosecution of Clinton arising out of her use of a private e-mail server to conduct official State Department business, and why she could not be prosecuted, perhaps the most significant and fundamental reason why a President Trump should not -- and would not -- pursue such a case is because of the ugly precedent it would set.Thanks to the obstacles identified above, any such prosecution would be transparently political, and would thereby set a precedent pursuant to which newly elected presidents might seek to pursue trumped-up charges as a way of silencing their opponents -- or use the specter of such prosecutions as a means of intimidating those who would run against them.But as then-Attorney General (and future Supreme Court Justice) Robert Jackson warned in a celebrated 1940 address, ""It is in this realm -- in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself.""And abuses of prosecutorial power, Jackson warned, not only demean the integrity of the entire criminal justice system, but, even worse, they can beget further abuses -- by future Presidents -- against the very prosecutors who started the vicious cycle.Steve Vladeck is a CNN contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law."	5 reasons not to expect Hillary Clinton to be prosecuted	['Chaffetz', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/mike-pence-vice-president-style/index.html	"The timing of Pence's ascension inside the Trump team -- as Trump and his family turned their focus from the election win to the business of running the nation -- also speaks to the growing relationship between the two running mates. ""President-elect Trump will bring about fundamental change in Washington, and these are the right people to make that happen,"" Pence said in a statement Friday.A senior Trump adviser said Friday that the decision to replace New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with Pence was made in part because of the possible federal indictment over Bridgegate and also loyalty -- Pence stuck by Trump after the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape surfaced.Pence's bona fides among Washington Republicans were re-affirmed this week after Tuesday's victory, with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell praising him and opening their doors to him. And he is expected to have a role in any Trump legislative push, including repealing Obamacare. The former congressman toured his old stomping grounds Thursday with Trump, walking out on the speaker's balcony facing the National Mall while Ryan showed the growing inaugural setup for Trump.Pence did not take any questions from reporters as he left the Capitol, and his staff say they are still digesting Tuesday's stunning victory.The role Pence will play inside the Trump White House is at the front of many people's minds right now.""He will be him, that's the way he's always been, but I think you're going to see the because of the experience that he brings or will bring to the role -- he experience on the Hill the policy side, the relationships with leadership and with members in both chambers, I think you'll see him play a large role in that,"" said one Pence aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk openly about internal discussions. Trump and Pence do not have a long relationship, but they speak daily now and have throughout the campaign, and Pence has often said he has grown to respect Trump. At a critical moment in the campaign, after Trump's comments about groping women in a 2005 video came to light, Pence wavered, but ultimately decided to stick by Trump. Asked where Pence ranked among Trump's other top advisers, one Pence aide noted that the incoming vice president already has strong relationships with many of them -- including Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who was Pence's longtime pollster.Pence, meanwhile, joined Trump Thursday on his whirlwind tour of DC. Pence met with Vice President Joe Biden, an old colleague from Congress, and the two talked about their time there and the policy areas Biden handled for the Obama administration.Indeed, the relationships Pence built over 12 years in Congress, while raising his family in Washington, are likely to be called on almost immediately as Republican leaders look to repeal Obamacare -- an item which will require close coordination with congressional Republicans. If you're Pence, ""the Hill is your domain. Think of it in terms of the health care repeal -- who runs point on that on the Hill?"" said a top Indiana Republican, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss likely roles for Pence. Pence has already been invited to the Senate for weekly meetings of Republicans there, and McConnell speculated he may serve as a good sounding board for lawmakers' concerns. ""We all really like Mike Pence. If you've asked any of us who've served with him, everybody likes him,"" McConnell said Wednesday. ""I would just mention the way Vice President (Dick) Cheney worked with us. He was at many of our Tuesday lunches. And you know Dick Cheney was a classic guy who didn't necessarily say anything all the time. But he was like a sponge absorbing what our concerns were. And he acted almost like President (George W.) Bush's Senate liaison.""Vice presidents often have room to craft their own roles based on how they complement the president, but vice presidents in the modern era have often filled roles as advisers based on how they were selected, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a former aide to former Vice President Al Gore. ""It's very possible that Pence becomes a first among equals in the Trump White House,"" said Kamarck.  ""A lot of that is going to depend on whether or not Trump grows to trust him ... In the end, it's really about the relationship between the two people."""	Mike Pence likely to find comfortable role in DC	['Trump', 'Christie', 'McConnell', 'Pence', 'Hill', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]

Keith Ellison of Minnesota is looking to make a run for the influential post, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Although Ellison has not yet officially commented on the speculation, the congressman has already picked up endorsements from prominent colleagues in Congress, including popular liberal Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is expected to be the next Senate minority leader. On Sunday Ellison also won the backing from the current Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.""My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done,"" Reid said in a statement. ""Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith.""The election of the next DNC head -- and what kind of Democrats emerge as the new and younger leaders of the party -- will send an important signal about the direction that the Democratic Party takes in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's shocking defeat to Trump this week.If Ellison is elected DNC chair, he could play a potentially powerful role in advocating for ethnic minority groups, including Muslims, who feel deeply concerned about Trump's past comments about non-whites.Earlier this year, CNN traveled to three growing Muslim communities and spoke to more than 40 Muslim Americans about the election. In these conversations, the community expressed emotions ranging from disbelief to anger to fear.In an extensive interview outside of his district office in Minneapolis, Ellison said at the time that Muslims in his community feared possible backlash and spike in racial discrimination if Trump were to be elected president.""I've had more than one mom say, 'My kids are asking me whether we're going to be deported, whether we're going to be safe.' Teenage girls asking whether they should wear the hijab if they want to,"" Ellison said. ""It's a choice, but they're now getting the message that maybe it's not safe for them to do that.""Like many others that CNN interviewed, Ellison also made a surprising revelation: that he believes things are worse now for Muslim-Americans than they were right after the September 11 terrorist attacks.""I think it's probably harder now,"" he said.Ellison described a gradual easing of tensions and normalization in the 15 years since 9/11. After becoming the first Muslim-American elected to Congress, Ellison said former President George W.
