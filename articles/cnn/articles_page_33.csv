Democratic President Barack Obama, or a like-minded successor, appeared ready to fill the vacancy.The Supreme Court was on the cusp of a historic reversal, and Roberts, the man with a golden resume, who when appointed in 2005 at age 50 was the youngest chief since John Marshall in 1801, seemed to face the greatest challenge of his life in the law. Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a respected moderate liberal and former prosecutor who is chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked Senate action on Garland, insisting that the open seat should be filled not by Obama but by whoever won this election -- a line he drew within an hour of the announcement of Scalia's death.Obama had nearly a year left in his White House term at that moment, and given the tenor of the presidential race most of the year, installing a liberal on the court seemed just a matter of timing.As late as Monday, there was even discussion among Senate Democrats and some Republicans over whether Garland would see a vote in the lame duck Senate before Hillary Clinton had a chance to nominate a more liberal justice.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of four conservatives and four liberals was in a holding pattern, deciding as little as possible and deadlocked on the most contentious issues.Roberts was waiting it out, engaging in modest negotiations, giving up little and watching for the political situation to clarify.Now it is clear that Trump, backed by a still-Republican Senate, will choose the next justices.His first appointee would likely have the same conservative ideology as Scalia and the 5-to-4 polarization that defined the Roberts Court in his first decade is likely to continue.But more than that, if any of the older liberal justices retire, Trump could deepen the conservative cast for years to come.Senior liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. The next most senior justice on the left is 78-year-old Stephen Breyer. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is generally in the conservative camp but joined with liberals to declare a right to gay marriage in 2015 and affirm abortion rights and campus affirmative action earlier this year, is 80.With those ages, as Ginsburg herself has said, the court could experience significant change in the next four years.Justices are appointed for life, and a president's legacy for federal courts at all levels endures long after he leaves office.Roberts's complicated decade on the courtRoberts, 61 and a student of history who considered earning a PhD at Harvard before turning to law school there, knows well the evolution of the Supreme Court he inherited in 2005.Its scaffolding traces back nearly a half century, when liberal groundbreaker Chief Justice Earl Warren retired in 1969 and newly elected Republican President Richard Nixon replaced him with Warren Burger.Then Nixon and a succession of Republican presidents filled most of the vacancies that arose through the years. Of the 16 new justices since 1969, 12 were Republican appointees, four Democratic, not counting William Rehnquist's elevation in 1986 from associate justice to chief. When President George W. Bush named Roberts to the center chair, Roberts had a ready-made majority for the conservatism he had embraced since he was a young lawyer in the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s.Under Roberts' leadership, the court curtailed the protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other racial remedies, allowed more religion inpublic places, and restricted class-action lawsuits against corporate America.His one significant departure from the conservative agenda came when he voted to uphold Obama's Affordable Care Act. Roberts was vilified by some Republicans for endorsing Obamacare, something Trump and other GOP candidates constantly reminded their base in the primaries.That aside, the four liberal justices routinely protested the majority's rightward direction. In 2007, when the conservative bloc rejected school integration policies in Seattle and Louisville, Breyer said, ""It is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much.""More controversial rulings were yet to come.Two that arguably most mark this bench in the public mind are 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which brought more corporate money into political campaigns, and 2013 Shelby County v. Holder, which scaled back voter protections, particularly in regions with a history of race discrimination.As Clinton campaigned across the country against Trump, she and her Democratic supporters vowed to try to roll back those decisions.Tuesday's results instead deeply secure them and likely guarantee Roberts the legacy he sought from the start."

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/post-election-2016-transition-launch/index.html	"In the 73 days between now and the inauguration, Trump will have plenty to do. From 4,000 appointments -- 1,100 of which require Senate confirmation -- to delivering on campaign promises to completing a budget, the previous few months before a president-elect takes office are a whirlwind of activity.  ""We used to kid we didn't know how fast warp speed was, but the transitions were faster than warp speed,"" said Clay Johnson III, who managed the transition for President George W. Bush.While Tuesday night was a time for celebration, Wednesday morning brought the reality into focus for team Trump, led by transition Chairman Chris Christie. If history is a guide, the next two months and change will be a mad dash.The day after his election in 2008, then President-elect Barack Obama held meetings with his team and spent time with family. But the day after, two days after the election, he made his first appointments, naming Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff and David Axelrod as a senior White House adviser. Obama had mostly filled out his top White House staff in less than two weeks, and names of Cabinet officials also began to surface. Less than a month later, the core of his Cabinet -- especially on national security -- was taking shape.The days after the election are a frenzy of meetings, vetting and coordination, all of which the transition tries to keep a tight lid on until they're ready to make names public. What is a transition? Johnson experienced a unique version of transition. In 2000, the election wasn't finalized until a Supreme Court decision in December on the winner of Florida, leaving only about a month for the normal transition period. But he said his experience of getting ""teary-eyed"" out of sheer exhaustion on the way home every night was something that all transition officials he's compared notes with have also felt.  His counterpart in 2008 was Christopher Lu, executive director of the Obama transition and now deputy secretary of labor. Asked to give advice to the 2016 transition chiefs before Election Day, Lu told CNN that banking sleep will be essential. ""I will tell anybody who's planning a presidential transition, as busy as it is now, make sure you get a little bit of sleep because once the day after Election Day comes, it is going to hit you so fast,"" Lu said. ""It's a special moment. It is something that is unique really in all of government. The fact that we've had peaceful transitions for the last 200 years really is what makes our democracy so special -- but trust me, get some sleep now because you won't be getting a lot during the transition time.""While building and vetting a Cabinet and developing policy are primary focuses of the transition, the effort also has to work on preparing that new administration to lead from day one -- no matter what circumstances are thrown at it.An effective transition should run table-top exercises to run through simulated emergencies of a variety of types, from terrorism, to public health, to natural disasters, the hope being that when the first crisis hits the presidency, it won't be the first time principals have gathered into a room to respond.  The transition period is one of the most vulnerable in American democracy. In addition to a new president taking office, only a few hundred of the 4,000 appointed officials are usually in place by August recess, meaning agencies are operating without permanent leadership or brand new leadership.The Trump transition beginsThat's one of the reasons that past transition chiefs and good government experts at the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service have emphasized the importance of starting transitions early. Both Clinton and Trump began thinking about transition last spring and set up their offices in earnest in August. Traditionally, the transition also enjoys some bipartisan support that stands in stark contrast to the pitched partisan fight of the general election. Obama signaled Wednesday he was ready to ensure a smooth handoff to Trump, calling ""the peaceful transition of power ... one of the hallmarks of our democracy."" Obama met with McCain in 2008, and emails hacked from Obama's transition chairman, John Podesta, who now chairs Hillary Clinton's campaign, revealed that McCain's transition's head of personnel wrote Obama's team a few after the election to offer his services and research into top administration positions, according to emails released by WikiLeaks. Partnership for Public Service recommends Trump set an ambitious goal of having roughly 100 appointments confirmed by the Senate shortly after inauguration and 400 to 500 positions by August recess. If the President-elect is to meet that goal, it will require tireless work before January 20. Johnson recalled Bush's first meeting in the West Wing, at 8:30 a.m. on January 22, 2001. The first order of business was getting official nominations out the door to the Senate for confirmation. Johnson swelled with pride as he recounted how the half-hour meeting went exactly according to plan, with all of his team's preparation paying off. ""I said (to the team), 'I guarantee you the President will never have a better meeting, a more productive, on time, matter of fact, boom, boom, boom meeting than he just had with you all in however long he's going to be president,'"" Johnson said. ""It was true. We were so proud. It was just so exciting. It's the launch of the rocket ship. I think the people at NASA will tell you something like 80% of all the energy required to put a satellite in orbit is required to get the rocket about 100 feet off the launchpad. This is the launch, the transition, in the first days and weeks of an administration is that rocket ship."""	Post-election, the hard work begins

""I wish Governor Hassan, her husband Tom, and their children Ben and Meg the very best.""Hassan's victory makes the count for senators that caucus with Democrats 48 seats, short of the majority they were aiming for before Election Day. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois was the only other Democratic pick-up of the night, which saw Republicans retain their control over their conference and Donald Trump win his bid for the presidency. Democrats also won a competitive race in Nevada, where Catherine Cortez Masto held off Republican Rep. Joe Heck to retain the seat being vacated by retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. Those were Democrats' only three victories in a night that saw Republicans win nearly every close race, retaining their House and Senate majorities and guaranteeing the party has full control of Congress when President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in on January 20, 2017. Ayotte's loss comes with Hillary Clinton maintaining a narrow lead of less than 1,500 votes over Trump in the tightly contested battleground state. Hassan's lead was even smaller than that. The loss shows that Republicans who attempted to run away from Trump largely failed to convince voters to split their tickets. Kirk in Illinois said he wrote down David Petraeus for president, but he was easily ousted. Heck had ducked questions about Trump. And Ayotte had said he is no role model and withdrawn her support for the GOP nominee after the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape became public. Clinton, like the Democratic Senate contenders, won all three states.Other Republicans who ran closer to Trump -- including Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt -- each won, aided by Trump's victories in their states. "	Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte concedes to Democrat Maggie Hassan

That's still our view, and you can expect us, with a new president who has the same view, to address that issue,"" McConnell said at a Washington news conference Wednesday. McConnell refused to say whether he would support building a wall along the southern border with Mexico, a signature item of Trump's campaign. McConnell would only say, ""I want to try to achieve border security in way that is most effective,"" when pressed on whether he would support the wall. McConnell also declined to talk about his previous criticism of Trump's comments about Hispanics and the long-term damage he saw that creating for the Republican Party. McConnell, who eked out a series of key victories Tuesday night to maintain control of the Senate, cautioned his Republican colleagues against over-reaching now that they will control the White House and Congress."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/america-new-first-lady/index.html	"Melania Trump, who will become just the second foreign-born first lady in US history, will assume the very public role after having spent much of her husband's presidential campaign avoiding the campaign trail and the limelight, saying she preferred to remain home in New York to care for the couple's only son, who is 10. She will succeed First Lady Michelle Obama, who has taken on a very public and active role in advocating for health and wellness issues.Trump delivered only a handful of speeches as her husband bounded from one unlikely phase of his campaign to the next. But she did lay out in broad terms what her priorities would be as first lady in the final week of the campaign -- and to accomplish at least one of those, she may have to begin in the West Wing.That's because Trump said in a speech last week outlining the priorities she would bring to the East Wing that in addition to ""helping children and women,"" she said combatting cyber bullying will be ""one of the main focuses"" of her work as first lady.While Donald Trump has repeatedly mocked his opponents on Twitter over their looks and intelligence, Melania Trump vowed to combat meanness on the Internet, saying ""our culture has gotten too mean and too tough,"" particularly as others are mocked over their ""looks or intelligence.""""It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is terrible when it happens on the playground, and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet. We have to find a better way to talk to each other,"" Melania Trump said, delivering a rare speech in Pennsylvania last week. ""We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media.""But while her agenda as first lady may be tinged with irony, Melania Trump has in many ways been a balancing force for her husband -- chiding him in private when his temper flared and he lashed out on Twitter at his political opponents and urging him to be more ""presidential"" in their private conversations.RELATED: How Donald Trump wonShe has also served as a symbolic counterweight to her husband's hardline rhetoric on immigration. While the Slovenian-born former model has said she agrees with her husband's immigration proposals, Donald Trump and his supporters have frequently touted Melania Trump's status as an immigrant to push back on attacks that Trump is anti-immigrant.Melania Trump has said becoming a naturalized US citizen in 2006 has been ""the greatest privilege in the world."" She will become the second foreign-born first lady, 192 years after England-born Louisa Adams became first lady.But her immigration history also risked becoming a liability during the campaign amid reports that she may have worked as a model in the United States before obtaining the proper paperwork to work legally in the US. She and her attorney have insisted she followed all appropriate laws.Before her speech last week, Melania Trump delivered only one major speech in the campaign -- at the Republican National Convention before her husband accepted the Republican presidential nomination.While initially well-received, the speech was ultimately tarnished by controversy after it came to light that parts of the speech were lifted from Michelle Obama's speech to the 2008 Democratic National Convention."

So much so that at one recent rally, Trump told his supporters: ""We are going to do something so special. It will be so special. It will be an amazing day. It will be called Brexit plus plus plus.""The same people that didn't expect the Brexit vote scoffed. Today, both Farage and Trump will feel vindicated.70 years ago, Winston Churchill, in his famous ""Iron Curtain"" speech, forged a new phrase, casting the relationship between UK and US as a ""Special Relationship"".Trump and Farage 'kindred spirits'After the Brexit vote, Trump and Farage saw a different kind of transatlantic synergy -- one where both men's political message could feed off the other.Appearing at a at Presidential rally with Trump, Farage told the Republican crowds exactly what he told the British before Brexit: ""remember anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to standup against the establishment"".Trump and Farage are kindred spirits. Both men have galvanized a groundswell of anti-establishment sentiment and turned it into era-defining change.They have spoken to those who feel that a liberal elite has left them marginalized. In the UK, Farage was for a decade a fringe voice that few in the mainstream took seriously. His UK Independence Party (UKIP) always looked fractured and fragile. Most thought he'd never be more than an ""also ran"".Trump was also underestimated; Farage's success could have only given him hope. With the UKIP leader by his side, he told a rally that ""soon they will be calling me Mr Brexit"".Campaigning together, Farage gave Trump yet more ammunition for his campaign, telling his supporters how Obama had come to the UK two months before the Brexit vote, urging Brits to vote against Farage: ""he talked down to us, he treated us as if we were nothing"".Both leaders had message of 'fear'For both men the message that resonated was one of fear, of immigrants, of the political elite, of experts, of being left behind in an unfamiliar post-industrial world where brawn counts less than brains and anyone's job can be outsourced.Both men cajoled and corralled the electorate with half-truths and flat out lies. In victory, Farage was fast to say that one of the biggest Brexit campaign slogans, a £350 million a week rebate from the EU once the UK left, was untrue.Churchill's ""Special Relationship"" with the US was to bring the two countries closer together, making Europe and the US safer in an uncertain cold war era.Neither Trump, nor Farage -- who has stepped out of UK politics now -- have a fraction of Churchill's political experience. The world however is once again entering uncharted territory, with threats and uncertainty piling up. It's a big ask of anyone."	Trump predicted 'Brexit plus plus plus,' and he was right
7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-campaign-promises/index.html	"Below are some of Trump's signature proposals supporters expect him to deliver on when he takes office in January.The wallWithout question, Trump's central campaign plank was his pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump made immigration a top focal point from the moment he launched his White House bid in June of 2015, when he controversially claimed that Mexico was sending ""rapists"" and ""criminals"" across the border. The wall, which Trump has promised will be ""beautiful,"" was the centerpiece of his immigration policy. He insisted that Mexico would pay for its construction, although he didn't broach the subject when he met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in August. Many Democratic and more moderate voters have voiced opposition to the wall, but the proposal is wildly popular among Trump's backers. Seventy-nine percent of his supporters said they favor building a wall along the entire US-Mexico border, according to the Pew Research Center.'Lock her up'The chants began during the Republican National Convention. Soon, ""lock her up"" became a ritual at each of Trump's rallies. And at the second presidential debate, Trump told Hillary Clinton that, were he to win, he would ""instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your (missing email) situation.""  Clinton responded by saying it's ""just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."" Trump shot back: ""Because you'd be in jail."" Many political observers on the left and the right were troubled by Trump's comment, but his supporters ate it up. FBI Director James Comey said over the weekend that Clinton should not face criminal charges over a review of emails linked to her time as secretary of state, reaffirming the agency's findings over the summer. But Trump's vow to revisit the matter became a main theme of his closing argument, and one not likely to be forgotten by his supporters.Muslim banAlmost a year ago, following the massacre in San Bernardino, California, Trump issued perhaps his most dramatic proposal: ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on."" The proposal has morphed in the 11 months since then, making it difficult to identify Trump's exact position on the matter. He eventually said the ban applied to immigration ""from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism,"" though his original pledge remains outlined on his campaign website. Just last month, Trump's running mate Mike Pence, who called the original proposal ""offensive and unconstitutional,"" said that Trump no longer supports an outright ban on Muslims entering the US. But Republicans seem to believe Trump had it right the first time. Exit poll data from earlier this year found wide majorities of GOP primary voters in support of a temporary ban against Muslims from entering the country.Repeal ObamacareRepublicans have been trying to repeal President Obama's signature health care law pretty much from the moment it was signed in 2010. Now the GOP will finally have someone in the White House to finish the job. Trump has hammered the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, calling it a ""disaster"" and vowing to replace it with ""the finest health care plan there is."" The law has had its share of setbacks, the most recent of which was the announcement that premiums are set to skyrocket in 2017.  The prospect of undoing Obamacare will excite even the Republicans who were lukewarm toward Trump's candidacy. House Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that, despite his misgivings with Trump, he nevertheless voted for the GOP nominee in part because of the opportunity to get rid of the health care law. Trump is now armed with a Republican House and Senate eager to repeal, though that would entail kicking up to 20 million people off health insurance.Unravel NAFTA and TPPTrump's improbable win on Tuesday was driven in large part by his triumph in the Rust Belt, with states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania going to the GOP for the first time since the 1980s, and Trump leading in a third, Michigan. He inspired voters there with a populist message on free trade, promising to return their communities to the golden years by scrapping what he described as horrible deals for workers.The two deals in question, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), gave Trump an opening with Rust Belt voters  -- and proved to be a political weak spot for Clinton. She came out against TPP, which is opposed by many Democrats, after previously describing the measure as a ""gold standard"" -- a shift for which Trump took credit. And Clinton's position on NAFTA, which was signed into law by her husband former President Bill Clinton, was difficult to pin down. In contrast, Trump has been resolute in his opposition to both. He has vowed to renegotiate the terms of NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, leaving open the possibility of pulling out entirely, and has said he will not approve TPP as president."

As many as 5,000 people were at a protest in New York, police estimated. Among the issues being yelled about outside Trump Tower were immigration and other controversial topics from the campaign.""I came out here to let go of a lot of fear that was sparked as soon as I saw the results,"" protester Nick Powers said. He said he feared Trump will support stronger stop-and-frisk policies that would put many people in prison. He was worried that Trump's victory would embolden sexist views. Many of the protests were in cities with large Democratic bases -- in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Boston; Chicago; Denver; Philadelphia; Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, Seattle and Washington. In Chicago, people walked down a normally busy Lake Shore Drive carrying signs. Many headed to Upper Wacker Drive, where a crowd was growing near the Trump Tower. CNN's Ryan Young estimated the throng at a few thousand people covering the street for half a mile. Many were using a vulgar chant aimed at the President-elect. One college student showed CNN a sign that said, ""I still can't believe I have to protest for civil rights.""""It's been really frustrating, because as a nation we thought we had come so far but it seems like we're taking many steps back,"" another woman said, ""so we want to come together to change that and make sure we keep going forward.""In Portland, marchers chanted ""No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA"" as they trekked through downtown. Protesters in D.C., who headed to the Trump International Hotel, shouted the same slogan. After an earlier solemn gathering at the White House a few dozen young people remained, their cries profane.Hundred of mostly young Latino protesters marched on Los Angeles City Hall Wednesday night. As the protest grew throughout the night, protesters set on fire a piñata depicting the head of President-elect.They chanted ""I will not live in fear,"" ""Fight back, stand up"" and ""¡Si se puede!"" (Spanish for ""It can be done"").Several protesters said they feared that family or friends might be deported once Donald Trump is sworn into office.In Austin, protesters blocked a highway Wednesday afternoon.  Students burned a flag on the campus of American University in Washington, and they walked out of class in high schools and colleges across the country the day after the Presidential election. In downtown Los Angeles, high school students crowded the steps of City Hall on Wednesday afternoon.  Protester Brooklyn White was holding a sign that said ""Hate won't win.""  The 18-year-old voted for Hillary Clinton and was disappointed.  ""We can't let it stop us. If he's the President then fine, but if  Donald Trump is gonna be it then he has to listen,"" she said. At Berkeley High School in California, about 1,500 students walked out of classes Wednesday morning. In Des Moines, Iowa it was hundred of high school students who left class to protest of election results.  In Phoenix, about 200 students from Carl Hayden High School marched to the state Capitol in protest.  Earlier Wednesday, trash fires burned on an Oakland, California, highway as an illuminated sign in the nation's capital proclaimed that the United States was ""better than bigotry."" The Oakland Police Department said as many as 6,000 demonstrators had marched in the streets by Wednesday night.""People are furious not just at the results of the election, but the rhetoric of Donald Trump,"" Ahmed Kanna, an organizer for Social Alternative Berkeley, told CNN's Don Lemon.White House candlelight vigilA candlelight vigil for Clinton supporters in front of the White House on Wednesday evening drew those who wanted to mourn their election loss.The peaceful crowd called out ""you are not alone"" to over 2,600 people watching the gathering on Facebook, organizers said.  Maybelline McCoy, an immigrant from Panama, came to the vigil with her three children.  ""My biggest fear is that they will be limited, that they will see people being silenced and invalidated and that I won't be able to shield them,"" she said. Protests after the vote countIn the wee hours of Wednesday morning after the votes were counted, one member of the crowd near the White House held an upside-down American flag, alongside the LGBT rainbow flag, in silent protest.Brian Barto, a protester who had remained at the White House after most dispersed, told CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington that he was ""destroyed, honestly distraught."" ""Everything that has been built up has been destroyed. ... America has failed (minorities).""Latasha Wilson said she was scared about the next four years. ""He doesn't respect women, Black Lives Matter, Latinos. He's a racist. ... There are multiple things that add up,"" she said of the President-elect.Supporters celebrateOthers went to the White House late Tuesday and early Wednesday to show their support for Trump. Nicholas Elliot, a student at Washington's Georgetown University, said he was elated about Trump's election. ""I feel pretty good, a year and a half process has ended and it ended my way,"" the Texan told WJLA. He said he thought it was ""definitely the responsibility of both parties"" to unite the country. Referencing the United Kingdom's Brexit vote to leave the European Union, which ""translated strongly here,"" he said he had no fear his candidate would lose. ""There is a hidden vote,"" he said, contending people didn't voice their true voting intentions to pollsters in case they were perceived as sexist, racist or homophobic. In New York on Wednesday morning, groups of Trump supporters cheered his victory outside Trump Tower.  Pop star Lady Gaga, a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter who had performed at the Democratic candidate's final rally in North Carolina, stood atop a sanitation truck outside Trump Tower in New York, brandishing a sign that read: ""Love trumps hate."" Images and footage shared on social media showed dumpster fires on what was described as a stretch of Broadway, from 14th to 20th streets in the city. At the University of Louisville in Kentucky, the base of a large-scale bronze cast of Rodin's ""The Thinker"" was spray-painted with the message: Trump #BuildThatWall.""
