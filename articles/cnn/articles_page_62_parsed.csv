The key for Clinton is to boost turnout in Philadelphia, especially among African-American voters, and in city's surrounding suburbs.Clinton will also campaign in Pittsburgh on Friday and Philadelphia on Saturday night.Tim Kaine, Clinton's vice presidential nominee, will be campaigning elsewhere, the aide said.The aide said the Monday night event would not necessarily be Clinton's final event, but it is unlikely that Clinton will hold a rally on Election Day.Clinton has relied on top Democratic surrogates to turn out voters in swing states across the country. On Thursday, for example, Clinton will campaign in North Carolina, while the President campaigns in Florida, Bill Clinton rallies voters in Michigan and Nevada, Bernie Sanders speaks in Ohio and Chelsea Clinton headlines events in Wisconsin.

Not only does he need to dominate the swing states, but he needs to edge into blue territory.By many indications, Trump's campaign is looking for a Republican victory in Michigan. And the people of Macomb County, Michigan, could make or break that dream.This largely white county outside of Detroit has been pretty evenly divided in previous elections, although it swung for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and backed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Now Trump's goal is to nip that more recent Democratic trend in the bud. He needs to turn out the Republican voters from suburbs like Macomb County and hope Democratic strongholds like Detroit stay at home.Early on, Trump signaled he would make a real play for the Rust Belt, working to appeal to the white working-class people the post-industrial economy has devastated. But to look at the polls in Michigan, that's been a tough sell.Members of Trump's campaign have pointed to Bernie Sanders' stunning victory in this state over Hillary Clinton as an indication the GOP can pull out an upset despite polling pointing otherwise.Another thing to keep in mind: There is no early voting without an excuse here, so Trump and Clinton have until Election Day to make their pitches to voters.It remains an open question whether the FBI's last-minute bombshell turned off Clinton voters, but if data from Google Trends are any indication, it's not the most pressing question voters have.PopulationEconomyThe pendulum swingsRepresentationPopularityTop searchesWho's searching?TrendingSearches by candidate	Critical counties: Macomb County is Donald Trump's Michigan moonshot	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

""Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.""Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen this week called on Comey to resign, but declined on CNN to say Comey's actions were politically motivated.

Four members of Afghan special forces were also killed and six others injured, Danish said. Twenty-six insurgents were killed and 10 others were wounded, he added.US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said he was saddened by the casualties.

Trump, however, has continued to campaign there. In a Quinnipiac University poll released October 17, Clinton had an edge over Trump with 45% to 37% among likely voters, with Johnson at 10% and Stein with 3% support. The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.In Colorado's Senate race, Democratic candidate Michael Bennet is leading Republican candidate Darryl Glenn by eight percentage points -- 48% to 40%.

They also weighed opposition to changing the vacate-the-chair resolution, which gives members a chance to effectively vote no-confidence in the House speaker. Another topic discussed: having one of their own serve on House Speaker Paul Ryan's leadership team. Whether Ryan is open to any of these potential changes remains to be seen. But the proposals will be part of the post-election talks that begin next week, as Ryan looks to shore up support within the conference ahead of leadership elections.  Meadows detailed the deliberations that took place at his residence during an appearance Thursday on CNN's ""New Day."" ""It was a private meeting, so I don't want to comment too much on that,"" he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""I can tell you that the real focus of that particular meeting was really looking about trying to be prepared for a Trump administration as we go forward.""Meadows said the group was enthusiastic about Donald Trump's call for congressional term-limits -- ""you know, this whole drain the swamp idea that Trump has talked about"" -- and that they hoped to be prepared to ""hit the ground running"" under a potential Trump presidency.""The North Carolina Republican also downplayed speculation about the group's discussion of Ryan and whether they would oppose him in the Republican conference's upcoming leadership elections.  ""You know, there really wasn't any focus on leadership elections. We tried to keep our focus primarily on how we can best legislate during the lame-duck session and be prepared for a new Congress,"" he said.""Is it true that the Freedom Caucus is looking for more of a voice and looking for more leadership roles?"" Camerota asked.""Well, I mean, it is true that we are, obviously, looking to try to make sure that we can best represent our constituents,"" Meadows said. ""But again, that was not the main focus. It was trying to focus on some of those legislative matters that we believe are important to the American people.""Meadows was also asked what House Republicans and Freedom Caucus members would prioritize if Hillary Clinton were elected president. He said that ""I still think term limits will be a great thing"" if Clinton wins, but added that ""I don't think that's going to happen."""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/north-carolina-clinton-trump-2016/index.html	"Clinton has held a small but persistent lead in the state in recent weeks. A Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday showed Clinton ahead, 48% to Trump's 46%. It's made North Carolina's 15 electoral votes Democrats' best chances of winning a state Mitt Romney carried -- albeit by just 2 percentage points -- in 2012. And for Trump, whose path to 270 electoral votes is already precarious, North Carolina is essentially a must-win -- a test of whether he can turn out working-class white voters and survive organizational and TV ad spending disadvantages to the Clinton campaign. The races that could flip the SenateIf Trump can't do it in North Carolina, he has little shot of remaining within striking distance of Clinton and pulling off the same feat in some combination of states like Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- all even more difficult to win. Here's why North Carolina matters so much -- and what to watch there in the days ahead:By the numbers: Why Trump has to have itEvery Trump path to 270 electoral votes starts with one reality: There are four battleground states he simply cannot afford to lose.  ""Our path to victory is through Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Iowa. And we believe 100% that we're winning all four of those. And once we do that, then we put ourselves in a position to win one of those other swing states,"" Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie said this week.North Carolina is the only one of those four that Romney won in 2012 -- yet it's also the one where Clinton's poll numbers are the best in 2016. Say Clinton wins North Carolina. Trump could win every other Romney state -- plus Florida, Ohio and Iowa -- and that still only puts him at 244 electoral votes. He's competitive elsewhere -- in states like Nevada, Colorado in New Hampshire. He's bet big on Pennsylvania, and made a late push in Wisconsin. But none of those states alone would get him to 270 without North Carolina -- and in most cases, even a combination of two of them wouldn't get him there. There's also the reality that Clinton outperforms Trump in most other battleground states by more than she does in North Carolina. If he loses North Carolina, it likely means he's already lost the election. African-American turnoutOne trend that has alarmed Democrats is a dip in African-American turnout across the country -- particularly in states like North Carolina, Georgia and Florida -- compared to the 2008 and 2012 elections. A surge in Latino voters has helped make up for it in some states, particularly in the West. But polls show the demography of the electorate is crucial: The more ethnically diverse a state's voters are, the better it is for Clinton; the whiter the state's electorate, the better for Trump. Clinton is leaning on President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama to make the case to their African-American supporters that 2016 is just as important as the last two elections -- particularly in North Carolina, a state that had been reliably Republican before Obama carried it in 2008 and nearly repeated the feat in 2012. ""If the African-American vote is strong in North Carolina, then you will decide this election,"" Obama said in an interview with North Carolina-based WQMG radio on Thursday, adding that Clinton will win if the state's black turnout matches its 2012 numbers. ""Your vote from '08 and '12 will be negated if you don't vote this time out. This is what seals the deal,"" Obama said. ""Show the country and the world this isn't just about me and my campaign or Michelle, but it's about a community that is empowered and wants its voice heard.""Obama also raised the stakes Wednesday during a campaign stop on Clinton's behalf in North Carolina, saying: ""I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders. The fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.""Voter purge lawsuitThe backdrop for North Carolina's 2016 election is a lawsuit that voting rights advocates filed this week alleging that at least three counties have purged their voter rolls of a disproportionate number of African-American voters. NAACP files suit in North Carolina on voting registration purgeThe NAACP filed the lawsuit, arguing that boards of elections in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties have canceled thousands of voter registrations after a small number of individuals challenged the registration of approximately 4,500 voters based ""exclusively on mass mailings that were returned as undeliverable.""They argue the ""en masse"" cancellation was done in violation of the National Voter Registration Act that prohibits systemic voter removal programs within 90 days of a federal election.On Wednesday, US District Judge Loretta Biggs said North Carolina's process of removing voters sounds ""insane"" and ""like something that was put together in 1901."" But she has not yet ruled, with just days until the election.Early voting In 2012, 61% of North Carolina voters cast their ballots before Election Day -- a number expected to rise this year.So far, early voting numbers, based on a breakdown of the party registration of those who have voted already, show Democrats have reason for worry. African-Americans made up 28% of the state's early voters at this point in 2012 -- but are just 22.7% so far this year, according to data from CNN's partner Catalist. White voters, meanwhile, make up 73% of the state's electorate to date, compared to 67% at this point four years ago. Overall, though, Democrats still have a lead of 243,000 ballots cast so far in the early vote.  But that's off their 2012 pace -- when Democrats led at this point by 307,000 votes, and still lost the state to Romney. Surrogates aboundPerhaps the best evidence of North Carolina's importance is how much attention each campaign's top surrogates are paying it. Ivanka Trump was in the state Wednesday for an event. Clinton's campaign has sent the Democratic nominee herself, husband Bill Clinton and the Obamas there. It's also where Hillary Clinton held her first joint event with Michelle Obama of the 2016 campaign. The candidates are putting a particular emphasis on targeting millennials and North Carolina's swelling ranks of college graduates. President Obama's event Wednesday was at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The joint Hillary Clinton-Michelle Obama event was held at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem.

""We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.""The Republican nominee criticism of Obama comes just five days from the election and as Obama, who enjoys 55% approval rating, has spent more time on the campaign trail to boost his would-be Democratic successor.""He's down here campaigning for Crooked Hillary. Now, why isn't he back in the office -- sometimes referred to as the Oval Office -- why isn't he back in the white house bringing our jobs back and helping our veterans? Why? Why isn't he back working?"" Trump said Thursday.Even as Trump continued to raise and exaggerate the scope of the FBI's inquiries, the Republican nominee also questioned whether ""justice"" would be done.""Just remember, the system is rigged,"" Trump said as he raised disagreements between FBI and Justice Department officials, including over the decision to announce the review of new emails potentially linked to the Clinton email server investigation.The real estate mogul capped off his rally here by polling the crowd as to whether the FBI's latest email review would result in action being taken against Clinton.""Will justice be done, yes or no?"" Trump said, drawing a mixed reaction from the crowd.""We're going to have to see,"" he replied. ""Who knows, we're going to see.""

""The guy does deserve a bullet. I mean, these aren't good people. These are horrible people. In fact, I commend my father.

Duke requested CNN call him back in an hour, saying, ""I have to think about it.""A comment request to Eric Trump and the Trump campaign was not immediately returned. Duke, who is running for US Senate in Louisiana, has, like many other white nationalists, been a vocal supporter of Donald Trump during the 2016 election. Duke, a heavy underdog in that race, reaffirmed his support for Trump during a debate with his opponents on Wednesday night. Donald Trump caused a controversy during the Republican primary by initially saying that he did not know anything about David Duke when asked about Duke's support for his candidacy, but has since disavowed the former KKK grand wizard.Protest marks former KKK leader David Duke debate appearanceIn Thursday's interview, Eric Trump said that attempts to tie his father to Duke were meant to distract from the power of Trump's movement.""A guy like David Duke is disgusting,"" he said.

At one point, while touting his accomplishments in office, Obama remarked on the low gas prices he noticed while driving in North Carolina Wednesday, and shouted to the crowd, ""Thanks, Obama,"" a nod to a viral meme of the President that began as a Republican critique. Obama also employed one of his most used catch phrases ""come on, man!"" multiple times in his speech in the Sunshine State to address what he called Washington's ""gridlock,"" again pointing to GOP obstruction on making improvements to Obamacare.
