Flynn, shared stories alleging top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin had a connection to the Muslim Brotherhood, pushed a conspiracy theory that Sen. Marco Rubio was a closeted homosexual who abused cocaine, and repeatedly used expletives to attack Trump's political opponents. The retired general has been offered the role of national security advisor, a transition official told CNN Thursday. The younger Flynn serves as his father's chief of staff and top aide, attending events alongside his father and working for his father's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group. The elder Flynn credited his son with editing his book and frequently tags his son in tweets. In a photo on Facebook, the younger Flynn can be seen walking with Trump backstage.A request for comment sent to Flynn and his son, as well as a spokesperson, was not returned. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign also did not return a request for comment. The younger Flynn, whose Twitter and Facebook are largely dedicated to supporting Trump, has occasionally shared racially insensitive sentiments.In a tweet from January of this year, Flynn responded to a Vox story on Twitter about whites-only dating sites, writing, ""@voxdotcom soooo African Americans can have B.E.T. but whites can't have their own dating site? Hmmm..."" (The tweet was deleted after CNN contacted Flynn for comment.)After the 2012 election, Flynn tweeted that minorities only voted for President Barack Obama because of his skin color.""Unfortunately, only reason minorities voted for BO is the color of his skin and NOT for the issues....#Election2012,"" Flynn wrote. (The tweet was deleted after CNN contacted Flynn for comment.)Flynn frequently shares unfounded conspiracy theories, like ones claiming Hillary Clinton and President Obama would be tried for treason if Trump is elected. He also posted a unfounded story claiming hackers would release a video of former President Bill Clinton raping a teenage girl.  In one post, he called alt-right social commentator Mike Cernovich, who frequently shares unfounded news stories, ""a source I trust.""In a Facebook post from October, Flynn shared a fake news story claiming Obama flaunted an erection to female reporters in 2008.Flynn tweeted multiple times unfounded claims about Sen. Marco Rubio's ""coke house, gayish dance troupe, and foam parties."" These tweets included a baseless article about Rubio being a homosexual who lived in a drug house and went to ""foam parties"" where ""mutual masturbation is an occasional component, generally beneath the cover of foam."" On Twitter, the younger Flynn frequently re-tweets Paul Watson, editor for the conspiracy website InfoWars, sometimes using the hashtag ""#infowars"" himself. His Facebook and Twitter picture are him in an InfoWars t-shirt. In one tweet, Flynn retweeted Watson sharing a video of a woman crying saying ""I need an ambulance"" because Trump was elected. Watson commented he thought it ""might be the best thing ever."" Flynn is also a frequent retweeter of members of the so-called alt-right, retweeting links to videos that discuss whether Clinton campaign chair John Podesta had a ""torture chamber"" and videos claiming Huma Abedin has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi terrorists. He has used the word ""cuck"" — a shorthand slur for cuck-conservative which combines the word cuckold and conservative — a number of times on social media. Flynn also regularly labels Hillary Clinton, Saturday Night Live, CNN, Sen. Bernie Sanders, President Obama, and others as communists. He labeled Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg socialists in a Facebook post, saying they promote anti-Trump  and pro-Hillary views. In another post on Facebook, he called Gloria Allred, an attorney for many of the women who accused Trump of sexual assault, ""a commie"" who was trying to ""get the heat off the witch."""

The truly deplorable ones end up in the Cabinet,"" said Dingell, who served in the House longer than any other representative in history, making reference to a statement Hillary Clinton made during the presidential race calling some Trump supporters a ""basket of deplorables."" Dingell's wife Debbie now serves in his former House seat. Trump has already selected candidates for several key administration and Cabinet positions, including Breitbart's Steve Bannon as chief strategist and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, both seen as contentious appointments and ushering in critics from both sides of the aisle. Trump can simply hire Bannon, but as a member of his cabinet, Sessions will need to be approved by the Senate. In the 1980s, before he was a senator, Sessions failed to achieve Senate confirmation to the federal bench after a former colleague accused him of making racist remarks.RELATED: Trump's transition rollercoaster rideOne of the first sitting lawmakers to endorse Trump, Sessions has been haunted by old allegations of racism. Some, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, say Bannon's alt-right publication Breitbart is linked to white nationalist groups.

This election can be well understood as the revenge of flyover country.""  Cruz was particularly critical of Hillary Clinton's campaign.""I think the Clinton campaign found themselves utterly flabbergasted. They had not even contemplated the possibility that they might not prevail. And that, I think, is the direct result of not listening to and not hearing the American people.""Trump's transition rollercoaster rideAt the National Lawyer Convention, an annual event hosted by the Federalist Society, Cruz also praised President-elect Donald Trump's pick of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general.""He is a committed and deeply principled conservative,"" Cruz told the crowd before warning conservatives about the responsibilities of governing.  ""When you're given control of the executive and the legislature, it's time to put up or shut up. There are no excuses. We've got to deliver.

Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate in the general election, are promoting a bill in the Senate Thursday that calls on US government agencies to report anti-Semitic activity more thoroughly and for the State Department to share more widely any new information on how the US and Europe are addressing the needs of the continent's Jewish community.""I am alarmed by the steady increase in anti-Semitism we're witnessing in America and Europe. We must be vigilant in reporting any incidents of anti-Semitism to ensure the safety, security and inalienable rights of Jewish communities,"" Kaine said in a statement. ""This legislation will help the State Department and Europeans work together to combat anti-Semitism and protect religious freedom for Jews and society at large.""It is some of the first legislative activity in the latest phase of their Senate careers: Rubio was just re-elected to the Senate and Kaine just indicated Thursday that he plans to run for re-election and not try to leave the body for a 2020 presidential campaign.Jews are leaving places like France in record numbers and landing in places such as Israel in part due to recent attacks on Jewish sites in countries like Belgium and Denmark.Fears of anti-Semitism have also spiked in the US during the 2016 campaign and Trump's election. A number of journalists have reported receiving anti-Semitic tweets and mailings from Trump supporters, and some Jewish groups have been dismayed by the elevation of Steve Bannon, a top Trump aide who is allied with the alt-right movement."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/obama-europe-germany-trump/index.html	"Thursday, as he stood on the opposite end of the park inside the German chancellery, the mood was darker. The man replacing him is readying plans to build a physical wall on the US border. A wash of populist nationalism has dampened prospects of steady cooperation.Bidding farewell in the same city he proclaimed his ""hope and change"" vision loudest, Obama instead warned of a dimmer change encroaching. ""There are going to be forces that argue for cynicism, for looking the other way with somebody else's problems, that are not going to champion people who are vulnerable because sometimes that's politically convenient,"" he said. ""If we don't have a strong transatlantic alliance that's standing up for those things, we will be giving to our children a worse world. We will go backwards instead of forwards.""The forces he described spreading across nations — cynical, uncaring, politically craven shadows — mirror almost exactly his pre-election descriptions of Donald Trump, views he says haven't changed in the days since he met with the President-elect in the Oval Office.As he departed Europe Friday underneath a persistent cold drizzle, Obama left behind few firm assurances that the continent's greatest fears aren't well-founded.""The voice that helps to steer the world away from war, wherever possible, that's our voice more often than not,"" Obama said during his final remarks in Europe as President. ""And we're not always successful but if that voice is absent or if that voice is divided, we will be living in a meaner, harsher, more troubled world.""On Friday, Obama met with his closest western allies and found a collection of counterparts in varying stages of political strife. France's Francois Hollande is suffering record-low approval ratings as he gears up for a re-election bid. Italy's Matteo Renzi has vowed to leave government if his proposed constitutional reforms fail next month. Britain's Theresa May has her attention squarely on how to remove her country from the European Union without prompting a financial disaster. Even Angela Merkel, the German chancellor upon whom Obama piled praise, will face a challenge from the right if she decides to run for a fourth term. Obama left little doubt where he stood on her reelection prospects Thursday, saying he'd vote for her if he could.Merkel, in her fashion, offered a tightly constrained view of the road ahead. She said she approached Trump's presidency with an ""open mind,"" leaving the unknown details about the future of the relationship unsaid.In a readout of his meeting, the White House said Obama and fellow leaders agreed to continue sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and urged them to continue intelligence sharing programs to counter extremism.He also reaffirmed, yet again, his commitment to democratic values ""at a moment of great change,"" urging the leaders ""to continue seeking solutions to common challenges with the incoming US administration on the basis of the core values that define the United States and Europe as open democracies.""Obama planned his final stops in Europe as a valedictory return after a rancid political campaign, meant to cement his legacy here while assuring leaders and ordinary people the progressive message he proclaimed in 2008 was now being realized by a Democratic successor.That was before Trump won in a surprise victory.Now, the assurances Europeans want — promises of stability and an end to the unease gripping this continent — Obama is not prepared to deliver.On core areas of cooperation, there's scant confidence about a way forward. Obama can't say, for example, that the Iran nuclear agreement will continue as written. He's not positioned to vow US commitment to the Paris climate accord going forward. Perhaps most worrying to his European allies, there's little he can say with certitude about Trump's plans for checking Russia's aggressions.After an hour and a half with Trump last week, Obama was able to glean the President-elect's commitment to preserving NATO ties, a statement Obama repeated in nearly every set of public remarks he delivered in Greece and Germany.But elsewhere, on deeper matters, there's little he can say with honesty about the road ahead.He still feels Trump is unfit for office, he's suggested, though no longer says so out loud. He remains concerned about the rhetoric the candidate espoused on the trail, but is ""cautiously optimistic"" he'll tone things down once he's in the Oval Office. And he can no longer say with any confidence the nationalist wave that landed Trump in the White House won't take firmer hold here.Even as Obama was standing at the Acropolis in Greece hailing the ancient wisdom of democracy, the French nationalist politician Marine Le Pen was declaring an end to the globalized vision he's worked to advance.""Donald Trump has made possible what was presented as completely impossible,"" Le Pen told CNN in an interview Tuesday. ""So it's a sign of hope for those who cannot bear wild globalization. They cannot bear the political life led by the elites.""Obama, too, has warned against the pitfalls of globalization. But his message has shifted from 2008, when he warned of those ""left behind in a globalized world"" during his speech in Berlin.Back then, he was advocating for the world's forgotten corners — dissidents in Burma, children in Bangladesh, refugees in Chad. These days, it's the disenfranchised voters who tilted toward Trump who he says must be eased into an interconnected world.""If people feel that they're losing control of their future, they will push back,"" he said."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/donald-trump-transition-agency-landing-teams/index.html	"Trump teams for the Defense, State and Justice departments, as well as the National Security Council, are fanning out in Washington. The Trump transition announced the names of the first wave of staffers who will form the ""landing teams"" for the four agencies on Friday, a list that included a mix of DC long-timers and newer additions to Trump's orbit. Those teams will receive briefing materials from the agencies they are assigned to and will have the opportunity to ask questions about how the agency operates. They will take back what they learn to the transition to inform the White House team as well as the future secretary or leader of that agency. Their findings will also help inform the development of policy for the President-elect. Trump taps hardliners for national security teamIt's a process that has repeated itself in recent presidential transitions and is essential to changing presidents, officials say. ""It's incredibly important,"" said Deputy Labor Secretary Christopher Lu, the former executive director of President Barack Obama's transition.""You can only discern so much information about what's happening in a department from publicly available information like a website,"" Lu added. ""Only once you've had a chance to talk to people can you really understand what's going on.""The process of agency landing teams was delayed, in part, by paperwork. The White House needed the transition to submit a list of names of staff they wanted to send into the agencies, so they could be given background checks, and required those individuals to submit to code of conduct and conflict of interest statements.Lu said the step is necessary for non-government employees to be privy to sensitive government information, especially in the national security field.  Waiting for the landing teams at the agencies are pre-readied briefings, ordered by Obama months ago. ""Those briefings include organizational charts, budget materials, briefings on key agency priorities and areas of responsibility, and other materials describing the essential functions of that agency,"" the White House says in a fact sheet about the transition. ""In addition to the initial briefings, designated employees across the Administration will work closely with their Agency Review Teams in order to facilitate open communication between the outgoing and incoming Administrations.""Trump transition moves to right the shipThey should be prepared for a lot of information. ""If our book is 800 pages, I can't even imagine what DoD's is like,"" Lu said, speaking from the perspective of preparing for the eventual arrival of the Department of Labor team. Only the first four waves have been named from Trump transition, but others are expected to follow. Pre-election, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had been chairing the transition and a number of people had been tapped on standby to lead agency teams. But shortly after Trump and his campaign inner circle reviewed the plan after the election, they replaced Christie with Vice President-elect Mike Pence -- who moved to remove a number of lobbyists from the team along with a few other individuals who were let go for different reasons.The transition has begun rebuilding since and is now moving down the list of agencies. National security was prioritized, including the announcement Friday of three key nominations: retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn for national security advisor, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director.  Lu says the Obama transition moved more in advance to get staff in agencies. He said upwards of 100 people were sent to the White House before the 2008 election so that they could be vetted and ready to go a few days after the election. Their landing teams were in agencies by the Monday after election, about a week ahead of Trump's first wave. Both Trump and Hillary Clinton's transitions were given the option to submit names in advance if they so chose. Despite being highly critical of Trump during the campaign, Obama has welcomed Trump to the White House since the election and been very clear to his staff that a smooth transition is a must.Lu notes that part of Obama's motivation is how helpful and gracious former President George W. Bush was with his outgoing presidential transition.""When Obama expressed his appreciation to that team, it was sincere,"" Lu said. ""The message has been sent to us repeatedly over the last six months that regardless of who wins, this administration is going to facilitate a smooth and orderly transition. It's a hallmark of our democracy."""	What is Donald Trump's staff doing in Washington?	['Pence', 'Obama', 'Christie', 'Pompeo', 'Trump']	[]

""I want her to stop doing that.""Life isn't always glamorous working presidential campaigns, but those who do it — from the journalists who cover them to the staffers who execute them — all share one thing in common: They want to have a role in this unique American process.The primariesOn January 24, 2015, about 10 potential Republican candidates descended upon Iowa for the first major cattle call of the presidential race. Scott Walker was all the rage. Ted Cruz performed mightily. Donald Trump barely got any mention.It was a different time.It's also when my own campaign story began. Since then, I've covered events in 43 states, taking more than 400 flights and spending 524 nights in hotels. CNN assigned me to cover the (very large) Republican field, a beat that sent me racing across Iowa and New Hampshire for a primary that would last over a year.As an embed, you're responsible for shooting events, writing up stories, reporting on the campaigns, staking out candidates and occasionally producing for correspondents.And when there were 17 primary candidates, there was ample room for news. But it was the colorful and unexpected moments that truly stick out.Those memories include getting brushed by a few shell casings as Rand Paul hit up a shooting range before the first primary debate. I also shot video of John Kasich as he shot hoops with the Milwaukee Bucks, and I walked through a parade with Rick Perry (actually we jogged through a lot of it -- the man has a ton of energy).I watched Ted Cruz sign a woman's pair of pink cowboy boots. I followed Jeb Bush around the Iowa state fair for four hours on a hot August day. I tagged along as Chris Christie worked the line outside of Ben and Jerry's on free cone day. And I climbed aboard Trump's plane to ask him questions in a last-minute gaggle.Becoming a stalkerThe field started to narrow, and my focus became covering Bush full time under the assumption that he would be the front-runner. That storyline didn't last long, and the new story became how Trump was outgunning a former two-term governor who had an unprecedented amount of money behind him.It was interesting to watch and chronicle Bush's campaign from beginning to end, but more than that, it was fascinating to get to know the man and watch him evolve as a candidate. When your life becomes your candidate's life, you absorb everything they say and anything that impacts them.Studying a person like that — picking up on any inflection changes in their stump speech, reading thousands of their publicly-released emails, becoming obsessed over minor tweaks like switching from glasses to contacts — makes you feel like a stalker, yes, but it also helps you understand this person who wants to be the leader of the free world.Bush tried earnestly to be a more open candidate than Mitt Romney in 2012. He gave us access that our fellow embeds on other campaigns envied, he handed out his email address to voters, and he spent hours upon hours in conversations with people after events — all of which we were allowed to shoot.But he wasn't selling what Trump was selling to the public, and three weeks after Bush dropped out, I was reassigned to the man who would become the eventual nominee and now President-elect.Changing beatsGoing from Bush world to Trump world was a culture shock.Bush usually averaged 150-200 people at his intimate, town-hall style events. Trump held massive rallies at arenas with thousands of people. My first Trump rally was interrupted by close to a dozen protesters, and Trump dramatically read the lyrics to a song called ""The Snake,"" making a comparison between Syrian refugees and a poisonous snake.CNN producer Noah Gray had been covering Trump since the previous summer and he helped me navigate this bigger — and much louder — universe. We worked as co-embeds over the next eight months, covering the always-eventful rallies and trying to share with our network the frustration and anger felt by the voters who attended them.Often that anger was directed at us, the media. Most voters were pleasant one-on-one, and I learned about entirely new perspectives in those conversations. But when Trump would egg on his audiences to boo the press pen, sometimes the same lovely people I spoke to before the rally were suddenly flipping us off or screaming ugly things.Experiencing such vitriol was uncomfortable, but you learned to get used to that feeling and stay focused on the task at hand.The final pushAs it became clear that Trump would become the nominee and as the election turned from a primary to the general, our daily lives as embeds also changed. Gone were the hours-long road trips from event to event. Gone were TSA lines and protracted airport waits. Gone was spending an entire day in one state.Instead we traveled together as a press corps, chasing Trump's plane to multiple cities and states a day in our own chartered plane. We hustled to and from events, sometimes running with our gear to keep up with Trump's busy schedule. Our moments of peace came when we could cram in a nap on the plane or when Secret Service would let us pet their dogs.In the last week of the campaign, we did 30 flights -- landing in 11 states for 14 rallies in the final three days alone. It was an aggressive schedule that likely played a big part in his surprise victory on November 8. As a result, my body hurt that morning after Election Day; I could barely move. And thinking about the past 22 months lately has overwhelmed me.But I got to experience this country in a way that only a few get the chance to do, and I will never forget the people I met and the perspectives that shaped this election. It's been a whirlwind ride, one where I've learned to always adapt, never make assumptions, and never take things for granted -- like being able to put clothes in drawers and buy regular-sized shampoo bottles.I'm looking forward to moving back into an apartment in the coming weeks and actually staying in the same city for more than eight days in a row for the first time in two years -- all the while thankful that CNN entrusted me with this crazy job.And my now six-year-old niece, Emma, will get Auntie Ashley all to herself for two weeks next month."

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-party-protest/index.html	"The independent senator from Vermont, who has emerged as a party leader in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's defeat last week, said Thursday that progressives must dedicate themselves to winning over voters who turned to Donald Trump on Election Day.In a speech to hundreds of supporters and activists gathered on a chilly fall afternoon in Washington, Sanders pinned Trump's victory on the Democratic establishment's failure to engage with millions of Americans who feel forgotten by political leaders and hemmed in by stagnant local economies.""The party has got to recognize some very important realities that Donald Trump, in fact, recognized,"" Sanders said, keeping up a drumbeat he began last week in a New York Times op-ed and has returned to in a round of subsequent appearances. ""And that is, yes, we are better off today economically than we were eight years ago, we've made a lot of progress in a lot of areas. But there are millions and millions of people today, working-class people, middle-class people, who are living in despair. And we have got to recognize that reality.""Sanders campaigned heartily for Clinton after she clinched the Democratic nomination this summer, but as the American left begins to consider its options in the wake of a slow-building electoral wipeout -- Republicans now control the White House, both chambers of Congress, and dominate state politics -- he and the movement that fueled his campaign are moving quickly to grab hold of the party.""There is a lot of pain in America,"" Sanders said in a short speech just a few hundred feet from his Senate office. ""Capitol Hill doesn't understand it -- we do. And we are going to reach out to those brothers and sisters (who voted for Trump) and work with them.""The organizers behind the rally, which was planned months before the election and initially slated as a demonstration against the the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact President Barack Obama has championed but has been rejected by many progressives who are leery of expansive free trade bill. But as if to further underscore the odd, partisan-defying moment, the deal is now all but dead -- thanks in large part to Trump's opposition.Activists in Upper Senate Park on Thursday wrestled with the irony, some by arguing that the President-elect had hijacked the economic populist movement they had resurrected. ""TPP was stopped because of you and Donald Trump had nothing to do with it,"" Tefere Gebre, the executive vice president of the AFL-CIO, told the crowd. ""Working together, we made the TPP toxic for politicians. Then opportunistic politicians tried to jump on the bandwagon and say, 'I was there too.'""Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat and Sanders ally, congratulated activists on defeating a wide range of ""forces arrayed against us,"" including ""financial institutions, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, the president of the United States, pharmaceutical industries, and big agriculture industries.""""They thought we couldn't do it,"" she said, ""but we certainly showed them."" Before former Ohio state senator Nina Turner took the stage to begin emceeing duties, RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, confessed she and the group, which organized the event, had not expected such a swift or politically confounding victory.""I wasn't anticipating this and I wasn't thinking of this when we planned the rally,"" she said, ""but we're very, very excited about (the turnout). Millions of people want to engage. We're not seeing a falloff in terms of energy.""On the same afternoon Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan formalized his plans to challenge to Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, DeMoro argued that the power center in liberal politics had already shifted -- and that while Sanders stood as progressives' ""fundamental leader,"" it would not rely on him for direction at every step.  ""(Sanders) has has millions looking to him for hope and direction -- he's critical,"" she said. ""Having said that, the movie was there before Bernie. Bernie was able to galvanize the movement. The movement got much, much stronger. So while Bernie is critical, the movement exists, the movement has a life of its own.""Two hours later, a group of about 25 union nurses walked a half-mile south to the Longworth House Office Building, passed through metal detectors, took elevators to the second floor, and gathered around the entryway to House Speaker Paul Ryan's office.With a letter -- and piece of pie -- in hand, they asked a staffer if Ryan was available to discuss their opposition to his longstanding plans to remake Medicare.""Paul is not here right now,"" he informed them politely, and then after exchanging contact information, closed the heavy wood door behind him."
