""There's a lot of stuff that we can do better and there's a lot of stuff that we do better than anybody in the world, but that's life. That's our project as Americans -- we always work to be better,"" he continued.But Brooks, who considers himself to be ""fairly conservative,"" is not optimistic that the next commander-in-chief will be able to make good on his or her promises to solve some of the country's most divisive issues if Washington remains gridlocked and the US continues to be as ""polarized"" as it is today.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to work with Congress to implement comprehensive immigration reform and pledged to take on the gun lobby to institute ""common sense"" gun-control measures.Meanwhile, Trump has promised to build a wall on the southern border between the US and Mexico.  CHECK OUT: #GetPolitical â€” A CNN Politics original series""I think all the issues that are on the table, from gun control to immigration, are so complicated, there is no easy answer,"" Brooks told CNN. ""None of these problems are going to be solved overnight or probably in the next four years no matter what either candidate says.""On gun cultureLamenting the hostility that has often plagued the gun-control debate on both sides, the ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" artist said that the right to bear arms is an American principle that ""should be respected.""""We do have a Second Amendment and it's something that should be respected and discussed in a civilized way,"" Brooks said. ""My only concerns are that Second Amendment rights are discussed with so much ferocity that sometimes we don't hear what each other is saying.""Brooks, who is an avid hunter, grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, along the Red River, and as he toured the country to play music over the last two decades, he witnessed a stark cultural divide between rural and urban America when it comes to guns.While Americans in rural America ""never considered what a gang was,"" Brooks said, those in urban America also don't understand that ""having a shotgun in the back of your pick up truck was also just a way of life"" for Americans like him.Brooks is a strong supporter of states' rights and said that gun-control solutions to address gang violence and gun violence in American cities are not necessarily needed or effective in rural America.""I don't feel like what's good for California is good for Tennessee, is good for Louisiana, is good for New York City,"" Brooks said,"" adding, that local ""leaders in our own communities know much better what our problems are and how we should deal with them than Washington, D.C., does.""And as for election 2016, Brooks did not say who he is voting for but said if he hears a candidate speaking along those lines, he tends ""to listen more closely.""On 'Only in America'Many artists have protested when politicians with views they oppose use their songs during campaign events. However, when then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama played Brooks and Dunn's ""Only in America"" at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, that was not the case.""Seems ironic that the same song Bush used at the Republican Convention last election would be used by Obama and the Democrats now,"" Brooks said at the time. ""Very flattering to know our song crossed parties and potentially inspires all Americans.""Brooks, who was a supporter of President George W. Bush, said that he co-wrote ""Only in America"" with his friend and music producer Don Cook -- a Democrat -- after they spent day in the woods, riding four-wheelers near Brooks' farm and talking about how grateful they are to be Americans. ""The song was never meant to be political in any way. It still isn't,"" Brooks said. ""The song is patriotic ... Call it corny or flag-waving or whatever you want to, but I'm really sincere about it. It means a lot to me -- our country does and everything it stands for."""

Ohio is going one step further.""We even asked the National Guard to attempt to penetrate our databases,"" said Joshua Eck, a spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. ""We've had a number of really positive tests. It has gone well and we've been able to find vulnerabilities and fix them.""A pair of cyberattacks on Illinois' and Arizona's voter registration databases over the summer spurred the Obama administration to ring the alarm bells for states as they prepare for what has already been a chaotic campaign. And top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees publicly accused the Russian government of seeking to alter the election.""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, said Thursday.Russian intelligence agencies behind US election hacks, lawmakers sayCybersecurity experts say the prospect of ""rigging"" the election, and changing the outcome, is practically impossible. Elections are decentralized: 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, run their own operations, not to mention the thousands of counties across the country that play a major role at the local level.Different jurisdictions use different voting machines, It isn't plausible for hackers to breach them all in one fell swoop -- penetrating one election system in North Carolina has no impact on Colorado. Furthermore, most voting machines aren't connected to the Internet, which inoculates them from outside intrusions.But hackers could still cause plenty of havoc in November, with attacks on registration systems or government websites reporting the results on election night. Many news organizations pull their results from those sites.""Think about the chaos you could cause if you get one TV network calling the election for one candidate, and another network calling the election for the other,"" said Professor Herbert Lin, a cybersecurity expert at Stanford University. ""If your intent is to sow doubt and uncertainty, at least in the short term, affecting the media reporting could be really problematic."" DHS running 'Cyber hygiene scans'Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is the Obama administration's point man on election security, holding meetings with elections officials from across the country, and offering help to states that are interested. DHS is offering ""cyber hygiene scans"" that will remotely search for vulnerabilities in election systems like online voter registration systems and election night reporting infrastructure. It is also offering to send cybersecurity experts to states so they can conduct more aggressive in-person testing the final weeks of the campaign.Johnson recently laid out other federal resources for states in a memo last week, including a 24/7 center to respond to cyberattacks, and a list of ""best practices"" on how to secure voter registration databases.Pennsylvania has accepted the DHS help, both the remote scans and the in-person testing, said Pennsylvania Department of State spokeswoman Wanda Murren. Election authorities in Ohio are also accepting federal help.But not every state is happy to have the administration involved.Georgia's secretary of state publicly scoffed at these efforts and accused the federal government of trying to ""subvert the Constitution.""Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, rebuffed the idea, telling Nextgov that the feds might want to ""subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security."" However, his office later walked back the comment, saying they were not flatly refusing the assistance.A call for comment from Kemp was not immediately returned Thursday.Florida officials, whose recount debacle in 2000 led to the federal law which ultimately created voter registration databases, declined to say whether they were accepting help from DHS, citing security concerns.What are the threats?Perhaps the most serious vulnerability is the integrity of voter registration systems. Hackers can break in and delete or alter individual voter registration records, creating confusion on Election Day when voters show up to their polling place and their names are mysteriously missing from the rolls, or their address is changed.This summer, hackers broke into a stash of information for about 90,000 voters in Illinois, breaching a database with voters' names, addresses, sex and birthdays. And officials in Arizona took their voter registration system offline after they learned that a Russian hacker had breached their systems.Once hackers penetrate a voter registration system, ""the scope could be whatever they want,"" said Cathie Brown, who served as Virginia's deputy chief information security officer and is a cybersecurity expert with Impact Makers. ""Deleting an entire precinct of voters -- that's absolutely possible. The grander the scope, the more likely they'll get caught. But they might not get caught until after they've done the damage.""But at least one expert said that state elections directors have been dealing with technological threats for a long time. ""The state and local election officials, this whole notion of security is not new to them this is something they deal with all the time,"" said Tim Mattice, executive director of the Elections Center, which trains state and local elections officials on administering elections. Mattice's organization works with the professional group representing election officials, the National Association of State Election Directors.Mattice said that when DHS offered up help, most people understood them when they said they were making it voluntary and did not want to be viewed as coming in and taking over state-run elections.Ironically, Mattice noted that the focus on technological security got serious after Congress passed the national Help America Vote Act in the wake of the 2000 elections, which mandated that states develop integrated voter registration systems -- effectively placing all the voter data in systems that could be hacked.Asked how hackers got through in Illinois and Arizona despite the layers of security that elections officials already have in place, Mattice said it's the same problem any organization or business faces.""You could ask Target how they got hacked -- these hackers are getting sophisticated,"" Mattice said."

""We take any reports about any cyberbreach seriously, particularly if it may include some sensitive information. At this point, I can't speak to the authenticity of the information released.""At this point, I cannot announce any sort of conclusion that has been reached about the individual or individuals who may have been responsible for the cyberbreach of this information,"" Earnest said.He couldn't confirm the authenticity of the passport scan, and said the emails in question belonged to a contractor who was hired for individual advance jobs, and was not a full-time White House staffer.The rest of the published emails contained largely mundane information about White House logistics.The group that posted the information, DCLeaks, was also responsible for publishing Colin Powell's emails last week.A spokeswoman for the US Secret Service said the agency ""is aware of the alleged email hacking of a White House employee. The Secret Service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed.

""I actually enjoyed the day with 'Saint Donald,' and I've enjoyed watching him,"" Knight said on ""Fox and Friends"" on Friday. ""I think the man has a lot of really, really good things to bring to the table."" It's an honorific Knight has been quick to use in recent days.

""I just kid him about that,"" Knight told reporters. ""I needle him about that. He's got a great sense of humor and I think that's another thing that he has that's gonna be good.""Knight said Friday he's watched Trump's style evolve since he first endorsed Trump before the Indiana primary and that he has been strong. ""I just watch him, I think, become -- I don't know if the word 'mild' is the word to use or not, or 'milder.' But I just have seen him take a different approach to how things should be and to go about attacking things and what's wrong,"" Knight said Friday on Fox. ""I've really been impressed with the interest that he has in seeing that things are done in the right way.""  Knight is famous for coaching the Indiana Hoosiers and is one of the winningest college basketball coaches of all time. He endorsed Trump and campaigned with him before the candidate went on to the win the Indiana primary, effectively sealing his nomination. But Knight left coaching on controversial ground, after he as accused of physically and verbally abusing a student. Knight was legendary for his temper as much as his wins. Trump proudly touts the endorsement on the campaign trail, even when he is not appearing with Knight. "	Bobby Knight calls Donald Trump 'Saint Donald'	['Knight', 'Trump']	[]
4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/23/politics/cheryl-mills-immunity-hillary-clinton-emails/index.html	"Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff and adviser at the State Department, was given the narrow immunity deal during the FBI's investigation into the former secretary of state's use of a private email server during her time in office. ""This is beyond explanation,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz said in a statement. ""The FBI was handing out immunity agreements like candy. I've lost confidence in this investigation and I question the genuine effort in which it was carried out. Immunity deals should not be a requirement for cooperating with the FBI."" A spokeswoman for Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, confirmed that Mills was being given immunity. But a Democratic congressional source said the extent of the deal was limited to a search of her and another aide's laptop.  According to the source, the FBI requested the laptops of Clinton's attorneys, Mills and Heather Samuelson, after they conducted a 2014 review of what emails Clinton sent were work-related and which were personal. Work-related emails were turned over to the State Department and personal emails were deleted.In exchange for giving the laptops they used to the FBI, Mills and Samuelson were given a limited immunity agreement from the Department of Justice, the Democratic source said, that they would not face prosecution for any information that was found on those laptops. ""The DOJ and FBI considered my clients to be witnesses and nothing more,"" said Beth Wilkinson, an attorney for Mills. ""Indeed, the Justice Department assured us that they believed my clients did nothing wrong. At all points, my clients cooperated with the government's investigation, including voluntarily participating in interviews with the FBI and DOJ.""The letters released to the Hill today only covered the computers that my clients had used in performing their legal work. Because of the confusion surrounding the various agencies' positions on the after-the-fact classification decisions, I advised my clients to accept this letter from DOJ.""A Clinton campaign spokesman said Friday's leak -- coming three days before the first presidential debate -- was politically motivated.""Three days before debate, House GOP selectively leaks details from inquiry that was closed months ago w/no charges,"" Brian Fallon tweeted.A 'criminal scheme'The FBI announced in July that it would not recommend any criminal charges in relation to its lengthy investigation of Clinton's email use. FBI Director James Comey made the announcement in an unprecedented statement to reporters, during which he also excoriated Clinton's staff for its carelessness, all while saying no criminal acts were prosecutable.First on CNN: FBI director defends Clinton email probe, document releasesSince then, congressional Republicans have called Comey to testify and have demanded the FBI send its investigation materials for review. Comey is appearing again on Capitol Hill, testifying before the House Judiciary committee next Wednesday. He is expected to face more questions from Republicans about his handling of the Clinton email probe.Republican candidate Donald Trump seized on the news, with his spokesman saying it proves a ""criminal scheme.""""No one with judgment this bad should be allowed to serve as President of the United States or hold any public office,"" said spokesman Jason Miller. ""In light of this development, Hillary Clinton must immediately come forward and promise the American people that none of these individuals will ever serve in any capacity in her administration."" The Democratic source, however, said that the immunity agreement was limited and that Mills testified before Congress and spoke with the FBI without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.""Mills was not given immunity for any testimony or statements she gave to DOJ. She gave voluntary statements to DOJ as she had previously to the Benghazi Committee,"" the source said. The top Democrat on the Oversight panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings criticized Republicans' response to the issue. ""It's beyond disappointingâ€”but not surprising in light of the electionâ€”that Republicans are rushing to leak inaccurate information about this very limited agreement between Ms. Mills and the Justice Department,"" Cummings said in an statement, and pointed to praise Mills received from Republicans for her participating in a nine-hour interview on the issue. An IT staffer has also been given immunity in exchange for his testimony. Mills is a former legal adviser to Clinton's campaign, was her chief of staff at the State Department and has served on the board of the Clinton Foundation.Her time at the State Department has been controversial both in terms of her handling of sensitive information via Clinton's email server and in her connection to the Clinton Foundation. While chief of staff at State, Mills traveled to New York on what her lawyer says was a volunteer basis to interview job candidates for the foundation, according to a CNN investigation.

They refer to an internal agency email from US Citizenship and Immigration Services about processing applications ""due to the election year."" The memo encourages DHS staff to work overtime to process applications and notes several Saturdays that offices will be open to help process applications.The senators say a similar effort in 1996 to increase citizenship applications ""endangered national security and public safety"" because not all the cases were processed following the correct protocol, such as fingerprint checks.The Department of Homeland Security said it aims to ensure naturalization applications are processed on time. ""USCIS's goal is to process applications for naturalization within five to seven months, regardless of external events such as elections.  USCIS uses statistical forecasting models to plan for the potential increased volume of work. USCIS anticipated that there would be a spike in applications this year, as we usually see in an election year, but the increase ... has exceeded expectations,""  Homeland Security said in a statement.
