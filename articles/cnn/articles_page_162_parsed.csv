He said in August that this month's CGI meeting would be his last, and he plans to step down from the foundation's board of directors if Hillary Clinton wins in November.""People may tell you you're making incremental change. But look back after 11 years and see what the aggregate is,"" the former president said. ""None of this could have happened without the belief that progress is possible.""Advisers said Clinton hoped that the speech will provide a strong rebuttal to what he sees as partisan attacks on his foundation. He did not explicitly bring up how it had been injected into the 2016 campaign, but the 42nd president did hint at the criticisms.""This is a time when this sort of talk is not in fashion all over the world,"" Clinton said. ""It's kind of a crazy time.""Republicans have portrayed the Clinton Foundation as a blemish against Hillary Clinton as she runs for president. The foundation has pushed back against the attacks, but questions about the foundation continue to hamper Clinton's campaign with some voters.Despite serving as president for eight years, Bill Clinton has said his work with the foundation has been the work of his life. He told staffers earlier this year that leaving the foundation would be as painful as a ""root canal"" and told NPR earlier this week that he would have ""paid more to do this job.""""I've had this job longer than I ever had any job and I've loved it,"" Clinton said. ""And you know we always say in response to our critics -- and nobody in my family ever took a penny out of this foundation and put millions of dollars in -- but I would have paid more to do this job. It was the most fun thing I think I've ever done.""This year's CGI -- the final gathering -- has been a slightly different than past meetings. Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama have both declined to attend, something they both did in past meetings."

Chris Coons of Delaware said Wednesday that Poroshenko sought a meeting with the GOP nominee during the United Nations General Assembly in New York but was ignored.""Earlier this summer, I led a bipartisan delegation to Eastern Europe. We visited Ukraine in particular, and I know President Poroshenko of Ukraine was seeking a meeting with Donald Trump while he was in New York meeting with the president of Egypt, and was rejected,"" the Delaware Democrat told CNN ""New Day"" host Chris Cuomo. But Poroshenko says that's not how it happened. ""We don't have any refusal,"" the Ukrainian president said in an interview on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" chalking it up to a scheduling conflict during a crammed few days of meeting with 22 heads of state. Poroshenko said he didn't take the lack of a meeting with Trump as a snub, citing bipartisan support in for his country in Congress.Earlier Wednesday a Ukrainian official confirmed to CNN that Poroshenko's office requested a meeting with both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton but only received a response from Clinton, who agreed to the meeting.A message left with Trump's campaign Wednesday was not immediately returned.Trump did meet Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, during which the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting. Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko took place just a few minutes before Trump met with el Sisi a short distance away. Before that meeting the Democratic nominee said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.""Coons -- a vocal supporter of Clinton for president -- was quick to link Trump's decision not to meet with Poroshenko to positive comments Trump has made about Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country, a primary geopolitical antagonist to Ukraine. ""Donald Trump's statements about Ukraine and Putin suggest a dangerous lack of familiarity with Putin's actual record of invading a neighboring country and a dangerous lack of respect for or familiarity with our NATO treaty alliances,"" he said.Coons continued, ""In meetings I had with heads of state in recent days here in New York City, they all expressed real concern or questions about Donald Trump's readiness or fitness to serve as president.""Trump's rhetoric on Ukraine and Russia throughout the US presidential election has prompted criticism and scrutiny, even from members of his own party. The GOP nominee has praised Putin as ""a leader far more than our President has been a leader,"" and suggested that the United States shouldn't automatically come to the defense of NATO allies in Eastern Europe who are threatened by an increasingly aggressive Russia if those countries don't adequately fund their own militaries."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/joe-arpaio-birther-investigation-donald-trump/index.html	"Joe Arpaio, the controversial Maricopa County Sheriff from Arizona and strident opponent of illegal immigration, spoke Tuesday night to a meeting of the Surprise Tea Party Patriots, the group that initiated Arpaio's quest to prove that Obama was born outside the US. And according to a report from the Arizona Republic, he made clear he would continue.""I'm not going to give up, and we're looking into it,"" he told the group. ""I don't know how it's going to turn out.""Acknowledging Trump's shift on the issue last week, Arpaio -- who has closely aligned himself with Trump during the Republican presidential nominee's political ascent -- nevertheless dismissed his candidate's reversal, and insisted that the birth certificate provided by Obama was a fake. It's a claim that has been thoroughly debunked. ""I don't care where he's from. We are looking at a forged document. Period,"" he said, according to the report. The man known as ""Sheriff Joe"" actually said that he had ""nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate."" He told the group, ""We did it on our own, because of you guys."" And Arpaio said that despite political pressure to drop the issue, he would persevere. ""I know all the politicians say, 'Sheriff Joe, don't talk about it.' But how can I back down when we started it? I'm not going to just forget it.""Dormant for years, the ""birther"" movement's false claim that Obama was born outside the US returned to the headlines last week when Trump refused to say whether he accepted the President's citizenship in an interview. Trump's equivocation sparked a firestorm of criticism, subsequently prompting the GOP nominee to declare at the end of a press conference last week that ""President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.""Obama, who was born in Hawaii in 1961, produced his long-form birth certificate at a White House news conference in 2011, largely putting the controversy to rest.Arpaio has served as a prominent supporter and surrogate for the Trump campaign, appearing with the candidate during campaign stops in Arizona and even speaking on behalf of Trump at the Republican National Convention over the summer.

""The fact of the matter is Donald Trump does have a tough battle. I'm not saying he can't win, but I'll tell you what, if he did, the presidential race is over.""The latest Muhlenberg College/Morning Call poll has Clinton with a comfortable 9-point lead over Trump but Madonna says the race is likely much closer. ""This election, his average in polls, has not been 5% or below for four months. And that's huge,"" he said.Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have returned to the state often -- nine visits between the two of them so far, with more on the way. The campaign has also started to advertise in the state. After spending a sum total of zero on TV advertising through August, Trump has now spent nearly $3 million dollars on an advertisement highlighting immigration and security concerns.Clinton, meanwhile, is taking no chances. Her campaign opened its 55th office in the state this week, she currently has more than 300 campaign organizers -- and expects many more by Election Day -- and she and her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, have been here 11 times, not including the party's convention, which was held in Philadelphia. Clinton has also spent four times that of Trump, around $12 million, on TV advertising in Pennsylvania.Trump has made a play for Pennsylvania based on broad support in the rural and western areas of the state. But he needs to compete in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, where a third of the states' voters live, if he hopes to turn the state red.  ""If he loses the Philly suburbs by a few thousand voters, then fine,"" Madonna said, ""but he can't lose by six figures. He won't be able to make up the difference.""Both campaigns have descended on Philadelphia and the surrounding counties to register voters and motivate them to vote. Hoping to appeal to women and moderates, Trump announced his childcare initiative in Aston just west of Philadelphia. In the same week, President Barack Obama, Clinton's strongest surrogate, made his first solo campaign appearance for her in Philadelphia trying to motivate young and African-American voters.Philadelphia and the surrounding areas cannot be underestimated. In 2012, Mitt Romney won 54 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties but still lost the state to Obama by 5.5% because of the heavy Democratic turnout in Philadelphia, the surrounding counties and the other Democratic stronghold, Pittsburgh. Though a Republican presidential candidate hasn't won Pennsylvania since 1988, it is often a battleground because most presidential contests here were won by 5 or 6 points. Obama's 10-point advantage in 2008 was a blowout.Voter registration across state was strong in July and August, actually running ahead of registration efforts in 2008, which was a banner year. Democrats have registered some 418,000 voters so far this year to Republicans' 321,000. With the last day to register, October 11, looming, both camps have moved into high-gear to find new voters.At a recent GOP get-out-the-vote effort in Stroudsburg, volunteers fanned out through neighborhoods looking for votes with instructions to be friendly and under no circumstances to engage in arguments with Clinton supporters.Clinton launched a broad effort this week to get younger voters engaged. She spoke to a small group of students at Temple University, promising progress on a host of issues from student loans to job to climate change.  ""If I'm in the White House,"" Clinton said to great applause, ""young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made."" Pennsylvania will be a test for Clinton's enormous campaign operation versus the enthusiasm of Trumps' most ardent supporters. With no early voting in the Keystone State, the race here will go all the way to November 8."	Trump's key to 2016 election win may lie in Keystone State	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/clinton-kaine-fundraising/index.html	"Since September 1, Kaine has headlined 25 fundraisers in 12 states and Washington, DC, while Clinton has only held eight.Kaine continued his fundraising blitz on Wednesday in California with multiple events in the Bay Area, including a luncheon featuring two long-time Republican donors. Thursday, he's in Houston for an event that features singer Michael Bolton. This is Bolton's second fundraiser for Clinton; he appeared at an event during the Democratic primaries. The Texas Tribune first reported Bolton's appearance. The Houston event is part of Kaine's cash-raising spree.Kaine appeared Wednesday at the Atherton home of Jillian Manus, a Republican donor, philanthropist and businesswoman. The event will be co-hosted by HP CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for California governor as a Republican in 2010. Whitman endorsed Clinton in August, writing in a statement that she would vote for and donate to Clinton.According to average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the Clinton campaign, Kaine has raised over $16 million in September, as of Wednesday. Clinton has raised around $13 million by the same standard.Clinton also canceled her trip to California earlier this month after she was diagnosed with pneumonia.The change comes after an August where both Clinton and Kaine focused more on fundraising than they did on campaigning. The Democratic duo headlined 70 fundraisers in August (37 for Clinton, 33 for Kaine). The events raised over $80 million, according to CNN's estimate.Clinton aides say that August will be the high-water mark for Clinton personally headlining events. While she will continue to headline events, one aide said more of the load would continue to fall on Kaine.The change is one that donors have long expected and were somewhat surprised it didn't happen in August.Even if Clinton was a more prolific fundraiser in August, Kaine hit the ground running on the fundraising circuit after he was named Clinton's running mate in July. To date, the former Virginia senator has headlined 58 fundraising events and raised closed to $30 million.Clinton still remains a far bigger draw than Kaine, with many of her fundraisers costing tens of thousands of dollars to attend. But Kaine has headlined his share of top dollar fundraisers.An event at the Los Angeles home of Cynthia and Charles Hirschhorn on Tuesday raised $1.4 million. Charles Hirschhorn, a movie producer who worked on ""Bull Durham"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" was housemates with Kaine in their student days at Harvard Law School.On Monday, Kaine headlined a ""Latinos for Hillary"" event at the Los Angeles home of actress Eva Longoria. Kaine also headlined an event Tavern on the Green, the historic New York restaurant in Central Park, where five donors paid a whopping $500,000 to dine with the VP candidate. In all, the intimate event raised $2.5 million.Kaine, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was tapped as Clinton's running mate, in part, because of his ability to raise the money needed to compete in a presidential election.While other factors like his preparedness and ability to win over white working-class voters were key factors in Clinton's decision to pick Kaine, aides said in July that the Virginia senator was the best fundraiser being considered."

Ever. Ever. Ever,"" Trump told a nearly all-white crowd during a rally in North Carolina.Brooks said Trump's assertion ignores ""the fact that African-Americans were lynched, African-Americans were forced to drink out of colored water fountains, ride the back of the bus, were enslaved in this country ... demonstrates a profound ignorance of history and insensitivity to what we are going through at this very moment.""Trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach""Mr. Trump, for anyone to assert that the African-American community is in the worst shape ever, ever, ever, to say that, to assert that with a semi-straight face is to demonstrate an insulting degree of ignorance and/or insensitivity,"" Brooks told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" Brooks, who represents the nonpartisan NAACP, added, ""We expect more from our presidential candidates.""Trump campaigned Wednesday in Ohio alongside former boxing promoter Don King, who used the N-word while introducing the businessman during an event at a church.King, who is black, said the word as he argued that African-Americans cannot achieve success by emulating white people, as they will remain ""negroes.""""If you're poor, you are a poor negro -- I would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- I mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro,"" King said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. ""You're going to be a negro 'til you die.""Trump, who was already smirking as he listened to King, didn't change the expression on his face, but turned slightly uncomfortably to his special counsel Michael Cohen and the church's pastor, Darrell Scott, who head up Trump's diversity coalition."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/donald-trump-stop-and-frisk/index.html	"Trump touted the much-maligned program during a Fox News town hall that was pre-taped for Wednesday night but didn't air, responding to a question about how he would stem ""violence in the black community."" He clarified on ""Fox and Friends"" Thursday morning that he was specifically proposing expanding the program only to Chicago, highlighting the city's gun violence epidemic and comparing the situation to New York in the 1990s.""(Former NYPD Commissioner) Ray Kelly did a great job and New York was not in a Chicago situation, but it was really in trouble. It was in bad shape, crime wise, with all the shootings and everything,"" he said. ""And it really -- Rudy Giuliani did a great job as mayor, and they really straightened things out with stop-and-frisk and it was used further by the next mayor, Bloomberg, and now they just recently -- not so recently, but fairly recently -- they stopped it.""Under stop and frisk, police stop people on the street who they deem suspicious and think may be involved in criminal activity and search them on the spot for guns and illegal drugs, among other things. Trump said the program worked and that it could impact gun violence in Chicago. ""Now Chicago is out of control. I was really referring to Chicago stop and frisk. They asked me about Chicago. And I was talking about stop and frisk for Chicago,"" he said.  Trump had praised the practice -- which a federal judge ruled in New York in 2013 was unconstitutional, and unlawfully targeted blacks and Latinos, although it was not banned outright -- in similar terms at the town hall Wednesday night.""One of the things I'd do ... is I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,"" Trump said in response to an audience member's question.Trump has previously touted stop-and-frisk policies, but his full-throated endorsement of it Wednesday -- in which he called for its widespread implementation -- came as Trump pressed forward with his pitch to African-American voters, appearing at a predominantly black church alongside several of his prominent black surrogates.New York mayor: Donald Trump wrong about 'stop-and-frisk'That pitch to African-Americans hasn't come without a series of slip-ups, the latest of which came as Trump invited the prominent boxing promoter Don King, who is black, to introduce him at the church event -- only to have the celebrity use the N-word at the podium.And on Tuesday, Trump described the state of African-American communities as being in ""absolutely the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever."" and comparing the US's inner cities to Afghanistan.While Trump has pledged to bring jobs and safety to the inner cities, he has offered few specifics as to how he would address those issues. But Trump has called for beefing up the number of police officers in inner cities and argued that police officers need more latitude to do their jobs and backing from political figures -- a push not necessarily consistent with African-Americans' frustrations over the spate of police shootings against unarmed black men, which have rocked the country.""You have to have, in my opinion -- I see what's going on here, I see what's going on in Chicago -- I think stop-and-frisk. In New York City it was so incredible, the way it worked. Now, we had a very good mayor, but New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do,"" Trump said Wednesday.The real estate mogul's call for introducing stop-and-frisk as a prescription for reducing ""black-on-black crime"" -- as the questioner put it in the town hall -- is also likely to face a stiff rebuke from minority leaders. Many have opposed the practice during its use by New York City police as minorities were disproportionally targeted. In August 2013 a federal judge ruled that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities in New York. She didn't order an outright ban, but called for reform of the policy and outside oversight. The city under Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de Blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor.""The United States Constitution guarantees the rights of all Americans, and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York already ruled in 2013 that stop-and-frisk, as previously practiced in New York, was unconstitutional,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. ""These policies erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. Plus, they have proven to be ineffective.""A November 2013 report from the New York attorney general revealed just 3% of stop-and-frisk stops led to convictions between 2009 and 2012. And in more than 5 million stops between 2002 and 2013, police recovered guns less than 0.02% of the time, according to police department data compiled by the New York Civil Liberties Union in a 2014 report.Stop-and-frisk was instituted by one of Trump's most prominent supporters and advisers, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani has continued to defend the practice in recent years, rebutting the statistics showing little correlation between stop-and-frisk and a reduction in crime.Giuliani frequently joins Trump on the campaign trail -- where he is introduced as ""America's mayor"" -- and argues that Trump will bring the same tough-on-crime approach to the presidency.Trump recently praised the stop-and-frisk policy in an interview earlier this month in Philadelphia where he was asked about the African-American communities' concerns that stop-and-frisk amounts to racial profiling.""Well, I think you are going to have it. So many people are being killed in Philadelphia, that it's actually incredible when you look at the stats. I think you have to have it,"" he said in an interview with the local NBC station.Trump pressed forward with his pitch to African-American voters Wednesday afternoon during a rally in Toledo, Ohio -- where he again described black lives in the US in bleak terms.""To the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it -- and I say, honestly, what do you have to lose? It's not gonna get any worse. It's terrible. The crime, the bad education, the no jobs. What do you have to lose? Believe me, I will fix it. I'm gonna fix it,"" Trump said.But New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the belief that stop-and-frisk caused the city's crime rate to plummet is false.""I understand that people say that, (but) that's just not the history,"" he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day.""The mayor said it was former New York City Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton promoting community policing in 1994 that led to the decrease of crime in the city. ""That's what changed things in New York City,"" de Blasio said. ""The bottom line is it (stop-and-frisk) created a huge line of division between police and communities.""""We ended that unconstitutional use of stop-and-frisk, that overuse of stop-and-frisk,"" he added.De Blasio said that crime has actually decreased since the city all but ended stop-and-frisk three years ago. And that Trump's facts on policing are inaccurate and would reverse the progress that the city has made, the mayor said.""Donald Trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts,"" he said. ""He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety.""""He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities,"" de Blasio added.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated whether New York City is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. The city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process."

If successful, Congress' override will be the first of Obama's presidency.ORIGINAL STORY: A clash between the White House and Congress appears likely at the end of this week as President Barack Obama prepares to reject a measure allowing victims' families and survivors of the September 11 attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.Support for the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" ran high among lawmakers, who overwhelmingly passed the bill after pressure from victims' groups. The bill passed with enough support to indicate lawmakers could override the President's expected veto. But in recent days some of the measure's supporters have expressed misgivings about the legislation, prompting a new effort by the administration to lobby against the bill.The White House hasn't specified when Obama will officially veto the measure, which he's vowed to reject claiming it could open US diplomats and service-members to lawsuits. The 10-day window for the President to submit his rejection closes on Friday, and the White House is hoping to keep its options open by waiting until nearer the deadline.Administration officials had been eying a Friday afternoon veto, which would have come after Congress was expected to adjourn until November's election contests. But prolonged negotiations over a government funding bill and a package to combat Zika virus have delayed the recess, meaning lawmakers are still likely to be in Washington next week to cast an override vote.A person familiar with the administration's thinking said that Friday afternoon still appeared the most likely period for the veto to come down. That would maximize time for White House officials to press members of Congress to reconsider support for the measure.""White House officials and other senior officials on the president's national security team have engaged members of Congress and their staffs in both parties in both houses,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters in New York on Tuesday. He wouldn't disclose when Obama planned to veto the bill.""As soon as the President has put pen to paper, we'll be sure and let all of you know,"" Earnest said.The Republican leaders of the Senate and House have both said in recent says that an override is expected to go through, despite new qualms about the bill. If successful it would be the first veto override of Obama's presidency.""Our assumption is that the veto will be overridden,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday.House Speaker Paul Ryan followed suit Wednesday, saying ""I do think the votes are there for the override."" But the Wisconsin Republican also voiced his own doubts about the legislation, saying the implications for lawsuits against Americans worried him.""I worry about legal matters,"" Ryan said. ""I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedence. At the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court.""He was one of several prominent lawmakers who have expressed buyers' remorse for the proposed law. A pair of Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have pushed for changes to make it more difficult for the families to pursue lawsuits but could also make it harder for the US to be sued for alleged wrongdoing.Opponents of the bill gained support Wednesday from the European Union, which issued its opposition in the form of a ""demarche"" statement to the US Department of State.""The European Union is of the view that the possible adoption and implementation of the JASTA would be in conflict with fundamental principles of international law and in particular the principle of State sovereign immunity,"" the EU statement read. ""The European Union considers that the adoption of the bill and its subsequent implementation might also have unwanted consequences as other States may seek to adopt similar legislation, leading to a further weakening of the principles of State sovereignty immunity.""The document called on Obama to reject the bill."

After it landed on the base, just south of Mosul, US troops tested it and received an initial reading for a chemical agent they believe is mustard.No US troops were hurt or have displayed symptoms of exposure to mustard agent.US officials said Tuesday that additional testing had definitely concluded that a mustard agent was not used in the attack. Last week, another official had said the agent had ""low purity"" and was ""poorly weaponized."" A second official called it ""ineffective.""A US defense official said troops had gone out to look at the ordnance after it landed. Based on seeing what they thought was a suspect substance, two field tests were conducted.The first test was positive and the second was negative, the official said. The substance is now being sent to a lab for further examination.Decontamination precautionUS troops involved in the incident went through decontamination showers as a precaution. No troops have shown any symptoms of exposure, such as skin blistering. CNN has reported on previous instances where ISIS has fired rounds with mustard agents in Iraq and Syria.""I don't know of a case like this where it was proximate to US forces like this before,"" said one military official, noting that ""potentially"" the rocket round was ""within hundreds of yards"" of the US forces and ""within the security perimeter"" of the base.The US officials said they ""had expected"" that ISIS might try use chemical weapons as US and Iraqi forces push towards Mosul in an effort to take the city back from ISIS. Several hundred US troops are using the base as a staging area for supporting Iraqi forces.All of this has led the Pentagon to assess on a preliminary basis that it was ISIS that fired at the base, since the terror group has been making mustard agent for some time.In the course of its air campaign against ISIS, US airstrikes have hit several locations the US believes are production sites for mustard agent.US officials emphasized that mustard agent is relatively easy to produce, and they continue to hit suspected manufacturing sites when they find them. US troops are routinely outfitted with protective gear in the event of a chemical weapons attack."	ISIS suspected of mustard attack against US, Iraqi troops	[]	[]

But on a public webpage on his official campaign website touting his record on veterans' issues, Kirk was listed as a ""veteran of the Iraq war.""While Kirk campaign officials said it was a staff error, the issue resembles the controversy that nearly caused his 2010 Senate campaign to implode. Moreover, Kirk is now running for reelection against Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who lost both of her legs during combat in Iraq. Kirk campaign officials said the webpage was not meant to be made public, saying that it was supposed to be a private site while edits were being made to the page.Campaign officials said a third-party vendor had drafted the language that they said had not been vetted or reviewed by the senator's staff. The language, they acknowledged, was inaccurate, saying it would be changed when the campaign began a more direct push to court military veterans. After CNN inquired about the statement, the campaign moved the webpage behind a password-protected firewall. It had been accessible publicly and through Google searches about Kirk's work on veterans issues prior to that.Kirk campaign manager Kevin Artl downplayed the error -- and instead attacked Duckworth over her tenure leading the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs.""Rather than focus on draft web copy that has yet to go through an approval process, we would welcome the media's attention on the six military veterans who died waiting for care during Tammy Duckworth's time at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs,"" Artl said.Duckworth campaign officials declined to comment.In 2010, Kirk came under heavy criticism for making a number of inaccurate comments about his military record, including falsely asserting he was the lone member of Congress to serve in Iraq and had been named the Navy's intelligence officer of the year. He later backtracked, including by saying he served ""during"" the Iraq war -- not ""in"" the war. He also later acknowledged that a different award was given by the Navy, and it was awarded to his entire unit.Kirk apologized for his misstatements, including one saying he had been fired on in 2000 while flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq and another saying he was a veteran of Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s.During the Iraq war invasion of 2003, Kirk was a congressman representing a district encompassing suburbs north of Chicago. He served in the Naval Reserves at that time but was working stateside, even joking to a reporter in 2003 that he wouldn't see combat unless the Iraqi army came to Washington.After a 23-year career in the Navy Reserves where he served as an intelligence officer, Kirk retired from the service in 2013 -- a year after he suffered a major stroke that still affects his mobility and speech today."
