The candidates are the ones that have to fact-check each other,"" he said.When considering how moderators should approach their task, McCurry emphasized that they should learn from long-time CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer's approach.""He said the first thing you should do as a moderator before the debate is go look in the mirror and say, 'It's not about me,'"" McCurry said.However, when it comes challenging outright factually incorrect statements, ""there are right ways to do that,"" he said.""I don't doubt that Donald Trump is trying to work the ref a little bit right now in some of the things he's been saying"" McCurry said, apparently referring to NBC's widely criticized ""Commander-in-Chief Forum,"" in which moderator Matt Lauer failed to fact-check Trump's statement that he ""was totally against the Iraq War"" despite having initially said that he supported it.The latest crop of moderators, beginning with NBC's Lester Holt on September 26 and followed by CNN's Anderson Cooper, ABC's Martha Raddatz and Fox News' Chris Wallace, will ""have to use their editorial and journalistic judgment and ask the questions that most Americans would expect the candidates to be asked"" McCurry said.""We want to see a good discussion about the future of our country in a dignified setting,"" he added."

In the must-win states of Florida and Ohio, Trump and Clinton are deadlocked in this week's CNN/ORC poll, as well as several other surveys.In Iowa -- a state President Barack Obama won twice -- Trump leapt to an 8-point lead among likely voters over Clinton in a Monmouth University poll released Thursday (his largest lead yet in a battleground state). And in Virginia, Clinton and Trump were virtually tied at 40% to 37%.Of course, the 2016 campaign has plenty of twists ahead that could once again reshape the race in an instant. The latest came Friday when Trump ended five years of pushing conspiracy theories about Obama's birthplace and finally acknowledged he was born in the United States. And the first presidential debate, which will likely be a pivotal moment for both campaigns, is nine days away.But the recent polls underscore concerns about the effectiveness of Clinton's strategy, which has centered on convincing voters Trump is unfit to be commander in chief, as well as her ability to lift vulnerable House and Senate Democrats in November with the same effectiveness as Obama in 2008 and 2012. The Democratic nominee is coming off one of the toughest weeks of her campaign, forced to the sidelines for three days to recover from pneumonia.Still, she returned to the campaign trail with a trip to the crucial swing state of North Carolina and insisted she is in a ""strong position.""""What matters is who registers to vote, and who is motivated and mobilized to turn out to vote,"" she told reporters. ""And I'm going to keep doing everything I can to deliver my message about what's at stake in this election.""Striking takeawaysOne of the most striking takeaways from the poll findings this week is that even with all of Trump's controversies and polarizing comments, Clinton is still struggling to stitch together key parts of the Obama coalition. That point was particularly evident in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist state polls this week that showed her with softer support from Latinos and young voters than Obama.Many young voters still have issues trusting Clinton, said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics, and that is driving them to third-party candidates like Libertarian Gary Johnson, who is polling close at 7% to 8% in some states.""This (election) really, in some ways, is coming down to young voters,"" said Della Volpe. ""She has not yet solidified what arguably should be one of the core constituencies of any Democratic campaign.""It is with those voters where surrogates like Obama and Bernie Sanders will be so key to Clinton's efforts. First Lady Michelle Obama made her debut on the campaign trail Friday with a trip to George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, where she encouraged young people to show up to the polls in November.""When I hear folks saying they're not inspired in this election, I disagree,"" Obama said. ""I am inspired because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to do this job and here's what I know for sure. ... Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president."" Pence says he's getting 'whiff of desperation' from DemocratsClinton and her allies brushed off the week's new numbers as an expected development in what the Democratic candidate said was always going to be ""a tight race.""Joel Benenson, Clinton's chief strategist, told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview Thursday that the campaign was still ""playing for 270 electoral votes.""""We are still playing more offense in states around the country and keeping the Trump campaign on defense, particularly in states that are must-wins for them like Virginia and North Carolina,"" Benenson said. ""They're not making us play defense anywhere.""Trump's shakeupThe improvement in Trump's standing comes several weeks after the real estate magnate shook up his campaign team and began delivering more disciplined, teleprompter-guided speeches. Several pollsters and strategists said Thursday that Trump's more measured behavior appears to be reassuring Republicans who were uneasy about voting for him -- and had refused to commit until now.""What's happened as much as anything else is that the election is taking on the contours of the 2012 election to a very large extent,"" said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. ""The ups and downs in the race have depended on the degree to which (Mitt) Romney voters from 2012 considered Trump to be acceptable or beyond the fringe. ... Right now, what we are seeing in the polls is that more Romney voters are willing to go with Trump.""Garin, an adviser to the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action, suggested that, in the long run, there could be an advantage to Trump's calmer demeanor for his Democratic opponent.""When Donald Trump is not behaving, he's sort of like a car crash that people can't help but stop and look at,"" Garin said. ""If Trump is being less outrageous and less titillating, it means that Hillary Clinton has a better chance to get her own message through and have the election litigated on her own terms.""  In a reflective speech Thursday, Clinton said her few days off the trail helped clarify what the 2016 campaign is about. Contrasting her style and tone with her rival's, she once again called Trump ""a loose cannon"" who would put America's gains at risk. Charting her course for the next few weeks, she said she would focus on working families and the challenges facing young people. In a nod to her vulnerabilities, she also acknowledged some of the criticisms of her public persona.""I have been involved in politics one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I have built up some defenses,"" she said. ""When it comes to public service, I am better at the service part than the public part.""But she said she was not ""the showman"" that her opponent is and promised to ""deliver for you and your family,"" which will be one of the cornerstones of her message in the final stretch of the campaign.Down-ballot racesThe closeness of the polls clearly could mean more difficult races for down-ballot Democratic Senate and House candidates who are hoping Clinton's candidacy, and her well-organized operation, will give them a lift at the polls.In New Hampshire this week, for example, Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte opened an 8-point lead over Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan: 52% to 44% among likely voters in a new NBC/WSJ/Marist poll after earlier polls had showed a much closer race.As voters are paying more attention to the race, University of New Hampshire Survey Center Director Andy Smith said Clinton's vulnerabilities are coming into sharper focus and that is having a drag on the ticket. So much attention has been focused on Trump throughout the campaign, he said, that people paid less attention to how unpopular Clinton was.Donald Trump: I'm 'the least racist person'""The candidate who has coattails is the candidate who is going to be able to pull in voters who might not otherwise have voted -- and that's what Obama was able to do in 2008 and 2012, especially among younger voters, African-American voters and minority voters,"" Smith said. But this year, many of those young voters in New Hampshire voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary, Smith noted. ""Obama was able to pull them out in 2008, and to a lesser extent in 2012, and they voted for Democrats down the ticket, but they're much less likely to vote this time around with Clinton at the top of the ticket,"" he said.Some Democrats expect the Obama coalition to coalesce as Election Day draws closer.""There is clearly a gap for Clinton with younger voters that her campaign will pay attention to,"" said Bill Burton, a former adviser to Obama. ""But once younger voters realize that anything but a vote for Clinton is a vote for Trump, the numbers will settle and the artificially high Gary Johnson numbers will come back to earth ... The Obama coalition is lagging in getting behind Clinton, but the debates will help natural gravity set in and bring this race where it will end.""Other Democrats see a bright side to a closer race at the top of the ticket in the sense that it could propel more voters to get out to the polls. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that if Republicans want to believe that this race is tightening, ""let them believe that.""""Because the more our own people see that it's important to vote, and a tight race sort of speaks to that urgency, then more of them will turn out. So it works to our advantage,"" Pelosi said."	Why Democrats are getting anxious	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Romney', 'Ayotte', 'Pence', 'Pelosi', 'Obama']	[]

""What kind of a man does that? A man with a dark and ugly soul.""Later Friday, Trump, at a campaign event in Miami, cited Clinton's push for greater gun control to suggest the Democrat's Secret Service detail should disarm.""Let's see what happens to her,"" Trump said. ""Take their guns away, OK? It'll be very dangerous.""That was the second time in as many months when he appeared to urge violence against Clinton. In August, Trump appeared to suggest that ""Second Amendment people"" could do something about Clinton if she became president and nominated judges who favored gun restrictions. The Trump campaign later said he only meant to increase political engagement, not incite violence.Warren disagreed.""Trump has repeatedly invited his supporters to commit a horrific act of violence against his opponent, against another human being,"" Warren said. ""What kind of a man does that? A bully. A twisted bully who can't fight his own fights.""Warren has been an attack dog of sorts for Clinton ever since she clinched the Democratic nomination, and the real estate mogul has hit back. Trump goes so far as to refer to Warren as ""Pocahontas,"" a reference to her claims of Native American heritage.Warren was but one of many Clinton surrogates hitting the trail in support of her this week. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who, like Warren, appeals to younger and more liberal voters, made two appearances in Ohio on Saturday."

He has been Pence's doctor since March 2013.Busk wrote that Pence exercises four times a week, primarily by riding a bicycle, and neither smokes nor drinks alcohol.Pence suffers from seasonal allergies and the only medication he takes is Claritin, an antihistamine. The governor has had three surgeries, one to repair a hernia in 2015 and the other two to remove for basal cell skin cancers in 2002 and 2010.An exercise stress test in 2014 revealed an asymptomatic left bundle branch block -- a condition, according to the Mayo Clinic, in which there's a delay along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make one's heart beat --but heart valves and chambers appeared normal. Pence follows up with an annual echocardiogram and Busk writes that ""the cardiologists feel you have a very good and strong heart.""Pence's most recent physical was in July; he had a blood pressure rate of 116/81 and a heart rate of 76 beats per minute. Laboratory tests also came back normal, according to Busk.Busk applauds the governor's ""desire to stay healthy,"" and concludes that Pence is ""in excellent general and cardiovascular health."" The presidential running mate is able to maintain ""a high level of professional work"" and perform his physical activity programs ""without limitations,"" Busk added.Pence released the letter after a week in which the candidates' health emerged as a major issue on the campaign trail. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign released additional medical information in the wake of her pneumonia diagnosis, and Donald Trump, Pence's running mate, went on ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" to discuss his health, though he only shared some of the results of a physical check-up he underwent last week.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine also released a letter that stated he was in ""overall excellent health."""

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/17/politics/obama-black-congressional-caucus/index.html	"Addressing the Congressional Black Caucus gala for the last time as president, Obama warned that while his name would not be on the ballot in November, all of the progress that the country has made over the last eight years was on the line. ""If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn't matter who we elect -- read up on your history. It matters. We've got to get people to vote,"" Obama said. ""I will consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy -- if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote.""Obama's speech -- coming less than two months away from Election Day -- marked some of his harshest words yet about Trump, as well as his most forceful call on the black community to get behind Clinton. Why Democrats are anxiousHis remarks also had lighter moments -- particularly as he addressed the so-called ""birther"" controversy. The second-term president began his speech by remarking:  ""There's an extra spring in my step tonight. I don't know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole 'birther' thing is over.""Chuckling, the President said, ""I mean: ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change -- none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate. And to think: that with just a 124 days to go, under the wire, we got that resolved.""Obama was referring to Trump's admission this week that the president was born in the United States. Trump has long supported the birther theory, raising questions about Obama's birthplace and demanding that the president present his birth certificate as proof of his origin. Obama's tone, however, soon turned serious as he outlined what he said was at stake in the election.""You may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or Jim Crow,"" Obama said. ""But we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. We will educate him.""In harsh rebuke of Trump, Obama referred to the businessman as ""somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life.""On Trump's quest to win over African-American voters, Obama quipped: ""Well, we do have challenges, but we're not stupid."" No, Hillary Clinton did not start the 'birther' movementClinton lauds ObamaSpeaking moments before the president, Clinton lauded Obama and also took on the birther controversy that has been swirling.""Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters have represented our country with class, grace and integrity,"" said Clinton, who served as Obama's secretary of state. She added, ""Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you are a great American.""Donald Trump's surreal FridayClinton, who accepted the group's ""Trailblazer Award"" on Saturday night for becoming the first female presidential candidate for a major political party, nodded to Trump when she said that the choice in November ""is not about golf course promotions or birth certificates, it comes down to who will fight for the forgotten.""""We can't let Barack Obama's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that, whose dangerous divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards,"" she said, though she never mentioned Trump's name.Obamas stumping for ClintonClinton's campaign is relying on the Obamas to help persuade the coalition of minorities, young people and women who propelled them to the White House to cast ballots for this year's Democratic candidate. The President made his first solo appeal this week, appearing at a campaign rally in Philadelphia and phoning in to African-American radio to talk up Clinton.""I get frustrated hearing folks say, 'You know, we're so excited with Barack, we love Michelle, they take Hillary for granted,'"" Obama told syndicated host Frankie Darcell. ""This is not a reality show. This is not something where it's all flash and fizzle.""On Friday, First Lady Michelle Obama made her first campaign appearance of 2016, trying to convince  her and her husband's supporters at a Virginia rally that Clinton is also worthy of their votes. ""When I hear folks saying they're not inspired this this election, I disagree. I am inspired,"" she said, urging the crowd to register to vote and actually cast ballots for Clinton."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/17/politics/election-2016-transition-fundraising-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/index.html	"Work is well underway for both camps' transitions. The lesser-known effort is typically separate from the actual campaign, and focuses on developing a plan for policies and staffing of a new administration. In fact, through the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, which has been updated by Congress over the years, transitions are prescribed by law.And so is the fundraising. While the federal government allocates resources for candidates' transition teams ahead of the November general election, including office space and equipment, there isn't public money provided for payroll and travel expenses until after a candidate is declared president-elect.That means the transition teams rely almost exclusively on private donations for any efforts before ballots are cast.Both Clinton and Trump have already begun that effort. Trump's transition effort is helmed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who told financial services lobbyists and executives in Washington last week that the transition has set a goal of $2 million and is nearly halfway there, according to sources in the room. Another person familiar with the transition's fundraising operation separately relayed the same numbers to CNN. Former Republican candidate Mitt Romney raised nearly $4 million for his transition team, as did Barack Obama in 2008, but the Trump camp plans to have a ""leaner"" operation, Christie told the room, including with less staff. He included what was characterized as a ""gentle"" ask for donations in his presentation. Clinton has also begun the fundraising process, though it wasn't clear how much she had raised. A source familiar with their plans said the transition's goal is about $4 million. Both campaigns are raising hundreds of millions of dollars for their campaigns. Clinton raised more than $140 million in August alone through joint committees, and Trump's joint fundraising operation brought in $90 million in August. But transition funding is a separate pot, and subject to different laws. The transition teams set up separate, tax-exempt organizations known as 501(c)(4)s where the money can be raised. The limit per individual is $5,000, by law, and private donations are disclosed publicly. Before the 2012 cycle, all pre-election transition activity was privately funded -- including paying for office space, travel, supplies, and any personnel costs.In 2010, however, lawmakers determined candidates needed to have a more robust operation ahead of the election in order to prepare themselves to take the job on day one. They passed a bill mandating the federal government support pre-election transition efforts through federally-supplied workspace, supplies and travel costs.This year, Congress appropriated $13.7 million for pre-election transition efforts to be divided between the two campaigns through resources. Both have been set up with offices in the same building near the White House. But the federal government doesn't actually supply any actual cash, meaning payroll is entirely up to the transition teams to front. ""To the extent they are doing anything that costs money -- paying for travel, paying for people -- they have to raise independently,"" said Max Stier, the president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, the outside group that helps both transition teams prepare for a possible presidency.That means adequate transition fundraising directly correlates with the strength of the effort.""If they don't have the money, they're not going to be able to have the people to do this operation correctly,"" Stier said. Because the length of time spent working on a transition, many of the more senior people on the staffs end up working essentially as volunteers.Romney's transition effort raised $3.8 million. Some of that was spent before the election, but there were leftover funds when Romney lost. His transition team issued a $1,300 refund for every donor who gave the $5,000 maximum donation. A person involved in the effort said many of the donors reacted with surprise -- it was the first time they remember a political organization returning unused funds.Some of the money also went to producing a book of the transition effort, and some went to charity.When considering donors for the efforts, Stier said it's common for campaigns to approach people who have already contributed the maximum amount to the campaign itself. This provides another avenue for wealthy supporters to express backing for a candidate.He said transition fundraising efforts are a reflection of the transition process as a whole: an vitally important undertaking that both candidates should approach with urgency, even as the bulk of their time is spent actually campaigning for the job.""If you're a thoughtful candidate, you recognize this is going to be true not only in the campaign but when you're president. There are a lot of important things you don't have time to spend time on,"" he said. ""That's why it's so important to have someone in charge you can trust to do an excellent job in running this operation, and who will be given the latitude to do so."""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/16/politics/donald-trump-birther/index.html	"As the ""birther"" controversy swelled around him, he stood before a national television audience seemingly poised to address the issue that launched his political career -- and then he spent 30 minutes delivering an infomercial about his new hotel. As the event was about to wrap, he tossed out a near-throwaway line: ""President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.""Whatever game Trump was playing with the issue in the past few days, it backfired. Trump finally admits it: 'President Barack Obama was born in the United States'Trump never had much of a chance with African-American voters. They are traditionally among the most loyal Democratic supporters, and many black voters viewed Trump's championing of the birther movement since 2011 as a racist effort to delegitimize the first African-American president. But for weeks, the real estate has been trying to appeal to African-Americans with visits to Detroit and Flint, Michigan, as well as speeches accusing the Obama administration of leaving too many black Americans behind in poverty or without good-paying jobs. Those entreaties, in many cases, seemed to backfire. This week, he insulted a black pastor from Flint as a ""nervous mess"" after she interrupted his speech to ask him not to deliver political attacks in her church. And given the animosity toward Trump among African-Americans, the campaign's strategy seemed more keyed to assuaging concerns among some Republican voters and independents that Trump's rhetoric is racist.The strategy of softening Trump's image among reluctant Republicans and independents showed some signs that it was working. This week, Trump's poll numbers inched up in battleground states, and the Clinton-Trump race nationally was deadlocked once again.But Trump's curious moves Thursday night and Friday were a reminder of how quickly his effort can go off the rails. Black congressional leaders, along with Clinton's campaign, pilloried Trump's brief statement on Obama's birthplace -- which was not an apology, an explanation or even an admission that he was the loudest promoter of the birther movement. At a press conference, member of the Congressional Black Caucus urged voters to register and get out and vote this November. ""We are used to dog whistles, but the thing we are not used to are the howls of wolves. These are howls, not whistles,"" said Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. That disdain for Trump could well become an asset to Clinton's campaign, particularly among younger African-American voters who aren't excited about her candidacy and might have otherwise stayed home. Moreover, Trump was widely derided Friday for his false claim that ""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy"" and that ""I finished it."" Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, called Trump's actions ""disgraceful.""""After five years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory into the mainstream, it was appalling to watch Trump appoint himself the judge of whether the President of the United States is American,"" Mook said in a statement. ""This sickening display shows more than ever why Donald Trump is totally unfit be president.""While some 2008 supporters of Clinton used Internet blogs to raise questions about Obama's birthplace, the Clinton campaign never promoted the conspiracy theories. The Clinton campaign, in fact, severed ties with a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded an email promoting the birther conspiracy, according to Clinton's 2008 campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle. 14 of Trump's most outrageous 'birther' claims -- half from after 2011Clinton's campaign clearly intends to use Trump's puzzling revival of the birther controversy as its latest illustration of why he is not fit to be commander in chief. Her campaign argued Friday that Trump's embrace of the birther movement ""turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure."" ""Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African-American president,"" Clinton's campaign tweeted. ""He can't just take it back.""While this issue is sure to rage on -- and come up in first the debate between Clinton and Trump -- the current commander in chief apparently is ready to turn to other topics. ""I think when the President released the long form version of his birth certificate in this room five years ago he was hoping that people would move on,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in the White House briefing room.""With regard to an apology"" from Trump, Earnest said, ""I don't think the President much cares.""

In an exclusive interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on ""Outfront,"" Dan Levinson said White House officials ""told us that they are working on the case, and they are not going to rest until he is home safe to us.""Levinson said the family realizes time is of the essence since there will be a new administration in January.""We are hoping with this limited time window and with Iranian elections coming up that the urgency is now more than ever and that they are doing everything they can to bring him home,"" he said.Levinson was not among five American hostages that Iran released in January. The Obama administration said $400 million that was part of $1.7 billion owed to Iran was withheld until the hostages were released, but has insisted it was not a ransom payment. Sarah Moriarty, Levinson's daughter, said that left the family ""absolutely devastated"" and it was difficult to accept since ""it's been nine and a half years that he has been without basic human rights.""The payment to Iran also upset Dan Levinson.""There was a lot of leverage and avenues that they could engage with the Iranians,"" he said. ""That was a lot of money and obviously we would have liked to see if there was any kind of connection with that and then that should have been more than enough to bring my dad home.""The Levinson family says it fully believes that Robert Levinson is alive, and that all indications from the FBI and investigators support that. Asked if she had a message for her father, Moriarity said, ""It's always we love you. We will never stop until you come home. You have so many people here fighting every single day to bring you home, and we love you very much, and you have several grandchildren that can't wait to meet their Grandpa Bob.""FBI investigators believe Robert Levinson, if he is still alive, is being held in Iran, US officials briefed on the investigation told CNN in January.Levinson vanished after traveling to the Iranian island of Kish in March 2007. His family has said he was looking into cigarette smuggling, and the FBI has said he was working on behalf of several large corporations. An email obtained by the family indicated he was trying to investigate corruption involving Iranian officials.But he was also doing independent contract work for the CIA at the time, the Levinson family eventually confirmed.The CIA has not confirmed that allegation. But three CIA employees -- including Levinson's handler -- were eventually fired, and seven others disciplined in connection with the case, and the CIA paid the family $2.5 million to avoid a lawsuit, a family attorney has told CNN."

The US embargo on Cuba still remains officially in place, but Obama loosened a series of regulations to  allow more US companies to sell their products in Cuba. Obama has also argued that the reopening would help make Cuba a freer society by helping open the country to the world.Asked in September 2015 about the opening with Cuba, Trump said, ""I think it's fine.""""I think it's fine. But we should have made a better deal. The concept of opening with Cuba — 50 years is enough — the concept of opening with Cuba is fine. I think we should have made a stronger deal,"" he told The Daily Caller.Trump also said in March that he would consider opening a hotel in Cuba.""Maybe it won't work out, but I will tell you, I think Cuba has a certain potential and I think it's OK to bring Cuba into the fold,"" Trump told CNN."

""I think they are tough states, but they're states we can win in.""The move is a reflection of a rapidly shifting terrain, where GOP senators -- and Donald Trump -- are gaining a surge of support in crucial states, narrowing the Democrats' path to hold the White House and win back the Senate majority.

Marco Rubio in Florida and Rob Portman in Ohio up by double digits against their respective foes.On Friday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee made plans to spend another $4.2 million in North Carolina, on top of an additional $2 million in Missouri, according to a source familiar with the matter. It plans to keep its reservations in Florida for the final three weeks of the campaign and final two weeks in Ohio -- for now.Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said ""I surely do,"" when asked if he believed Democrats could win the three red states. ""We know that we're in a horserace. We're in a fight. It's going to be very expensive -- hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent in these competitive Senate races.""Republicans view the heightened Democratic focus on red-state battlegrounds as an implicit recognition that the map has significantly narrowed, and that their adversaries now have a tougher climb to the majority. But top Republicans are warning that they could lose those states even though they typically vote GOP, urging their donors -- and their candidates -- to step it up.Republican groups, including the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC tied to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and its allied non-profit, plan to drop a combined $16 million in those three states alone, according to an official with the group.In Missouri, where Democrats are targeting incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, the party has ramped up its ad reservations substantially, with groups now planning to spend at least $8 million from now until Election Day to help their candidate, Jason Kander, according to media tracking sources.The DSCC has now reserved nearly $7 million in new ads targeting GOP Sen. Richard Burr in North Carolina, in the hopes of giving a boost to Democrat Deborah Ross, who polls say is trailing by just a few points. Republicans have privately raised concerns that Burr has not run an aggressive campaign against Ross, giving Democrats hopes of pulling off an upset. And in Indiana, where former Sen. Evan Bayh's campaign has already spent roughly $5 million so far, his campaign and Democratic groups have reserved nearly $6 million for the fall campaign -- in line with the amount of cash the GOP plans to bolster Rep. Todd Young's candidacy. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's allied super PAC, Senate Majority PAC, is ramping up spending in Indiana as well. ""I think they're running out of targets,"" Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said of Democrats. ""It's evidence that the election is looking more positive for us and more desperate for them.""Despite the heightened focus on these three states, the battle for control of the Senate still extends into blue and purple states as well. To win back the Senate, Democrats need to pick up four seats if Hillary Clinton wins the White House, five if Trump wins. They are ahead in two Democratic-leaning states, Wisconsin and Illinois, and have a serious shot at winning in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Moreover, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, remains a Democratic target, but he has opened up a double-digit lead in recent polls over Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. Plus, Democrats need to hold onto the seat being vacated by Reid in Nevada, where polls show GOP Rep. Joe Heck in a dead heat with his challenger, Catherine Cortez Masto.On Friday, Reid dismissed all the polls, predicting his party would retake the Senate majority.""I don't buy your silliness with your $500 polls you go out and buy overnight,"" Reid told CNN. ""I don't believe them. They're not right. They're incorrect.""Reid added: ""Donald Trump will never be elected president of the United States. We're going to retake the Senate.""Tester, the DSCC chairman, said that he has not given up on Florida and Ohio, saying that the Democratic candidates there -- Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy and former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland -- still can win, despite the polls.""Those are states the presidential is going to be playing in,"" Tester said. ""We've got good candidates, and I think things are going to tighten up for us in states where we're behind.""But both sides are still influenced heavily by the top of their ticket. And with Clinton's struggles of late, Democrats are having a hard time running significantly ahead of her. Tester said he'd advise candidates to make their own decisions to campaign with Clinton.""I think it depends on the candidate,"" Tester said. ""It depends on the state, depends on what they feel comfortable with."" Wicker added that Trump now is helping his candidates down-ticket, a sharp shift from weeks ago when the Senate GOP was running away from its nominee.""I think the top of the ticket helps,"" Wicker said. ""To the extent that voters are motivated to get out and vote in a close race, I think it helps us down-ticket."""
