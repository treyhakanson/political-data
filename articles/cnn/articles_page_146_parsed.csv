Giuliani was attacking Hillary Clinton in an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press"" the morning after Trump said -- with no evidence -- at a rally: ""I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really folks, really, why should she be?""Not mentioned by Trump: He's had three divorces and faced accusations of infidelity himself. So has the thrice-married Giuliani. Todd asked Giuliani if he's the right person to criticize Clinton's marriage. Giuliani cited his pre-mayoral career as a Justice Department prosecutor.""I'm the right person to level this charge, because I've never made such a charge, and I've prosecuted people who've committed rape,"" he said. But, Todd responded, ""You have your own infidelity charge."" ""Well, everybody does,"" Giuliani said. ""And I'm a Roman Catholic, and I confess those things to my priest. But I've never ever attacked someone who's been the victim ... of sexual abuse. Not only that, I put people in jail who've been the victim of sexual abuse."" Then, Giuliani complained about Todd's line of questioning. ""And I think your bringing up my personal life really is kind of irrelevant to what Hillary Clinton did. She's running for president, I'm not,"" said Giuliani, himself a presidential candidate in 2008, when he sought the GOP nomination, unsuccessfully."

Hillary Clinton, who has met with Black Lives Matter protesters, said in their presidential debate last week that Trump ""has a long record of engaging in racist behavior."" She also famously declared that half of Trump's supporters are part of a ""basket of deplorables"" -- including racists. Trump, meanwhile, has inflamed racial tensions by retweeting false crime statistics about African-Americans, comparing largely black inner cities to Afghanistan and claiming that African-Americans face their worst conditions ""ever, ever, ever."" He also rose to political prominence by pushing birtherism -- the bogus and racially-fueled theory that President Barack Obama was born outside the United States.Twitter user @AngryBlkManDC posted a video Saturday of the Trump International Hotel being spray painted.The graffiti was reported to police at 4 p.m. Saturday, said Metropolitan Police spokeswoman Aquita Brown. The graffiti is now being covered up with plywood, and no arrests have been made.Patricia Tang, director of Sales and Marketing at Trump International Hotel, declined to comment on the graffiti. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.This story has been updated."	Trump's DC hotel vandalized with 'Black Lives Matter' graffiti	['Black', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

They're angry, they're disgusted, at what they see as a corrupt political system in this country,"" the Vermont senator told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" Trump has refused to release his tax returns. But the 1995 records, obtained by The New York Times, showed him posting a loss large enough that he could offset it by legally avoiding paying income taxes for an 18-year period.What Trump tax report could mean for his campaignThe paper did not look at his federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax return as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns.CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity.Sanders, who lost the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton, on Sunday chided Trump for hypocrisy.""You've got some middle class people working longer hours for lower wages -- they pay their taxes, they support their schools, they support their infrastructure, they support the military. But the billionaires? No, they don't have to do that, because they have their friends on Capitol Hill. They pay zero in taxes,"" Sanders said. ""So Trump goes around and says, 'Hey, I'm worth billions, I'm a successful businessman. But I don't pay any taxes. But you, you make $15 an hour? You pay the taxes, not me,'"" he said.

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-health/index.html	"Straying from the prepared remarks on his teleprompter, the Republican nominee reignited his attacks on Hillary Clinton's physical and mental health, arguing that the former secretary of state ""could be crazy"" and lacks the ""stamina"" to be president -- even imitating Clinton stumbling into her car while leaving a 9/11 ceremony last month. And just as he is once again drawing attention to former President Bill Clinton's sex scandals, Trump took his political attacks a step further, questioning, with no evidence, whether the Democratic nominee is ""loyal"" to her husband. The attacks came as The New York Times raised fresh questions about his payment of taxes and business success.Trump's personally charged rhetoric comes as he continues to defend his performance at the first presidential debate last Monday and as he is working to swat away renewed Republican distress over his candidacy after he doubled down on the latest controversy, drawing attention away from his core campaign message.""She's got bad temperament. She could be crazy. She could actually be crazy,"" Trump said, turning away from his teleprompters.That's a revival of the line of attack Trump employed nearly two months ago, when he blasted Clinton as ""unbalanced"" and ""totally unhinged,"" suggesting she ""took a short-circuit in the brain.""""Honestly, I don't think she's all there,"" he said during an August 6 rally.Those remarks came before he shook up his campaign leadership and reshaped his campaign into one pockmarked by fewer controversies and a heavier focus on policy.But Trump trained his focus Saturday night not on the issues that have lifted his candidacy, but instead on leveling a series of nasty political attacks on his rival.""I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really folks, really, why should she be?"" Trump said, apparently calling into question Clinton's marital fidelity to her husband in his most direct terms yet.And as he slammed her for her work as secretary of state and pointed to the slew of problems confronting the United States around the world, Trump also raised an incident weeks ago when Clinton stumbled and needed Secret Service agents to hoist her into her van as she left a 9/11 memorial ceremony.""She's supposed to fight all of these different things and she can't make it 15 feet to her car? give me a break. give me a break,"" he said. ""Give me a break! She's home resting right now. She's getting ready for her next speech which is going to be about 2 or 3 minutes.""Trump then began to stagger on stage, imitating the medical incident Clinton faced when leaving the 9/11 ceremony.Clinton's doctor revealed later that day that Clinton had just been diagnosed with pneumonia and ""overheated"" at the ceremony.And while Trump has largely resisted overtly attacking Clinton over the incident or raising questions about her health, he has lately begun pumping up that line of attack.Trump delivered his fiery speech before a large crowd of several thousand that waited more than 90 minutes past the rally's slated start time -- and Trump served up his most original, bombastic self that voters got to know best during the Republican primaries.The punches continued to roll as Trump delved further into his speech -- and most appeared to come as tangents to his prepared remarks.""She's an incompetent woman,"" he said.""She's never done anything meaningful. Never. Her only legacy is death, tremendous financial loss and failure,"" he added later."	Trump brings up Clinton's health, questions if she's 'loyal' to Bill	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Tapper was pressing Sanders about audio clips obtained from a hack into a Democratic staffer's emails posted late Friday by the conservative Washington Free Beacon. Speaking to a gathering of campaign supporters in February, Clinton said some of Sanders' followers ""are new to politics completely. They're children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents' basement.""She continued: ""If you're feeling like you're consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot, and doesn't have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. I think we all should be really understanding of that.""Clinton gives frank take on Sanders supporters in audio from hacked emailAsked if those comments bothered him, Sanders said: ""Of course it does, but we are in the middle of a campaign ... If you go to some of the statements I made about Hillary Clinton, we have real differences.""Still, he said the two have worked together since the end of the Democratic primary on proposals such as providing affordable public college tuition and expanding access to health care through increased funding for community health centers. ""What Secretary Clinton and I have done since the election, since the primary nominating process, we have worked together in a number of areas,"" he said. Asked about those comments in particular, Sanders shook his head ""yes"" and said he agreed with Clinton. ""They are living in their parents' basement, and that's the point,"" he said, arguing that many young people have been denied economic opportunity since the recession. Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, also defended the audio clip on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, criticizing the press coverage of it.""I really encourage everybody to listen to that full audio,"" Mook said. ""The original piece that came out on it had to have the headline changed because it completely mischaracterized what she was talking about. She was talking about young people that she'd met who were frustrated that they graduated from college and went into an economy where they couldn't find the job they wanted.""This story has been updated."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/02/politics/donald-trump-taxes-fallout-questions/index.html	"The New York Times report that the Republican presidential nominee reported a $916 million loss in 1995 -- and could have gone 18 years without paying federal income taxes as a result -- has set off new questions about Trump's refusal to release his tax returns and his business acumen. The Times did not look at his federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax return as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns.CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by The Times.Mounting questions about Trump's businesses and finances are set to test Republicans' loyalty to the party's nominee. And they will test Trump's temperament as well, the week before his second debate with Hillary Clinton. Here are six questions about Trump's taxes and the political fallout: Did Trump pay income taxes? We still don't know. The bottom line: Unless and until he releases his personal income tax returns, as every other presidential nominee since 1976 has, there's no way to verify what Trump has or hasn't paid. However, Trump's $916 million loss in 1995 -- around the time his Atlantic City casinos were going bust -- could be spread out over a total of 18 years to offset the taxable profits he earned from other businesses. It's possible Trump lost money other years, as well, which could be used similarly. And he has a slew of tax breaks available to real estate developers. Trump's steadfast refusal to release his tax returns -- the last 12 years' worth are under ""routine audit,"" he's said repeatedly -- make it impossible to know what he's paid. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump?What's the immediate political damage? Trump has just five weeks left to Election Day -- and the next several days are all but certain to be dominated by questions about whether he pays taxes. Any hope Trump had of dodging and deflecting on the issue through November 8 is now gone. Even more troubling: He just spent a week feuding with a former Latina Miss Universe who he had publicly ridiculed as ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping"" 20 years ago -- and who he continued insisting was overweight last week, rather than dropping the issue. At this stage in the tightly contested race, Trump's momentum has stalled and time is an increasingly precious resource. Unless he is suddenly willing to share much more information about his taxes, he'll have squandered two important weeks as early voting is underway in several key states.Is 'genius' very smart? The messaging out of Trump Tower has been clear: If Trump didn't pay federal income taxes, it makes him a ""genius."" How Trump could lose a billion bucks but still live a billionaire lifeIt was the buzzword coming from Trump's top surrogates on the Sunday shows. ""The reality is, this is part of our tax code. The man's a genius. He knows how to operate the tax code to the benefit of the people he's serving,"" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" ""There's no one who's shown more genius in their way to maneuver around the tax code and to rightfully use the laws to do that,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on ""Fox News Sunday."" But labeling Trump a ""genius"" when so many questions remain unanswered is politically problematic because it implies that Trump in fact did not pay taxes. And if he's a genius for not paying income taxes, what does that make everybody who does? Will this hurt Trump in the Rust Belt?The case for Trump has long been that hard-working Americans -- particularly in the Rust Belt -- have been unfairly hammered by outside forces like immigration and globalization. By refusing to directly address the questions raised by The New York Times report, Trump's campaign so far has left open the possibility that those workers for years have paid more in federal income taxes than Trump, despite his vast wealth. If the revelations on Trump's taxes leave Trump looking like a beneficiary of the status quo in Washington, it could become harder for him to sell himself as an outsider in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, where he desperately needs wins.  There is evidence that a majority of voters believe it is important that presidential candidates release their tax records.In a Monmouth University poll last month, 62% of those asked thought it was very important or somewhat important for candidates to show their tax records.Will Trump face more pressure to release his tax returns? Yes -- particularly now that new questions have been raised. That pressure could be amplified by members of Trump's own party. Congressional Republicans will be asked a new round of questions about Trump's taxes, and some could call on him to release his returns. It's also sure to be a hot topic in the vice presidential debate, pitting Trump's running mate Mike Pence against Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine on Tuesday night. Add this to the list of questions Trump has left unanswered: Has he paid income taxes? Why did he suddenly decide President Barack Obama was born in the United States? What keeps him from dropping distracting personal feuds with people like Alicia Machado and Rosie O'Donnell? In each public appearance and interview this week, Trump will be asked questions related to his taxes. He will likely answer by bashing the media and pivoting to attacks on Clinton -- which will only perpetuate the questions. Will Trump react by attacking Clinton? Over the course of the 2016 campaign, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he reacts to personal slights by lashing out angrily -- often with attacks on individuals that come at a political cost, such as his criticism of Indiana-born Judge Gonzalo Curiel's Mexican heritage and the Gold Star Khan family. The tax revelations won't just create new pressure for Trump to release his returns, they'll raise questions about the credibility of Trump's claims he has created a ""great company."" Trump offered a glimpse of the bare-knuckled style he's returning to Saturday night in Pennsylvania, as news of his $916 million loss in 1995 broke. He said Clinton ""could be crazy"" and lacks the ""stamina"" to be president -- even imitating Clinton stumbling into her car while leaving a 9/11 ceremony last month. And he questioned, with no evidence, whether the Democratic nominee is ""loyal"" to her husband.""I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really folks, really, why should she be?"" Trump said Saturday, apparently calling into question Clinton's marital fidelity to her husband -- without evidence -- in his most direct terms yet.He willl campaign in northern Virginia and Colorado on Monday, followed by Arizona on Tuesday, in what will be the first tests of his temperament and handling of tax return questions.

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-notorious-rbg/index.html	"Ginsburg reveals that the original plan was to publish the book, ""My Own Words,"" only after the release of a biography that has been in the works since 2003. But her authorized biographers, ""thought it best,"" Ginsburg writes, ""to defer final composition of the biography until my court years neared completion.""  With a biography nowhere on the horizon, a presidential election raging and a court limping along with eight members, Ginsburg is keeping her plans quiet for now. The book on sale Tuesday is a compilation of a lifetime of Ginsburg's writings and speeches, including everything from her eighth-grade thoughts on women's suffrage to her 1996 landmark bench announcement striking down the all-male admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute. And it reveals a more personal side of the unlikely icon who has inspired operas, tattoos, T-shirts and millions of young women who never knew that the law was once reserved for male lawyers. Here are 10 highlights: A Nancy Drew-loving ""twirler""""Kiki"" Bader grew up in a working-class neighborhood in New York where she learned the cello and was a ""twirler,"" performing with her baton at football games and even a Manhattan parade. She was heavily influenced by a mother who always wished she could have furthered her own education. Celia Bader's advice? ""Be a lady"" which meant, in part, that one wasn't to let emotions like anger or envy get in her way, and ""be independent.""The young Ginsburg spent Friday afternoons at the library, housed between a Chinese restaurant and a beauty parlor, reading Nancy Drew. According to Ginsburg: ""Nancy was a girl who did things. She was adventuresome, daring and her boyfriend was a much more passive type than she was."" An unlikely mentorShe credits her Cornell college professor, Vladimir Nabokov, the writer known for the novel Lolita, with improving her writing skills. According to Ginsburg, she took Nabokov's advice to use words ""to paint pictures.""In the book she tells her biographers, ""I try to give people the picture in not too many words, and I strive to find the right words."" Last term, Nabokov's advice was evident when Ginsburg joined an opinion of the court to strike down a Texas abortion law. In a brief two-page concurrence -- laced with a flourish of French -- Ginsburg got right to the point: ""When a state severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, faute de mieux, at great risk to their health and safety."" Partner in lifeGinsburg's more than half-century marriage to noted tax expert Martin ""Marty"" Ginsburg, who died in 2010, was one of Washington's most legendary pairings. Besides his legal expertise, he often told audiences that he took over the kitchen at the demand of their two children who recoiled at the idea of their mother's pot roast. The book includes a 2003 speech Marty gave summing up their marriage. The two were attending a play in New York just after the release of Bush v. Gore, the controversial opinion that cleared the way for George W. Bush's presidency. As they walked down the aisle at intermission, the entire audience began to applaud and Ginsburg ""beamed."" Marty reveals that he leaned over and whispered to his wife, ""I bet you didn't know there's a convention of tax lawyers in town,"" at which point he writes, said, ""without changing her bright smile, Ruth smacked me right in the stomach, but not too hard."" Pathmaker: The Stephen Wiesenfeld caseAs a young lawyer, she blazed trails to fight laws that discriminated on the basis of gender. Ginsburg, a keen tactician, knew that it would be particularly powerful if she could show that gender discrimination hurt men as well as women. As such, she represented Stephen Wiesenfeld, who fought a provision of the Social Security Act after his wife died in childbirth. As Ginsburg explained it in 2008: Wiesenfeld ""sought to care for the baby personally, but was denied child-in-care Social Security benefits then available only to widowed mothers, not to widowed fathers. Stephen Wiesenfield won a unanimous judgment in the Supreme Court."" Supreme Court nomination President Bill Clinton waited until after an NBA Finals basketball game to call Ginsburg to offer her the job on the high court in 1993. But the phone line, from the White House kitchen, went dead three times. Finally, Clinton got it right. ""If I'm going to propose,"" he joked to Ginsburg, ""we might as well have a good line.""One would think the first time that Justice Elena Kagan and Ginsburg shared a hearing room it would have been at the Supreme Court after Kagan was seated in 2010. Not so. Ginsburg reveals that during her confirmation hearing in 1993, she stared up at then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden. Sitting behind him was Kagan, who was serving as special counsel to Biden during the hearings.Sandra Day O'ConnorIn a 2015 speech, Ginsburg praised Sandra Day O'Connor as a ""true cowgirl, resourceful, resilient, equipped to cope with whatever fortune brings her way."" She spoke of the time the ""incomparable"" O'Connor invited the Olympic women's basketball team to the Supreme Court's basketball court that is often referred to as the ""highest court in the land.""One of the players passed O'Connor the ball and she missed the first shot, ""but the second went right through the hoop.""Early writings on faithGinsburg's biographers reveal that while her immediate family was not ""devoutly religious,"" Jewish traditions were very much a part of her childhood even though at times she resented an adherence to ""seemingly hypocritical rules and the inferior role assigned to women."" She did, however, respect Rabbi Stephen S. Wise. In 1946, a 13-year-old Ruth Bader served on the editorial staff of the bulletin of the East Midwood Jewish Center, where she wrote in praise of Wise, calling him a ""champion of every righteous cause,"" adding that he was a ""valiant fighter"" for women's suffrage.Ginsburg the jockShe may appear frail, sitting on the bench in her robe and frilly lace collars. Not so. The book includes a picture of her on the elliptical sporting a ""Super Diva"" sweatshirt. It seems she has slowed down a bit, however. A few years ago, she did 30 push-ups twice a week and now she is down to a mere 20. That might be 20 more than some of her colleagues on the bench would be able to achieve. She told The New York Times in 2013 that she's had to give up one passion: waterskiing.Cultural rock star -- and a fishThere's an opera, a play, a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit, and an upcoming movie starring Natalie Portman (development was delayed --Ginsburg told an audience last year — because Portman insisted on a woman director.) But that's just the beginning:The preschool class at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, Texas, named their class fish ""Ruth Beta Ginsburg."" And scientists named an entire species of praying mantis, Ilomantis ginsburgae, in honor of Ginsburg. (Apparently the species' neck plate resembles the jabots Ginsburg wears in court.) Asked when she thinks there will be enough women on the court, she answers: ""when there are nine.""Retirement speculationGinsburg mentions little about her own retirement, widely speculated to occur at some point if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency. But in one speech in 2013, she offered some clues, quoting her onetime boss, the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who compared judging with refereeing a basketball game. Rehnquist said that a judge has an obligation to ""call it as he saw it"" even if it's a foul against the home team.""The day a judge shirks from that responsibility, Chief Justice Rehnquist counseled, is the day he or she should resign from office. I heartily concur in the counsel,"" she said. In the conclusion of the new book, her biographers refer back to comments Ginsburg has made in the past saying she will stay on the court ""as long as I can do the job full steam.""Her biographers say that the quality of her reasoning, her mental acuity, her stamina and her public engagement mean that ""there is no question that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg continues to 'do the job full steam.'"""	10 things you didn't know about the 'Notorious RBG'	['Portman', 'Clinton']	['abortion']
