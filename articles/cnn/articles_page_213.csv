Obama has tried to portray himself as the eco-warrior-in-chief over the past eight years. He's pushed the world to act on climate change -- which he calls the greatest threat to future generations -- and he's using his powers as president to turn at-risk areas, like the waters around Midway, into national monuments.  WHERE AND WHAT IS MIDWAY?Midway is a tiny ring of coral reef in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean, more than 1,300 miles and three hours by plane from Honolulu, where Obama was born. It's part of the Hawaiian archipelago, but it's the only island that isn't technically part of the state of Hawaii.If the name ""Midway"" sounds familiar, it's because the island is where the US scored its most famous naval victory, defeating Japan at the Battle of Midway in 1942. The battle transformed the Second World War in the Pacific, but today Midway is on the front lines of a different conflict -- the fight to save the world's oceans. WHY WAS OBAMA THERE? Obama visited Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument to underscore the efforts he's taken to preserve some of the world's threatened ecosystems. Last week, he quadrupled the area of the sanctuary to nearly the size of the Gulf of Mexico. On Thursday, he toured the island and met the managers of the refuge, which is home to more than 7,000 marine and bird species. Obama pledged to ensure ""not only that Midway itself is protected, that the entire ecosystem will be able to generate the kind of biodiversity that allows us to study it, research and understand our oceans better than we ever have before.""Endangered monk seals, green turtles and tiger sharks are among the species that share the fragile marine environment in Midway, which is also home to 19 bird species like the black-footed albatross and red-footed booby. MIDWAY BY THE NUMBERSOnly 50 people live on Midway, which means the island's population tripled when Obama and his 100-member entourage of staff and journalists arrived.But 1.5 million Laysan albatross call Midway home. The albatross carry five tons of plastic onto the island each year — plastic that was created, consumed and then dumped by humans, and is now is being fed by these birds to their chicks. WHY YOU SHOULD CAREThe plastic bags, coffee cups and toothbrushes we use each day don't magically disappear when we throw them away. Some plastic gets recycled, but a lot of it — 8 million tons each year — ends up in the world's oceans. CNN visited Midway this summer, where an endless plastic tide washes up on shore every day, poisoning and killing the island's rich wildlife. Plastic is part of the sand and part of the fish, and experts fear it could be making its way into the food we eat.Our exclusive documentary from one of the remotest island chains on the planet is due out soon. It explores the damage that plastic pollution is doing to the world — and the damage it could be doing to you."	Why Obama visited this tiny Pacific island

But the President hopes the trek will help underscore the efforts he's taken to preserve some of the world's threatened ecosystems.The White House announced last week that Obama was quadrupling the size of the Papahanaumokuakea marine sanctuary, which includes Midway. Upon arriving Thursday shortly before noon, the President emerged from Air Force One and was met by Midway residents.""Let me start by saying that this is hallowed ground,"" Obama said, noting that this was the site of the 1942 Battle of Midway, where ""a number of young men lost their lives here ... For us to be able to visit this monument and remind ourselves of the sailors and airmen and everyone involved who were able to rebuff the Japanese force, that was vastly outnumbered, is a testament to their courage and their perseverance.""""It is also spectacular as an ecosystem, and our ability to not just designate but build on this incredible natural beauty that is home to 7,000 marine species, that sees millions of birds, many of them endangered, sea turtles, Hawaiian monk seals, black coral, all sorts of species that in many other places we no longer see, we'll extend that 550,000 miles in ways that ensure not only that Midway itself is protected, that the entire ecosystem will be able to generate the kind of biodiversity that allows us to study it, research and understand our oceans better than we ever have before.""The President was also planning to snorkel off the coast of the atoll, according to a pool report.Obama was going to ""interact directly"" with some of the wildlife, according to his top climate adviser Brian Deese, though he didn't specify what that might entail. Two-dozen bird species, including the black-footed albatross and red-footed booby, occupy the island, as well as dozens of coral reef-dwelling fish in the surrounding water.Endangered monk seals, green turtles and tiger sharks are among the other species that share the fragile marine environment there.RELATED: Obama to meet Erdogan amid anti-ISIS squabbleObama isn't the first president to visit Midway; Richard Nixon held secret talks there with the South Vietnamese president in 1969. Former first lady Laura Bush also visited Midway during her husband's presidency.Like his visit last year to the Alaskan wilderness, Obama hopes his stop in a remote and threatened environment will prompt more Americans to take climate change seriously. He made his case for taking action during remarks near Lake Tahoe Wednesday, warning against electing leaders who deny warming temperatures are the result of human activity.""The fact is it is man-made,"" Obama said. ""It's not 'we think it is man-made,' it's not, 'we guess it is man-made,' it's not, 'a lot of people are saying it's man-made,' it's not, 'I'm not a scientist so I don't know.' You don't have to be scientist. You have to read, or listen to scientists, to know that the overwhelming body of scientific evidence shows us that climate change is caused by human activity.""He was participating in a yearly summit organized by Nevada Sen. Harry Reid.Obama hopes to further solidify his climate agenda when he travels onward from Midway to the Group of 20 summit in China. He sealed an historic climate accord with Beijing in 2014, and officials said they hope to further cooperation during his bilateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday."

""And then we heard yesterday, and I was totally disappointed -- not surprised, but disappointed -- and slightly misled, because he gave the impression and the campaign gave the impression until yesterday morning that he was going to deal with the undocumented in a compassionate way."" Trump on immigration: No amnesty, no pivotTrump on Wednesday returned to the same immigration rhetoric that saw him clinch the GOP nomination, telling an audience in Phoenix that there would be ""no amnesty"" for undocumented migrants living in the United States under his presidency.Aguilar, who has been critical of Trump's tone and posture on race and immigration in the past, slammed Trump for his plan, with Aguilar describing it as being ""even worse than what he initially proposed.""""They're going to leave the country, self-deport or be removed, and there's no guarantee that they will return,"" Aguilar said. ""I mean that speech was a restrictionist speech. And I just think he's embraced Jeff Sessions and people like Ann Coulter and forgotten about building a coalition to win this election. I'm so sorry, but I just can't be part of that.""Mexican president disputes Trump over border wall payment discussion But Aguilar remained adamant that he would still not vote for Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, in November.""I mean, people who think that she's (Clinton) committed to immigration reform, she's misleading them just like Donald Trump misled us,"" Aguilar said. ""So, look, I don't think we have a good choice right now. I think I have to talk to our coalition of leaders and figure out, you know, what our next step is, but certainly, it's not going to be to support Trump nor Hillary Clinton.""Aguilar's announcement follows a report by Politico on Wednesday that high-profile Latino Trump surrogates, including Trump National Hispanic Advisory Council member Jacob Monty, were wavering in their support after the address at the Phoenix Convention Center.Clinton: In Mexico 'Trump just failed his first foreign test'Monty also officially distanced himself from the Republican Party's standard-bearer Thursday, telling CNN he had stepped down from the council.""We need more security but when he called for the deportation of (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, that is just unrealistic, cruel, (and) not productive for the economy because they're working, they're going to school,"" Monty told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. ""And the biggest thing for me was when he completely punted on the issue of what to do with the 11 million, when we discussed that with him.""Monty added, ""And when I saw that, I had to resign because I'm not going to be a prop for his image like the president of Mexico was yesterday.""Monty said he too was not prepared to vote for Clinton and had decided not to vote for either of the candidates at the top of the ticket, supporting Republicans further down the ballot instead."

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/iran-exemptions-nuclear-deal/index.html	"The alleged granting of ""secret"" exemptions to Iran by the Joint Commission, the deal's implementing body, is likely to thrust the controversial accord, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), back into the political spotlight. The report says ""most of the conditions"" laid out in the agreement ""were met by Iran"" but it also claims Iran would have not been in compliance by January 16, 2016, the deal's so-called Implementation Day, without the exemptions to the requirement that Iran limit its stockpile of low enriched uranium to under 300-kilograms. The exemptions supposedly pertained to uranium in ""waste form,"" according to the report, but the authors noted that that waste was potentially recoverable. The report's authors, David Albright and Andrea Stricker, went on to blast President Barack Obama's administration for keeping these exemptions secret.  ""Any rationale for keeping these exemptions secret appears unjustified,"" the report said.Albright told CNN that the additional low enriched uranium could reduce the amount of time needed for Iran to develop a nuclear bomb if it decided to break the accord.  The report said another exemption allowed Iran to operate 19 ""hot cells"" larger than specified in the accords, larger hot cells could be used to produce plutonium, which can also be used to produce a nuclear weapon. ""We were also worried that these exemptions or decisions by the Joint Commission set bad precedents that Iran is going to use to try and further weaken the conditions of the Iran deal,"" added Albright, a physicist and expert on Iran's nuclear program.The report's conclusions were first published by Reuters. The State Department pushed back Thursday on the report's findings but noted that the workings of the Joint Commission were always confidential and therefore declined to discuss specifics of the commission's work.""The Joint Commission has not and will not loosen any of the commitments and has not provided any exceptions that would allow Iran to retain or process material In excess of its (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) limits that it could use in a breakout scenario,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said Thursday.""There's been no cutting of slack,"" he added. The White House also criticized the report Thursday, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying the administration had ""significant objections"" to it.""Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That's not my opinion. That's not rhetoric. That is not a conjecture. That is a fact that is verified by independent international experts who, because of the agreement, now have the kind of access that is required to verify it,"" Earnest said.Kirby said that the International Atomic Energy Agency had also confirmed that Iran was fulfilling its obligations under the deal, noting that Iran's ""breakout"" period for obtaining a nuclear weapon had been extended from several months to a year as a result of the deal.A senior State Department official offered an even more strident rebuttal, telling CNN, ""The United States and its partners did not and will not allow Iran to skirt its JCPOA commitments.""The official said that Iran met all of its commitments on implementation day and that ""Any assertion to the contrary is completely false.""""Iran has never been over its 300 kilogram limit for low enriched uranium,"" the official added. The White House also criticized the report Thursday, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying the administration had ""significant objections.""""Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That's not my opinion. That's not rhetoric. That is not a conjecture. That is a fact that is verified by independent international experts who, because of the agreement, now have the kind of access that is required to verify it,"" Earnest said.Republicans were quick to use the report's conclusions to criticize the administration.""This latest report further confirms that the Obama administration has consistently misled the American people on the Iran nuclear deal,"" the Republican Jewish Coalition wrote in a statement. Albright sounded a pessimistic note on the future of the agreement during his interview with CNN.""The trend, in my mind, is not good. It's toward weakening the deal instead of strengthening the deal,"" he said.Iran recently announced an expansion of its civilian nuclear capabilities, saying that construction will begin on two more Russian-built nuclear reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant next week, according to the country's atomic energy chief quoted on state-run IRNA Wednesday."

That haul smashes what she has personally raised during previous months and put her on pace to make August her biggest fundraising month of the campaign.Tom Steyer-backed group targets millennials to help Democrats in North CarolinaOne key reason Clinton is able to raise these large sums of money: The Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising account that allows the Democratic ticket to raise money for her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic state parties at the same time. These agreements allow Clinton's donors to give $366,400 to a number of different Democratic accounts through the Clinton campaign.An analysis by Bloomberg found that the Hillary Victory Fund allowed hundreds of donors who had maxed out their donations to the Democratic National Committee to give more money through the joint fundraising agreement.According to the Clinton campaign, $62 million of their total haul in August was for the campaign, while about $81 million was raised for the Democratic National Committee through the Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary Action Fund.First on CNN: Pro-Clinton super PAC reserves $6M in ads aimed at minoritiesClinton's month was anchored by two three-day swings -- one through California and another through New York.The former secretary of state raised over $19 million during a three-day, nine fundraiser swing through California earlier this month.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/military-credit-cards-strip-clubs-casinos/index.html	" The IG office found last year that from July 2013 to June 2014, Pentagon personnel spent an unauthorized $952,258 at casinos. They dropped another $96,576 at places like Sapphire Gentleman's Club, which advertises itself as the world's largest strip club, ""featuring 70,000 square feet of topless entertainment."" At the time, the IG warned that beyond the abuse of taxpayer dollars, the use of the travel credit cards for personal expenses in gambling houses and strip bars created potential national security vulnerabilities -- blackmail is a risk if military personnel take part in sexual impropriety or incur major debt. Government travel card use is intended for official travel expenses only. The IG recommended steps to prevent abuse of the cards in casinos and strip bars in 2015. This week, it said, the Pentagon hadn't taken those steps and the travel card program remains ""vulnerable to continued misuse.""  The IG also found that:-- Pentagon management failed to perform reviews and responded inconsistently to cardholders' improper charges.-- The Pentagon had less money for legitimate travel expenses as a result.-- Cardholders weren't offered assistance for financial concerns or gambling addictions. The Defense Department, the IG said, ""experienced potential national security vulnerabilities"" because it hasn't dealt adequately with cardholders who may pose security concerns, ""including extensive travel card misuse, questionable judgment, the decision not to follow rules and guidance, financial concerns, or gambling addictions,"" the report said. The IG report reveals some frustration with senior Pentagon officials, too, noting that one of them had seemingly dismissed the IG's concerns by arguing that misuse in the 2015 report represented only .04% of total travel card spending. The IG hit back in this latest report, saying that the 2015 audit didn't allow their office to assess the total amount of personal use in the travel card program or evaluate its overall strength.The Pentagon's responses, the IG added, ""attempt to minimize the potential risks presented by our findings, including the risk of security vulnerabilities by cardholders who misused travel cards."" The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The report comes at a time when the Defense Department is already under fire for inadequately screening personnel for behaviors that might pose national security risks. Lawmakers are pointing to the Pentagon's failure to discover that Maj. Gen. David Haight, a senior officer on the front lines of handling tensions with Russia, spent 10 years frequenting swingers clubs, engaging in group sex and carrying on an affair. ""More needs to be done to detect potential threats to national security secrets,"" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill told CNN about Haight.""Too many cases in recent years have shown gaping holes in the process."" The initial problems with military travel cards came to light because the law requires the IG at each Cabinet agency with more than $10 million in travel card spending to periodically review those programs. At the time, the IG recommended simple steps to end the use of travel cards for unauthorized expenses, including setting up red flags if military personnel used cards while they weren't on travel, if they went above per diems or if they had multiple declined authorizations. Those steps would have helped officials spot some of the offenders the IG highlighted in its 2015 review. The IG office found a civilian employee at the Defense Logistics Agency had used his card 29 times in two years at Maryland Live! Casino. He made three attempts to withdraw $402 in cash with the card that were denied.   Another petty officer 1st class in the Navy spent $1,116 during 17 days of work travel at places like Red Parrot Gentlemen's Club and Dreams Cabaret. His allotted budget for meals and incidentals on that trip was $151.50. The IG also said the Pentagon could establish a policy to identify high-risk merchants or categories -- a step that would quickly flag a vendor like ""Vegas Showgirls,"" which showed up in the 2015 investigation. And it could request that Citibank notify management officials of potential fraudulent or suspicious activity on accounts. This year, once again, the inspector general called for the Defense Travel Management Office and program managers to improve oversight, toughen internal controls of the program and provide clear, written rules forbidding the use of travel cards at high-risk merchants.

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/clemency-sharanda-jones/index.html	"Sharanda Jones says she was never told she could be facing life in prison after being indicted for seven counts of conspiracy to traffic cocaine. It was her first criminal offense. During her week-long trial, prosecutors were unable to produce any physical evidence that Jones actually ever possessed, bought, or sold cocaine and according to courtroom testimony, relied mostly on the word of admitted drug dealers and users who received leniency in exchange for their testimony. When the judge read the verdicts -- ""not guilty"" for six counts and ""guilty"" of one -- Jones felt somewhat relieved. That feeling wouldn't last very long. As she listened to prosecutors tallying up the factors that determined jail time in federal court, Jones realized that she would be spending much more than the five or so years she expected in a worst case scenario. The 23.92 kilos of crack cocaine Jones was convicted of conspiring to traffic would have yielded a maximum sentence of just around 24 years' imprisonment based on federal sentencing guidelines. But prosecutors then began to argue for sentencing enhancements. A concealed carry permit in her name was used as evidence that a firearm was present ""in furtherance of a drug conspiracy."" She was listed as a ""leader/organizer"" of the conspiracy. And she committed perjury, they said, according to court documents, ""for her false denials of guilt on the stand."" Prosecutors argued that due to the amount of time she was facing, Jones should be held until sentencing. The judge agreed. ""My attorney told me, 'Don't say anything,' that [he'll] do all the talking and just stand there. And I see marshals coming and I didn't know what that meant, not knowing they were coming to lock me up,"" Jones said. Jones was immediately taken into custody after her guilty verdict, which was a shock in itself considering it was her first encounter with the criminal justice system. That morning she had dropped her daughter off at school, gone to work at the diner she co-owned, and attended her hearing during her lunch break. Jones recalls that she even left her purse in her car that day, thinking she would have time to sort her affairs well before beginning to serve out her punishment. Jones was sentenced in November 1999 to mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole. She would never again drop her daughter off at school, work another shift in her diner, or drive the car unintentionally abandoned in the Dallas courthouse parking lot.""I remember him saying 'I'm sentencing you to life' and I was just numb,"" Jones said. ""I couldn't understand it. I was just blank. My body was numb. I couldn't cry. I couldn't process it at all."" Sharanda wasn't the only member of her family headed to jail for this conspiracy case. Her sister Sherena served six years for what prosecutors portrayed as a minor role in the conspiracy. Her brother Ernest was sentenced to 18 years in prison. And her mother, a quadriplegic since a car accident at the age of 20, was sentenced to a 17 years. The CaseThe Jones family were just four of more than 100 black residents of Terrell, Texas, rounded up in a drug sweep aimed at crack cocaine users, dealers, and suppliers in 1997. Over the following two years, the Kaufman County Sheriff Department, Terrell, Texas police detectives, and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents would leverage those arrested for low-level offenses into giving up information on fellow users, dealers, and suppliers. With many defendants facing long ""mandatory minimum"" sentences for non-violent drug offenses, government informants were not hard to come by -- friends and neighbors testified against one another to downplay their involvement in the conspiracy. Those that testified or ""snitched"" received leniency in their sentences. Those that didn't faced the harshest punishment. Drug users and low level drug dealers receiving jail terms reserved for the most notorious kingpins, Jones says. Sharanda's decision not to snitch would prove costly. ""They arrested a couple I knew, a couple I had dealt with in the past and they implicated me."" Jones explained. ""Not as their main supplier but as someone who could just help them out."" The couple, Julie Franklin and Keith Jackson, acquaintances of the Jones family, had called Sharanda pleading for her to front them drugs to be sold later as they were hard pressed for money. Unbeknownst to Jones, their conversation was being recorded and listened to by the DEA. At first, Jones reluctantly agreed to try to connect them with a woman who may be able to provide them with drugs to sell, but ultimately told them she was back running the diner and that any drug contacts she had known are ""long gone, all gone,"" according to court documents.  That couple later testified that Jones had previously provided them with 40 kilograms of powder cocaine to be converted to crack. Additionally, a Houston cocaine supplier, Joseph Antoine testified that he provided Jones with cocaine to be sold at the family ""crack house"" that Jones and her siblings and mother were alleged to be dealing from, accusing Jones herself of setting the market price for crack cocaine in the area. ""Evidence of Sharanda Jones's involvement in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine at 705 Rosehill is sufficient, though only barely so,"" according to a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding her conviction. ""They clearly testified that I was the middle person because they actually got the main character and they got the low level drug dealers and they put me in the middle of both of them,"" Jones said. Julie Franklin and Keith Jackson would be later sentenced to seven and eight years with Antoine, the main supplier, receiving 19-and-a-half years. All have since been released. Doing TimeOn November 10, 1999 BOP Prisoner No. 33177-077 began her life sentence at a Tallahassee, Florida federal prison before being transferred a year later to Carswell federal prison in Forth Worth, Texas alongside her mother, who was on the medical floor that she described as a ""nursing home type setting,"" and her sister, Sherena, who she shared a unit with. ""Those are eight-by-eight rooms and there are four people in those rooms,"" Sharanda recalled. ""That's harsh living."" Despite the severity of her sentence, Jones insists she never let it break her. ""All the staff can tell you I never programmed my mind to say life. And people would ask me how much time I had. I just could never get life out. It just didn't seem right rolling off my tongue,"" Jones said. ""I just knew an appeal will work. Maybe I'll do five, ten, 15 years at the most because I am guilty. But not for no life sentence."" Nonetheless, Jones settled in for a long stint. ""You can be in any group in prison. They have a wild group, they have a calm group, they have older people. So, I kind of like stick with my group the older people, watch the news daily and that's how I kept up with what was going on in the world,"" Jones said. The remote possibility of freedom in the future, no matter how distant, kept Jones far away from all the trouble or temptations a prisoner may face in trying to escape from their realities. ""The pill line is the number one thing there. Just drugs, drugs, drugs. I had to get two knee replacements and all they could offer me is Percocets and OxyContin. I always turned down narcotics. Friends before had already told me, 'Don't take a narcotic, we took them when we came here and now we are addicted to those drugs',"" Jones said. Jones wasn't a perfect prisoner, she admits, having to occasionally sneak pass a particularly strict guard who refused to let Jones into the medical ward to see her mother. ""We based the rest of our lives around helping our mom,"" Jones said. But no matter how much family she had around her to ease the pain of being incarcerated, she could not wrap her mind around how unfair her sentence seemed. ""We had rapists, murderers. The prison I was at had a max unit where people have done horrible crimes and they still had a number, they still had a [release] date. And I would compare myself to those people cause my cell was facing the max unit. when they take people in and out I'm looking at that. I'm looking at how they chained and shackled up and I'm chained and shackled up and I'm like, this just don't match up to me,"" Sharanda recalled with cracks in her voice. In 2009, Jones received an unexpected visit in prison from a stranger that would change her life. Brittany Byrd was still a law student when she stumbled upon Jones' case and began to research it. The daughter of an incarcerated mother, Byrd was moved to action. Soon, Byrd visited Jones, who at the time had no legal representation as all her appeals had been exhausted, and convinced her that she would take the case all the way to the White House if she had to, until Jones was a free woman. ""I was like, you know, God you really sending someone to help me and from that day on, our vibes grew stronger and our belief grew together like this is gonna happen one day so we started working on the clemency,"" Jones said, describing how it felt to meet Byrd.But it wasn't until her mother died, one year away from her release, that Sharanda really set her mind on freedom. Jones recalls the last exchange she had with her mother. ""She said I gotta go out to the hospital and said 'I'll see you tomorrow'. The next day they called and said she had 24 hours to live and I didn't understand that. That was like all I knew at Carswell was to be with her,"" Jones said, crying. ""As soon as my mother passed I said I knew I'm going home. I scheduled my routine around her so, that's all I knew."" Getting OutTo date, President Barack Obama has granted 673 commutations, with 232 of those individuals initially serving life sentences. According to Neil Eggleston, White House counsel to the President, these individuals ""received unduly harsh sentences under outdated laws for committing largely nonviolent drug crimes."" And while recent drug sentencing reforms, such as former Attorney General Holder's ""Smart on Crime Initiative,"" which prioritizes federal prosecutor resources for the most serious offenses, keep many low level offenders from entering the overcrowded prison system, there was no retroactive mechanism to assist those already convicted. The only possibility of freedom, they determined, would be a presidential pardon or commutation. Byrd would have to live up to the promise she made and get the Obama administration to pay attention to Sharanda's case. With the clemency petition filed, Byrd began a grassroots campaign to highlight what she saw as a major injustice in Jones' sentence. One Monday in December 2015, Byrd heard rumors that President Obama was scheduled to announce a round of pardons, commutations, and clemencies. ""Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, nothing happened,"" Sharanda remembers. ""Then on Friday, the officer called me and told me to go to the back conference room and that just doesn't happen."" Jones waited alongside another inmate, both uncertain as to why they were being called in but remaining hopeful that their long shot bids for freedom had finally been granted. They began praying together before Jones was then escorted into yet another conference room where a phone call was waiting on her. It was Byrd, her attorney. ""Brittany, is everything ok?"" Jones asked. ""You're going home!"" Byrd screamed as Jones broke down in tears.But just as Jones had to adapt to prison life almost 17 years ago, she now must adapt to life on the outside and reconcile all the moments she's missed with her family. Since being released, Jones has found a job doing clerical work and is trying to rebuild her life while reconnecting with her daughter, Clenesha, who had been without her mother since the age of 8. And while Jones may have missed out on raising her own daughter, she feels she has been blessed with yet another second chance with the birth of her granddaughter three months ago.  Jones plans to use her voice to raise awareness for the need for criminal justice reform. ""I am so grateful for having a second chance at life but I left so many women behind who deserve the same mercy I was given,"" Jones said. ""I want to be done but I can't be done until more come home.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this story contained a photo caption that misspelled Reynolds Wintersmith's name."
