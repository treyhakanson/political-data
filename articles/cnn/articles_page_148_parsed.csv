Not if you're going to be president of the United States,"" Gingrich told Fox News' Sean Hannity.""What Trump has got to understand, he's got to sing either, 'I got to be me' or he's got to order a new song, 'I've got to be President.' They're not the same song. He's got to become much more disciplined,"" Gingrich said about Trump's behavior. ""For a while there, I thought he had really turned a corner. This last week, I think has been, frankly, a lost week. A week which has hurt him. Which has shaken his own supporters.""Trump's week began with a widely criticized performance at Monday's debate, which led to a dip in poll numbers. His rant early Friday morning specifically focused on Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe whom Trump has criticized about her weight gain in the 1990s. Machado is now a highly visible surrogate for Clinton, and the feud threatens to harm Trump's standing even further with groups with which he has already struggled: women and Hispanics.This isn't the first time Gingrich -- once floated as a possible running mate for Trump -- has criticized Trump. After Trump accused U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was overseeing a lawsuit involving Trump University, of bias because of his Mexican heritage, Gingrich called him out.Donald Trump: Newt Gingrich's criticism of judge comment 'inappropriate'In an interview with the Washington Post, Gingrich said, ""I don't know what Trump's reasoning was, and I don't care. His description of the judge in terms of his parentage is completely unacceptable."" And on ""Fox News Sunday,"" he said that it was ""one of the worst mistakes Trump has made,"" adding: ""I think it's inexcusable."""

He was ambivalent about the invasion, at best.The third: Trump might say that the US ""got out of Iraq the wrong way,"" but he had once said the US should just ""declare victory and leave.""And the fourth: Clinton did push for intervention in Libya, but Trump himself too called for that same move.It's part of a pattern for Trump. FactCheck.org analyzed another Trump appearance, in Miami, and found over 20 questionable statements. Tapper will look next week at a stump speech delivered by Clinton.As FactCheck.org wrote:""The day-to-day appeals in stump speeches often go largely uncovered, though. The words are nearly identical in stop after stop for weeks and weeks. And the media are looking for new things to report. But those speeches — repetitive as they may be — represent the core appeal to voters.""Read the full post at FactCheck.org."	A fact-check of Trump's stump speech	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

He quickly added: ""I mean, that's not the end of the inquiry, though. We were two-term governors and I think Gary is very, very solid. At this point, we overlapped as governors and I thought highly of him back when we served together, but having spent the last several months (together), I don't just like the guy, I love the guy. I think he is very solid and deep.""Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, said he thought Republican nominee Donald Trump was ""out of control"" at Monday's debate, whereas he felt Clinton did ""a great job.""RELATED: Why is Gary Johnson still in the race?Weld also spoke in defense of his running mate, Gary Johnson, after a gaffe earlier this week in which he couldn't come up with the name of any foreign leader during an MSNBC town hall.

In earlier advisories and press releases about Obama's last-minute trip to the country, ""Jerusalem"" was written without a country after the city's name.The initial transcript of Obama's remarks, which listed ""Jerusalem, Israel,"" was sent Friday morning, shortly after Obama departed Tel Aviv after his six-hour visit. On Friday afternoon, a version labeled ""corrected"" was sent with the word ""Israel"" struck through with a line.The oversight was an unfortunate blip during an otherwise outsized display of personal diplomacy in Israel. Obama made the rare decision to fly 10 hours for Peres' funeral based on his deep personal affection for the former Israeli president, who dedicated much of his life attempting to foster peace in his country."

The remarks were made at a fundraiser in February.""The last thing we need,"" she told the audience, ""are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear-armed.""The remarks put her at odds with the Obama administration, which has requested large increases in nuclear weapons programs at the Defense and Energy Departments, according to the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan group that monitors arms control policies. Three independent estimates put the expected total cost of modernizing the US nuclear forces over the next 30 years at as much as $1 trillion, the association said.Aides are pointing to recent comments where Clinton has publicly said that she is for re-evaluating nuclear modernization and say that Clinton is in favor of conducting a review of the nation's nuclear forces to determine the best way forward.Trump demands Obama promise not to pardon Clinton""We'll make a renewed push to reduce the world's nuclear weapons, because that does make us all safe,"" Clinton said to the American Legion in August. ""One of the first things I will do as president is to call for a new nuclear posture review. We have to make sure that America's arsenal is prepared to meet future threats.""Clinton also said in January that she may oppose a plan by the Obama administration to update the country's nuclear forces.After a rally in Iowa, a journalist asked Clinton, ""Do you oppose plans to spend a trillion dollars on an entire new generation of nuclear weapons systems that will enrich the military contractors and set off a new global arms race?""Clinton responded, ""Yeah I've heard about that.

""Hillary Clinton was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics,"" Trump told The Times. ""Hillary was an enabler, and she attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward. I think it's a serious problem for them, and it's something that I'm considering talking about more in the near future.""Trump and his campaign, however, have repeatedly referenced Bill Clinton's infidelity this week. The Saturday before the debate, he threatened to bring Gennifer Flowers as a guest to the debate, and after Monday's event, he told CNN's Dana Bash he was ""happy"" he was able to refrain from mentioning ""the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton.""On Wednesday, a copy of Trump campaign talking points instructed supporters to use figures like Flowers and Monica Lewinsky to counter criticism of Trump's treatment of a former Miss Universe.Referring to Eric Trump's comments earlier in the week that Donald Trump showed ""courage"" in not bringing up the issue at the debate, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted Friday night, ""Assume (Eric Trump) now believes he's a coward.""He also told the Times that his own marriage history does not prevent him from being able to make attacks against the Clintons' relationship. Trump has been married three times, and his first marriage fell apart after he carried on an affair with Marla Maples.Donald Trump quintuples downBill Clinton's infidelities, Trump said, ""brought shame onto the presidency, and Hillary Clinton was there defending him all along.""The GOP presidential nominee told the paper that he believes the issue will worsen Hillary Clinton's likeability with female voters.Asked if he ever cheated on his wives, Trump responded: ""No — I never discuss it. I never discuss it. It was never a problem.""And when asked specifically about his affair with Maples, he responded, ""I don't talk about it. I wasn't president of the United States. I don't talk about it. When you think of the fact that he was impeached, the country was in turmoil, turmoil, absolute turmoil. He lied with Monica Lewinsky and paid a massive penalty.""'Absolutely disgusted'Trump also tore into Clinton's decision to feature Alicia Machado, a 1996 Miss Universe whom Trump allegedly called ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping,"" as a surrogate. Machado has joined the Clinton campaign in publicly denouncing Trump's comments against women, and Trump has responded with smears against the former beauty queen during interviews and on Twitter, including shaming her for a sex tape for which the campaign has not provided evidence.Trump told the Times he was ""absolutely disgusted"" that Clinton enlisted the help of Machado for her campaign and that Clinton, who has portrayed Machado as a victim, had ""made this young lady into a girl scout when she was the exact opposite.""Trump eyes risky move in bringing up Bill Clinton's womenLooking ahead to the next debate, Trump said he's going to start preparing as early as this weekend. But he does not think that he needs to prepare more rigorously, blaming audio issues Monday with distracting him.He ""spent 50 percent of my thought process"" dealing with it, Trump said.And he backed away from his proclamation Monday that he would ""absolutely"" support Clinton if she won the election in November,""We're going to have to see,"" Trump said.

I lost the argument. I've argued for the use of force. I'm the guy who stood up and announced that we're going to attack Assad for the use of weapons,"" Kerry is heard telling the Syrian attendees, referring to internal deliberations within the administration of President Barack Obama that followed Assad's use of chemical weapons in 2013.Kerry also faulted Congress for failing to support such a retaliatory strike, saying, ""The bottom line is that Congress refused even to vote to allow that.""""We have a Congress that will not authorize our use of force,"" he added, explaining that a new military intervention would be difficult to bring about.The discussion in the recording occurred only days after the United States and Russia announced a ceasefire agreement in Geneva, an accord that has since collapsed with reports of regime bombing attacks and the positioning of some 10,000 Syrian regime-aligned troops preparing to advance on Aleppo. The recorded conversation contains a series of revelations about Kerry's view of the ongoing civil war in Syria. Several of the meeting's participants have confirmed the recording's authenticity.The Syrian civilians repeatedly questioned Kerry about violations of the ceasefire and America's unwillingness to enforce the agreement more strongly, and lobbied for a bigger US role.Kerry cited legal restrictions and local air defenses as reasons why a US military intervention was not feasible.  ""The problem is the Russians don't care about international law and we do. And we don't have a basis, our lawyers tell us, unless we have a Security Council resolution,"" he said.""They were invited in, we were not,"" he added, referring to Moscow's military operations in Syria.""We don't behave like Russians. It's just a different standard,"" Kerry said.""The only reason they are letting us fly is because we are going after ISIL,"" Kerry said, using another term for ISIS. ""If we were going after Assad, we would have to take out all the air defenses and we don't have a legal justification for doing that.""Kerry added, ""So far, American legal theory does not buy into the so-called right to protect.""""Nobody (is) more frustrated than me,"" Kerry told the gathering.Acknowledging that Russia's military actions have ""changed the equation"" and made removing Assad more difficult,  Kerry suggested that Syrian refugees could one day help eject Assad if given the right to vote. Asked about the recording, State Department spokesman John Kirby told CNN, ""While we will decline to comment on a private conversation, Secretary Kerry was grateful for the chance to meet with this group of Syrians, to hear their concerns firsthand and to express our continued focus on ending this civil war.""Kerry found himself on the defensive as the attendees implored the United States to help stop the violence against Syrian civilians through direct action.""You can be mad at us, but what we are trying to do is help Syrians to fight for their own country, and we have been spending a lot of money, a lot of effort,"" he said.""I am frustrated, too,"" Kerry said.He later added, ""A lot of Americans don't believe that we should be fighting and sending young Americans over to die in another country."""

I'm voting today,"" said Steininger, who came prepared with a handmade ""Hillary"" sign attached to the front of her walker. ""I'm not taking any chance and leaving it 'til the election. When you're 103, you make every minute count.""""And you have made every minute of all those years count,"" Clinton responded.Steininger also congratulated Clinton on her first debate against Donald Trump, which at the time had just happened. ""You did very well,"" she said.Clinton's visit to the Hawkeye State was aimed at promoting the first day of in-person voting in the state. The campaign sees early voting as a critical part of earning support in battleground states, and plans to organize more events to encourage voters cast their ballots ahead of November 8th.That Steininger was able to vote in the 2016 presidential election holds historical significance of its own. A former schoolteacher, Steininger was born in 1913 before the first World War -- an era when women were not allowed to vote. With a passion for politics, Steininger has voted in every single election since 1936, when she first cast her ballot for Franklin D. Roosevelt.In February, Steininger cast her ballot for Clinton on the night of the Iowa caucuses.""I've got a big job ahead of me ... I've got to live!"" she said at the time. ""After that, OK, I can die if I want to, but I'm going to live until she's elected.""Overwhelmed by the possibility of Clinton becoming the country's first female president, Steininger wrote a letter to the former secretary of state earlier this year.""In my first century of life, I've seen many incredible things"" she wrote. ""A pandemic, two worldwide depressions, a cure for polio, the first Catholic president, a man on the moon, the end of smallpox, an attack on American soil, and a black president. In my second century, I look forward to seeing a woman president.""Speaking to supporters in Iowa in September, Clinton called out to Steininger sitting in the crowd.""I am so grateful for her support,"" Clinton said. ""It's a great honor to have Ruline supporting me. I am so pleased and she's going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts.""
