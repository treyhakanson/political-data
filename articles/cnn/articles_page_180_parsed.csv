So right now you have Donald Trump in a situation where he makes money by aiding the people whose interests don't coincide with America's,"" Newsweek senior writer Kurt Eichenwald told CNN's Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day,"" adding later, ""The important thing here is this is an entanglement that can't be unwound.""The Newsweek report raised a series of questions about how Trump would handle the countless conflicts of interests inherent in his overseas business interests.RELATED: Businesses could pose conflicts of interest for a President TrumpTrump has said he plans to entrust his business to his children if he is elected president, a move that would only partially distance Trump from his massive corporation and do little to quell questions about influence-peddling and conflicts of interest.""From what I'm hearing, Trump is planning to say that he will put the company in a blind trust -- which is sort of like saying 'I have 100 million shares of Apple stock and I'm going to put it in a blind trust,'"" Eichenwald said. ""He would know what's there, he knows who his partners are and he knows, you know, he will know going forward.""""Now, in the future, you're talking about giving money to either the family of the President of the United States or money that will go to the President of the United States if his company is in this, you know, blind trust.""CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on the report and has not yet received a response. Ivanka Trump also discussed the future of the Trump business empire if her father wins the presidency during an interview on ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday. Asked what the family would do to prevent potential conflicts of interest, she said that ""as a private business, we can make decisions that are not in our best interest.""""There's something so much bigger than our business at stake, and that's the future of this country,"" she said. ""We can say, you know what, we'll do less deals, and not going to do that deal even though it's a fine deal and economically reasonable because it could create a conflict of interest. And we'll act incredibly responsibly, and my father already said he would put it into a blind trust and it would be run by us.""The report outlines a series of potential conflicts of interests, from Trump's dealings with businessmen who have been the subject of government investigations in India and Turkey to his ties to powerful Russian oligarchs.On ""New Day,"" Eichenwald explained why Turkey would be problematic for the Republican nominee. He said that a failed business deal between Trump and a politically-connected organzation in the country had created potential tension between Trump and the President Recep Erdogan, who had called the deal a ""mistake.""  ""What I am being told is that Turkey's cooperation with the United States, in terms of providing an air base where we are able to launch bombers against ISIS would be at risk if Donald Trump was president,"" he said.And where Trump has suggested significant changes to US foreign policy, the Newsweek report magnified some of Trump's business dealings.Trump, who has floated the idea of Japan and South Korea obtaining nuclear weapons, maintains an ongoing business relationship with Daewoo Engineering and Construction, according to Newsweek. Daewoo is one of the top South Korean companies involved in nuclear energy projects.In India, Newsweek raised questions about Trump's ties to powerful businessmen and political parties in the country, particularly in light of promises from Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., to build ""a very aggressive pipeline"" there with ""exciting new projects"" to come.""If he plays tough with India, will the government assume it has to clear the way for projects in that 'aggressive pipeline' and kill the investigations involving Trump's (Indian business) partners? And if Trump takes a hard line with Pakistan, will it be for America's strategic interests or to appease Indian government officials who might jeopardize his profits from Trump Towers Pune?"" Eichenwald wrote.Eichenwald also discussed potentially problematic connections between Trump and Russian oligarchs under the political umbrella of Russian President Vladimir Putin. One such connection comes from a deal in which the GOP nominee attempted to license the Trump name to an organization in Russia. Eichenwald said that ""the head of that organization, who, again, very politically connected, very tied in to the Putin government, backed away from the deal because Trump wanted too much money."" Trump would undoubtedly have the most expansive and complex international business portfolio of any president in US history, which would bring an added layer of scrutiny to nearly every foreign policy decision Trump would make as president.Clinton pouncesHillary Clinton's presidential campaign sought to jump on the story Wednesday by tweeting 20 questions that they would like Trump to answer about Eichenwald's report.""Will you sever ties with your company linked to foreign leaders, questionable organizations, and criminals if you become president,"" read the first.The questions also hit Trump for not releasing his tax returns, his business connections and his ability to separate his responsibilities as president with his businesses ventures.""How can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk?"" asked another question."

""(Kaepernick) deserves support, not criticism for his actions. What does it say about our country when there is a national outrage over an athlete sitting out the national anthem, but the same outrage isn't expressed when a young black man is killed for no reason?""Williams added that he has engaged in a ""personal protest"" with the pledge and at times ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" saying he stands out of respect but does not recite the words.In his statement, Williams cited the increased earnings of Daniel Pantaleo, a white police officer who was not prosecuted in Garner's death. The incident touched off protests in several US cities, and, along with the shootings of other unarmed black men by white police officers, sparked a nationwide discussion about police brutality.Williams said Pantaleo was ""rewarded with an increase in pay."" Records show Pantaleo earned $119,996, including overtime, in fiscal year 2016, according to SeeThroughNY, a website that uses government data to provide salaries. In 2015, Pantaleo earned a total of $105,061.Asked for comment, the NYPD told CNN, ""The chief of department has ordered a review of the overtime practices for officers who are currently on modified assignment.

The former US Army soldier is serving a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth, an all-male Army prison in eastern Kansas, despite her request to transfer to a civilian prison. Her lawyers say she has been denied medical treatment for her gender dysphoria, a condition in which there is a conflict between a person's physical sex and the gender he or she identifies with. The government's refusal to treat her for her condition led to a suicide attempt in July, her lawyers said.Manning began a hunger strike on September 9 to demand treatment and access to medically prescribed recommendations for her condition. It ended on Tuesday when she received word that the military will provide treatment for her gender dysphoria, beginning with surgery recommended by her psychologist, according to the ACLU, which is representing Manning.The Army declined to confirm the claim, saying ""We cannot and will not discuss the medical needs of individuals.""A new Department of Defense policy, which takes effect in October, lays out processes under which service members may transition. Under the policy, ""service members with a diagnosis from a military medical provider indicating that gender transition is medically necessary will be provided medical care and treatment for the diagnosed medical condition."" It is not clear if or how the policy applies to inmates like Manning.'This is all that I wanted'Manning told her lawyers that she expects ""to meet with a team of doctors in the next week or two to move the process forward to prepare for surgery,"" ACLU attorney Chase Strangio said in an email.No ""concrete timeline was given,"" he said.The development could make Manning the first transgender person to receive gender affirming surgical treatment in any US prison, military, state or federal, the ACLU said.Manning began publicly identifying as a woman in August 2013, the day after her sentencing. She filed a lawsuit in 2014 against the Department of Defense so she could grow out her hair, use cosmetics and receive hormone treatment ""in order to express her female gender."" Last year, the Army agreed to provide her with hormone therapy but would not allow her to groom as a woman.""I am unendingly relieved that the military is finally doing the right thing. I applaud them for that. This is all that I wanted — for them to let me be me,"" Manning said in a statement through the ACLU. ""But it is hard not to wonder why it has taken so long. Also, why were such drastic measures needed? The surgery was recommended in April 2016. The recommendations for my hair length were back in 2014. In any case, I hope this sets a precedent for the thousands of trans people behind me hoping they will be given the treatment they need.""'Absolutely vital care'Manning's lawyer said she still faces charges related to her suicide attempt. Her hearing will be held on September 20, he said in a tweet. ""This is a monumental day for Chelsea, who can now enjoy some peace knowing that critically needed medical care is forthcoming. This medical care is absolutely vital for Chelsea as it is for so many transgender people — in and out of prison — who are systemically denied treatment solely because they are transgender,"" he said in a statement.""Thankfully the government has recognized its constitutional obligation to provide Chelsea with the medical care that she needs and we hope that they will act without delay to ensure that her suffering does not needlessly continue."""

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/politics/zika-government-funding-congress/index.html	"Senate leaders had hoped to complete action on the legislation next week and send it to the House but now that ambitious timetable might be delayed if they can't reach a deal soon.  ""It's a work in progress,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters. ""A lot of work to be done on that."" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, sounded a little more optimistic an agreement would be struck soon but said the closed-door negotiations -- especially regarding Planned Parenthood funding in the Zika bill -- are at a sensitive point. 'We're that close,"" Cornyn said holding up two fingers an inch apart. But, he added, ""nothing is decided until everything is decided so that's why I'm hesitant to talk publicly about it but it's getting closer."" With just under eight weeks until Election Day and with control of the Senate in doubt, Senate Republican leaders are anxious to complete their work and send their vulnerable members up for re-election home for a final campaign push. Democrats are keenly aware of that desire and recognize it might provide them some leverage in the late stages of the negotiations. ""I think they'd love to have us here longer than shorter,"" said Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota suggesting Democrats might want to slow-walk talks to keep senators in DC. ""It's advantageous to them to have our incumbents here."" Another key deadline is September 30, when a deal on federal spending must pass or agency operations could be shut down. GOP leaders very much want to avoid that scenario this close to the election because they worry voters will blame Republicans -- who have majorities in both chambers -- for not governing responsibly.  A key sticking point is language in the Zika bill that keeps funds in the bill from going to clinics in Puerto Rico that are associated with Planned Parenthood. Democrats are insistent that restriction be removed and Republican leaders have acknowledged they must change the language to get enough Democratic support to pass the bill. But to this point, negotiators haven't been able to agree on language that would be acceptable to both sides.  ""Planned Parenthood is not gone yet,"" Reid said tersely.Florida Gov. Rick Scott, whose state is at the center of the Zika epidemic, traveled to Washington and told reporters he's met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, other top leaders, Senator Marco Rubio and many members of the Florida congressional delegation to press for more money for prevention kits, vaccine research and mosquito abatement. ""The truth this is not just a Florida issue, this is a national and international issue,"" said Scott, a Republican. ""This is something everybody cares about -- developing babies. We want to make sure we take care of them."" He sounded upbeat that a deal would emerge, adding, ""I'm up here because I want Congress to act soon. I want them to act today. I know there's a whole process up here but I know everyone I've talked to has been very, very supportive."" Internet domains, Export-Import Bank, Syria among issues involvedOther controversial issues have creeped into the negotiations: Sen. Ted Cruz wants to add language to stop the Obama administration from releasing control of Internet domain names to an international consortium that includes Russia and China, fearing those countries will stifle Internet freedom.Business groups are pressing Congress to make functional changes to the Export-Import Bank, a difficult task because many conservatives decry the bank as an example of crony capitalism.Environmental groups are concerned about damage caused by the pesticides that are used to kill Zika-carrying mosquitoes.House conservatives want to add language barring refugees from Syria and other countries with terrorist ties from entering the US -- a provision that would be a non-starter for Democrats.And states that have been damaged recently by heavy flooding are pressing for federal aid to be added to funding resolution.  House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers called the negotiations over the funding and Zika package ""promising."" Rogers told reporters he received a letter from the White House notifying him that the Obama administration was putting together a new request for $2.6 billion in funding for flood recovery efforts in Louisiana.  Asked if the money for Louisiana could be added to the funding bill, Rogers said, ""It's going to be really tough to do that because we don't know the details yet,"" but he didn't rule it out. In the House, both Democratic and Republican aides told CNN that the negotiations are proceeding on several tracks, and there is progress, but it's unclear when a final bill would be unveiled. They anticipate the Senate leaders will move first, and give Ryan little time or choice but to move the package to the House floor, where he will need to turn to Democrats to help pass it."

Myanmar was formerly known as Burma, a name the US government still uses when referring to the country.""In part because of the progress we've seen over the last several months, I indicated after consulting with Daw Suu that the United States is now prepared to lift sanctions we've imposed upon Burma for quite some time,"" Obama said, using an honorific title for the Burmese leader. ""It is the right thing to do in order to ensure the people of Burma see the rewards from a new way of doing business and a new government.""Obama didn't specify precisely which sanctions would be lifted, but said the relief would come ""soon."" He also announced the US would add Myanmar to a roster of developing countries granted special trade status, allowing duty-free import of some 5,000 products. A senior administration official said afterward that some sanctions would remain on Myanmar, including a longstanding arms ban ""in order to ensure that the military remains a partner in the democratic transition.""But the White House said it was removing a ""national emergency"" designation on Myanmar that had been in place for two decades, allowing for the lifting of sanctions that had prevented broad economic investment in the country.In his meeting with Suu Kyi, Obama had hoped to ascertain whether the time was right to remove further economic sanctions on leaders in Myanmar given its ongoing move toward democracy.""We are very hopeful about the future,"" Obama said at the meeting. ""We are hopeful about building upon the friendship and relationship we have already established.""In November, when Suu Kyi was elected to her post, the US removed certain government-run businesses and some banks from a blacklist in an attempt to jump-start trade.The latest round of sanctions relief will not entirely loosen the screws on Myanmar's military, which ran the country for decades and still controls important government functions like its borders and armed forces. Advisers to Suu Kyi signaled ahead of the meeting she would not support that type of sanctions relief given the military's still-outsized role in governing her country.""We have a constitution that is not very democratic, because it gives the military a special place in politics,"" Suu Kyi said following her meeting with Obama.RELATED: Historic day in Myanmar as Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD party takes power Symbolic leaderKept under house arrest for almost 15 years, Suu Kyi is legally barred from becoming Myanmar's president since her two sons are British citizens. Changing the country's constitution to make her eligible for the top post would require the support of the military's large voting bloc in parliament, which leaders have signaled is unlikely.Despite her ineligibility, Suu Kyi is widely considered to be Myanmar's symbolic leader. Her official title is ""state counselor,"" but an audience in the Oval Office with Obama leaves little doubt of her stature.While Obama and his administration were pleased at Suu Kyi's elevation to the role after decades as an outspoken critic of the military junta, rights groups are concerned at the condition of ethnic minorities in the country. Thousands of Rohingya Muslims have been either targeted by sectarian violence or have attempted to flee on boats to Thailand and Malaysia.""I think that Daw Suu is the first one to indicate that a lot of work remains to be done,"" Obama said. ""But it's on the right track. If you had predicted that five years ago that Aung San Suu Kyi would now be here sitting as the duly elected representative of her country, many people would have been skeptical.""""It's a good news story in an era, in which, so often we see countries going in the opposite direction,"" Obama said.RELATED: Hillary Clinton celebrates Myanmar vote and her role in itMyanmar is mostly viewed as a success for Obama -- and Hillary Clinton, his secretary of state at the time he moved to thaw relations between Washington and Yangon. Those moves, taken during his first term, have led to hundreds of freed political prisoners and a fledgling peace process.""Unity also means prosperity, because people fight over limited resources,"" Suu Kyi said Wednesday.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/politics/cnn-orc-poll-florida-ohio-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html	Among likely voters in Ohio, Trump stands at 46% to Clinton's 41%, with 8% behind Libertarian Gary Johnson and 2% behind Green Party nominee Jill Stein. In Florida, likely voters split 47% for Trump to 44% for Clinton, within the poll's 3.5 percentage point margin of error, and with 6% behind Johnson and 1% backing Stein. In both states, Trump's support increases as a result of the likely voter screen, among all registered voters, Clinton edges Trump 45% to 44% in Florida, and in Ohio, Trump tops Clinton 43% to 39% with Johnson at 12%.Read the Ohio resultsThe polls come as other national and battleground state polls suggest a sharply tightened contest compared with mid-August. While Clinton emerged from her convention with the advantage in surveys in both states and nationwide, more recent surveys suggest a closer contest and an enthusiasm gap that tilts in Trump's favor. A Bloomberg Politics survey of Ohio voters released Wednesday morning found Trump ahead by five points, identical to the margin in this survey of Ohio voters, and Quinnipiac University surveys released shortly after Labor Day showed an even contest in Florida with Trump up four points in Ohio. Read the Florida resultsNationally, several recent polls, including a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday and a CNN/ORC poll released last week, have shown the race within the margin of sampling error nationally.In the new polls in both states, Trump holds a wide advantage among white voters, topping Clinton by 22 points in Ohio among whites and by 29 points in Florida. Non-whites, who make up a larger share of voters in Florida than they do in Ohio, break heavily for Clinton in both states; she's up by 70 points among non-whites in Ohio and by 43 points among non-whites in Florida.And although the wide gap by education among whites that's emerged in most polling on this contest continues here (Clinton's support lands below 30 percent among those whites who do not have college degrees, while the race is closer among whites with degrees), Trump does hold an edge among whites with college degrees in both states; he's up 9 points among that group in Ohio and 8 points in Florida.Both candidates have the support of roughly 9 in 10 of their own partisans in each state, but Clinton trails Trump among independent voters in both places, with Trump up 10 points among independents likely to vote in Florida and 8 points in Ohio.Younger voters, who were a key driver of President Barack Obama's support in both 2008 and 2012, are not lining up as solidly behind Clinton in either state, and they are less likely than older voters to make it through a likely voter screen at this point in the campaign, suggesting they are less enthusiastic about voting in this election. In Florida, Clinton tops Trump by 6 points among those under age 45 who are likely to turn out in November, and in Ohio, Clinton and Trump are about even among this group. Obama carried this group by double-digits in 2012 in both Florida and Ohio.One big difference this time between younger and older voters: Support for Gary Johnson. In both states, Johnson reaches double-digits among those voters under age 45 who say they are likely to turn out, while he gets low-single-digit support among older voters.These voters younger than 45 are also most apt to say they might change their minds between now and Election Day -- about 3 in 10 in each state say they haven't yet made a firm decision. Whether Clinton can spark their interest in voting and pull some away from a vote for Johnson could be critical to her chances in these battlegrounds.In Ohio, Clinton faces deeper image challenges than in Florida. Her favorability rating there is worse than Trump's, even among the broader pool of registered voters. Just 36% have a positive impression of Clinton vs. 41% who view Trump favorably. Clinton also trails Trump by 12 points on the question of who is more honest and trustworthy. Not all is negative for Clinton, though. She tops the GOP nominee as more trusted on handling foreign policy and as better at handling the responsibilities of commander in chief. Trump's strong points come on managing the economy, terrorism and immigration.Still, voters in Ohio are roughly split on which candidate shares their values, with 44% saying Trump does, 41% Clinton and a sizable 13% saying neither of them does. The percentage saying neither shares their values spikes to 20% among whites who hold college degrees and 21% among political independents.In Florida, the two candidates are about even in terms of favorability, with 46% having a positive impression of Clinton and 43% of Trump. Marco Rubio, the home-state senator who lost his Florida's Republican presidential primary to Trump before deciding to run for re-election, holds a higher favorability rating than either of the two presidential nominees, with 51% having a positive take on him.Here too, Trump is broadly seen as better on the economy (52% to 44% who think Clinton would do a better job handling it) and Clinton holds the edge on foreign policy (55% to 39%), but the two are about evenly matched in Florida on immigration (Clinton 49% to Trump's 47%) and terrorism (Trump 48% to Clinton's 46%).Clinton has the edge on shared values (47% choose her, 41% Trump) and handling the responsibilities of being commander in chief (51% to 44%) while Trump is more often seen as honest and trustworthy (47% say Trump is, 40% Clinton, 12% neither).In both states, the Senate races break in favor of the Republican incumbents, with Rubio topping Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy by a 54% to 43% margin among likely voters, and Rob Portman well ahead of former Gov. Ted Strickland, 58% to 37% among those most likely to turn out in November.The CNN/ORC polls were conducted by telephone September 7 through 12. Results in Florida are based on a random sample of 1,003 adults who live in the state, including 788 who are likely to vote in November. In Ohio, interviews were conducted with a random sample of 1,006 adults who live in the state, including 769 likely voters. In both states, results for the sample of likely voters have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points.

Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein picked up the support of 10% and 3%, respectively. Both Johnson and Stein will be on the ballot in Ohio, though Johnson will be listed as an independent and not as a libertarian.The poll was conducted Friday through Monday and could possibly serve be the first indicator of Clinton's turbulent weekend. At a fundraiser in New York City on Friday night, the former secretary of state told a crowd of donors that ""you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables."" She later said she regretted saying half. And on Sunday, Clinton was wobbly after she left a 9/11 anniversary ceremony early, an episode her campaign ultimately attributed to a pneumonia diagnosis, though the poll was mostly conducted before Sunday's incident. But the Bloomberg poll is also not the first recent survey to show Trump gaining in Ohio, where Clinton had boasted fairly consistent leads for much of the summer. The findings continue what has been a general tightening in the race after Clinton emerged with sizable leads both nationally and in swing states in the weeks following the Democratic National Convention. A possible sign of the tightening race, Clinton's campaign announced it will open six more campaign offices in the Buckeye State this week, bringing the total number of Democratic offices in Ohio to 54.Perhaps no battleground is more important than Ohio, which has been carried by every winning presidential nominee since 1964. And no Republican has ever won the presidency without also winning the state. The Bloomberg poll was conducted September 9-12 using phone interviews with 802 likely Ohio voters.
