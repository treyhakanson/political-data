Kelly Ayotte) is the strongest possible way to accomplishing what many voters want, which is taking the country a new and different direction,"" Conway said. ""And how would that be? We already have divided government. And look what's happening, Erin. People are not satisfied with that.""Conway was referring to an ad from the US Chamber of Commerce that calls on New Hampshire voters to re-elect Ayotte on the premise that a Republican-controlled Congress could serve as a check on a Clinton presidency.Conway said that the campaign is working toward helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate.First on CNN: GOP group runs first Senate ad calling for check and balance on White House""I get why some interest groups want to do this, but from our perspective in the Trump campaign, we want a Republican House and a Republican Senate so that we don't have the kind of divided government that you see that gets absolutely nothing done,"" Conway said.Many Republicans have abandoned Trump since the surfacing of a 2005 conversation in which he bragged about being able to grope women and get away with it. Ayotte -- who earlier this month walked back comments calling Trump a ""role model"" for children -- said she wouldn't vote for the GOP nominee in the wake of the video.Trump has angrily pushed back against Republicans who withdrew their support.Burnett also asked Conway about Trump's performance in the polls.""We feel that when voters see that this is a competitive race ... I think it's worth a couple extra points here and they're among people who have decided, 'I don't want Hillary Clinton. I do know her well,'"" she said. ""There's something holding them back. And we need to reach out and grab those voters and give them the reason to vote for Donald Trump.""Conway also said that ""the polls all over the place"" and that next week the Republican nominee has a ""surprise for women"" in North Carolina to appeal to female voters.""We have work to do and I'm always the first to admit it,"" she said. ""I think these last couple of weeks he wants to reach out ... We're going to talk about Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump's ideas about child care and elder care that would benefit all Americans and next week in North Carolina we have a really nice surprise for women in America and I would encourage them and I'm sure CNN will tune is as well."""

""They're sending people. They're sending money. They've never done that before.""Freedman, a self-proclaimed ""lonely Democrat"" in Carefree, population 3000, exudes triumphant joy as she talks about the political shift. But she can't hide her surprise.It's a sentiment shared by Alexis Tamerón, Arizona Democratic Party state chair. ""We were playing the long game. 2020, 2022,"" she explains, as the target years where state Democrats would harness a changing demographic of more Latinos and millennials to edge Arizona into battleground territory. But then an unlikely catalyst came along. ""I do believe Donald Trump has helped us jump our timeline,"" she says.Across Arizona, Democrats are making a fervent push in the final stretch before Election Day. Feeling the momentum is on their side, Democrats point to data from Arizona's secretary of state showing the party edging Republicans in voter registration in the last eight weeks by about 5,000 voters.State Democrats have set up 32 offices and hired more than 160 staffers, more than they've had in decades, sharing office space with the Clinton campaign. State Democrats believe more staffers will come from outside the state, expanding their ground game with cash and expertise.Poll gives Democrats reason to believeA poll released Wednesday by the Arizona Republic, Arizona State University's Morrison Institute for Public Policy and Cronkite News shows Clinton with a five-point lead over Trump.The Democrats are now investing $2 million in ad buys and direct mail -- not to mention an all-star cast canvassing the state this week in an effort to turn the state blue. In addition to Chelsea Clinton's visit to Tempe, Clinton surrogate Bernie Sanders headlined two campaign rallies in Flagstaff and Tucson.And First Lady Michelle Obama, arguably the Democrats' most powerful public speaker in recent weeks, held a rally in Phoenix Thursday, urging the crowd of thousands to vote for Clinton and other Democrats on the Arizona ballot.But she directed her most potent words toward Trump, who has repeatedly suggested the election is rigged -- even refusing to say whether he'd accept the results on November 8. That sentiment, Obama argued, should motivate Democratic voters in Arizona.""When you hear folks talking about a global conspiracy and saying this election is rigged, understand that they are trying to get you to stay home. They are trying to convince you that your vote doesn't matter, that the outcome has already been determined and you shouldn't even bother to make your voice heard.""Arizona GOP: Not so fastArizona Republicans, however, are showing no signs of allowing their reliably red state to go blue.""I don't know what people's definition of blue is, but to me it's bright red,"" says Arizona GOP Chairman Robert Graham.The defiant Graham boasts his party's active base and organizational outreach in the state, with 12,000 volunteers and more than a 1.2 million live phone calls so far to voter households. While he acknowledges that Democratic speakers like Obama are a dynamic force, he's skeptical that will translate into votes for Clinton. He also welcomes the Clinton campaign's push in Arizona, arguing it only helps Trump.""If Hillary spends time and money here ... we actually hope, in the sense, that she does that because then it takes resources out of other battleground states where she may have a better chance,"" Graham says.Republicans here have reason to be confident and urge a closer look to the same Arizona secretary of state voter registration data that have Democrats buzzing. Numbers show the GOP holds an overall advantage of 161,000 voters with under three weeks to go before Election Day.Many Trump supporters believe Arizona will stay red in 2016.Jay Yager sat amongst a few dozen of those supporters as they watched the debate live Wednesday at a party held at GOP headquarters in Phoenix. Undeterred by polls showing Clinton ahead in the race, the GOP faithful in the room munched on pizza and snacks as they applauded and laughed at Trump's zingers.Yager has lived in the area since 1977 and is not convinced by recent polling putting Hillary in the lead. He says he's already voted from Trump and is confident the state he's called home for almost 40 years will do the same on November 8.""I have friends on either side of the aisle and most of them are say it's Trump,"" says Yager. ""I think it's absolutely Trump."""	Arizona Democrats sense momentum in final weeks of campaign

I think he's able to relate to ordinary Americans because in many cases he is still very much like that. He does do that. He hasn't spent his whole life sitting there polishing every statement he's ever made, every conversation he's ever had.""Donald Trump apologized for his comments in a video statement shortly after they were leaked, and has since referred to them as ""locker room talk.""Trump Jr. went on to call his father's comment a ""mistake.""""He doesn't run a focus group so he can tell you what he's thinking,"" he said. ""He speaks from the heart, that one is obviously one that we don't want to --- that was a mistake, he recognizes that.

It all began when Trump tweeted on Friday morning: ""The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON! Thank you, these are very exciting times.""Not long after, Clinton's campaign, quoting Trump's tweet, wrote: ""Where was this kind of comedy last night?""It's unclear which results Trump was referring to, though he has in the past cited unscientific online polls as proof of his success in previous debates. A CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers had Clinton winning the debate 52% to 39%.The two faced off twice this past week -- once on the debate stage in Las Vegas and again on Thursday night for the Al Smith charity dinner in New York.The dinner, traditionally the last time the two major party candidates share a stage before the election, typically features good-natured ribbing between the candidates but usually includes warm-hearted remarks. This year, however, featured no such good wishes between Trump and Clinton, and Trump's comments -- at one point he said Clinton ""hates"" Catholics -- occasionally generated boos from the audience."

The first move of a new presidential administration will not be to ""cancel any of these programs but we've shown it is possible to make significant changes in short time,"" said Jerry Hendrix, one of the report's authors and a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank.""We want to stir the debate."" he added.  The proposal was first reported by The Washington Post. Most notably, the report calls for canceling the $40 billion Ford-class aircraft carrier program, halting construction of the littoral combat ship, and purchasing fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.Those funds would be reallocated for the stealthy B-21 bomber, adding 16 additional submarines, and investing in emerging technologies like high-energy lasers, the CNAS report  recommends. The Department of Defense outlined the groundwork of a spending plan in its $583 billion 2017 budget proposal submitted in February, but CNAS experts Hendrix, Paul Scharre and Elbridge Colby say their plan would help the Pentagon rebalance its investment priorities for the next decade. CNAS is an independent and bipartisan organization that provides research and analysis to ""shape and elevate"" the national security and foreign policy debate.  Working under a hypothetical budget that implements a 2 percent increase over the DOD's 2017 budget, the report lays out a plan to grow the Navy to 345 ships from 272 over a 10-year period and provide 185 additional aircraft to the Air Force by investing in what Hendrix called, a ""high-low mix"" of technology. The DOD's 2017 budget request totaled less than a 1 percent increase over 2016 spending levels. The report's authors said purchasing a combination of high-tech systems along with cheaper, lower-tech options would allow the Pentagon to increase the size of its force and permit the US to invest in equipment to handle emerging threats. ""There is a point where quantity does have a quality,"" Hendrix told CNN, adding that it is easier to maintain a presence around the world with higher numbers of ships and planes. For example, rather than buying two F-35s, the CNAS report suggests purchasing one F-35 and two older F-16s or F-18s. ""It's about applying the right type of force to right combat situation,"" Hendrix told CNN. ""You don't have to be all high end to manage national security issues."" Despite cutting the Ford-class carrier program after only two of the four planned ships are complete, the three think-tank experts said their plan will ensure that the US still has 10 aircraft carriers by the end of the decade due to their 35-year lifespan, but that the carriers would take on new functions, acting as prepositioned operating bases around the world. Investing in the airwing gives aircraft carriers utility going forward, Hendrix said, noting that long-range strike aircraft would allow the carriers to sit out of range of Russian and Chinese anti-ship missiles. The money saved by cutting the additional carriers could also allow the Pentagon to counter China and Russia's anti-ship and anti-air defense systems by bolstering the US submarine fleet and developing unmanned systems and undersea technology. Asked for comment on the CNAS report, the Pentagon said only, ""Our strategy is laid out in the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2017."""	Report: Pentagon should scrap $40 billion aircraft carrier
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/kelly-ayotte-maggie-hassan-ad/index.html	"The ad from the US Chamber of Commerce does not explicitly say the group believes Hillary Clinton will be president, but the intent is to make clear to voters that possibility is very real. ""America's future is far from certain,"" the narrator says over a picture of an empty presidential debate stage, followed by one of the White House.""But no matter who the president is, New Hampshire needs a strong voice in the US Senate,"" the ad continues, declaring that incumbent Sen. Kelly Ayotte works across the aisle to get things done.The ad reflects a growing sense among the establishment wing of the party that the White House is increasingly out of reach for its nominee, Donald Trump. Many Republicans are now shifting their focus to Capitol Hill, where the GOP's control of the Senate is on the line. Even the House, long seen as safely in Republican hands, could also be in play.A source with the Chamber tells CNN that the group chose to air this kind of ad in New Hampshire first because it is the ""most needed,"" but noted there could be others to follow elsewhere to help Republicans fighting to maintain control of the Senate -- a cause even more dire as GOP hopes for winning the White House fade. The hope is that this ad -- the first of its kind -- sends a signal to GOP downballot candidates and other Republican groups that it is time to realize Trump will not win and the focus should be on saving the GOP Senate majority.The ad, set to launch this week, comes as a new WMUR New Hampshire poll shows Ayotte trailing her Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan, the state's governor, by 8%. That same poll has Clinton beating Donald Trump by 15 points in the Granite State -- a battleground where Trump has been competing hard.Of all the endangered GOP senators this election year, Ayotte has seemed to struggle the most with Trump at the top of the Republican ticket. She stumbled on a debate question earlier this month about whether she believes Trump is a good role model by saying yes, then coming out quickly the next day to say she misspoke."

It's a place where trolls try to bait me into insignificant arguments and where conspiracy theorists call me a fraud for failing to report the ""real"" reason Donald Trump groped those women: Carlos Slim, of course.It gets worse. The ugly underbelly of the alt-right movement, to which Trump has given legitimacy, has been exposed as it has turned to social media to spread anti-Semitic, racist and sexist propaganda. No fan of censorship, I have nonetheless taken to blocking anyone on Twitter who uses Pepe the frog -- which the Anti-Defamation League now considers a hate symbol -- in their avatar or tweet.Some supporters of Trump enjoy tweeting Holocaust photos, promising that after the election that's where I and other anti-Trumpers will end up. Swastikas, Confederate flags, white nationalists and anti-government anarchists haven't just found a home on social media -- they've found a front yard where they can openly and defiantly plant their disturbing yard signs for the world to see.What's there to do about this? Very little. Reporting hate speech on Twitter comes with complications, especially for First Amendment defenders who know that one man's hate speech is another man's free speech. Reporting offensive social media to some vague, corporate thought-police board isn't very appealing to me.But I do wish there was an app -- (are you listening millennials?) -- where you could send someone's offensive tweet to three specific people: the offender's mother, spouse and employer. I'm pretty sure the problem would take care of itself.Balancing motherhood and the 2016 campaignWe complain a lot about social media and the way it treats us in politics, whether you're voting Republican, Democrat or None of These Awful People for president this year. But the truth is, social media is the best thing ever to happen to politics and journalism.Thanks to widespread Internet reach, we know -- and care -- about things that would otherwise be happening in far-flung corners of the earth. Ever hear of the Arab Spring? Of course you have, because you're on Facebook.Also, before social media, it was possible to believe disturbing movements like the alt-right were fringe and underground. It's important to know up-close how movements like this are fomenting and where they are headed. Social media helps immensely.And because of social media, news consumers have a way of venting at news producers. Instead of angrily yelling at your television, you can actually go on Twitter and tell Jake Tapper that he isn't covering the thing you want him to cover (and he'll tell you to watch the next segment). We, as news producers, whether we are reporters, anchors, editors, opinion contributors, are disadvantaged when we are protected from your reactions.For me personally, I've discovered it's been a place to shed light on a topic that I don't think has gotten enough attention this election year, or since 2011, which is the plight of the Syrian children. I recently took to tweetstorming, not something I'd done much of before, photos and stories about the humanitarian crisis and found a lot of support in response, and gratitude for raising awareness. It's a little thing -- miniscule in fact -- but it's not nothing. Trump supporters are, of course, against my doing this. Not for the policy (I haven't prescribed any) but for what they call ""concern trolling"" and ""virtue signaling,"" other nasty stuff that comes with trying to do a good thing on social media. But for every awful idiot on Twitter, there are thousands more who are connecting with this issue in ways they haven't before. Whatever you use social media for, it undoubtedly comes with a lot of unwanted crap. Maybe ultimately you'll decide it isn't worth it for you, and you'd be justified. I can speak from experience -- no one wants to be called a ""loser"" on Twitter. By Donald Trump.  But whether it's shining light on an important social cause or sharing that perfect GIF that will brighten up someone's day, social media is a force for good. It's just up to us to use it.SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and a conservative."	Why women should stay engaged with social media
