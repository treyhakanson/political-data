Just two hours later, he opened up Twitter again and quickly went from venting to slandering a former beauty queen -- shaming her for a sex tape for which the campaign has not provided evidence.Trump's conduct since the first debate has been astonishing for a major party nominee just 39 days away from the election. Instead of zeroing in on his strongest points from Monday night on jobs and trade, he's cited fake polls, resurfaced Bill Clinton's marital scandals from the 1990s, floated a conspiracy theory about Google searches and attacked 1996's Miss Universe.And after Hillary Clinton raised allegations that Trump called 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping,"" Trump has kept that controversy alive by refusing to apologize, instead seeking to discredit Machado and justify his apparent comments and similar ones he made in interviews at the time. The overnight tweeting spree once again brought into focus Trump's apparent unwillingness or inability to back away from a fight, regardless of who is attacking him. It's a habit that serves to keep the attention away from his core campaign message and also emphasizes Clinton's argument that Trump lacks the temperament to be president. ""By the way, who gets up at three o'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against the former Miss Universe?"" Clinton asked supporters in Coral Springs, Florida. ""I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could, really. Why does he do things like that?""She added that the late-night rant was ""unhinged"" and proved he is ""temperamentally unfit"" for the Oval Office, a line of attack she's used before.Trump defended himself via Twitter Friday afternoon.""For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!"" he tweeted.Asked by WZZM in Grand Rapids, Michigan, about his tweeting habits, Trump said he finds the medium ""effective.""""It's one way you communicate whereas you know two years ago, five years ago, 20 years ago you wouldn't have this, but now it's a modern day way of communicating,"" he said Friday. ""I find it very effective."" Asked Friday by CNN's Jake Tapper why Trump's phone hasn't been taken away from him, campaign surrogate Sarah Huckabee Sanders replied, ""I don't think we're -- anybody's taking anybody's phone away.""Reminiscent of Khan feudClinton called Machado Friday on her drive from her first event in Florida to the airport in Vero Beach, according to Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman. The call lasted around five minutes.Clinton started by thanking Machado for all she has done and for the courage she has shown, Merrill said. Machado responded by saying that she supported Clinton for a long time and she will continue to support Clinton and I will continue to stand up to Trump.It was reminiscent of Trump's rough and tumble month of August when he skirted numerous controversies and refused to back down after the Khans, parents of a Muslim US soldier who died in Iraq, criticized him for his Islamophobic rhetoric and policies.Even as his top advisers urged him to abandon his feud with the Khans, Trump escalated it, suggesting Ghazala Khan, the mother, stood silently alongside her husband at the Democratic National Convention because she was subservient to her husband and comparing his own sacrifices to the family's loss of their son. It's also become clear that Trump's supporters are less than thrilled with his decision to keep the Machado controversy alive.Kellyanne Conway, the billionaire's campaign manager, said Thursday on ""The View"" that she reprimanded Trump for his comments on ""Fox and Friends.""And Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany, a CNN political commentator, rebuked Trump Friday morning for his overnight tweeting, saying, ""I don't think Donald Trump needs to be doing that.""The controversy started when Clinton brought up Trump's comments and treatment of Machado at Monday's presidential debate. The next morning, Trump doubled down.""You know, she gained a massive amount of weight (after winning Miss Universe) and it was a real problem. We had a real problem,"" Trump said on ""Fox and Friends"" the morning after the debate.He defended himself similarly in an interview the next day with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly.As Machado did the media rounds and the Clinton campaign continued to attack Trump over his treatment of Machado, Trump apparently couldn't shake the hits. And that's when he pulled up Twitter in the wee hours of Friday morning, and began firing off.""Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an 'angel' without checking her past, which is terrible!"" he tweeted.""Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virture just shows taht Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con,"" he continued at 5:19 a.m.And finally, ""Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in debate?""Machado's past has come under intense scrutiny in recent days, including accusations from Trump's surrogates that she drove a getaway car from a murder scene in Venezuela in 1998, to which Machado replied on CNN this week that ""I have my past"" and that she is ""no saint girl.""""He can say whatever he wants to say. I don't care. You know, I have my past, of course everybody has a past. And I'm no saint girl,"" Machado told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday on ""AC360."" ""But that is not the point now ... (Trump) was really rude with me, he tried to destroy my self esteem. And now I'm a voice in the Latin community. I'm in a great moment in my life and I have a very clear life. And I can show my taxes.""Machado has also appeared in a reality TV show in which she appears to engage in a sex act under the covers with another contestant -- which some tabloids and conservative outlets have pointed to as evidence of a sex tape.Supporters of the Republican nominee have argued since Trump's roller coaster month of August that he has evolved as a candidate: he shook up his campaign leadership and has faithfully stuck to delivering rally speeches from a teleprompter, minimizing the number of controversies he can stoke.But late at night, with his campaign staff far from his side, Trump was free to follow his gut. And his gut told him to punch back at a former Miss Universe whom he allegedly once called ""Miss Piggy"" after she gained weight by calling her disgusting for starring in a sex tape.And so that's what he did.

CNN and a group of other news outlets petitioned successfully for the release of the actual video from the lawsuit involving two Washington restaurateurs.The video's release caps a challenging week following an underwhelming debate performance and comes with a little more than a month until the election. Shortly after he launched his campaign, Macy's department store, Serta, Univision and others cut their ties with him. Univision later settled with him for ""a substantial"" but undisclosed amount of money, according to Trump.""I guess they didn't like my comments,"" Trump told lawyers in a lawsuit over two restaurateurs who backed out of plans for his recently opened hotel at the Old Post Office Building in Washington, just a few blocks from the White House.Trump sued the two celebrity chefs, Geoffrey Zakarian and Jose Andres, after they cited his comments about Mexicans in their decision to cancel the planned restaurants. Both Zakarian and Andres filed countersuits.Another deposition taken in the lawsuit shows Ivanka Trump seemed to understand the damage by her father's comments and she ""suggested a clarification because I felt that his comments were being misconstrued.""""Basically I was playing around with the idea of the fact that the media was spinning what he said to be about Hispanic people generally, as opposed to illegal Immigrants, which he subsequently clarified on his own,"" Ivanka Trump told lawyers.Trump's lawyers had argued against the release of the video, saying that it would likely become campaign fodder, but the judge in the case decided that was not a strong enough argument in a filing issued Thursday evening."

""Bill! Let's go!"" Obama hollers again as Clinton dallies at the bottom of the stairs and other people board.""Bill! Let's go. Let's go home,"" Obama says after he walks on the plane's mobile stairs.Finally, Clinton, delayed after greeting people seeing the US delegation off, strides up the steps and the two presidents go arm-in-arm into Air Force One."

No other details were immediately made available.The statement provided no evidence that the audio issue affected the television audience of more than 80 million people.To CNN producers inside the debate hall, it sounded as if Trump's audio was at a lower level at the beginning of several answers, perhaps as a result of him standing too far away from the microphone attached to his lectern. During the course of those answers, it appeared as if someone had increased the audio level, making Trump sound louder in the hall.His audio level never seemed to stay low for an entire answer. The audio issue appears to have been limited to what was heard by the audience inside the debate hall, and the variations in audio were not heard by viewers watching the debate on television. The PA system in the auditorium and the TV audio were operated separately.Trump had complained earlier in the week that his microphone wasn't functioning properly at Monday's debate, though Friday's statement by the commission said nothing about a microphone problem.""And they also had, gave me a defective mic. Did you notice that? My mic was defective within the room,"" he told a group of reporters afterward. ""No, but I wonder, was that on purpose? Was that on purpose? But I had a mic that wasn't worked properly, with, working properly within the room.""Speaking at a rally in Novi, Michigan, Friday afternoon, Trump said the commission's announcement vindicated him.""It was just as I was saying,"" Trump declared. ""Working that mic was a hell of a lot more difficult than working crooked Hillary Clinton.""He added: ""I wonder why it was bad. I wonder why it was bad,"" though he did not speculate further.In a New York Times interview released Friday night, Trump said he ""spent 50% of my thought process"" dealing with the issue. He blamed any problems he had at the debate -- his performance was widely panned -- on the technical problems.Trump's Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, mocked Trump the day after the debate for complaining about his mic.""Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,"" Clinton told reporters."

None likes Donald Trump. But only one said he would vote for Clinton.Courting young voters is a central part of the Clinton campaign's grassroots efforts in the final weeks before Election Day, and for good reason.Young voters fueled President Barack Obama's victories. He got 60% of 18-29-year-olds in 2012, a demographic that was nearly 20% of the vote. This week Clinton predicted it could grow to 25% this year.To lure them to her campaign, team Clinton has ramped up efforts to engage millennials -- especially Bernie Sanders supporters -- by bringing on several of the Vermont senator's former campaign aides to mobilize voters under age 35.The campaign has also hired youth directors in swing states across the country to lead the charge registering and courting voters on more than 280 college campuses.Lillie Catlin, Clinton campaign's North Carolina Youth Director, told us that -- not surprisingly -- a big part of their efforts rely on social media: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat -- any and all tools millennials use to communicate with one another, the campaign uses too.""We have a really exciting digital program and a lot of it's being run by our campus organizers themselves,"" Catlin said.""We can't, you know, knock on every dorm and students move every year and so it's, you know having those kinds of conversations but through our text lists and on Twitter,"" she added.Still, polls show Clinton is under performing with millennials, so the campaign is deploying high-profile surrogates. Sanders is lobbying his army of young supporters, campaigning along side Clinton this week. Michelle Obama too is targeting millennials, and her husband is planning to help Clinton by going hard after this critical part of his winning coalition.Chelsea Clinton also is hopscotching to college towns. We caught up with her during a visit to North Carolina this week and asked why her mother is having such a challenge exciting millennials. She conceded, ""we need to be doing a better job of collectively making the case at what's at stake in this election,"" noting that only about 55% of 18-24-year-olds were even registered to vote at the beginning of 2016.Chelsea Clinton headlined a forum for students at East Carolina University, talking mostly about the college affordability plan her mother worked on with Sanders after he dropped out of the primary race. During Q-and-A with students, Erick Jenkins told her that he is a Sanders delegate who is now supporting Secretary Clinton, largely because of her college plan.But another Sanders delegate, Zackary Pate, asked what ""moral ground"" Hillary Clinton has to stand on to run as the Democratic nominee.Chelsea Clinton responded by politely thanking him for being a delegate, and urging him to listen to Sanders, who is now making the case for Hillary Clinton.During another back and forth, Pate, who really came to protest, walked out as Chelsea Clinton was speaking, carrying a sign for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.Afterward Pate told us he believes the Democratic primary was rigged for Clinton and that he's going to write in Stein's name on the ballot -- not because he thinks she can win -- but as a way to empower a third party.""This is to make a statement that says that every political party and every voice in this country should be heard, and have fair access to people, to media, to debates, to ballot access, to everything that matters and makes us a democratic nation,"" he said.Losing millennials to third-party candidates is a dire concern for Clinton. A Quinnipiac University national poll this month found  that 44% of voters 18-34 said they would vote for Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson, while only 31% said they would back Clinton.Stumping for Clinton this week, Michelle Obama argued a vote for a third party is really a vote for Donald Trump.""If you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don't vote at all, then you are helping to elect Hillary's opponent,"" said the first lady.At the end of the day, Clinton campaign aides say they think the best people to make this case to millennials are their peers.Anniken Williams, the Vice President of North Carolina College Democrats who sat on stage with Chelsea Clinton this week, admitted afterward that her experience getting friends on the Clinton train has been ""pretty difficult.""She says a lot of people she knows have told her they will vote for a third-party candidate.""To me when you vote for a third party -- I've studied this, I'm a political science major -- when you vote third party you're throwing your vote away,"" Williams said.She told us that she has successfully changed a few minds making that case around campus.Back at Clinton campaign headquarters in New York, they collect all kinds of data from their vast grassroots efforts to try to figure out if their efforts to lure millennials is working.But there is an unlikely barometer beyond the fancy metrics that top advisers say is most telling: tracking online sales of Hillary Clinton campaign merchandise. The cooler she is to young people, the more they tend to buy her campaign hats and t-shirts."	Hillary Clinton's young people problem

At least if Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have (me),"" Duterte said Friday while speaking in his hometown of Davao City. ""You know my victims, I would like (them) to be all criminals, to finish the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition.""Asked about Duterte's comments Friday, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter called them ""deeply troubling.""Speaking to reporters after attending a meeting of defense ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in Oahu, Hawaii, Carter said Duterte's remarks were not discussed in the meeting. He stressed that US-Philippines cooperation would continue, saying, ""It has served the interests of our nations for many years now"" and adding that he had good discussions about ""ongoing alliance operations"" with his counterpart from the Philippines.Carter's description of Duterte's remarks were echoed earlier Friday by State Department spokesman Mark Toner.""We find them troubling,"" Toner told reporters in Washington.Toner went on to say that the US-Philippines relationship was based on ""our shared belief in human rights and human dignity, and within that context, President Duterte's comments are a significant departure from that tradition.""He added, ""Words matter, especially when they're from leaders of sovereign nations.""But when asked if the latest Filipino leader's outburst would negatively affect the US-Philippines relationship, Toner said the US government continues to ""productively, constructively and closely cooperate with the Philippines on a number of issues.""He continued, ""While there (are) these remarks occasionally being made, at the working level our relationship remains very strong and very vital.""Toner highlighted security cooperation as one such area that remained strong, comments that followed remarks Thursday by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter describing the two countries' military relationship as ""ironclad.""Still, Duterte himself has cast doubt on the future of that collaboration, and his incendiary comments and aggressive style of rule could complicate the relationship with the US.Duterte, speaking in Hanoi, Vietnam, earlier this week, said joint US-Philippine navy drills scheduled for next month will the last of its kind between the two countries.""I would serve notice to you now that this will be the last military exercise. Jointly, Philippines, US, last one,"" he said, while noting that such exercises are not wanted by China.While defense officials from both the Philippines and the US downplayed the immediate impact of the President's statements, his comments are bound to complicate a relationship that the US has long seen as one of its most stable in Southeast Asia.The US and the Philippines are co-signatories of a mutual defense pact, signed in 1951. Duterte signaled that he would continue to honor the pact while speaking in Vietnam, noting it dates back to the 1950s, even as he said he would ""establish new alliances for trade and commerce.""RELATED: Duterte's tongue the least of Obama's Philippine problemBut as the US seeks allies amid China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea, the loss of the Philippines could be a major headache for US policy planners.Only month's before Duterte's June swearing in, the two countries inked an agreement granting US military forces access to five bases in the Philippines. It's a major boost for US troops in the Pacific as China has engaged in the development, and by many assessments militarization, of man-made islands in the South China Sea.In July, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a maritime dispute that was seen as a victory by the US, concluding that Beijing had no legal basis to claim the bulk of the South China Sea.But Duterte has singled that he is willing to enter bilateral negotiations with the Chinese over the dispute and has publicly expressed a desire for closer relations with the Asian power.Asked about the Philippines' relations with other countries, Toner, the State Department spokesman, said the US was not opposed.""This is not a zero sum game for us,"" he said.

She was seen leaving the hotel on Saturday.A longtime Clinton confidant is portraying Trump in her practice debate sessions, two people familiar with the debate preparations tell CNN.Philippe Reines, known for his combative style and fierce loyalty to Clinton, is spending the weekend helping Clinton prepare. He has been working closely with her debate planning team for more than a month, the sources said.Hillary Clinton prepares for unpredictable Donald Trump at debateClinton is joined in the sessions by Huma Abedin, her longtime aide; John Podesta, her campaign chairman; and Jake Sullivan, Clinton's top policy aide, according to the sources. The all-day sessions, which find Clinton sparring with multiple versions of the Republican nominee, are being led by Ron Klain, who advised President Barack Obama, and Karen Dunn, a longtime lawyer and aide.She last appeared on the campaign trail Wednesday in Orlando, Florida. Her absence has not gone unnoticed; on Thursday, Trump asked a campaign audience where she was, remarking, ""Some people think she's sleeping.""Clinton told donors last month that she isn't sure which Trump will show up on Monday: A more reserved, controlled Republican nominee or the blunt, happy-to-insult candidate voters see on the campaign trail. Because of uncertainty, Clinton is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity to her health.In addition to preparing at the hotel, Clinton spent weeks reading briefing books about Trump's policy, personality and politics at her home. Aides have said that Democrats have offered considerable -- sometimes unsolicited advice -- to the former secretary of state.""I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,"" Clinton said Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. ""I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport.""The role of Trump had been one of the most closely-guarded secrets surrounding Clinton's rigorous debate preparations. Most aides at the campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, while aware that Reines speaks frequently to Clinton, did not know he was playing the role of Trump.The New York Times first reported Reines' involvement in debate preparations. Reines was a press secretary for Clinton during her Senate tenure and one of her closest advisers as secretary of state. In Clinton's memoir about her time leading the State Department, ""Hard Choices,"" she describes him as ""passionate, loyal, and shrewd.""""He usually knows what Washington's movers and shakers are thinking even before they do,"" Clinton wrote in her 2014 memoir.Among aide's top concerns for Monday night are that Trump will be graded differently than Clinton, given his relative inexperience compared to the former secretary of state, who has debated upwards of 40 times, including debates in 2008 and during her Senate run in 2000.Clinton's aides would not disclose who is playing NBC's Lester Holt, who is moderating Monday's debate, in the sessions. But they did say on Friday that they are worried about the journalist not fact-checking Trump during the debate.""Donald Trump has pattern of repeating lies hoping no one will correct him. Want voters to be on alert. Any candidate who tells this many lies clearly can't win the debate on the merit,"" Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, said on a call with reporters. ""This warrants particular focus because his level of lying is unprecedented in American politics.""Both candidates have been viewing hours of footage of their opponent to assess their debate style -- and their campaigns have strained to hang high expectations on their rivals in an effort to minimize the impact of their own flaws.CNN previously reported that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is playing Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine in debate preps with Mike Pence. Meanwhile, lawyer and agent Bob Barnett is playing Pence in debate prep sessions with Kaine."

""No one expected it except me. We got it. And when we got it, what we wanted to do was make sure it wasn't just a one-night thing.""Donors are buying in.

Still, there is no denying the interest -- nearly three in four students have applied online for one of the few hundred publicly available seats inside the David S.

""My parking lot situation is pretty bad out here.
