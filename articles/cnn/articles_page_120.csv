While Trump didn't directly answer the question, his response essentially boiled down to: See something, say something, Muslims. ""We have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it,"" he said. Muslims took to Twitter to report what they saw. Muslims report TrumpMoustafa Bayoumi kicked things off with his tweet: ""I'm a Muslim, and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri.""Some pointed to what they saw on the town hall stage Sunday night.

Trump's mission: Make Clinton's life hell for the next monthMuslims report Islamophobia Trump backed away from his previous call to ban all Muslim immigration into the US, and said he now backed ""extreme vetting."" He also likened accepting refugees from Syria into the US as ""the great Trojan horse of all time.""

The debate, in case you missed it, was a town hall-style affair where audience members (screened by Gallup and selected by the moderators) asked questions of the candidates. And in that group of well-behaved, articulate, truth seekers was one Mr. Bone. The nastiest lines from the debateHis question to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was a doozy: ""What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job layoffs?""But that wasn't why Bone became the Internet's insta-darling. It's that name. Ken Bone. Very Luke Cage-y.It's that power outfit:  The red cardigan, the white tie, the black-rimmed glasses. People were in love. The man behind (...in?) the red sweaterBone spoke to CNN's Carol Costello Monday morning about his debate fame. ""I went from, last night, having seven Twitter followers, two of which were my grandmother...to now, I have several hundred,"" he said. ""And I don't know why they care what I have to say, but I'm glad they're engaged in the political process.""Maybe it has to do with the fact that, at the end of proceedings, he captured the moment by whipping out... a disposable camera.Ken Bone -- he's no conformist. He's the person a divided America needs right now. The man who brought some levity to the ludicrous, some vim to counter the vitriol. The only thing that was making America great again. As Ramzy Nasrallah put it, ""Was so sad and ashamed throughout the entire spectacle but then KEN BONE rose like a Phoenix from America's ashes and there's laughter again.""Bone was one of the undecided voters who attended the debate to get a better feel for their options come November. And Bone told CNN he actually walked away without a final verdict. ""I know people hate to hear this, but I think I might be more undecided than ever,"" he said. Bone said he was leaning toward Trump, but he was impressed with Clinton's composure and looks forward to the third and final debate. Either way, true to the Internet hero he has become, he plans to use his power for good. ""I'm really glad that so much attention has come my way, if for no other reason than I can get the message out that your voice can be heard, and please get out and vote in November. If you feel like your vote doesn't matter, it does. Make your voice heard."" The internet bursts with love During an otherwise contentious event, Bone's comforting demeanor was just the balm weary debate watchers needed. ""I bet Ken Bone brings roses to his wife randomly. Just because,"" one mused. Within minutes, someone had created a Facebook page. And, of course, a parody Twitter account. And yes, an ode to his greatness.We also all now know what we'll be dressing as for Halloween.So, thank you, debate organizers, for giving us someone we could all rally behind. ""Tonight I lost hope in America's future... then I met Ken Bone,"" tweeted Jeff Guenther.We could not agree more. Postscript: We would be remiss if we also didn't give a shout out to Mr. Staring Man. Our apologies for not catching his name. But we certainly caught his ""Do NOT B.S. me, mister"" look.

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/10/politics/podesta-emails-wikileaks/index.html	"This is the second hack in four days from WikiLeaks, which claims it has a trove of more than 50,000 emails from Podesta.The emails appear to be mostly from 2015, covering a litany of policy and strategy discussions between Clinton staffers on how to handle issues of the day and the press, including the release of the book ""Clinton Cash"" alleging nefarious activity by the Clinton Foundation. Another email has long-time Clinton aide Doug Band referring to Chelsea Clinton as a ""spoiled brat.""Clinton campaign responded to the release by slamming the Trump campaign for ""cheering on a release today engineered by Vladimir Putin,"" after Trump adviser Jason Miller tweeted a link to the document page with the phrase ""And here...we...go."" ""It is absolutely disgraceful that the Trump campaign is cheering on a release today engineered by Vladimir Putin to interfere in this election, and this comes after Donald Trump encouraged more espionage over the summer and continued to deny the hack even happened at Sunday's debate,"" said Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin. ""The timing shows you that even Putin knows Trump had a bad weekend and a bad debate.""WikiLeaks has been alleged to work with Russia, and US national security officials have accused Russia of trying to influence the US elections through highly coordinated hacks, though they haven't pointed specifically to Russia in the WikiLeaks release.Emails released Friday included what appeared to be excerpts from transcripts of closed-door speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street companies after leaving the State Department. Here are some highlights of the new batch.Chelsea Clinton a 'spoiled brat'One exchange has a long-time Bill Clinton aide calling his daughter Chelsea Clinton a ""spoiled brat"" who had a ""lack of focus in her life"" in a 2011 email that came to light as part of hacked emails posted by Wikileaks.Doug Band emailed Podesta and longtime Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills about a damning story about his consulting company, Teneo, by lashing out at Chelsea Clinton.WikiLeaks posts apparent excerpts of Clinton Wall Street speeches""I don't deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for me to explain these things,"" Band wrote. ""She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she's doing because she, as she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life.""""Clinton Cash"" responseThe emails also revealed that Clinton wanted to respond more forcefully to ""Clinton Cash,"" the 2015 book that looked to connect Clinton Foundation actions and decisions made by Hillary Clinton's State Department.According to an email from another close aide, Huma Abedin, Clinton wanted to tape a straight-to-camera video responding to the allegations.""She believes she needs to do this video because her integrity is being attacked and she is the only one who can say she didnt (sic) make a decision as secstate based on a donor,"" Abedin wrote. Abedin added, ""She doesnt want to continue to have to have press yell these questions at her in Nevada and CA and if she doesnt do the video, that is the situation she will be in.""Reporters at Clinton events had tried to get the former secretary of state to respond to the book by shouting questions at her at events on the trail. Initially, the Clinton campaign had decided not to respond directly to the charges, given the lack of front-page and TV coverage of the book. Once that began to change, having Clinton respond to the charges began to gain more traction internally.Clinton ended up responding to the book in TV interviews.When to object to Keystone?The Clinton campaign discussed opposing the Keystone XL pipeline as early as spring 2015, according to one email from campaign manager Robby Mook.Discussing a revelation that a Canadian bank and shareholder in the project had paid $1 million to Bill Clinton while the State Department was reviewing the pipeline, Mook wrote on April 19, 2015, ""The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?""Clinton eventually announced her opposition to the project in September 2015; Obama formally vetoed it in November.Responding to Clinton Foundation link to Russian uranium companyOne email exchange revealed the manner in which the campaign aimed to deal with a New York Times article in April 2015 that alleged a connection between donations to the Clinton Foundation and a Russian uranium producing company, Uranium One.""We should have surrogates attack the NY Times for writing 'thousands' of words when their own story admitted that there was no connection,"" Joel Benenson, CEO of the Benenson Strategy Group, wrote to Mandy Grunwald of Grunwald Communications. Grunwald responded, ""Ditto here. But it still ran on the front page and he's still getting air time all over the place.""Suggestions for ClintonThere's no shortage of suggestions from Clinton supporters outside the campaign on ways she could break through against Bernie Sanders and improve her performance.One chain from September 2015 starts with an email from Democratic power broker Andy Manatos, who suggests, ""A good amount of exposure of Hillary holding, feeding and playing with her adorable grandchild would greatly help the public understand her."""

3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/10/politics/trump-clinton-family-feud/index.html	"Now there are the Clintons and the Trumps.Two clans whose triumphs and disasters have flared bright across the national stage for a quarter century are now engulfed in a family feud for the modern era.Bill and Hillary Clinton are the most enduring political figures bridging the turn of the 20th Century into the 21st, perpetually locked in a cycle of self-imposed failure and redemption -- and are on the verge of recapturing ultimate power.Donald Trump and his colorful, brash kin are the nouveau riche embodiment of a new political age when 12 million Twitter followers and outrageous fame are as important as the traditional political network that the Clintons have built for a generation.On Sunday night, the two compelling, potential first families faced off in the round in a gladiatorial contest with the fate of the White House on the line.The episode that unfolded in St Louis at the second presidential debate reached almost operatic levels of melodrama and antipathy, registering a new emotional peak in a campaign that will echo throughout the ages.The showdown, dubbed by CNN's Brian Stelter ""The fury in Missouri,"" began with the families arriving separately in Secret Service SUVs. Trump strolled to his holding room as his wife and children swept in behind him.7 takeaways from the second presidential debateChelsea Clinton put an arm around her mother's shoulders as they scaled a short flight of stairs, once again at her side during a moment of personal testing.Trump's sparringBut Trump started the sparring well before he took the debate stage Sunday night.Just beforehand, he engineered a staggering stunt with three women who have spent decades accusing Bill Clinton of sexual assault. By staging an event with them, the billionaire signaled he was ready to do whatever it takes to get into Hillary Clinton's head.With his campaign in free fall after the release of video showing him boasting about how he can grope women with impunity because he is a ""star,"" Trump seems determined to introduce the seediest, most sordid details of a flurry of half-forgotten Clinton scandals to a new millennial audience.The reality star's move in meeting the Clinton accusers was pure Trump -- lassoing the media into covering a spectacle -- and placing himself at dead center of the chaos, ready to make the most of the confusion of his disoriented foes.It was also a sign that his days of listening to GOP leaders who fear the blowback of such inflammatory tactics are done. If Trump is going down, he now appears determined to take the Republican Party and any future Hillary Clinton presidency down with him.The Trump campaign then attempted to have the three women -- Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey -- allowed in the VIP box in the hall, where they would dramatically have been in close quarters with Bill Clinton himself.But the Commission on Presidential Debates nixed the plan, saying that area was for family only, so the women had to be content with a prominent seat in the audience.Bill Clinton had been briefed about Trump's media coup before arriving at the debate hall, sources said.The former president still waited to greet the Trumps as they walked in to take their seats, shaking the billionaire's wife Melania by the hand, then moving on to grim-faced handshakes to each of Trump's kids -- perhaps in a steely bid to show he was not fazed.Donald Trump's mission: Make Clinton's life hell for the next monthAmong them was Donald Trump Jr., who had said he was proud of his dad for not bringing up Clinton sex scandals in the first debate.But Chelsea Clinton -- apparently to avoid an awkward moment with her friend Ivanka Trump, the Republican nominee's daughter -- joined her father a little later.Spiking awkwardnessThe awkwardness only spiked when the candidates themselves appeared.Clinton and Trump walked on stage and stopped a few feet one another. Trump nodded. Clinton said, ""Hello, hello,"" in a strained voice, the tension and simmering dislike each candidate bears for the other palpable.There was no traditional pre-debate handshake and each candidate seemed loath to stand in the same photo frame, in the end standing sideways without looking the other in the eye.With the debate underway, Trump adopted a glowering, somber persona. As Clinton spoke, he paced the stage. As he prepared to unleash zingers, he often lifted his microphone to his lips and paused for a few seconds to build anticipation.At times, he seemed to loom large right behind his foe as she addressed members of the town hall audience. Though camera angles likely contributed to the unflattering look, it may not have played well with crucial women voters watching at home.He introduced language never seen in such a rarified setting before -- calling Bill Clinton ""abusive"" and Hilary Clinton a ""liar,"" a ""devil"" with ""tremendous hate in her heart."" He brushed off his offensive banter on the ""Access Hollywood"" tape as mere ""locker room talk.""Clinton never flinched. She fought back by going after Trump's personality, and refused to be intimidated by a rival used to dominating a room.""My argument is not with his supporters. It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans,"" she said.Trump also rarely lost his cool and refused Clinton's bait, frustrating her efforts to provoke him into the kind of overreactions that cost him in the first debate.Public humiliationClinton has endured all kinds of public humiliation during her long tenure on the national stage -- especially during the impeachment saga set off by her husband's Oval Office dalliance with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. So she was well-prepared for the daggers that Trump threw her way, a sustained, personal, bitter attack unprecedented at a televised presidential debate.Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton II: The nastiest linesThroughout it all, she remained calm, returning to lean on her stool and sometimes shaking her head or even smiling.At times, the drama became surreal.When Trump threatened to appoint a special prosecutor if he becomes president to probe her ""situation"" -- referring to her handling of classified information while using a personal email server for official business as secretary of state -- it seemed American politics resembled a classic banana Republic more than the most enduring and powerful democracy the world has ever seen.Several times, moderators Anderson Cooper from CNN and Martha Raddatz from ABC had to step in to cool boos and cheers from the audience.As he has throughout the campaign, Trump again busted convention Sunday night -- dismissing the pundits' assessment that flagrant personal attacks don't work in a town hall event, a more intimate affair than other debate formats.The final person to ask a question might have helped cool the atmosphere and get everyone out in one piece when he asked each candidate to mention something about the other that they admire.Clinton discussed Trump's family. And in an almost touching moment, Trump praised his opponent's resilience and determination to never give up.With temperatures cooled a notch after the ugliest presidential debate in memory, the two feuding rivals did meet at center stage for a brief handshake.Trump left the stage and was greeted by his son Donald Trump Jr., who shared a glance and shook hands.The Clintons were focused on the family business. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton huddled with the undecided voters brought into the debate to ask questions. Fighting for every vote, just as they have done for years."	High drama on debate night

You know, it takes a big man to know when he is wrong and to admit it and to have the humility to apologize and be transparent and be vulnerable with people and Donald Trump last night showed that he is a big man,"" Pence told a few hundred supporters during the mid-day campaign stop. The Indiana governor cut right to the chase at the top of his speech, broaching the debate and Trump's apology simultaneously. Pence said his running mate ""literally embodies the spirit of America"" and rolled out a string of positive descriptors like ""strong, freedom loving and independent."" The vice presidential candidate often talks about his Christian faith on the campaign trail, and Pence relied on his religious roots again today, explaining that he believes in forgiveness. ""You know, as I said last weekend, I don't condone what was said and I spoke out against it. But the other part of my faith is I believe in grace. I've received it. I believe in it. I believe in forgiveness, and we are called to forgive as we have been forgiven,"" Pence said. The crowd applauded and seemed receptive to this message. Pence continued to praise Trump's performance last night. ""Last night my running mate, he showed the American people what was in his heart and he showed humility to the American people, and then he fought back and turned the focus to the choice that we face, and I am proud to stand with Donald Trump."" At the same time that Pence was onstage touting his running mate, Trump tweeted out a critical statement of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has all but unendorsed the Republican presidential candidate. At an ice cream stop after the town hall, Pence did not answer reporters' questions about whether he had spoken with the speaker or for his reaction. Pence also hit back on the Hillary Clinton's latest hacked emails, quoting her comments to Wall Street investors in which she talks about having a ""public and private position"" in order to be politically successful. Someone in the crowd yelled, ""She's two-faced!"" Pence went on to say of Sunday night, ""When she was asked about that on television, and give the moderators some credit -- she was asked about it last night, we got a lecture about Abraham Lincoln. Did you see that? Well, as a member of the party of Lincoln, I would prefer if dishonest Hillary did not associate herself with honest Abe,"" he told the crowd."

She received 52% to Trump's 38%, a 14-point lead. NBC's ""Access Hollywood"" tape, which was first published Friday by The Washington Post, upended Trump's campaign this weekend. Numerous Republican Party members rescinded their endorsements of the GOP nominee.Trump apologized for his comments during the debate but also dismissed them as ""locker room talk"" and used his response as an opportunity to attack former President Bill Clinton for the latter's indiscretions.

""We are in full coordination with the Trump campaign. We have a great relationship with them. And we are going to continue to work together to make sure he wins in November.""The move to present a united front with the Trump campaign comes after earlier Monday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told Republican members of the House he would no longer defend Trump, but did not formally rescind his endorsement.Priebus convened the call with members on short notice over the weekend, and did not take any questions. His remarks lasted less than 14 minutes. Trump's support in the Republican Party has eroded in the past few days after a 2005 recording surfaced of him making lewd and sexually aggressive comments toward women. Several prominent members of the party have pulled support for Trump, and the vast majority have publicly condemned his comments.Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking with him?Monday, Priebus emphasized he does not defend the controversial remarks. ""Like all of you, I don't condone what was said in the video,"" he said. ""In fact, the campaign itself doesn't defend the words in that video.""But the GOP chairman said that Trump comported himself well in Sunday night's debate and apologized from the heart. Priebus also pushed back on media reports of turmoil inside the RNC or efforts to pull back support from Trump. He said no one has left the RNC or the campaign, and said there were no meetings about rules to replace a nominee. He also said no efforts through the party and campaign's joint operation, Trump Victory, were halted. He said efforts were ""ahead of budget"" and donations were still strong. ""Everything is on course,"" Priebus said. He also dismissed as ""silly"" the protest at RNC headquarters organized by a former Virginia campaign chairman for Trump, noting that the man, Corey Stewart, had been let go by the campaign. Trump campaign fires Virginia chair after protestPriebus' move stood in contrast with the tone struck by Ryan, a close friend and political ally of the chairman, on a call with his GOP conference Monday morning. Ryan told members he would not defend Trump and focus on protecting Republican majorities in Congress. He faced pushback from a few members on the call who accused him of ceding the White House.

Part of a presidential nominee's job has been to ensure his or her party wins seats in Congress so the party can enact its legislative agenda. Before he distanced himself from Trump, Ryan explained this calculus was part of why he supported the Republican nominee. ""I'm tired of divided government. It doesn't work very well,"" Ryan told CNN in September.Pierson said in a follow-up message that people would vote straight Republican, regardless of what the ""establishment"" did.Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, offered a similar sentiment Monday, writing, ""Mr. Trump's campaign has always been powered by a grassroots movement, not Washington.""The Trump campaign has repeatedly clashed with party leadership, and Hill figures have warned about his campaign's negative effects on their down-ballot efforts.During an appearance Tuesday on CNN, Pierson tried to downplay the vulgar remarks Trump made on a 2005 videotape, which has driven Republicans to rescind their endorsement.As Pierson put it, Trump wasn't even a Republican when he made the offending comments.""We keep hearing from the left and the media how we want to talk about substance,"" Pierseon said.

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/10/politics/donald-trump-rally-debate-women-hillary-clinton/index.html	"(CNN) — Donald Trump emerged Monday from the toughest weekend of his presidential bid seemingly more determined than ever to go on the attack.The Republican nominee didn't hang on mea culpas or seek to humble himself after audio of a 2005 conversation in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals surfaced on Friday, even as the Republican speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, said he would no longer defend Trump and urged fellow lawmakers to simply ""do what's best for you and your district."" And he certainly didn't address the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Monday showing Clinton seizing an 11-point lead in the wake of Friday's revelation.Instead, he intensified his attacks on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by tying her to allegations of sexual misconduct against her husband -- going further even than he did during Sunday night's debate.During his evening rally, basking in the roar of the crowd of several thousand, Trump took a subtle dig at Ryan, mimicking an early tweet, lamenting ""people who can't fix a budget and then they start talking about the nominee.""And he even performed a dramatic reading of  ""The Snake,"" a poem he said he reads when he's ""in a good mood."" High drama on debate nightTrump's campaign swing on Monday came as his closest advisers publicly and privately praised his performance in the second debate in the most glowing terms, and as political observers suggested his performance had helped stem the bleeding of his campaign.But the surest sign that Trump's campaign is still grasping for a recovery came as he lashed out at Clinton by once again dredging up decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct against her husband, former President Bill Clinton -- and warned that more attacks would come should more tapes of him ""saying inappropriate things"" emerge. ""If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we'll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things -- there are so many of them, folks,"" Trump said.He even accused Hillary Clinton of attacking the women who have accused her husband ""more viciously than he attacked them,"" though he offered no evidence of how she attacked those women or why it was worse than her husband's alleged sexual misconduct.Fallout over tapeTrump's attacks at the afternoon rally came three days after audio surfaced of Trump bragging in 2005 about being able to ""grope women -- actions that would amount to sexual assault -- because of his ""star"" status.Trump apologized for those remarks -- which included saying he could ""grab (women) by the pussy"" -- in a video message early Saturday, but has since sought to deflect criticism by repeatedly dismissing the comments as ""locker room talk"" as he did on Monday.Trump only subtly addressed Republican uproar over his comments at his second rally Monday in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, telling the crowd that his running mate, Mike Pence, was a ""totally loyal person"" who had even asked for permission to put out a statement condemning his remarks on Saturday. Speculation had swirled over the weekend that Pence might consider leaving the GOP ticket after he bowed out of an event where he was set to represent Trump on Saturday.The rallies also came after Trump invited three women who accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault or harassment decades ago to join him before the cameras to express their support for his candidacy.Trump then raised those women's allegations in the debate Sunday night, while Hillary Clinton responded by saying, ""when they go low, we go high.""Clinton slammed Trump at a rally Monday for seeking to smear her rather than chastening himself for his lewd and sexually aggressive remarks.But Trump on Monday repeatedly sought to blame Hillary Clinton for Bill Clinton's actions.""As I outlined last night, Bill Clinton was the worst abuser of women ever to sit in the Oval Office. He was a predator,"" Trump said.""For decades, Hilary Clinton has been deeply familiar with her husband's predatory behavior and instead of trying to stop it she made it possible for him to take advantage of even more women. She put even more women in harms way and then she goes out and says, 'Oh I love women. I'm going to help women. I'm going to help women.' But she's a total hypocrite.""Trump also addressed the debate Monday at his first rally since the town hall showdown, arguing it exposed her lies and failures.""She lied so much last night,"" Trump said, even though he was repeatedly fact-checked for false statements over the course of the 90-minute debate.Trump only briefly sought to undercut the mountain of criticism he faced in the wake of the leaked audio, which cemented a view of Trump as a misogynist, by touting his belief in ""equal pay for equal work"" and pointing to his track record of promoting women to top positions in his company.The real estate magnate also noted that while he is ""not proud of everything I've done in life,"" he is proud of his support for blue-collar workers -- who are a key part of his voting bloc -- and said he counted himself among their lot.""I love blue-collar workers,"" said Trump, who was born into a wealthy family. ""And I consider myself in a certain way to be a blue collar worker.""Trump's fiery and combative presence on Monday was only upstaged by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of his top advisers, who told supporters at Trump's first rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, that Hillary Clinton ""hates you"" and had somehow confessed to federal crimes during the debate on Sunday by not directly answering a question about her deleted emails.And taking the stage at Trump's evening rally, Giuliani even took to making light of Trump's hot mic moment.""Phony as -- I can't say that word,"" he said, suddenly stopping himself as he knocked Clinton. ""I might say it back in the locker room."""	Trump determinedly stays on attack after rough weekend
