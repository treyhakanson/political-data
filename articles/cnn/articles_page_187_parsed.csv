A Navy spokesman said the sailor had complained of abdominal pains and was checked into the medical department on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was there where she later gave birth to a seven-pound girl.Both the baby girl and her mother ""are healthy and are doing well,"" according to Cmdr. Bill Urban of the US Naval Forces Central Command.""As the baby was born at sea aboard an operational unit, the main focus for the US Navy, the ship and its crew is the safety and well-being of the baby and the mother,"" Urban said. The woman and child were flown to Bahrain by helicopter with a medical escort, where they are receiving follow-up care at a shore-based hospital.The unexpected birth came at a tense time aboard the ship. The Eisenhower was in the Persian Gulf in support of US-led air campaign against the ISIS. Urban said that Navy policy allows expectant mothers to ""remain onboard a ship up to the 20th week of pregnancy and only if the time for medical evacuation to an emergency treatment facility is less than six hours."" But the Navy was unaware of this particular pregnancy, he added.""While it would have been preferred to send her to her homeport earlier, per policy, we are now focused on caring for the health and welfare of our sailor and the newest member of our Navy family,"" Urban said. ""We are working a plan to move them to a shore-based hospital as soon as possible."" "	Surprise! US Navy sailor unexpectedly gives birth on aircraft carrier	[]	[]

""At the core, the US remains very committed to Israel's long-term security.""Israeli perceptions that sanctions relief provided as part of the nuclear deal would allow Tehran to wreak greater havoc in the region drove Jersusalem's argument that the deal should be much larger than previous packages. Regional unrest in Syria and Iraq deepened Israeli concerns.READ: Opinion: Why Iran deal is good for Israel New York Representative Nita Lowey, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement Tuesday that the agreement would put Israel ""in a better position to address turmoil and instability in the region and therefore be able to better protect its citizens and secure its borders.""   Some reports put Netanyahu's initial aid request as high as $45 billion. In the end, political imperatives may have driven both sides toward an agreement.A long-standing ally Obama will be able to leave the White House in an election year saying that Democrats have done more than any other party to protect a long-standing ally. His party's presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, can claim part of that legacy as Obama's former secretary of state and will likely pledge to continue those policies in her campaign appeals to pro-Israel voters.""I think President Obama sees this as vindication of his belief that there's an iron-willed distinction between his commitment to Israel's security and whatever policy differences might exist between the two countries,"" Makovsky said. For Netanyahu, reaching an agreement now removes any of the uncertainty that might surround the decisions made by Obama's successor. The agreement sets the Israeli prime minister up for a successful visit to New York next week for the UN General Assembly, where he is expected to meet with Obama.And there is symbolic value as well in having a Democrat ink this deal with Israel, Makovsky said. ""By ensuring that a liberal Democrat has signed this deal, it's a way of locking in bipartisan support.""The successful conclusion of the agreement, diplomats on both sides said, represents the staying power of a relationship that transcends individual politicians or leaders.Significant boost in funding The US has made Israel its largest recipient of military assistance for decades, part of its commitment to help its closest Mideast ally maintain a qualitative military advantage in a hostile region. The most recent pact was worth about $3.1 billion a year.The new agreement will be a departure from the previous arrangement in a number of respects, according to congressional sources. Not only will it feature a significant boost in funding, but it will include changes that bring it more in line with US military aid packages to other countries.Israel has agreed to a gradual phasing out of the practice by which as much as 26% of the US aid could be spent on contracts with Israeli defense industries. Instead, all the aid will have to be spent on US defense contractors who will supply Israel.In previous deals, Israel has also been able to spend up to 13% of US aid on military fuel, a practice that will end with this new agreement. The new agreement will also include a decade's worth of funding for Israeli missile defense and a pledge from Israel that it will not lobby Congress for extra money for the program. In the past, funding for Israel's missile defense was provided in addition to the existing military aid of the agreement. It was handled yearly by Congress, making it subject to the uncertainty of the annual appropriations process."	US, Israel reach record military aid deal	['Israel', 'Obama']	[]

A video showed a wobbly Clinton stumbling as she was assisted into her van to depart the ceremony. She then went to daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment and later returned to her home in Chappaqua, where campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Jake Tapper she was attended to by her doctor.Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday but decided to continue on the trail.

Stein also pointed to recent reports hinting at the involvement of some Saudi Arabian officials in the attacks. ""I think all evidence certainly points to bin Laden, but the 9/11 attackers had assistance and funding and bin Laden had assistance and funding.""""What we should have done  is declare a crime against humanity and pursued it, pursued the attackers and gotten the intelligence about who was behind this,"" she added.Stein also criticized the US foreign policy in the wake of the terrorist attacks 15 years ago, and accused both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump of being ""war mongers."" She said that the tragedy ""provided a pretext for the wrong wars, which have only gotten us into more trouble.""The Green Party nominee has repeatedly offered a liberal critique of both major party presidential candidates throughout the White House race, highlighting issues such as climate change and economic inequality in addition to national security and foreign policy. And despite low polling and long odds, Stein has persisted in reaching out to disaffected voters who supported Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary and haven't since warmed to Clinton.

What's the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems?""The veteran Democratic strategist was referencing a rough 48-hour stretch for the Clinton campaign over the weekend, during which Clinton was forced to leave a September 11, 2001, terrorist attack memorial service after ""overheating,"" which her team later revealed was the result of a pneumonia diagnosis the former Secretary of State, who is 68, had received on Friday but which had not been made public at the time. Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway piggybacked on Axelrod's criticism, replying to his tweet: ""Wow. Well said.""Clinton's communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, responded on Twitter, ""We could have done better yesterday, but it is a fact that public knows more about HRC than any nominee in history.""She added, ""In contrast to HRC, Trump has been less transparent than any nominee in modern history.""Conway shot back at Palmieri: ""D-E-F-E-N-S-E. Yet, Jen has a point: they know enough about Hillary that they don't like her, don't trust her.""Axelrod -- who helped run both of Obama's successful presidential campaigns, including his primary fight with Clinton in 2008 -- has been an intermittent critic and backseat driver during Clinton's 2016 campaign. In February this year, during a difficult stretch for the Clinton campaign due to revelations about Clinton's email use at the State Department, Axelrod cryptically wrote on Twitter:""When the exact same problems crop up in separate campaigns, with different staff, at what point do the principals say, ""Hey, maybe it's US?""During the Democratic primary, he also criticized Clinton's team for overthinking their debate strategy, which had been detailed in a New York Times report.

""To millions of people, particularly African-Americans, the Confederate battle emblem is a symbol of Old Mississippi -- the Mississippi of slavery, lynchings, pain and white supremacy,"" wrote U.S. District Court Judge Carlton W. Reeves in an opinion on Thursday.""The emblem offends more than just African-Americans,"" he added, ""it is difficult to imagine how a symbol borne of the South's intention to maintain slavery can unite Mississippians in the 21st century.""While making clear his disdain for the flag, Reeves who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2010, said he had to dismiss Moore's case on a procedural issue. Reeves said that Moore did not have the ""standing,"" or legal right to be in court. Reeves held that Moore couldn't show a ""cognizable legal injury"" necessary to bring the case. But the judge left open the possibility that another case could be brought or ""the people themselves"" could act to change the flag.""Today, Mississippi stands alone,"" Reeves wrote, ""it is the only state to include the notorious 'stars and bars' in its official flag."" ""At times there is something noble in standing alone,"" Reeves continued. ""This is not one of those times.""Moore said in an interview that he was disappointed that the judge blocked his case from going forward, and he plans to file an appeal this week with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.But he believes from a historical perspective the judge ""hit the nail on the head.""""While he dismissed my lawsuit, he definitely left the door open and seemed to be receptive to others challenging the constitutionality of the state flag in the federal court, or to the voters themselves,"" he said.Moore has also attention of a lawyer from a Philadelphia law firm.""I think the judge did a remarkable job of exploring and laying out the historic context of which the flag arose, the way the flag has been used for a more than a century and laying out why it is wrong to have a state incorporate that emblem into its official state flag. However, the judge interpreted 'standing' in a way that is not consistent with Supreme Court precedent,"" said the new lawyer, Michael T. Scott of Reed, Smith.Moore argues in court briefs that the flag is ""tantamount to hateful government speech that both has a discriminatory intent and disparate impact and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.""The lawsuit targets Gov. Phil Bryant. Bryant was not required to answer Moore's allegations, but his office filed a motion to dismiss arguing that Moore's complaint is ""devoid of a single allegation that he has personally suffered a concrete and particularized injury.""Lawyers for the state argued that while Moore may sincerely hold a belief that the flag ""allegedly incites racial violence,"" such ""generalized fear of future injury is insufficient to confer standing.""In court papers they stress that the Mississippi Supreme Court has weighed in on the issue and ruled that the decision to ""fly or adopt"" a state flag rests "" entirely with the political branches.""Reeves' opinion walks through the flag and the state's history and discusses a case brought by the Mississippi State Conference of NAACP branches and individuals. In 2001, the Mississippi legislature set a special election where voters had the option of choosing an alternate design. According to Reeves, ""the special election results substantially favored the 1894 flag.""In January 2016, several bills were introduced regarding the flag, but they did not clear committee hurdles.Marc Allen, public affairs officer for the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that says it works to honor the reputation of soldiers who fought for the confederacy during the Civil War says Reeves was right to dismiss the case, but he misrepresented the state's history.""This is not a federal judge issue, this is an issue for the people of the State of Mississippi to decide,"" Allen said. Allen calls the emblem "" a battle standard, it's what the confederate soldier looked to on the battlefield."" ""I think the judge doesn't understand the history of what he is saying,"" Allen said. ""A lot of people will point to its use by hate groups, but if you use that logic, we also have to get rid of the Christian cross and the bible."""

""What happened yesterday was that I just was incredibly committed to being at the memorial -- as a senator on 9/11, this is incredibly personal to me.""Bill Clinton said Hillary Clinton is ""doing fine"" now as she recuperates from pneumonia at home in New York.""She was even better last night before she went to sleep.

""Well, if it is (more serious) then it's a mystery to me and all of her doctors,"" Bill Clinton said. When Rose noted Clinton's age -- at 68, she'd be among the oldest first-term presidents -- and her grueling campaign schedule, Bill Clinton pointed to his wife's more recent campaign events.

I'll be lucky to hold her back another day."" Clinton canceled a planned trip Monday to California. Her campaign has said it will release more details about her medical history later this week in an effort to demonstrate she isn't suffering greater health problems.Bill Clinton's comments came as he defended the Clinton Foundation's work, arguing that accusations of conflicts of interest are baseless and come from politically motivated Republicans.""There's never been a foundation to disclose as much as I have,"" he said.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-transparency/index.html	"Hillary Clinton is under fire for waiting until she nearly collapsed at a public event Sunday to disclose she was diagnosed Friday with pneumonia. She hasn't provided a full accounting of her health, though Donald Trump has revealed far less. The Republican nominee is departing with decades of tradition by not releasing his tax returns, which could provide key details about his investments and financial interests. And both candidates have declined traveling with a ""protective pool"" of reporters that follow them to provide continuous coverage of their activities.Trump, campaign take measured response on Clinton health newsOn Monday night, transparency questions surfaced again as PBS interviewer Charlie Rose grilled former President Bill Clinton about his family's foundation.In other words, Trump and Clinton have less than two months to close the sale, but most voters aren't sure exactly what they're buying.Few candidates relish throwing open their most intimate health and financial secrets. But the issue is particularly acute this year given Trump's decades of business dealings. And, of course, Trump, 70, and Clinton, 68, would be the oldest and second oldest presidents inaugurated for a first term in a job that comes with intense physical and mental demands -- making their health a highly relevant issue.When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday why she kept her pneumonia diagnosis secret, Clinton said she ""just didn't think it was going to be that big a deal.""""It's just the kind of thing that if it happens to you and you're a busy active person, you keep moving forward,"" she said. ""I think it's fair to say, Anderson, that people know more about me than almost anyone in public life. They've got 40 years of my tax returns, tens of thousands of emails, a detailed medical letter report, all kinds of personal details.""Clinton campaign manager: Staff to blame for slow health disclosureTrump has said he will soon release details of a physical exam he underwent last week. In an interview Monday with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room,"" Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence said both candidates should release detailed medical information.Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway fought back against the allegations Tuesday that Trump's campaign shared Clinton's lack of transparency. ""As far as I can see, there are two major party candidates running for president and only one of them has pneumonia and lied about it, especially to the press because she always treats you all like second class citizens,"" Conway told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day.""'People have a right to know'""People are vying for the highest office in the land,"" the Indiana governor said. ""People have a right to know.""But when it comes to taxes, Pence said Trump wasn't violating any laws by withholding the data, though he acknowledged ""there's a bit of a tradition here.""Nightcap: Hillary Clinton talks to CNN's Anderson Cooper about her health | Sign upTrump has said he would release his returns once the Internal Revenue Service completes an audit. When pressed why Trump would not release topline information about previous returns now -- which would not interfere with the audit process -- Pence told Blitzer the Republican nominee would release his returns ""in totality"" and ""not parse them out piece by piece.""Still, the Clinton campaign is already trying to use her weekend misfortune to increase pressure on Trump.""We know more about Hillary Clinton in than any presidential candidate in history ... we know almost nothing about Donald Trump and he has got to come forward,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Jake Tapper.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine also weighed in.""I hope that there will be an even standard applied to getting them both to release sufficient information, not just on health but obviously we have the ongoing issue on taxes too,"" Kaine said in Ohio.Hillary Clinton stumbles -- will her campaign follow?Politicians have long tried to shroud themselves in secrecy to varying degrees.""You have had candidates that have been a little close to the vest before -- many of them if not all of them having something they would rather not talk about,"" said Bruce Buchanan, a presidential historian at the University of Texas at Austin. But this year threatens to set unprecedented levels for the lack of disclosure, Buchanan said, because the election matches up two candidates who have ""reputations in that vein.""Presidential spotlightPresidential candidates have not always been under such a spotlight.After all, President Franklin Roosevelt took extensive -- and successful -- measures to hide his paralysis during his 1932 election campaign and subsequent presidency. President John Kennedy, despite a conjuring a mythology of youth and vitality, was one of the most unhealthy presidents ever to hold the office -- but his multiple ailments were not common knowledge at the time.Clinton's case appears to have little in common with those two Democratic presidents -- and pneumonia is a fairly common complaint that should not impair her capacity to serve as President.But her wobbly exit from a ceremony Sunday commemorating the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attack in New York created a sudden political storm for two reasons.Trump wants apology for Clinton 'deplorables' remarkFirst, the episode and video of Clinton staggering into her van played into conservative conspiracy theories that she is hiding some kind of secret illness since sustaining a concussion while secretary of state and is not fit to serve -- a narrative without evidence that is often trumpeted by her opponent and his surrogates.Then, the length of time it took for her campaign to say what is wrong -- with journalists in the dark about where she was -- fostered the idea that something was being covered up.""It's not health itself that is the problem she has to deal with,"" CNN senior political analyst David Axelrod said on Monday. ""By allowing that six-hour gap they created this sense that they were trying to put one over on people and that is not helpful to her candidacy.""The incident also played out as the Clinton campaign has spent months rebutting arguments against the Clinton Foundation, which Republicans have argued was a conduit for access to Hillary Clinton's State Department. In the Monday interview with Rose, Bill Clinton insisted ""we have been as transparent as we can be"" when it comes to the foundation.""We've been more transparent than any other foundation -- more transparent than any other foundation has been asked to be, and certainly more transparent than anybody else in this line of work,"" he said.Transparency is often uncomfortable for candidates.The ultimate public trustBut at the same time, people who run for President are assuming the ultimate public trust -- the Presidency of the United States, a position for which good health and a freedom from conflicts of financial interest are desirable if not essential. So any unwillingness to comply with what have become political norms for disclosure risks reflecting badly on a candidate's character.Clinton's campaign promised to do better going forward — and is planning to offer more details about her health later this week. In political terms, she now has little choice. ""If they keep trying to hide and obfuscate her real condition, it is going to be a big albatross all the way to election day,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a historian at Rice University on CNN's ""At This Hour with Berman and Bolduan.""For her part, Clinton's physician did issue a health statement last year certifying that she was fit to serve as President. Trump has offered no such information. His only health disclosure was a note from his doctor saying his health was ""astonishingly excellent"" and that he would be the healthiest person ever elected president.Ex-Obama adviser rips Clinton's 'unhealthy penchant for privacy'Neither candidate has approached the level of disclosure that another senior citizen candidate -- John McCain -- offered in 2008, when the cancer survivor invited select reporters to view over 1,000 pages of health records.Even if Trump offers more health details, he still risks setting an unprecedented example on financial disclosure for future candidates. The billionaire has steadfastly refused to match Clinton -- and previous presidential nominees -- by releasing years of tax returns.'Nobody cares about it'""Nobody cares about it except some of the folks in the media. Nobody cares about it,"" Trump said in a Fox News interview earlier this month.Trump has made his record in building a global business a pillar of his argument that he would be able to turn the economy around as President. Yet he has refused to publish tax returns that would allow voters to make their own assessment of his financial health or claims about his income.Such disclosures would also permit voters and reporters to view Trump's charitable giving, which he has said has been substantial without providing evidence.Trump, campaign take measured response on Clinton health newsTrump did comply with election laws in May requiring candidates to release a financial statement, which claims a net worth of $10 billion and business interests all over the world. Trump also lists 16 liabilities for which he owes at least $315 million, according to the statement.But the information does not offer details on the source of Trump's annual income -- information that would more typically be available on a tax return. That's important for voters to size up whether Trump would face conflicts of interest as President given his vast businesses interests around the globe.  Critics have suggested that Trump could be compromised as President if he has heavy exposure to US adversaries like China and Russia.It's also possible that Trump's returns show he paid a very low tax rate if his income comes mainly from capital gains or can be written off against property investments -- a factor that could be politically embarrassing."
