In 2014, a CNN investigation found that dozens of veterans died while waiting for treatment at the Phoenix VA and that officials manipulated appointment data with ""secret"" waitlists and other schemes in order to hide the backlog of requests for care.Over the past two years, the inspector general has issued six reports calling on VA officials in Phoenix to address mishandling of appointment scheduling and other forms of mismanagement, but Monday's report concluded, ""These issues remain.""The report found that patients continue to encounter delays in care at the Phoenix VA due to administrators not appropriately reviewing appointment requests, not rescheduling canceled appointments, and in some cases, even misplacing lab results.The VA's inspector general attributed some of the issues at the medical center to staffers' confusion over policies and procedures.Investigators found that staffers inappropriately canceled about 24% appointments for specialty care they reviewed, but they concluded this occurred because some administrators were ""generally unclear"" on the appropriate way to manage requests. In the case highlighted by the report in which delayed-care contributed to a patient's death, a new patient in his 50's complained of chest pain during an examination at the medical center in May 2015. A VA physician referred him for testing, but the patient died in June 2015 due to heart disease and the test had never been scheduled. ""Timely testing ... could have forestalled his death,"" the report found.In another case, a patient waited more than 300 days for a vascular appointment but ultimately did receive care in October 2015.The chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, GOP Rep. Jeff Miller, not only critiqued the Phoenix VA for a lack of improvement in the last two years, but he also exhorted the inspector general's report for not holding VA officials accountable.""It's clear veterans are still dying while waiting for care,"" Miller said in a statement Monday. ""VA's performance in Phoenix and across the nation will never improve until there are consequences up and down the chain of command for these and other persistent failures.""A separate report issued by the inspector general in October 2015 found that 45% of urology appointments at the Phoenix VA were delayed, and 10 patients experienced ""significant delays,"" some of whom died.In June, the VA announced the firing of three additional senior officials at the Phoenix VA for negligence and lack of oversight of healthcare scheduling.The former director of the Phoenix VA, Sharon Helman, was terminated in the wake of the 2014 wait-time scandal and later plead guilty to not reporting $50,000 in gifts from a lobbyist, but since Helman's removal, the Phoenix VA has had six directors.The VA received criticism over its most recent appointment of Phoenix VA director from some Arizona members of Congress in September who described the official as having a ""questionable record.""The Phoenix VA's new director, RimaAnn Nelson, previously presided over the St. Louis VA when the hospital closed twice due to unsanitary conditions. The VA's inspector general found staff in St. Louis had not been trained to sterilize equipment, and according to a whistleblower, the poor sanitation contributed to infections.Responding to the report issued Monday, VA officials said the Phoenix medical center has implemented a new appointment management policy and has increased staff training and compliance tools, but VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson said the department as a whole is still in the midst of a massive transformation""Though we have made irrefutable progress, there is still much work to be done,"" Gibson said."

He's threatened to renegotiate or repeal existing trade deals like NAFTA and slap tariffs on goods made in other countries -- particularly by American businesses that relocate their manufacturing.

Post-debate, Clinton takes the leadSince the first presidential debate last week, Trump has become consumed by controversy marked by his own stumbles, late-night tweets and capped by The New York Times report that he lost over $900 million in 1995, which may have helped him avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years. Trump added to his troubles Monday when he said that veterans commit suicide because they ""can't handle"" the stress of war. Trump has defended his tax filings by saying he knows the tax code well and can use that knowledge to better fix it.""I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit ... Honestly, I have brilliantly used those laws,"" Trump said Monday in Pueblo, Colorado.Trump: 'I'm working for you now, I'm not working for Trump'Tuesday's vice presidential debate in rural Virginia will be the biggest political moment for Pence and Clinton's running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Their job: defending the top of the ticket from attacks while also getting in some hits of their own. Pence previewed some of his material Monday, during a pre-debate rally in Ashland, Virginia.""Hillary's record on foreign affairs alone could literally take up the entire 90 minutes and it wouldn't be pretty,"" Pence told the crowd. He also hinted at the tough balancing act of trying to play up his credentials, but not cutting into the job of defending Trump and attacking Clinton, saying ""I hope we get to talk about our records as well.""Pence has already spent much of his almost three months running with Trump explaining and smoothing over the businessman's roughest edges and toughest self-inflicted wounds. (It's what has led at least one Indiana Democrat to dub Pence ""the chief pooper-scooper."")  A Pence spokesman said he did not want to get into hypothetical questions about Pence defending Trump's record, but pointed to their joint appearance together on ""60 Minutes"" when Trump said he did not expect Pence to use the same language as him.  Pence has withstood some tough grillings over Trump's positions without giving any ground already.  In late August, as Trump's advisers attempted to explain that he would stake out nuanced territory on immigration, Pence argued extensively with CNN's Jake Tapper that Trump would not be changing his positions at all.  ""Nobody was talking about illegal immigration when Donald Trump entered this campaign. He was attacked from day one for putting the whole issue of the violence that is derived from certain individuals that come into this country illegally on the table,"" Pence said on CNN's ""State of the Union.Pence has been preparing weekly for the debate since he was picked by Trump, aides say, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has been playing the role of Kaine. But Tuesday's dynamics promise to be immensely tougher than his 2012 debates in Indiana. Back then, Pence was the front-runner for Indiana governor, carrying the mantle of the popular outgoing Gov. Daniels and running almost like an incumbent.  Through three debates, Pence was poised and almost flawless in his ability to duck questions and stick to a carefully scripted message of taking Daniels' conservative management of the state ""from good to great."" Pence split the stage with a former Indiana state lawmaker, John Gregg, known for his trademark walrus mustache and Rupert Boneham, a former reality TV star running on the Libertarian ticket. Pence's message discipline is legendary, if a bit rigid, and has only clearly gotten him in trouble once, during a scathing interview with George Stephanopoulos last year in the middle of Indiana's ""religious freedom"" battle.Pence's public approval in Indiana tanked after last year's handling of the ""religious freedom"" push and other stumbles, including an attempt to start a state-run news service. And he was locked in a surprisingly tight re-election bid with Gregg earlier this year when Trump picked him as his running mate, in large part for his ability to stick close to a script. By the start of last month, a local poll by WTHR and Howey Politics found Hoosiers were evenly split between seeing Pence in a favorable and unfavorable light since joining Trump.  ""I think Hoosier voters are looking at Gov. Pence and they see him in a new light, they see him in a different context, they see him in a national context and he's popular because of it,"" Indiana Republican operative Mike O'Brien said last month on the long-running Indiana political show, ""Indiana Week in Review."" But Ann DeLaney, a longtime Democrat, fired back: ""I think they see him in a new light -- he's the chief pooper-scooper."" ""I mean all he's doing is running behind trying to say, 'He really didn't mean what he said,'"" she said. ""If he was going to lose for governor, I guess it makes more sense to lose for vice president."" "	Mike Pence preps for his biggest debate job: Trump clean-up

""Can you imagine the President getting up at 3:30 in the morning and tweeting vitriol?""Biden was referencing Trump's late night Twitter rant on Friday, when he took to the social media at 3 a.m. ET to slam the media and then two hours later, opened up Twitter again and quickly went from venting to slandering former Miss Universe Alicia Machado for an alleged sex tape that the campaign has yet to provide evidence for.In the wide-ranging interview with CNN, Biden praised Clinton and said he's working hard to get her to the White House and slammed Trump for his comments on the military, praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the possibility that he might not be paying taxes.QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump?Biden on Trump's taxesWhen asked about The New York Times report about Trump's leaked income tax returns published Saturday night revealed that Trump might have avoided income taxes for 18 years after declaring a $916 million loss in 1995, Biden said paying taxes is ""about making sure you did your part for the country.""The Times obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax returns as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns -- it did not look at his federal return. CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not denied any facts reported by The Times.Donald Trump: Underdog ""Since when does somebody who lives at the top in the world, in a penthouse overlooking the world, be in a position that he doesn't feel any obligation at all to pay any federal income tax to support the military, to support education, to support our foreign policy?"" Biden said about Trump. ""Since when is that a patriotic thing to do? Can you imagine any other president, any other president, just ever say that and be proud of that? I can't fathom it.""And Biden added that despite Trump's promises to challenge the status quo, his proposed tax plan will preserve the tax breaks he took advantage of.""What he's proposing in the tax cut would lock in all of those special interests from real estate folks and cut their taxes even more,"" Biden said. ""This is all about Trump. This is all about Trump.""Biden continued: ""What's that say about all the people here?

That's just not right.""'How can (Trump) be so out of touch?'Biden also responded to Trump's comments Monday about veterans suffering from PTSD, calling him ""ignorant"" of the sacrifice of service men and women. Trump said of veterans suffering that if ""you're strong and you can handle it but a lot of people can't handle it.""The vice president invited Trump to the ""battlefield"" with him in Afghanistan and Iraq so that Trump could experience what the ""these kids are going through"" and the ""sacrifices they're making.""""I was asked to present a Silver Star to a young man who had jumped into a burning Humvee to pull out his buddy after an IED exploded,"" Biden said. ""And the kid died. The commanding general ... asked me to pin on a Silver Star, when I was there. You know what the kid said to me? 'I don't want it. I don't want it. He did not live, sir.

It expands Russia's anti-air capability in northwest Syria significantly. Though the US does not believe the Russians plan to target US pilots, one official called the development ""a concern.""The system is located in a mountainous area that the US believes gives the Russians significant extended air coverage. The radar extends into Turkey and eastern Syria when it's placed on a mountain. Fox News first reported the missile system being brought into Syria. RELATED: US suspends talks with Russia over SyriaFor months now, the Russians have had air defense that lets them see north to the Turkish border, so this expands the envelope potentially in a militarily significant manner.US officials feel that Russians likely want to extend their air defense envelope out to Dier Ezzor to demonstrate to the world they and the Syrian regime are in control of wide swath of Syria. But a US official with direct knowledge of the situation and the thinking inside the Administration says the anti-regime forces and other militia forces -- the majority of which form the Free Syrian Army, a main anti regime force -- are now estimated to total as much as 100,000 fighters across Syria. This means the Syrian military would not likely be able to wipe them out and assert full control on the ground. The battlefield stalemate appears to have no solution at this point. The Administration is not considering military options against the Syrian regime, several officials say.But there are growing signs that inside the Administration there is a rift. Several senior Pentagon officials are making it clear they do not favor military action. The State Department and the intelligence community are more open about the potential for some type of move to pressure Russia though its not clear what that would be.  On Friday, CIA Director John Brennan told Reuters ""I think that pushing back against a bully is appropriate,"" adding, ""I think that is very different than rushing in and bombing the hell out of a place."""

United States, in which a California man who drained another man's bank account is arguing that he didn't commit bank fraud because the bank was insured and didn't lose money. Very early into oral arguments, Breyer questioned the attorney for Shaw about whether insurance negates theft -- using the example of Kardashian being robbed of millions of dollars' worth of jewelry in Paris this week. ""Even Kardashian's thief, if there is one, believes that all that jewelry is insured. Indeed, over-insured. So it's not theft?"" Breyer asked petitioner's attorney Koren Bell, according to a transcript.  He continued the analogy as he peppered Bell with questions. ""If he defrauds him out of the money, he defrauds her out of the jewelry, says, 'Here I am, your local jewelry cleaner.' Gets the jewelry. Wouldn't you think that was fraud? Even if she's insured. Even if he thinks she's triple insured. Even if he thinks that, in fact, this isn't even her jewelry, that it was just loaned her on the occasion by a good friend, the necklace,"" Breyer said. He continued: ""If the local person comes to the door and says, 'Dear Miss Kardashian, I am your local jewelry cleaner. Please give me your jewelry. She does. And that's not fraud. He wanted to get the jewelry ... He also believed that the friend had just loaned it for the evening, that she's triple insured, that she won't even lose any money because the publicity will be worth it.""""I would have always thought from first year of law school, criminal law, that that was fraud, but perhaps I was wrong. So I would like you to explain it,"" Breyer said.During a conversation Wednesday with CBS's Charlie Rose at 92Y in New York City, Breyer said he used the reality TV star's robbery as a teachable moment for Bell. ""Did your wife ever, ever, ever think that your name would be in the same sentence with Kim Kardashian?"" Rose asked during the interview that aired Thursday on CBS's This Morning.""This comes about through teaching,"" Breyer said. ""When you're teaching, what you do is you want to give an example that the class is going to remember.""Breyer said he's made even ""worse"" references in his career. ""I mean I've said a lot worse things than that and that's because I want an illustrative point. And I don't want to watch every two seconds what I'm saying, but I want the lawyer to get the point that I'm making so I get an answer out of that lawyer,"" he said.The Supreme Court justice added that this type of discourse creates ""progress."" ""And when you get a conversation going in a courtroom -- and it is, you know, right on the merits, it isn't taking people taking poses or positions -- you can make a lot of progress,"" he said.Bell said that the argument of the case is that the scheme would be to defraud the insurer -- and in the case of her client, not the bank.The case was one of the first oral arguments of this year's Supreme Court term.

Chris Christie spoke, after the lane closures, in October 2013 about the drafting of a false report regarding the reason for the closures. In the proposed report, the ""New Jersey side"" of the Port Authority would accept responsibility for the lane closures, and they hoped this would put an end to the issue, Wildstein said in federal court.Wildstein previously testified that this report would say the Port Authority conducted a traffic study in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and a communications breakdown between the agency and the town played a part in the massive amount of traffic experienced the week of September 9, 2013. Wildstein has said defendant Bill Baroni used the resulting report to falsely testify in a legislative hearing.Wildstein testified that he was told Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye had conversations with Cuomo's office about the proposed report, and that after Foye came to Cuomo with questions, Cuomo told Foye to sign the report and to ""lay off"" Christie.  ""You felt that Foye would sign it because you believed Albany had told Foye to quote, lay off Christie?"" defense attorney Michael Critchley asked in court. Wildstein said this was his understanding. Foye was appointed by Cuomo, as Port Authority executive directors are appointed by the governor of New York. The PANYNJ is a joint commission run by the states of New York and New Jersey. After finding out about the lane closures, Foye ordered the lanes reopened on September 13, 2013, after four days of gridlock.  Cuomo's office vehemently denied the claims Tuesday evening. ""To be clear, no such conversation between the governors happened, in fact no report of any kind was ever done, and whatever the admitted Bridgegate architect thought or dreamt about New York's involvement has no basis in fact,"" a spokesman for Cuomo told CNN in a statement. ""Anyone can say anything, especially a convicted felon spinning a tale, but it's just false and delusional."" ""Mr. Wildstein's testimony on this topic is not accurate,"" Foye's attorney, Eric Corngold, said in a statement.   ""Mr. Foye never had any such conversation or was given any such direction by the governor or any of his staff."" Wildstein testified last week that Christie was aware of traffic problems at the bridge as they were happening.During redirect Wildstein testified Wednesday that he did not know for a fact that the conversations between Cuomo and Christie actually happened, and that to his knowledge Foye never signed off on the false report.Wildstein's testimony wrapped up on Wednesday."""

""We, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90% of our people.""""But there is a group of people -- mostly small business owners and employees -- who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can't get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they're not in big pools,"" Clinton said. ""So they have no bargaining power.""Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Tuesday he bet Clinton ""went through hell last night"" with his wife, then added: ""Honestly, there have been many nights when he's gone through hell with Hillary.""Bill Clinton, whose efforts with his wife to overhaul health care in the 1990s were stymied by a recalcitrant Congress and the insurance lobby, told the crowd the insurance model ""doesn't make sense"" and ""doesn't work here.""Touting his wife's proposal to allow people without access to subsidies to buy into Medicare and Medicaid, he also acknowledged that market-based solutions would not solve the country's problems with insurance costs and coverage. ""On the other hand, the current system works fine if you're eligible for Medicaid, if you're a lower-income working person; if you're already on Medicare, or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care,"" Clinton said. ""But the people that are getting killed in this deal are small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies.""Post debate, Clinton takes the lead Angel Urena, Clinton's press secretary, defended the former president's stance on Obamacare on Tuesday, saying he had consistently supported the legislation since it was enacted in 2010.""President Clinton spoke about the importance of the ACA and the good it has done to expand coverage for millions of Americans. And while he was slightly short-handed, it's clear to everyone, including President Obama, that improvements are needed,"" Urena said in a statement. The White House said again Tuesday there were changes they would like to see made to the ACA.""President Obama has of course acknowledged that with cooperation from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, there are some things that could be done to further strengthen the law.

But he insisted Obamacare remains a top accomplishment of the president's tenure.""The Affordable Care Act continues to be a source of pride for people who work here in the administration in terms of that significant legislative accomplishment. That's essentially our position,"" Earnest said. ""You'd have to talk to President Clinton about exactly what message he was trying to send.""When asked whether the former president went too far in his criticism against the ACA, Earnest responded he's ""not sure what argument (Clinton) was making.""And when asked if he wished Clinton hadn't used ""crazy"" or ""craziest"" to describe Obamacare, Earnest said, ""Of course."""

The numbers fluctuate on a monthly basis, but the GOP advantage was about 177,000 in November 2004, when George W. Bush carried the state.
