But his comments, which came as he stressed the importance of free trade -- a position not shared by Trump -- seemed intended to rebuke the protectionist message unfurled to his party at rallies nationwide for the last two years.""I understand anger, and some people may have been angry when I was president. But anger shouldn't drive policy,"" Bush said. ""What needs to drive policy is what's best for the people who are angry.""Obama: Trump tapped into a 'troubling' strainBush has been a quiet critic of Trump, declining to endorse him after he won the Republican presidential nomination but not speaking out publicly about his differences with the nominee. He did not vote for either Trump or Hillary Clinton on Election Day.Sources told CNN Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush, voted for Clinton, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush replied ""secret ballot"" when asked shortly before the election about his plans.As president, George W. Bush was a staunch free trader, a position no longer in vogue in Trump's GOP. Bush, even as he praised major international trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, acknowledged that the economic anxiety induced by trade deals explained much of what happened on Election Day, analyzing that Americans were ""sick and tired of the status quo"" Yet despite their differences, Bush in Dallas honored the traditional position held by most former presidents: not to criticize those who follow them in the White House.""I don't think it's helpful for a former president to criticize successors,"" Bush said. ""It's a hard job to begin with."""	George W. Bush laments role of 'anger' in politics

""The Electoral College is an outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society, and it needs to change immediately. Every American should be guaranteed that their vote counts.""""In 2012, Donald Trump tweeted, 'The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy,' "" Boxer added. ""I couldn't agree more. One person, one vote!""According to CNN's election results as of Tuesday, Clinton won 61,329,657 votes and Trump won 60,530,867.This is the fifth time in history that a nominee has won the popular vote but not the Electoral College. The same situation happened to Al Gore in 2000, when he lost to George W. Bush. The actual likelihood of Boxer's bill passing is low. It's a proposed constitutional amendment, which would require passage not only by two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate, but then in three-quarters of states. A lame duck session and a Republican Congress will make it difficult to get such a bill through the legislative branch. On Tuesday, Trump praised the Electoral College after previously criticizing the system. He said he could have won the popular vote if he campaigned differently. Trump tweeted he would have won the populous states of Florida, New York and California if he had spent more time campaigning there.  "	Sen. Barbara Boxer to introduce bill to end Electoral College

Vice president-elect Mike Pence will receive his first briefing on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., an aide told CNN.The PDB is a daily rundown of threats and intelligence developments compiles by the national security community. The top secret document is read by the president and his inner circle of security advisers and top White House officials and is often accompanied by an in-person briefing by intelligence officials.Trump received his first classified national security briefing in August after he became the Republican nominee, and less than a month later, received a second briefing at his request. Despite those briefings, Trump continued to doubt the US intelligence community's conclusions that Russia orchestrated a series of hacks aimed at Democratic Party officials and organizations in the midst of the US election.Trump will continue to receive the PDB daily through his presidency.

""If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily,"" Trump tweeted.

Trump reiterated this stance once again on Sunday during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes.""""I'm not going to change my mind just because I won,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl.

But Bill Groth, a Democratic lawyer fighting the Pence administration in state court, cautioned that if the court accepts their argument, it could shield all his communications from the public. ""If the court buys their separation of powers argument, the executive branch will be exempt from (Indiana's public records law),"" Groth said. ""Why are they willing to take that risk if they have statutory arguments and they aren't really seeking to exempt the executive?""In Clinton's case, her use of a private email server led to an FBI investigation that dogged her campaign but never amounted to a determination of wrong-doing. But the GOP ticket used it as an example of what they said was poor decision-making and worked to further voter distrust of her.""The FBI last summer concluded that Hillary Clinton having classified documents on that private server was 'extremely careless,' "" Pence said just last week. ""And I guess today, I don't know if you heard, today they announced that they had not changed that conclusion.""But a top Pence spokesman said that this current email case, which is being weighed in Indiana's Court of Appeals now, is nothing like Clinton's email scandal. ""The plaintiff received the text of the email in one question. One email,"" said Pence deputy chief of staff Matt Lloyd. ""The court reviewed the white paper and determined the state was correct in protecting it as attorney client privilege.""Lloyd added that Pence has never had a private email server and never destroyed any devices containing his emails. Groth did receive the email he sought, about Pence's decision to have the state join a consortium of other states suing to block President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration. But he is fighting for access to the attachment to that email, an issue paper that Pence's lawyers argue is confidential under attorney-client privilege. Indiana's public access counselor, a lawyer who independently reviews public access and transparency complaints, determined that Pence had complied with state law in the case and did not ding him on the issue. The same counselor, last year, blasted state lawmakers for shielding their communications from public view. But public access advocates and journalists have put Trump on watch, after he blacklisted reporters -- something Pence said he fought against after joining the ticket. And Pence himself has had transparency woes, after he was forced to pull the plug on a proposed state-run news service last year."

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/alt-right-steve-bannon/index.html	"President-elect Donald Trump's move to name Steve Bannon, the establishment-bashing Breitbart News chief, as one of his top two advisers will bring the movement firmly into the White House, with unprecedented access to the Oval Office that could shape the policies and tone of Trump's presidency. The decision appears to have put a sudden halt to hopes that Trump was beginning to mollify some of his hardline campaign promises. Instead, the move signals Trump isn't ready to abandon the right-wing elements that proved key to his ascent to power.Bannon, in any other administration, likely would not have passed muster.He was once charged with domestic violence, allegedly objected to his daughters attending a school because of the number of Jewish students enrolled and ran a website that stoked racial fears, engaged in blatant misogyny and peddled conspiracy theories. 'Knife fight' as Trump builds an unconventional national security cabinetBut beyond his biographical bullet points, it's Bannon's quiet encouragement of Republican infighting through Breitbart and his championing of hardline conservative policy prescriptions that may prove intrusive to Trump's efforts to pass legislation with a slim Republican majority in Congress.While Republican leaders are finding comfort in Trump naming RNC Chairman Reince Priebus to the top post of White House chief of staff, the press release announcing the appointments noted the two men will be ""equal partners."" And Bannon was listed first in the statement.Early indicatorThe announcement is one of the earliest indicators of what Trump's administration will look like. It provides insight into how he will balance the often-conflicting priorities of dueling factions within the Republican Party, and the degree to which Trump has come to rely on Bannon's counsel. For now, it seems Trump is poised to give both the GOP establishment and the more hardline elements of his party the benefits of proximity to power.Priebus and Bannon are in many ways the embodiment of the internal struggle that has roiled the GOP in recent years: Bannon, the rabble-rousing and unflinchingly hardline conservative segment, and Priebus, the business-oriented establishment eager to expand its electoral appeal.""I think it's a great team,"" Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager and now a senior adviser to his transition effort, told reporters Monday. ""They complement each other. They both have the most important thing: the ear of the boss.""Bannon declined to comment for this story. But Pence defended him Monday, calling Bannon ""a force for good"" and a ""generous, hospitable, wise person to work with"" on MSNBC.Trump to supporters harassing minorities: 'Stop it'""Steve and I have formed a great partnership in advising President Trump together. That's what it is. Talking to him together, getting ourselves on the same page. It worked well on the campaign. I think you have seen perilously over the last few months that Donald Trump has been very disciplined. He's also been very comfortable and on message and clear-minded,"" Priebus added Monday on ABC.Even President Barack Obama, who spent the better part of the past year blasting Trump, said the President-elect should have a chance to build his team.""The people have spoken,"" Obama said at a White House news conference Monday. ""It will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflects his policies.""Messaging and strategyWhile it's true that both Priebus and Bannon have been at Trump's side, Bannon was largely credited with helping craft the messaging and strategy in the final months of the campaign. Those efforts empowered Trump to ride a populist wave to victory, without abandoning the hardline policy proposals and controversial rhetoric that won him the fandom of loyal supporters in the first place.Trump would not repudiate his Muslim ban proposal. He would not back off his plans to deport all undocumented immigrants. And he certainly wouldn't stop bellowing at his rallies about building a border wall and making Mexico pay for it.Bannon also oversaw Trump's forays into the African-American community and his controversial depictions of black America as entirely crime and poverty-ridden -- ""You walk down the street, you get shot!"" -- that black leaders called insulting. Critics contended such remarks were aimed more at assuaging white Americans' concerns.Already, Bannon's appointment is sparking heated criticism from Democrats and non-partisan groups alike.The Anti-Defamation League, a leading organization combating anti-Semitism, said it ""strongly opposes"" the decision. The group's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, said Bannon ""presided over the premier website of the 'alt-right' -- a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists.""What Donald Trump taught us about ourselvesSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid's spokesman, Adam Jentleson, went further, saying Bannon's appointment ""signals that White Supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House.""""It is easy to see why the KKK views Trump as their champion when Trump appoints one of the foremost peddlers of White Supremacist themes and rhetoric as his top aide,"" Jentleson said.While Bannon's website ran headlines such as ""Bill Kristol, Republican spoiler, renegade Jew,"" ""Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy"" and another proclaiming ""Young Muslims in the West are a ticking time bomb,"" Bannon's tenure at the helm of Trump's campaign did not escalate the then-Republican nominee's inflammatory statements or his courting of the far-right.Trump did not, as many expected, become a walking, talking Breitbart headline. Rather, he got more focused -- reading from teleprompters at every rally since Bannon and Conway took over. Trump amplified his hard-right policy proclamations by laying them out in more palatable language.Less bravado, more policyIn fact, there was less bravado and more policy. There was less targeting of Republicans, and more targeted attacks on Hillary Clinton.What Bannon did not discourage, however, was Trump's fear-mongering and mischaracterizing of Clinton's policies, which filled the pages of Breitbart long before Trump jumped into the presidential race.Is Donald Trump already walking away from campaign promises?Bannon was also the man behind one of Trump's most controversial stunts in which women who had previously accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct were paraded before the cameras moments before the second presidential debate against Clinton. As reporters were led into the room -- mouths agape -- Bannon stood silently toward the back of the room, grinning."	The alt-right heads to the White House

A surge in donations for organizations like the ACLU. And the #SafetyPin movement, where you clasp the pin somewhere on your person to indicate you're a safe ally to talk to. Keep the momentum going. Here are 25 ways you can elevate your activism: Local politics and activism1. Know who your local legislators and politicians are Here's where to find your House Representative. Put your address in here to find a full list of your elected officials. 2. Know how to get in touch with them (and actually make them listen.)Here's a great Twitter thread from a former Congressional staffer about how to actually get politicians to listen (your phone is your best ally). Here are some general guidelines on how to contact them. 3. Identify an issue you care about and pursue itHopefully you don't need too many resources on this, though here's a good list of social issues to get you started. 4. Attend town hall meetings A town hall is where you, in person, can make your actual voice heard, in front of local politicians who can actually do something about it. Your congressperson will usually have a schedule of Town Hall meetings on their website, or you can check out your city's website as well. 5. Attend City Council meetings Alternately, attend a City Council meeting to get an up-close view of what's important to your city's legislators. 6. Get to know your local School Board If you have kids in school, you probably need to know about your school board. Here's everything about what a school board does and how you can get involved.  7. Join your local PTA Not only can you have a direct communication with your school, you can also volunteer and participate in other ways that directly impact your community. Here's how (and why) to join. 8. Mobilize more people to support your cause You alone are great and awesome and boy, can you make a difference. Now imagine,a dozen more of you. Get a group together to do any of the above things; attend meetings or join an association, and your cause will be magnified. 9. Join a voting league or political organization A non-partisan group like the League of Women Voters is a good way to get informed, or you can choose a political group that aligns with your values. 10. Register to act on behalf of a political party. Here's a starting place for Republicans. Here's one for Democrats. Keep in mind your party has a state chapter, too. Not feeling the bipartisan vibe?

Join a campaignIf you find a local politician who represents the change you want to see in your community, contact their office to figure out how you can get involved in the campaign! Maybe they'll have you stuff mailers or put up signs or some other boring task, but the boring tasks is what actually gets stuff done. 12. Volunteer at their headquarters Like we said, your state, city and county have party headquarters that are just waiting for your time and energy. Just give it a Google. They WANT you to help out, so it's not that hard to find. If you'd rather stay at home, you can most likely take part in digital activism: Sending newsletters or text messages or organizing online campaigns. 13. Attend or organize rallies and events Just make sure you're safe and lawful. Alternately, there are always political talks and events going on, probably in your area. Look them up here. 14.

And do it in every election, not just the big ones. Political education18. Subscribe to a paper or other publication you believe in If you're unhappy with journalism or media coverage, find a publication that represents good journalism to you. Click on it often. Pay for a subscription. Support it any way you can. 19. Read up on American history and civics USA.gov is your best friend. There's history and civics there, but it's just the beginning. Here's a link to the National Constitution Center where you can read a word-for-word breakdown of the document. Here's a link to the American History section of the Library of Congress. Go crazy. 20. Share that knowledge Have discussions with your friends and family. Engage in respectful debate when appropriate (and no, that doesn't mean on Facebook timelines). Spread the word. Community outreach21. Volunteer at a place that benefits your community Ideally, you can align your volunteer work with your most important causes. Volunteer at church, at the local VA hospital, at a homeless shelter or at a school. The possibilities are endless, but this website is a good place to start. 22. Volunteer at a museum, state or national park, cultural center or historical society Volunteering isn't just about serving others, it's also about making sure the organizations that are important to you can continue to serve others. 23. Hell, GO to a museum, state or national park, or historical society SUPPORT. EDUCATION. IN ALL. FORMS. 24. Donate At the very least, let your wallet do the talking. If you're looking at a specific charity, check Charity Watch to make sure your money is being well-used. 25. Get off the internet Complaining on social media only gets you so far.
