In a phone interview with CNN, Giuliani cast his work, which included consulting work on reducing crime in Mexico City, El Salvador, Colombia, Chile, along with helping political candidates in Ukraine and the Dominican Republic, as a qualification to be secretary of state. The former New York City mayor also sought to rebut critics who say that his consulting and speeches make his attacks on the Clinton Foundation during the presidential campaign hypocritical.""What I did violated no laws, no regulations,"" Giuliani said. ""It was a perfectly legal, lawful, thing to do. And also these comparisons to Hillary Clinton are nuts because I was in private business. I was not—there's no conflict with anything. I'm not a government official. I'm in private business. And finally, I wasn't selling influence. I was selling my expertise. And the services of my company. Giuliani contacted CNN in response to a story by CNN's KFile about his 2012 work consulting with Serbian politicians once tied to convicted war criminal Slobodan Milošević. Giuliani said he was providing development advice to the city of Belgrade. In interviews at the time, Giuliani said he was there ""to give advice"" to Aleksandar Vucic, now the Serbian prime minister, who was running for mayor at the time. Giuliani said that he was paid by a London company involved in putting together a plan for economic development in Belgrade. Press reports at the time cited Vucic saying he had invited Giuliani to advise him. In the interview Friday, Giuliani said that he was invited by the London company and that his team had assessed the offer and determined that they could provide useful advice to the city. He also defended the content of his consultation. ""I didn't go in there and give a public relations address,"" he said. ""I went there and gave a highly substantive speech on what happens to be one of the areas of knowledge which is perfectly lawful. I don't know what it is that I did wrong. Or how you can paint it is as wrong.""""I conducted myself in a very honorable way. Including a somewhat courageous way, to add, yeah, 'I think you should've been bombed,'"" Giuliani also said, referring to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. ""How many people go to a city and say, 'I think it was okay you were bombed. You know how often I've done that?""Giuliani further cited his relationship with Viktor Yushchenko, the former Ukrainian president and foe of Vladimir Putin who was poisoned in 2004. He said that when he went to Ukraine, he was told that he couldn't meet with Yushchenko (Giuliani misspoke and said he couldn't meet with Viktor Yanukovych, another former Ukrainian president and a Putin ally, but described him in the interview as ""the Viktor that Putin poisoned or allegedly poisoned""). The former mayor said that he met with Yushchenko anyway.  ""I said, 'F*ck you, I'll meet with him,'"" he said. ""And I did. And they took away my security and almost didn't let me out the country. And that's before the poor man was poisoned. He and his wife have become good friends of mine. And what I am upset about is the attacks on my reputation.""In the conversation, Giuliani often returned to the idea that his work gave him foreign policy knowledge that would be valuable if Trump picks him as secretary of state, arguing that he is being unfairly ""hit on both ends,"" referring to critics who say he lacks experience and those who say he may be hampered by conflicts of interest. ""I know all these governments,"" Giuliani said. ""I know the good parts and the bad parts. When I go, I often meet with the prime minister, if I don't meet with the prime minister I always meet with the interior minister and almost always with the defense minister. They want my advice, because I have substantive expertise. They don't want my influence, nor did they try to ask me to influence President Obama which would be ridiculous of course or even President Bush. I'm not seen that way. I'm not seen as a lobbyist, government influencer. I am seen around the world as an expert on crime reduction, city development, and in a different part of my life an expert on securities law. I don't mean securities securities, I mean financial securities law.""Giuliani went on to describe coverage of his consulting work as ""totally, totally and completely unfair and without any description of what I actually do."" ""They make try to make it sound like I'm a world traveling lobbyist and what I am is a world traveling expert of crime reduction, terrorism, economic development and various aspects of international law and American law that is now becoming international law,"" he said.Giuliani defended his work for Middle Eastern countries like Qatar, which he said was a staunch ally of the United States at the time and claimed that he never worked for Saudi Arabia, which his former law firm Bracewell and Giuliani represented in Texas court cases. Giuliani left that firm in January. ""I let the State Department know that I was doing it,"" he said of his work for Qatar. ""They were supportive of it. I got paid for services. I did that in the best interests of my country. It was a different Qatar then, that was completely allied with the United States in the war against Iraq."""

Jeff Sessions for attorney general and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security advisor.Wasserman Schultz cited Sessions' unsuccessful appointment to a federal district court by then-President Ronald Reagan, which sank when a former Justice Department employee testified that Sessions had made racially tinged remarks. ""Let's remember that Jeff Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship by President Reagan and at the time was one of only two in 60 years to be rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee -- which was controlled by Republicans at the time -- because of his previous racist statements and really outrageous comments.""RELATED: Sessions dogged by old allegations of racismLater in the interview, Wasserman Schultz weighed in on the emerging leadership battle for House Democrats, which was kicked off after Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan announced he would challenge current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for her post.While Wasserman Schultz was careful to express admiration for both Ryan and Pelosi, she suggested that Pelosi's leadership experience would be critical for Democrats as they gird for legislative fights against the Trump administration. ""There is nobody in my mind that is more battle-tested and prepared, and frankly, savvy enough to be able to go toe-to-toe with Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership, and this really troubling and disturbing administration, than Nancy Pelosi,"" she said. Wasserman Schultz then skirted a question about who she would support for DNC chair in the upcoming election.

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/jeff-sessions-racism-allegations/index.html	"It had to do with a young black man who had been kidnapped and brutally murdered by two members of the Ku Klux Klan.The Klansmen, Henry Hayes and Tiger Knowles, slit the victim's throat and hung his body from a tree. They carried out the attack in retribution for a jury acquitting a black man in the slaying of a white police officer. As Sessions learned that some members of the Klan had smoked marijuana on the evening of the slaying, he said aloud that he thought the KKK was: ""OK until I found out they smoked pot.""Sessions insists he was joking. But the damage was done.The comment, and others like it, cost him a federal judgeship in 1986 and have been repeated time and again in summary form in newspaper and magazine articles over the years. They are often cited absent the full context in which they were made.The issue has reemerged and could have magnified importance with President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Sessions to become US attorney general.But a CNN examination of the statements at issue in that hearing three decades ago -- a defining moment in Sessions' life — reveals a more nuanced portrait than has sometimes been conveyed over the years.A former colleague who testified in the hearing said he found it ironic that Sessions was being painted as racist for comments that came out while he was literally helping to take on the Klan.""The way he was portrayed,"" retired Department of Justice prosecutor Barry Kowalski said, ""was very unfair.""Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III was born in Alabama in 1946. He was a child of the segregated South and came of age during the Civil Rights Movement. He went to college in his home state and attended law school there as well.Sessions worked briefly in private practice before signing on with the US Attorney's office in 1975. Six years later, he was appointed US attorney for the Southern District of Alabama by President Ronald Reagan.In 1986, Reagan nominated him to become a federal judge, a lifetime appointment requiring confirmation by the US Senate. It was during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Sessions' comments about the KKK became an issue.Thomas Figures, an assistant US Attorney who worked under Sessions in Mobile, testified that he was present when Sessions made the remark and said he did not regard it as a joke.Figures, who was African-American and passed away last year, also told committee members that Sessions had called him ""boy"" on several occasions and once cautioned him to ""be careful what you say to white folks"" after Figures had spoken harshly to a secretary who was white.Another federal prosecutor, J. Gerald Hebert, testified that Sessions had called the ACLU and NAACP ""un-American"" and ""communist-inspired."" According to Hebert, Sessions said the two groups ""forced civil rights down the throats of people.""Hebert, a veteran civil rights prosecutor, told the committee he had ""very mixed feelings"" about testifying about the conversations that he said had taken place over a matter of years. He said he and Sessions would engage in ""spirited debate"" about civil rights and that he sometimes wondered if Sessions was baiting him with controversial statements. Sessions, he said, ""has a tendency sometimes to just say something, and I believe these comments were along that vein.""Asked by a committee member whether he considered Sessions a racist, Hebert responded: ""No, I do not.""The same committee member, Sen. Jeremiah Denton, an Alabama Republican, asked Hebert: ""If Mr. Sessions says he would be fair as a judge, would you believe him?""""He is a man of his word,"" Hebert responded, ""and when he says something, I believe him.""RELATED: Can Trump actually drain the swamp? The answer is murkySome witnesses at the hearing came to Sessions defense on issues of race, including Larry Thompson, an African-American former US Attorney in neighboring Georgia.Thompson testified that he had known Sessions as a colleague and friend for years and had twice shared a hotel room with him on work trips to cut costs.He told the committee he considered Sessions ""a good and honest man untainted by any form of prejudice.""Kowalski, a prosecutor in the Justice Department's civil right division in Washington, also heard Sessions make the statement about thinking the Ku Klux Klan was OK until learning that some of its members smoked marijuana.Kowalski testified that he considered the comment a joke.In a recent interview with CNN, Kowalski said Sessions played a pivotal role in getting the case against the Klansmen off the ground.Kowalski said the slaying of the young black man, Michael Donald, was initially seen by local authorities as the result of a drug deal gone bad, even though his body was found hanging in a tree across the street from a member of the Klan's residence.Kowalski said Sessions was supportive of his idea to convene a grand jury to investigate whether the killing was racially motivated and therefore qualified as a federal civil rights crime.""At a time when many US Attorneys in the South were not always welcoming to the Civil Rights Division, Jeff Sessions was,"" said Kowalski, 72, and now retired from the Justice Department. ""Jeff had the vision and the courage and the desire to do right.""Kowalski, who went on to prosecute the Los Angeles police officers who beat black motorist Rodney King in 1991, described himself as a liberal Democrat who disagreed with most of Sessions' political views. But he said he witnessed no evidence that Sessions was a racist, either in how he spoke or how he treated people.Kowalski said he could not directly contradict Figures. But he said he has struggled to comprehend how Figures took the comment about the Klan seriously.""I have trouble understanding how he came to that conclusion,"" he said.Kowalski said the allegation that Sessions called Figures ""boy"" or admonished him for the way he spoke to white people was ""inconsistent with the way he behaved when I was around.""READ MORE: Trump picks Sessions for attorney generalTestifying on his own behalf at the hearing, Sessions acknowledged that he was ""loose with my tongue on occasion"" and may have made comments about the ACLU and NAACP that could have been misconstrued ""but I really did not mean any harm by it.""He denounced the KKK as a ""force for hatred and bigotry"" and said he was shocked that Figures or anyone else would suggest he thought otherwise.""I am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create,"" Session told the committee. ""I am not a racist.""Leading the charge against Sessions at the time was the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. He called Sessions ""a throwback to a shameful era that I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past"" and ""a disgrace to the Justice Department.""The committee voted 10-8 against advancing Sessions' nomination to a hearing before the full Senate.Sessions was elected attorney general of Alabama in 1994. Two years later, he was elected to the US Senate, where he is now serving his fourth term.In the Senate, he has earned the reputation as one of the institution's most conservative Republicans, taking reliably right of center stances on social and economic issues alike. He is particularly passionate on issues of immigration. In 2007, he was a key player in the successful effort to defeat President George W. Bush's proposed overhaul of national immigration policy, which would have granted legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants.Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said he's known Sessions as a friend and colleague for two decades and has never seen an indication that he's ""motivated by race or religion.""""He's just a very conservative guy,"" Graham said. ""He's very sincere and passionate about his beliefs.""Sessions' positions on civil rights issues have not won him any fans at the NAACP. He's received consistent ""Fs"" on the group's legislative report cards for the past decade and a half.Cornell William Brooks, the group's president, blasted Sessions' nomination, citing what he called a ""very disturbing and recurring theme of hostility to and toward civil rights"" exhibited over his career.He said Sessions nomination along with a top post being awarded to Stephen Bannon were deeply troubling from a civil rights perspective.""The campaign has been blowing a racist dog whistle,"" Brooks said. ""Now the campaign rhetoric is becoming transition reality.Hebert, the Justice Department prosecutor who testified about Sessions alleged comments about the NAACP and ACLU, said he has had no contact with his former colleague since the hearing three decades ago.But has followed his career through his public comments and votes in the Senate. He said he noticed ""a pattern"" of behavior that has concerned him, including voting against the nomination of several high profile appointees who were non-white.All things considered, Hebert, said, he found it a frightening prospect that Sessions would be appointed attorney general.""It's a collection of things from over the years. I think it's frightening for people who believe in fairness and equality for him to be running the Justice Department.""Sessions was the first US senator to endorse Trump for president, which he did in February. Sessions' past -- or the version that emerged from the Judiciary hearing -- was quick to follow.""Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions had a lengthy history of making racist statements,"" a headline in The Nation charged at the time.The racial allegations made news again when Trump questioned the impartiality of federal judge Gonzalo Curiel based on his Mexican heritage and Sessions declined comment on the matter.""'Racist' Senator Sticks With Donald Trump,"" a Daily Beast headline proclaimed in June.The negative coverage of Sessions appears to have had little impact on Trump, which is not surprising given his oft-stated distrust and disdain for the media.""The President-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama's Attorney General and US Attorney,"" read a statement following a meeting at Trump Tower. ""It is no wonder the people of Alabama re-elected him without opposition."""	Colleague, transcripts offer closer look at old allegations of racism against Sen. Jeff Sessions
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/jeff-sessions-justice-department/index.html	"Elections have consequences, however, and President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, Jeff Sessions, has a new mandate.Sessions, the 69-year-old Alabama senator, is likely to change course and place a greater emphasis on more traditional criminal law areas such as drug and immigration enforcement. He would take a narrow view of the scope of federal authority in other areas and emphasize deference to the states.Resources aren't endless, and as head of the department, Sessions will have to consider where to devote his. Under the Obama administration, for example, DOJ brought a lawsuit challenging Arizona's controversial immigration law. Its lawyers also fought back hard against a lawsuit brought by states challenging the President's executive orders on immigration. And in the area of gay rights, the administration chose not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in 2011, a federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman.""The average American may have a hard time seeing how shifts in enforcement priorities within the Justice Department affect their daily lives, but the impact can be substantial,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.""Whether it's in how much (or how little) to enforce anti-discrimination laws against local governments or private employers, how aggressively to enforce (or not enforce) drug laws, or taking a different position on the relationship between the federal government and the states with respect to immigration, the environment and other hot-button topics, how resources are allocated has potentially monumental substantive policy implications,"" Vladeck added.""Sessions will bring a dramatically different ideological vision for the role of the Justice Department, "" said Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University. ""This will occur across the board and because of his years on the Senate Judiciary committee, his influence may also extend to judicial nominations.""Critics of Sessions are preparing for the worst. They say a man who has encouraged the investigation of Hillary Clinton, and who himself lost a chance to serve on the federal judiciary in 1986 after allegations of racism, shouldn't get the job as America's top lawyer.""It is a blatantly inflammatory act in a time of heightened focus on violence and injustice of communities of color,"" said Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. One area that Sessions is sure to target is immigration.Immigrant rights attorneys -- still stung by the fact that Obama's executive orders were blocked-- were quick to respond to the nomination, saying it should ""send chills down the spines of all Americans.""""Under Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions has been pushed from the fringe into the center of American politics,"" said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. ""As a result, women, immigrants, the Black community, the LGBTQ community and anyone who cares about justice and equality for all being are being pushed out.""But Sen. Ted Cruz, who himself was under consideration for the post, struck back at Sessions' critics at an appearance at the conservative Federalist Society on Friday and said that Sessions is a necessary change of course from the Obama years.""We need all hands on deck,"" Cruz said, and noted that many of the lawyers in the room might land in the new administration. ""Do not follow the example of the previous administration,"" he warned, speaking about the need for deregulation and a reining in of the power of administrative agencies.""We must rebuild our legal culture,"" Cruz said.Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society who has met with Trump concerning Supreme Court nominees, agreed.""The one thing you have to know about Jeff Sessions,"" said Leo, ""is that he believes deeply in the rule of law.""""He is going to want to have a Justice Department that is a most fitting example of an institution committed to the rule of law, integrity and getting it right legally, because that's what he believes in. ""Supporters of Sessions say he will help change the way Washington works.""He is not intimidated by the liberal media or the Washington establishment,"" said Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation. ""He should easily be confirmed.""The Alabama senator is on his home court before his colleagues in the Senate, and already has the backing of one Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.""He knows Senator Sessions, considers him a friend's and believes he can work with him,"" Manchin spokesman Jonathan Kott told CNN.But he won't get a free pass.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, set to take over as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, warned it might not be smooth sailing.""Senator Sessions has served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for many years so he's well aware of the thorough vetting he's about to receive,"" she said. ""While many of us have worked with Sen. Sessions closely and know him to be a staunch advocate for his beliefs, the process will remain the same: a fair and complete review of the nominee."""

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-national-security-advisor/index.html	"The revelation comes as the Trump camp has taken a series steps to curb the involvement of lobbyists in the presidential transition efforts. Robert Kelley, a former chief counsel to the House National Security Subcommittee and current general counsel and principal at the Flynn Intel Group, filed a lobbying disclosure report with Congress on September 15.According to the official document, Kelley was working on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by Turkish businessman, Kamil Ekim Alptekin.Alptekin told CNN in an email that the firm works to strengthen ""the transatlantic relationship and Turkey's future in that alliance.""Kelley's connection to the Flynn Intel Group and Alptekin were first reported in the Daily Caller. Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Elijah Cummings sent a letter to Trump transition chair Mike Pence expressing concerns over Flynn's ""apparent conflict of interest.""""President-elect Trump promised during his campaign that he would 'drain the swamp,' but his top national security advisor is Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whose firm is reportedly being paid to lobby the U.S. Government by a close ally of Turkey's president,"" the Maryland Democrat wrote. ""It is unclear how Lt. Gen. Flynn was reportedly allowed into intelligence briefings during the campaign despite these apparent conflicts of interest.""Trump's transition responded to questions about the lobbying effort with a statement Friday, saying that Flynn's career was within his right as a ""private citizen."" ""After devoting his life to serving his country, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn became a private citizen and opened a private consulting business to advise companies on various issues. Gen. Flynn has said that he will sever ties to his consulting firm if he ever returned to government service and that is what he will do in the Trump Administration."" Alptekin is the chair of the Turkish-American Business Council and helped organize Turkish President Recep Erdogan's 2015 visit to Washington.But while Alptekin acknowledged having a commercial relationship with the Flynn Intel Group, he told CNN that Flynn himself ""does not work on my contract.""He also adamantly denied any connection to the Turkish government.""Neither Inovo, any of my other companies or my person are affiliated to the Turkish government in any form whatsoever,"" he said. He added that his company's contract with Flynn's company ""is not about representing the position of the Government of Turkey""However, the fact that Flynn was overseeing a company that was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients at the same time he was attending classified briefings alongside Trump seems to complicate the transition, especially given Trump's stated goal of ""draining the swamp"" in Washington.Flynn, who as America's top military intelligence officer was already privy to volumes of classified material, is obligated to not share that information with any outside entity.While Flynn had the highest level of clearance while serving as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, experts on security clearances told CNN that his firm's business arrangements with foreign companies would be closely looked at by background investigators before Flynn could receive additional intelligence briefings in his new role.""They would certainly look at it carefully,"" Sean Bigley, a security clearance lawyer and former government background investigator told CNN.Although Bigley said there was no restriction on someone like Flynn working for foreign companies upon leaving office he said Flynn would have to inform background investigators of these business relationships in order to be able to continue to receive classified briefings.But other lawyers specializing in security clearance issues said Flynn simply informing investigators of his company's ties to Inovo might not protect him from having his security clearance revoked.Bradley Moss, an attorney who routinely represents defense contractors in security clearance disputes, said Flynn's actions would likely raise a red flag.  Flynn's lobbying work, according to Moss, could potentially jeopardize his ability to get cleared as national security advisor.""Security adjudicators would have concerns that someone with Flynn's level of experience wouldn't think twice about sitting in on a classified briefing while working for foreign clients,"" Moss said. ""The moment he sat in on classified briefings, his association with his own company had to be severed."" ""By not doing that he exposed himself unnecessarily to foreign influence and raised questions about his good judgment,"" Moss added. Asked about Flynn's business dealings, CNN counterterrorism analyst Phil Mudd told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday that that type of work was not unusual and that his activities should not prevent him from taking on the role of national security advisor. ""I don't think those should be a bar to duty,"" he said. But while he said his business relationships were not disqualifying, Mudd, a former CIA analyst, said Flynn's temperament would not serve him well in the role. The intelligence briefs containing some classified were first given to both candidates in August and Flynn accompanied Trump during at least one brief. It is unclear if Flynn informed investigators of his company's ties to Inovo. His representatives did not reply to a request for comment.Flynn told the Wall Street Journal that if he were to officially join the Trump administration he would sever ties with his company, which is described as providing ""all source intelligence support to global challenges.""""If I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump,"" he said. Flynn's connection to Turkey drew scrutiny after he penned an Election Day op-ed in The Hill newspaper, which said the US should extradite the exiled cleric Fetullah Gulen to Turkey.The Turkish government has accused Gulen of being behind the July coup and has demanded the US hand him over. The Justice Department is currently reviewing the case for extradition.But Alptekin said he and his company had nothing to do with Flynn's op-ed.""If he had asked me whether to publish it, I would have advised against it for a variety of reasons,"" he said.

Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas has been selected for CIA director. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has been offered the job of national security advisor and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions has been picked for attorney general. All three have accepted their offers.The news followed signs on Thursday that the weight of the presidency is beginning to sink in for Trump, and that the President-elect may be shifting from the bomb-throwing tactics he employed during the campaign to a more nuanced approach.The President-elect held his first meeting with a world leader, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on Thursday. It was a most unusual setup -- arranged without any formal briefing for Trump from the State or Defense departments.The chaotic nature of the Trump transition continues to give jitters to Democrats, some Republicans in Washington, as well as allies in governments around the world. For months, diplomats and world leaders have watched Trump deliver incendiary speeches on the campaign trail with wariness and trepidation. But Abe spoke positively about the meeting afterwards, calling it a candid conversation and saying he believed they could form a relationship of mutual respect.Trump also arranged meetings with Republicans who were among his fiercest critics, a display of normalcy after a week of upheaval and apparent chaos for his transition team. First, he replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been overseeing the transition, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and subsequently purged lobbyists from the ranks, in keeping with his vow to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington.Then there was the lightning rod announcement of former Breitbart chief executive Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser -- which sent shockwaves through activist groups who view the Breitbart site as racist and anti-Semitic.Thursday, more conventional Republican faces began appearing at Trump Tower as the team continued vetting potential Cabinet members and advisers at a furious pace, with literally thousands of government positions to fill within a very short window of time.Trump met with foreign policy heavyweight Henry Kissinger, as well as Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and one-time critic South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who are both under serious consideration for Cabinet jobs.In perhaps the most surprising news, Trump plans to meet this weekend in New Jersey with 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who was one of Trump's most vociferous critics during the campaign (calling him a phony, and a fraud, and skewering him on Twitter for the way in which he talked about women on a leaked ""Access Hollywood"" tape). Romney may be considered for a Cabinet post -- possibly secretary of state -- though sources close to the former Massachusetts governor say he has not actively sought a role in the Trump administration and merely agreed to meet with Trump as a gesture of good faith. Establishment Republicans viewed the more recent developments with relief on Thursday -- a signal that Trump may be giving more serious thought to addressing the deep fissures in his party.Trump's outreach to Haley and Romney, seemed to demonstrate a possible willingness to assemble a team of rivals in his government -- which would be a surprising pivot for a man who wrote in his 1997 book ""The Art of the Comeback"" that one of his maxims was to ""get even"" and that he believed ""in an eye for an eye. World is watchingMany world leaders were eager to make contact with him after his surprising victory last week. But with Trump's own team in transition, that was no easy feat. For example, Trump was connected with the Australian prime minister, sources told CNN, by a mutual acquaintance, golfer Greg Norman, who happened to have his phone number.Several diplomats told CNN that they reached out to Trump Tower to schedule congratulatory calls for their head of state. . Once the calls were arranged, they were connected without being asked for any verification of their identities or measures to verify the authenticity of the call.Some diplomats who had set up meetings with transition team members for the coming days discovered those officials were gone as part of this past week's purge of Christie's team and anyone registered as a lobbyist.Amidst the initial confusion about who was in charge, one diplomat wondered whether to reach out directly to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is one of his closest advisers, or his daughter Ivanka Trump.Having been elected without any prior government experience, Trump's conversations unsurprisingly are bucking traditional diplomatic protocol The Times of London reported on a leaked transcript of Trump's call with British Prime Minister Theresa May, where Trump reportedly offered her the most casual of invitations to meet with him: ""If you travel to the US, you should let me know.""'A certain amount of chaos'After Trump's White House meeting with President Barack Obama, there also was a lapse in communication with the current agency personnel who will ensure a smooth transition of power.That problem -- delays created by Trump's team not getting paperwork and a list of names to the White House -- appeared to be corrected Thursday when a transition official reported that four teams -- from the Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Defense and National Security Council -- have been connected with the proper agency points of contact.While Trump's team has come under a hail of criticism this week, both Democratic and Republican officials who have been involved in past transition planning cautioned that a fair amount of chaos was to be expected, particularly given that many of Trump's own advisers did not expect him to win. Presidents-elect generally don't announce major nominees like Secretary of State within nine days of the election anyway.""Lots of reasons to be concerned about @realDonaldTrump transition,"" former Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted, ""but the pace of announcements isn't one of them. That's not a fair shot.""""We hadn't made any major appointments at this point in 2008,"" Axelrod added. ""I don't remember being criticized for it.""Lanhee Chen, a former Romney advisor and a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said it was hard to judge at this early stage whether things were going more or less smoothly than they did under Obama or President George W. Bush, even though the teams of those two candidates were highly organized and ready to deploy as soon as they clinched victory.  ""There's a certain amount of chaos that is built into every transition,"" Chen said. ""There always is this challenge of meshing campaign staff with transition staff with campaign staff. If Governor Romney had won in 2012, I think that there would have been some issues to sort through as well.""""Some of this is part of a natural process,"" said Chen, a CNN contributor. ""It's important to keep in mind that the Republican Party was pretty divided throughout this election, and part of what we are seeing is an effort, not just to build a new administration, but to heal some of the wounds from that fight.""
