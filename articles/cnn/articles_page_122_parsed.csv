And the campaign is already preparing its defenses for the third debate later this month.Clinton aides were shocked -- and caught off guard -- when Trump held a press conference with three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety before Sunday's debate. They were even more surprised when those women took seats inside the hall, in front of some of the most prominent Democrats in the country.Even though aides said that Trump's decision to invite three women ""failed"" to intimidate Clinton, there is now an acknowledgment inside Clinton's campaign that if the wheels completely come off Trump's campaign, the attacks could grow even more personal.""This was supposed to be his big moment. His threat, he followed through and it had no effect, so I don't know what he is going to do as an encore,"" Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, told reporters on Monday.But Palmieri also acknowledged that this won't be his last attempt to dredge up past scandals and allegations to humiliate the former secretary of state.""She's been through a number of trials over the course of her career and she's certainly not going to let him throw her off or intimidate her from speaking out,"" Palmieri added.Clinton also nodded to the astonishing spectacle of Sunday's debate.""Did anybody see that debate last night,"" Clinton asked to big applause at Wayne State University in Detroit. ""Bet you never saw anything like that before.""Defending Clinton's recordLess than 24 hours after the debate, Clinton and her team have already started to prepare for the third and final contest in Las Vegas later this month. One line of attack that Trump has effectively leveled against Clinton is questioning what she has accomplished in her 30-year career, arguing that she has plans but should have been able to do more as US senator and secretary of state.On Monday in Columbus, Ohio, Clinton presented her achievements by decade and compared those moments with points in Trump's life.""So when Donald Trump talks about what I have been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that,"" Clinton said at her largest rally of her presidential campaign. ""Because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he as being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination.""""In the 1980s,"" Clinton added, ""I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas ... while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business.""After slamming Trump for his NBC show ""The Apprentice"" -- ""on the day that I was in the situation room watching the raid the brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice"" -- Clinton said: ""If he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on.""Campaign giddy over GOP 'civil war'Even as they gird for a nasty last debate of the campaign, Clinton's aides are openly giddy about the fact that Republicans are openly feuding. After boarding the flight, Clinton remarked that it was time to take off so alcoholic beverages could be served.7 takeaways from the second presidential debateThe Clinton campaign watched on Monday as House Speaker Paul Ryan informed GOP House members on a conference call that he was no longer able to defend Trump — a stunning announcement that sparked chaos inside a party that had already been fractured around Trump's controversial candidacy this year.  ""I think it's pretty stunning that the morning after the debate, the speaker of the House has to come out and say that he's no longer going to defend Donald Trump and that each Republican member of Congress has to decide for themselves whether or not they're going to support their party's nominee,"" Palmieri said.To twist the knife on the Republican Party, Palmieri added, ""It seems that somewhat of a civil war is breaking out in the Republican Party.""After Ryan informed House Republicans that he could no longer defend Trump, the GOP nominee was quick to express his anger on Twitter. ""Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,"" Trump wrote.Donald Trump's mission: Make Clinton's life hell for the next monthEver since a 2005 video in which Trump casually brags about sexual assault was made public last week, Republicans across the country have begun to pull their support for Trump. Ryan and other congressional leaders have not gone as far as to rescind their endorsement, but plenty of Republicans in tough Senate and House races have rescinded their endorsements. Clinton was in good spirits after Sunday night's debate, where her campaign aides felt that she effectively dispatched with Trump's attacks and tried to stay focused on speaking to the undecided voters who asked questions during the town hall contest.Clinton received some good news Monday in a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that was conducted after the lewd 2005 video was made public -- but before Sunday's debate -- that found Clinton with a 14-point lead nationally in a head-to-head matchup against Trump, 52% to 38%. In a four-way race including third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, Clinton leads 46% to 35%.But even Clinton knew after the debate that her race against Trump, something she cast on Monday in Detroit as a fight between cynicism and hopefulness, was far from over.Asked on Sunday night whether she was surprised to see her husband's accusers in the audience, Clinton shook her head.""Nothing surprises me about him, really,"" she said. ""I was surprised by the absolute avalanche of falsehoods I find it almost unimaginable that someone can stand and just tell a falsehood after a falsehood."""

In the interview, Ginsburg steers clear from criticizing presidential candidate Donald Trump but calls the rhetoric from the election cycle ""distressing."" She updates her health status, her thoughts on Hillary Clinton and Merrick Garland's nomination and admits, to an amazed Couric, that she's never even seen the famous parody of her on ""Saturday Night Live.""National anthem protests Of Kaepernick and others she says, she thinks their actions are ""dumb and disrespectful"".""I would have the same answer if you asked me about flag burning. I think it's a terrible thing to do, but I wouldn't lock a person up for doing it. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act."" Kaepernick said Tuesday it was ""disappointing to hear a Supreme Court justice call a protest against injustices and oppression 'stupid, dumb.' """"I was reading an article and it refers to white critique of black protests and how they try to de-legitimize it by calling it 'idiotic, dumb, stupid,' things of that nature, so they can sidestep the real issue,"" he told reporters Tuesday, according to the Mercury News. ""As I was reading that I saw more and more truth how this has been approached by people in power and white people in power in particular.""In 1989, before Ginsburg joined the court, the Supreme Court held that the conviction of a man named Gregory Lee Johnson for burning the flag was inconsistent with the First Amendment. Of the athletes, Ginsburg said, ""if they want to be stupid, there's no law that should be preventive. If they want to be arrogant, there's no law that prevents them from that. What I would do is strongly take issue with the point of view that they are expressing when they do that."" Ginsburg's words were similar to the comments that the late Justice Antonin Scalia made when he was asked about his vote in favor of Johnson in the flag burning case.""If I were King,"" Scalia told CNN's Piers Morgan in 2012, ""I would not allow people to go about burning the American flag. However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged."" Election""I have said everything I'm going to say about the current election,"" Ginsburg told Couric and refused to discuss her comments last summer when she said she regretted calling Trump a ""faker"" among other comments to journalists. She laughed, though, when Couric brought up a tweet by Trump that said Ginsburg's ""mind is shot."" ""I'm not on Twitter, and I think I would not have responded,"" she said. She also refused to to speak directly to whether one could ban an entire religious group from entering the country in case that question could come before the court. But she did speak in personal terms about signs she saw as a young girl in the roadside in New Jersey that said ""No dogs or Jews allowed."" ""All I can say is I am sensitive to discrimination on any basis because I have experienced that upset,"" she told Couric. She said she looked at the sign and said to herself, ""I am a Jew, but I'm an American, and Americans are not supposed to say such things."" Ginsburg said ""I'm proud of the US as a country that welcomes all sorts of people."" She called the rhetoric of the election ""distressing"" but said she was ""hopeful it will go away."" Clinton and GarlandCalling Garland ""eminently qualified,"" she reiterated her belief that the Senate should hold a vote but ""it's the Senate's prerogative."" She added, however, that the court is ""handicapped"" without nine justices. Asked whether she said Clinton would re-nominate Garland, if she were to win the election, Ginsburg said, ""your guess about what she would do is as good as mine."" She also praised Clinton. ""It's very refreshing to see a woman with the knowledge that she has, with the poise and the command of language,"" Ginsburg said.Retirement?During the interview, conducted before the start of the term last week, she said, ""I'm still as excited about this new term about to start as I was in my first term here."" She said she ""won't be here forever,"" but that at her age, she has to ask herself the question each year. ""I can tell you this year, I'm fine, I'm OK ... what will come next year, I don't know.""Ginsburg reminded Couric that she still can do 20 pushups and was dismissive when Couric asked if she performed so-called ""girls pushups."" ""Oh no, no, no, the real ones,"" Ginsburg responded. She was asked about the infamous ""Saturday Night Live"" skit, where comedian Kate McKinnon portrays her. She said she hadn't seen it. ""What is this SNL?"" she queried."	Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Kaepernick protests: 'I think it's dumb and disrespectful'	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""Not for a second do I want to say that Obama has not been well-thought"" on this issue, Johnson said. ""But if he has been, if you're saying that he has been, I'm making the pitch that I'm going to be a continuation of that.""In the nearly hourlong conversation, Johnson also: Expressed regret for appearing to not recognize Aleppo, a city in Syria that has been at the center of that country's civil war, and then joking about it afterward. ""Look, 90% of people don't know what Aleppo is, but 90% of people aren't running for president of the United States. I am, and there's no excuse."" Indicated that, as president, he would not honor the US commitment to the Paris climate change agreement. ""If we're out in front on this and it results in fewer US jobs -- no, I'm not going to put us in a position of losing US jobs to comply ahead of everyone else.""Suggested local communities could supply a safer method for addicts to use heroin as a way to help combat the epidemic of opioid- and other drug-related deaths that have afflicted many parts of the country. ""I am not advocating a federal program here whatsoever. But if Chicago were to set up clinics that you, as a heroin addict, could come in and get your heroin tested without fear of criminal repercussion, we'll test it for you and we'll determine whether it will kill you or not. If you are genuinely concerned about reducing or eliminating death due to heroin, that is a program that would definitely do that.""Articulated his support for unlimited political campaign contributions from individuals and corporations, provided the system allows for full disclosure.To hear the whole conversation with Johnson, click on podcast.cnn.com.

She argued that while she found Trump's words offensive in a now infamous tape, in which he discusses how his fame allows him to treat women, she said she believed he would still be the best president on the issues she cares most about. Sciolaro also said that during the years in which Bill Clinton was president, his sex scandals caused her children to misunderstand the name of his White House office.""When Bill Clinton was president, my children came home from school and they had no idea it was actually called the Oval Office,"" she said.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/hillary-clinton-debate-guests-st-louis/index.html	Clinton's guests, according to a Clinton aide, include a member of the Little Rock Nine, two union leaders and Janelle Turner, a Clinton supporter with breast cancer whose relationship with the Democratic nominee began in Iowa in October 2015.Turner was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2015 and underwent six months of chemotherapy before she attended a Clinton event and held a sign about her cancer treatment. Clinton met with Turner at that event and has kept in touch with her since then, according to the Iowan, asking regularly for updates on her heath and family.Turner, who has said she is aiming to be at Clinton's inauguration in January, was featured in a campaign video earlier this year.Clinton has also invited Ernie Greene, a member of the Little Rock Nine, the first group of students to integrate Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957. The Clintons lived in Little Rock for decades and Green's invitation should be a seen as a commitment to working for racial equality.Two union members -- Eugene Hubbard, a chair of SEIU Local 1's member political committee, and Joseph Nudi, a UAW Local 12 member in Toledo, Ohio -- are both attending for Clinton.Nudi works at the JEEP Wrangler plant in Toledo. His job, according to the aide, was threatened during the 2008 recession but was saved because of the auto rescue.And Clinton has also invited Martha Soltani, whose daughter was born with hearing impairments and was treated thanks to the Children's Health Insurance Program, which Clinton helped created in the 1990s.During the first debate, Trump challenged Clinton to prove what she has done with her decades-long career. Clinton's aides, after the debate, highlighted her work to established the Children's Health Insurance Program and Soltani's invite could be highlighted it Trump rolls out the same attack.In addition to Clinton's invited guests, former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and son-in-law Marc Mezvinsky will also be seated in the hall with the Democratic nominee.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/trump-clinton-sex-then-vs-now/index.html	"When Bill Clinton's sex scandals were still fresh back in the 1990s, however, Trump took a much different approach to discussing them — expressing sympathy for Hillary Clinton, defending Bill Clinton and dismissing his accusers, and in one interview with Howard Stern, making light of Bill Clinton's infidelity. Already this election season, Trump has called Bill Clinton the ""greatest woman abuser of all time"" and pointed the finger at Hillary Clinton for what he has described as enabling her husband's sexual misdeeds and attacking the women who came forward against him.""She's been the total enabler. She would go after these women and destroy their lives,"" Trump said at a campaign rally in May. ""She was an unbelievably nasty, mean enabler, and what she did to a lot of those women is disgraceful.""On Sunday, Trump twice retweeted Juanita Broaddrick, the woman who in 1999 at the tail end of his presidency, accused Bill Clinton of raping her in the 1970s when he was the attorney general of Arkansas. Clinton denied the allegations through his lawyers at the time, and no legal proceedings were ever brought against him. The Trump campaign in late September circulated talking points telling surrogates to bring up women like Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky to counter questions about comments Trump made about former beauty queen Alicia Machado.Speaking with Wolf Blitzer in November 1999 in video reviewed by CNN's KFile, Trump said Hillary Clinton had been through more public controversy than any women should have to bear.""I think she's gone through terrible times,"" Trump told Blitzer in the interview. ""I think she's been through more than any woman should have to bear — everything public. I mean, women go through this on a private basis and can't take it, she's on the front page of every newspaper every week with what went on in Washington."" A month before, in an interview with CNBC, Trump expressed a similar sentiment about Hillary Clinton and blasted the independent investigator Ken Starr as ""a total wacko.""""I think she's a very, very good person,"" Trump said of Clinton. ""I think she's had a very tough life the last few years. I mean, what could be tougher than that? I mean, can you imagine those evenings when he's just being lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko? There's the guy. I mean, he is totally off his rocker. And can you imagine being lambasted like that all day and then saying, 'Darling, what are we having for dinner?' It's gotta be pretty tough.""Trump also repeatedly dismissed and at times mocked Bill Clinton's accusers. In a 2008 interview with CNN, Trump called the Lewinsky scandal ""totally unimportant"" and said it was ""nonsense"" that Republicans tried to impeach him.In another interview, with CNBC in 1998 and first unearthed by the Washington Post, Trump called Clinton accuser Paula Jones ""a loser.""  In August 1998, Trump again dismissed Jones, and said Bill Clinton was actually the victim.""I don't necessarily agree with his victims,"" Trump said to Fox News' Neil Cavuto in a clip uncovered earlier in the year by the ""Daily Beast."" ""His victims are terrible. He is, he is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.""""These people are just, I don't know, where he met them - where he found them,"" Trump continued. ""But the whole group — it's truly an unattractive cast of characters. Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg, I mean, this woman, I watch her on television. She is so bad. The whole group, Paula Jones, Lewinsky, it's just a really unattractive group. I'm not just talking about physical.""The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. As reported on Saturday by CNN's KFile, Trump also joked about Jones's celebrity boxing match in 2002, calling her ""not very talented"" and saying, ""it's too bad she didn't run like that from Bill (Clinton)."" Trump — who now wields Bill Clinton's past misdeeds as a weapon against Hillary Clinton — made light of Clinton's sex life in an interview Howard Stern in 1999, joking that she may have encouraged Bill Clinton to cheat. ""What's gonna happen with Clinton when he retires as a young man of 53 or 54?"" Trump asked in the interview. ""He's gonna run a company or something,"" replied Stern.""But do you think he'll stay married?"" Trump asked.""I think he will because --,"" said Stern, before co-host Robin Quivers interjects, ""She lets him do whatever he wants."" ""He's got the perfect marriage,"" Stern added.""Right,"" responded Trump.""He does whatever he damn well pleases,"" said Stern.""I think she might even encourage him,"" said Trump.""Right, I don't think she really wants him on top of her and that's the way it goes,"" said Stern, to which Trump laughs.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-state-of-the-union-debate/index.html	"Rudy Giuliani defended Donald Trump's crude remarks about women Sunday, telling CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that ""men at times talk like that."" But the former New York City mayor also admitted that what Trump was describing in a 2005 video is sexual assault. Hours before the second presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Trump's campaign tasked Giuliani with defending the GOP nominee amid a controversy that threatens to derail his candidacy and has thrown the Republican Party into chaos, with many of the party's top officials now openly rejecting Trump and calling on him to drop out of the race.Giuliani told Tapper that Trump is likely to apologize at the town hall-style presidential debate -- yet is also likely to attack Hillary Clinton over her treatment of the women involved in Bill Clinton's extramarital affairs. Giuliani said Trump made ""horrible remarks -- they're remarks you certainly don't want to hear from anyone, much less a presidential candidate.""""I think he made a full and complete apology for it. He probably is going to do it again tonight,"" he said. Tapper pressed Giuliani on Trump's claim -- in the video from a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" interview published Friday by The Washington Post -- that because he is a star, he could walk up to women and ""grab them by the pussy,"" asking who Trump did that to. ""First of all, I don't know that he did it to anyone. This is talk, and gosh almighty, he who hasn't sinned, throw the first stone here,"" Giuliani said. Tapper said: ""I have never said that; I have never done that. I am happy to throw a stone. I have been in locker rooms. I have been a member of a fraternity. I have never heard any man, ever, brag about being able to maul women because they get away with it -- never.""Giuliani responded: ""We've taken it to an extra degree of what he said. But the fact is that men at times talk like that. Not all men, but men do. He was wrong for doing it. I am not justifying it. I believe it's wrong. I know he believes it's wrong. I believe this is not the man we're talking about today."" In a separate interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" host George Stephanopoulos told Giuliani that what Trump was describing in the video is sexual assault -- which Giuliani didn't dispute.""That's what he's talking about. You know, whether it happened or not, I don't know, and how much exaggeration was involved in that, I don't know,"" Giuliani said. ""I do know there's a tendency on the part of some men at different times to exaggerate things like this, and I'm not in any way trying to excuse it or condone it. There is no excuse or answer for it other than, 'I'm very sorry and I wish I hadn't done it. And I'm not like that anymore.'""The former New York City mayor also insisted that Trump's apology in a video posted on Facebook in the early Saturday morning hours was sincere. ""It was an apology. He definitely apologized, and I know from talking to him that he genuinely feels very sorry about this, and it's certainly not the views he holds today,"" Giuliani told Tapper. Kaine struggles to answer question on hacked Clinton emails""He's run for public office. He spent the last year and a half traveling around the country. He realizes the responsibility he has to the people that follow him and believe we have to make a change in this country,"" he said. ""I think that alone has put a heavier weight on his shoulders than he ever had even when he was an entertainment star, the star of 'The Apprentice.' It's a different man that emerges when you campaign around the country for a year and a half and you hear the concerns of the American people.""Still, in that Facebook video, Trump attacked Hillary Clinton over her treatment of the women involved in Bill Clinton's extramarital affairs. Giuliani previewed that line of attack in his interview with Tapper. ""Gosh almighty, there were an awful lot of things, particularly Hillary Clinton attacking the women that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted, sexually abused -- and she was the leader of the attack against them -- so maybe he felt that at least put in context the kind of anger there would be at him,"" Giuliani said. Bill Clinton has denied sexually assaulting any women and has never faced charges on any claims.Giuliani also said Trump knows that 16 Republican senators on Saturday said they won't support him for president -- a round of defections that came after the ""Access Hollywood"" video surfaced.Trump throws GOP into chaosHe said Trump won't exit the race, despite calls from some for him to do so less than a month from Election Day. ""Yes, he is aware of the fact that a number of Republicans pulled their support, and he is not going to drop out,"" Giuliani said. ""He is going to remain. He is going to apologize for what he did. He is going to explain to people that that's not who he is today,"" he said. ""And he's going to count on the fact that the American people are fair and decent people, and when someone asks for forgiveness, they usually give it."""

Clinton leads Trump in Pennsylvania by 12 points among likely voters, 49% to 37%. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson had 6% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 4%. The polls show Clinton also held her 12-point lead in a two-way contest with the Republican nominee.

That three-point lead was within the poll's margin of error. The Florida poll finished before Hurricane Matthew hit the state. Trump has seen tremendous political fallout since the video, taped by NBC's ""Access Hollywood,"" was released. Several Republican Party members, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, have pulled their support of Trump entirely. Vice presidential nominee Mike Pence did not disavow his running mate but canceled a campaign appearance this weekend and said he ""cannot defend"" Trump's remarks.
