So you know, I appreciate their view, but I don't think I need to do any more at this point,"" Kasich told CNN in a phone interview Saturday.Kasich said the answer to that question is in the hands of the Republican National Committee.Trump to Howard Stern: It's okay to call my daughter a 'piece of ass'""Nobody has been clearer about their feelings toward him, or not many, as I have been. You have a Republican National Committee and they have to figure this out,"" said Kasich.Earlier in the day, Kasich released a statement announcing that he will not vote for Trump. The Ohio governor told CNN that he will definitely not vote for Hillary Clinton, and may just leave the top of the ballot blank.Trump throws GOP into chaosKasich, Trump's former rival for the GOP nomination, got a lot of criticism from fellow Republicans for refusing to attend this summer's Republican convention, even though it took place in Kasich's home state.He clearly now feels vindicated, though he insists Trump's lewd comments caught on tape were just the straw that broke the camel's back.""This is not just a matter of what has happened within the last 24 hours. This is a matter of what's happened over the course of frankly the last two years,"" said Kasich.""There was always -- somehow maybe the guy will change -- there's been no change. It's gotten worse,"" he added.Trump says he will 'never' drop outKasich said he isn't sure if this will be a wake-up call for Republican voters, who nominated Trump over him.""Frankly, if the Republican Party does not understand that the 21st century is about the politics of people, the Republican Party will die,"" said Kasich, echoing the core themes of his presidential run.""The truth as I'm out talking about these different issues that affect people, sometimes I'm not sure that my party hears it,"" Kasich lamented.He also said he worries what this latest Trump incident does to America's image around the world. ""I think this damages the way that people look at us. Now is it permanent? I don't believe it's permanent, but it is damaging at this point in time. There are people around the world that are probably in disbelief that this is how a presidential campaign is run in America,"" said Kasich.Before this latest bombshell, Trump was doing well in Ohio, where his populist anti-trade message resonates. Kasich, who was twice elected Ohio's governor, said he isn't sure what will happen now with Trump in the Buckeye state.""Nobody has been able to predict any of these things but I've always believed that a divider doesn't win. So I can't tell you if people are going to somehow justify this -- I hope not. I hope not,"" he said."	Kasich calls Trump's actions 'disgusting' but doesn't urge withdrawal	['Trump', 'Kasich']	[]
1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/donald-trump-gop-chaos/index.html	"Many in the GOP are reeling from shock, revulsion and utter confusion about what to do next after a video surfaced Friday of Donald Trump talking about women in crude and aggressive sexual terms. New revelations emerged Saturday after CNN's Kfile reviewed hours of newly uncovered audio of demeaning conversations Trump held over a 17-year period with radio shock-jock Howard Stern. The topics discussed included his daughter Ivanka's physique, having sex with women during their menstrual cycles, threesomes, and checking out of relationships with women after they turn 35. The fallout on Saturday revealed a party in chaos as dozens of Republicans either pulled their support for Trump or said his running mate, Mike Pence, should lead the ticket. Pence, the governor of Indiana, criticized Trump and canceled a scheduled appearance in Wisconsin on behalf of the campaign later Saturday.Even Trump's wife, Melania, who has kept a low profile in recent months, released a statement saying Trump's comments were ""offensive.""""This does not represent the man that I know,"" she said. ""He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.""Huddle at Trump TowerTrump's closest advisers, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, gathered at Trump Tower to plot a path forward. But in a sign of the extraordinary resistance to Trump that has developed over the past 24 hours, many in the party consulted the rules of the Republican National Committee to decide whether there's any possibility of dropping the billionaire from the ticket -- an option that seems easier said than done.For now, the RNC has put a temporary pause on its mail operations that are part of the committee's victory operation to assess the current situation and decide if they need to change their message on mailings and other get-out-the-vote operations, according to a top RNC official.Through it all, Trump seems determined not to be fazed by the crisis enveloping his campaign.""I'd never withdraw. I've never withdrawn in my life,"" Trump told The Washington Post. ""No, I'm not quitting. I have tremendous support.""He told The Wall Street Journal there is ""zero chance I'll quit.""The GOP nominee enjoys a strong base of support among disaffected Republican voters, and there are no immediate signs that his most loyal backers will split with a man they view as their champion in confronting a hated political establishment. In fact, the revolt of the establishment wing of the party against the GOP nominee could further embolden Trump's supporters.Trump briefly emerged from Trump Tower Saturday afternoon to greet his supporters, who cheered ""USA! USA!""Mess enveloping campaignThe mess enveloping the Trump campaign is just the latest stunning lurch of a wild presidential race that has repeatedly tested the limits of convention, credulity and even decent political discourse owing to the presence of Trump. Most immediately, the crisis elevates the GOP nominee's crucial second debate clash Sunday night with Hillary Clinton at Washington University in St. Louis into an extraordinarily important moment for Trump's White House campaign.Even before then, the fragile marriage of convenience between the GOP and Trump was splintering.Can Donald Trump recover from this?Pence abruptly canceled plans to appear with House Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin. Pence has repeatedly defended Trump despite his long history of controversial statements and positions. His decision not to show up sent a signal that he didn't want to personally represent Trump at an important Republican Party event.Pence issued a statement saying he was offended by the words and actions of his ticket mate.""I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them,"" Pence said. ""I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people. We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.""Pence's comments were an example of how Republican politicians are maneuvering amid the fast-changing political environment to protect their own futures as well as the short-term run-up to the election.For her part, Hillary Clinton has largely stood by as the drama with Trump and the GOP unfolds. But the furor presents Clinton with a new challenge -- and opportunities -- as she prepares for Sunday's debate.The former secretary of state must calibrate how she responds to the storm raging around Trump, and also prepare for the possibility that he will try to deflect it by bringing up the past infidelities of her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton was hunkered down and preparing for Sunday's debate with her top aides at the Doral Arrowwood, a Rye Brook, New York, hotel and spa, when The Washington Post published the bombshell video of Trump casually talking about sexual assault on Friday.The tape changed Clinton's debate prep as the small group of advisers with her focused on how to prepare her on how she will respond. Based on those efforts, Clinton's top aides decided Saturday that the Democratic nominee will not respond to Trump's suggestive comments before tomorrow's debate and instead address them ""early"" in the debate, possibly in her opening statement.Clinton's senior advisers made the decision after watching dozens of Republicans rescind their endorsements and feel there is no rush to get something out Saturday. The campaign thinks it is beneficial for them if her first response comes during what is expected to be a debate that draws more than 80 million people, maximizing the number of people who see her reaction.Cutting Trump looseRepublicans steadily began cutting Trump loose Saturday.New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, locked in a tight re-election race, helped trigger an avalanche of top GOP figures away from Trump. Nevada GOP Senate candidate Joe Heck, competing in another competitive race, said he could no longer support Trump, though would not vote for Clinton.How the shocking hot mic tape of Donald Trump was exposedArizona Sen. John McCain also withdrew his support for Trump. In addition to the vulgar comments that surfaced Friday, McCain also cited Trump's controversial remarks earlier in the week about the ""Central Park 5"" -- saying he believed they were still guilty in a 1989 rape despite being exonerated years ago -- in making his decision.""Donald Trump's behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy. Cindy, with her strong background in human rights and respect for women fully agrees with me in this,"" McCain said.""Cindy and I will not vote for Donald Trump,"" he continued. ""I have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate and we will not vote for Hillary Clinton. We will write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president.""Meanwhile, Ted Cruz, who only recently endorsed Trump after a brutal primary battle, is considering rescinding that backing, according to a source close to the Texas senator.A handful of top operatives involved in GOP Senate races said the guidance from the Republican leadership in Washington is to do whatever it takes to insulate those campaigns from the Trump fallout.""This comes from the top and it couldn't be more clear: Repudiate him, repudiate the remarks, and if you need to go beyond that, then don't hesitate and don't worry,"" said one Republican strategist working a difficult race for a GOP Senate incumbent.  ""The presidential race is over,"" said a second GOP strategist working a key Senate race.Three GOP sources familiar with conversations at the highest level of the party leadership said House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would prefer Trump step aside, even though they understand the mess and confusion that would cause because early voting is under way, state ballots are mostly printed and deadlines for getting off the ballot have passed in most states.  Both Ryan and McConnell have condemned his remarks but neither has publicly called for him to quit the ticket. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a McConnell leadership deputy, did say Trump should step aside, and the GOP sources pointed to that as evidence of leadership thinking.These sources said both congressional leaders are increasingly frustrated with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who has repeatedly promised them Trump would come to understand his role as nominee and his impact on other Republicans. And they said it had been relayed to Priebus that they expected the national organization to place protecting the congressional majorities first as questions about resources are decided in the final 30 days of the race.Forcing Trump off the ticketRepublican sources say one option under consideration is ending the Joint Fundraising Agreement between the RNC and the Trump campaign so the RNC could focus its fundraising exclusively on critical down ballot races and encourage donors who were opposed to Trump to continue to support the party.But the chance that the GOP could force Trump off its presidential ticket just a month before Election Day appears to be a long shot, not least because the election is already underway in some states in absentee and early voting.In theory, there is a mechanism to replace Trump on the ticket should he rescind his pledge to stay in the race and drop out. The party rules allow RNC members to pick a new nominee in a state-by-state vote.Why Republicans can't easily dump Trump off the ballotBut any move to replace Trump would soon run into a legal minefield. There is no system in place, for instance, for states to recall votes or offer new ballots to Americans who have already voted in the election. Ballot access deadlines have already passed in some states so there would certainly be legal challenges.One RNC member told CNN's Tom LoBianco that dumping Trump would be almost impossible.""I don't think it's an option. Seriously. Ballots are printed. People are already voting. We just have to live with it."" Another RNC member said getting changes to balloting rules in 50 states was likely not going to work. ""We are stuck and so is Pence,"" the person said."	Trump throws GOP into chaos	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Christie', 'McConnell', 'McCain', 'Pence', 'Paul', 'Thune']	[]
2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/sean-spicer-donald-trump-women-remarks/index.html	"Spicer also engaged in a discussion on what the Republican Party would do if Trump stepped down as the Republican nominee. He said during a radio interview with former baseball player Curt Schilling Trump would need to understand the ""severity"" of his comments. Schilling, the former baseball star and prominent conservative, said Trump's comments made the election ""unwinnable"" for the Republican nominee.""I think, look, as Christians and Americans, we all understand that people make mistakes and ask for forgiveness. How they do it and how they take a situation and show that they want to change and be better is really kind of sometimes the bigger part of a problem or an issue. How he handles this over the next 24 hours is absolutely critical.""""If you don't get the severity of this, then that will speak very loudly,"" Spicer added, after repeating Trump would need to ask for forgiveness.Trump apologized for his comments in a video statement released after midnight on Saturday, though he immediately pivoted to attack the Clintons.""I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,"" Trump said.The RNC chief strategist added the comments could not be defended in anyway.""No, absolutely not and that's why I'm saying there is no defending it,"" Spicer said. ""There is no excusing it. Whether you have a daughter or a sister or a mom, I mean, you look and you go that is not how you describe a woman. No way, no how, ever.""Spicer said people of faith should recognize people make mistakes. Schilling asked Spicer what would happen if Trump were to step down as the Republican nominee.""I'm not a big fan of hypotheticals, but the answer is we'd have to cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Spicer said. ""If he -- and frankly that holds true with any office -- if there's a vacancy, then it depends on state law. We have never had that happen before, at least in modern times that I'm aware of."" Spicer cited the case of Mel Carnahan in Missouri, who died in a plane crash weeks before the 2000 Senate election, as precedent for how to change names on the ballot.""We don't have that scenario right now. I think what we have to do, to your point, recognize that there's still a choice,"" said Spicer. ""Donald Trump made some comments 11 years ago that weren't appropriate. He has apologized. I think we will see in the next 20, 48 hours how he continues to hold and handle this.""He added voters would have decided if Trump's 2005 comments outweighed the decisions Hillary Clinton would make as president.""But we also do have a choice and have to recognize that Hillary Clinton will have spending, appointments, decisions and priorities that could vastly change our country,"" he added. ""We have to make a decision whether someone's comments 11 years ago outweigh the decisions that a president Hillary Clinton would make in terms where we are as a country now and what those decisions would have on the coming generation.""He added while he found Trump's comments were ""reprehensible,"" he believed Clinton's actions as secretary of state were worse."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/donald-trump-republicans-statements-support/index.html	"(CNN) — It took an audio recording of Donald Trump bragging about trying to have sex with a married woman and saying he could ""do anything"" to women -- including grabbing them ""by the pussy"" -- for Republicans to begin withdrawing their support of their party's nominee.It was the final straw for the flurry of Republicans who began recanting their endorsements and calling on the Republican nominee to drop out on Saturday, but it was also just the latest in a string of outrageous, controversial and inflammatory comments Trump has made over the course of his nearly 16-month-old campaign.Here are 17 things Trump has said that didn't cause Republicans to reject their party's nominee or stop them from endorsing Trump in the first place.1. He called for banning all MuslimsTrump last December called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" a proposal that would effectively bar about 1.6 billion people from entering the United States on the sole basis of their religion.The proposal was just one of a slew of Islamophobic comments Trump has made throughout his campaign, including declaring in March that he believes ""Islam hates us.""Trump never disavowed his calls for a blanket ban of all Muslims, though he has since said he wants to ban immigration from ""terror states.""2. He questioned a federal judge's impartiality because he was 'a Mexican'Trump argued that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a US-born federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University, was inherently biased against him because of his Mexican heritage.""We are building a wall. He's a Mexican,"" Trump said in a June interview with CNN's Jake Tapper.While Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan condemned Trump's remarks as ""the textbook definition of racism,"" neither Ryan nor any other Republican withdrew their endorsement at the time.Only Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois announced after those comments that he would not support Trump.3. He feuded with the family of a slain US soldierTrump lashed out at the Gold Star parents of a slain Muslim US soldier who died in Iraq after they sharply criticized him at the Democratic National Convention.He said Humayun Khan's mother did not speak during the speech because she was not ""allowed"" and said the father had ""no right"" to criticize him.Trump's escalation of the feud prompted Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to announce that she could not support Trump. No Republicans who had previously endorsed Trump withdrew their support.4. He didn't deny calling a former Miss Universe ""Miss Piggy"" after she gained weightAfter Hillary Clinton raised former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's allegations that Trump had called her ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping"" back in the 1990s, Trump didn't deny the allegations.Instead, he said this: ""She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.""5. He called undocumented Mexican immigrants criminals and ""rapists""Trump kicked off his campaign amid controversy after labeling undocumented Mexican immigrants broadly as criminals and ""rapists."" ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" Trump said. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""6. He denigrated prisoners of war -- and never apologized""He's not a war hero,"" Trump said in July 2015 about Sen. John McCain, who was imprisoned and tortured for more than five years in a North Vietnamese prison.""He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured,"" Trump continued.McCain announced his support for Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination and only un-endorsed him on Saturday amid the uproar over the 2005 audio.7. He appeared to mock a disabled reporterTrump pressed forward with his pattern of mocking reporters who displeased him when he went after Serge Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter who has a physical disability.""Now the poor guy, you've got to see this guy: 'Uhh, I don't know what I said. I don't remember,'"" Trump said in November, flailing his arms in a manner similar to how Kovaleski's arms look due to his disability.Trump was prompted by challenges to his repeated (and debunked) claim that he saw ""thousands"" of Muslims celebrating in Jersey City, N.J., as the World Trade Center towers burned and fell during the 9/11 terror attack.8. He called on Russia to hack Hillary ClintonTrump appeared to urge Russian intelligence agencies to unearth and release the 33,000 emails Clinton deleted from her private email server.""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,"" Trump said in July.Trump's statement marked a startling call from a presidential nominee to urge a foreign adversary to interfere in the US elections.9. He condoned violence against protesters at his ralliesAfter a Black Lives Matter protester was shoved, tackled, punched and kicked when he disrupted a Trump rally last fall, the GOP nominee offered this response:""Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,"" Trump said reacting to the incident.Trump has also said in February of a protester that he would ""like to punch him in the face"" and fondly recalled the ""old days"" when protesters would be ""carried out on stretchers.""And during another February rally, he urged his supporters: ""If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?""10. He said women should be punished for getting abortions""There has to be some form of punishment,"" Trump said in March when asked if women should be punished for getting abortions should the practice be outlawed.He later walked back his remark, saying only the doctors who perform the service should be punished if abortions were outlawed.11. He called a GOP primary rival too ugly to be elected president""Look at that face!"" Trump cried out as his primary rival Carly Fiorina appeared on TV as Trump sat for an interview with Rolling Stone magazine last year.""Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?"" Trump continued.12. He attacked Ted Cruz's familyTrump repeatedly crossed the line most politicians would not dare to cross by attacking the family of his chief rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, during the GOP primary.He threatened to ""spill the beans"" about Cruz's wife -- whom he later retweeted an unflattering picture of alongside a glamor shot of Trump's own wife.Trump later accused Cruz's father -- with no evidence -- of being involved in President John F. Kennedy's assassination.Trump also called Cruz a ""pussy"" on stage at a rally before the New Hampshire primary.13. He said ""Second Amendment people"" could deal with Hillary Clinton""Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know,"" Trump said in August.The comments were interpreted by many as a threat of violence against Clinton and prompted the Secret Service to issue a statement that they were ""aware"" of Trump's comments.Trump also called in September for Clinton's Secret Service detail to ""disarm.""""Let's see what happens to her,"" he said. ""It'll be very dangerous.""14. He suggested more countries should get nuclear weapons to defend themselves""North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea,"" Trump said in an April interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace.""With nukes?"" Wallace asked""Yes, including with nukes,"" Trump said.15. He set conditions for defending NATO alliesTrump cast doubt in a July interview with The New York Times as to whether, as president, he would defend some top US military allies in the event of an attack.Trump said that he would defend NATO allies that have ""fulfilled their obligations to us,"" but would not answer when asked if he would defend those that he believes have not.16. He refused to immediately reject the support of David Duke and white supremacists""I don't know anything about David Duke. OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,"" Trump told Tapper when asked about the former Ku Klu Klan leader's support.He would later disavow Duke's support.17. He repeatedly made denigrating comments about womenTrump's 2005 conversation about groping and trying to have sex with a married woman was not the first time such lewd talk has surfaced since Trump has been a candidate for president.In his numerous appearances on ""The Howard Stern Show,"" Trump frequently engaged in vulgar and objectifying conversations about women, including ranking women on a scale of 1 to 10 and discussing everything from oral sex to an anal sex and whether he could get an erection for certain famous women.And during the presidential race, after suggesting Megyn Kelly asked him tough questions because she was on her period, Trump accused Kelly of being a ""bimbo."""	17 other things Trump said that didn't stop Republicans from supporting him	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'McCain', 'Kirk', 'Cruz', 'Black', 'Paul']	[]

If sensible centrists stay home because there are no great options, we risk ceding control to the fringes of our political spectrum,"" Clinton said. ""Please consider the long-term consequences of your choice and make that choice heard in November.""Whitman, who also served as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under George W. Bush, said in March -- before Trump was the nominee -- that she would back Clinton over Trump, should he secure the nomination.""I will probably vote for her,"" Whitman said. ""I don't want to. I can do a write-in. But I think that's where I'd go if those are my choices.""Whitman has also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler.""It is no longer a stretch to compare Donald Trump ... to some of the worst dictators in history,"" Whitman wrote in December in the wake of Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from the US. ""Trump especially is employing the kind of hateful rhetoric and exploiting the insecurities of this nation, in much the same way that allowed Hitler and Mussolini to rise to power in the lead-up to World War II. The parallels are chilling.""Clinton's campaign has been courting Republican endorsements for much of 2016, looking to disqualify Trump with moderate Republicans who have been appalled by some of the nominee's more shocking comments."

""He talks about how he'd like to punch people in the face? Well, I'd like to punch him in the face.""De Niro recorded the video for the #VoteYourFuture initiative to encourage Americans to vote in the presidential election. But producers deemed the video so partisan that they excluded the De Niro section on Trump from the video and released it separately.The video began attracting attention when it aired Friday on ""The Kelly File,"" the Fox News show hosted by Megyn Kelly, who has been on the receiving end of Trump attacks in the past. The video was recorded before news broke Friday that Trump had used vulgar language to describe his attempt to sleep with a married woman and how his fame allows him to have his way with women.In the video, De Niro called Trump several names, employing some that the GOP nominee has used to describe people he doesn't respect like ""pig"" and ""dog.""""He's so blatantly stupid. He's a punk, he's a dog, he's a pig, he's a con, he's a bulls--- artist, a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about,"" said the actor, known for iconic roles in ""The Godfather II,"" ""Goodfellas"" and scores of other films in a four-decade career.Trump ""doesn't do his homework"" and ""doesn't care,"" said De Niro, who has endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He ""thinks he's gaming society, doesn't pay his taxes. He's an idiot. Colin Powell said it best: He's a national disaster. He's an embarrassment to this country,"" he said."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/republicans-replace-trump/index.html	"News of Trump's sexually aggressive remarks from 2005 is just the latest explosion to spur discussion of ways to break ties with the presidential nominee.The #NeverTrump forces fought all the way through the last day of the Republican convention. That was quickly followed by his lengthy battle with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, which had some Republicans digging through the party's rules and state laws for options.Talk of replacing Trump ebbed when he pulled even with Hillary Clinton in the polls last month, and with just 30 days left until the election, thousands of ballots already cast in states with early voting and the legal deadlines for changing names on the ballot already past, the GOP is stuck with him.Trump says he's not going anywhere, but that won't stop the conversation. Here are some of the hypotheticals -- and the reasons they can't work.Rule 9The Republican National Committee's rules allow for the 168 party committee members to replace a nominee in the case of ""death, declination, or otherwise.""The idea of having the RNC reconvene and select a new nominee was first floated in August. It was a long-shot then and practically impossible now because votes have already been cast and deadlines for removing candidates from the ballot have passed.""I'm not aware of any national RNC rule remedy or federal statute here outside of state-by-state write-in rules,"" said one RNC committee member Saturday. ""It is unrealistic and politically risky to beseech 50 different Secretaries of State to change ballots or to pursue write-in efforts. We are stuck, and so is (Mike) Pence.""""I don't think it's an option. Seriously. Ballots are printed. People are already voting,"" said another RNC member. ""We just have to live with it.""The reality is that early voting means the ballots have already been locked in, said Steve Vladeck, a CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.""The only real scenario is Trump saying he'll resign the second he's inaugurated -- at which point voters will think that a vote for him is really a vote for Pence,"" Vladeck said.Even President Barack Obama has already voted -- Friday afternoon, just before the Trump bombshell exploded.Mike Pence to the rescue?As the fallout from Trump's comments began to take hold, Republican lawmakers who were distancing themselves from Trump also began saying they would vote for Pence.Pence drew conservative applause for his standout performance in Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, spurring talk of a 2020 run. But some Republicans don't want to wait that long.A spokesman for Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who has been an ardent anti-Trump Republican, said he is ""likely"" to write in Pence when he votes next month. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, facing a tough re-election battle, issued a statement saying she supports Pence. Others have followed.Pence canceled a public appearance in Wisconsin Saturday and blasted Trump in an extraordinary statement.""I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them,"" Pence said.""The likely scenario, if there is one, is that Pence would become the nominee since he had already been nominated and voted on once. It's not simple, but it is do-able,"" CNN Republican delegate analyst Mike Shields told CNN's Gloria Borger.But Evan McMullin, the conservative former Republican staffer who is mounting an independent bid, blasted Pence as a Trump ""enabler.""""Calls for Pence, Trump's number one enabler, to replace the nominee may be a feel good exit for GOP leaders, but it isn't actually feasible,"" McMullin said.One of the scenarios being played out by GOP party elders is convincing Pence to leave the ticket. Vin Weber, a former Jeb Bush supporter, says he would ""absolutely"" call for Pence to leave the ticket as a way to put ""immeasurable pressure"" on Trump to leave the race.""Pence is the anchor that keeps Trump in the race,"" so without him it would be over for the candidate, Weber said.Faithless electors?Election law expert Rick Hasen floated the idea of a ""hail mary"" in a tweetstorm Saturday morning, saying that Trump could still appear on the ballot but that the actual electors themselves who show up to the Electoral College to place the votes that decide who is president could then cast their votes for someone else. Like, say, for Pence.""No, the Republican Hail Mary now is GOP faithless electors voting for Pence (or Romney?) instead of Trump in Electoral College vote,"" Hasen tweeted.Hasen, writing in a longer blog post, explained that it would be a state-by-state decision and that some states bar so-called ""faithless electors"" from voting against the will of the voters.""There are some laws that bar 'faithless' electors from casting votes for anyone who did not win the popular vote in a state, but I have a hard time believing either the Republican-controlled House or a court (because it raises a political question) would stop the actions of a faithless elector,"" Hasen writes.But the ""faithless elector"" scenario still runs up against a mishmash of state laws, making it almost impossible for an across-the-board sweep of at least 270 electors defecting.Vladeck explained that it remains a better option than pulling Trump's name from the ballot, but is still a longshot. ""The Electoral College is a different matter, so folks could vote 'for Trump' on assumption the electors will pick someone else, but I just don't see that happening,"" Vladeck said. Clinton's lawyer: Not happeningMarc Elias, the Clinton campaign's top lawyer, has assured campaign manager Robby Mook and other senior Democrats that there is no way Republicans can remove Trump from the ballot, according to a Clinton aide.Elias told Mook and others that it is too late into the process for that and the campaign's top aides, based on Elias' assurances, are confident that Trump will be their opponent -- no matter what happens in the next month.Clinton's campaign watched on Friday as reporters and other political watchers cited RNC rules as proof that Trump could be replaced on the top of the ticket should the fallout from his lewd sexual comments lead to that.But Elias, who handles election law for most top Democrats and is currently suing a number of states to restore early voting and stop voter ID laws, told Clinton aides that it is state ballot laws that matter, not RNC rules.What's more, Elias told the aides, early voting and uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting has already begun."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate/index.html	"But on Sunday, she plans to respond to the sexually explicit remarks ""early"" in the contest, according to a source with knowledge of her debate strategy.Clinton was hunkered down and preparing for Sunday's debate with her top aides at the Doral Arrowwood, a hotel and spa here, when The Washington Post published a bombshell video of Trump casually talking about sexual assault on Friday. The subsequent 24 hours have rocked the Trump campaign to its core and rattled Republicans nationwide.Based on their confidence in Clinton's ability to respond to Trump, Clinton's top aides decided the Democratic nominee should try to maximize the audience for her response and make her first comments during what could be a debate watched by more than 80 million people.The campaign official said Clinton wanted to get the response out of the way early, likely in order to knock Trump off his heels and use that to hurt him throughout the debate.The tape of Trump saying that because he is famous he is able to grope and assault women entirely changed Clinton's debate preparations. While Clinton and her aides always knew that a debate with Trump would be difficult to plan for, the release of the Trump video on Friday made it even more likely, Democrats said, that Sunday's contest would be unpredictable and nasty.Before the first debate, Clinton and her aides prepared for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, namely Bill Clinton's infidelity. But sources said they planed for Trump, in an effort to reach out to skeptical Republicans and undecided voters, to be more presidential than bombastic.But now that Trump has released a defiant video apology -- in which he alluded to how he will go after Bill Clinton on Sunday -- sources said the expectation that Trump would be presidential in St. Louis went out the window.Clinton and her aides scripted one-line responses to Trump before the first debate at Hofstra University, and Democrats close to Clinton said they expect the nominee to prepare the same way ahead of Sunday's contest. She will come prepared with a way to respond to Trump if he brings up her husband's infidelity, sources said. But -- as she did last month -- Clinton will look to give Trump as much time as he needs to try to explain his comments, hoping that the more time he talks about them, the worse it is for Republicans.Importance of preparationClinton's primary takeaway after her first debate with Trump was that preparation matters, aides said. So in the days leading up to Sunday's contest in St. Louis, Clinton has heavily prepared for the town hall debate format.Town hall debates present Clinton and Trump with a different challenge than last month's contest: Both nominees will need to prepare to attack one another while also connecting with the undecided voters who will ask them questions. Those challenges were elevated with Friday's release of the video.Clinton has considerably more experience than Trump in the town hall format. Clinton headlined 19 town halls in Iowa, 19 in New Hampshire and nine in South Carolina during her run for the Democratic nomination and at times took uncomfortable and direct questions from voters.That is considerably more than Trump, who is more familiar with large rallies and headlined a rare town hall in New Hampshire on Thursday as a way to prepare for Sunday's debate.Clinton is surrounding herself with the same team of aides who led her prep ahead of last month's debate at Hofstra University.Jake Sullivan, Clinton's longtime policy aide, has taken the lead on preparing for Sunday's debate, according to a source with knowledge of the preparations. Sullivan has been joined by Ron Klain, who advised President Barack Obama; Karen Dunn, a longtime lawyer and aide; John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman; and Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director.Philippe Reines, a longtime adviser known for his combative style and fierce loyalty to Clinton, is playing Trump in debate prep, the same role he played last month. Clinton is said to be very impressed with Reines' Trump impersonation. While he isn't imitating Trump's voice, the way he emulated his cadence and hand motions led Clinton to exclaim, ""Wow, that sounded exactly like Philippe,"" when she came off the debate stage last month.Five-hour sessionsClinton prepared with aides at her Washington, D.C., home on Wednesday, focusing more on strategy and policy than actually doing mock debates, sources said.After headlining a fundraiser in New York City on Thursday, Clinton headed to the Doral Arrowwood, which is near her home in Chappaqua, where she met aides for further debate prep.Clinton returned to the hotel on Friday, conducting a five-hour sessions in the afternoon, and came back again on Saturday.Trump has mocked Clinton for her hours of preparation before the debates, but is now said to be preparing for the debate while trying to save his campaign.""Do you really think that Hillary Clinton is debate prepping for three or four days?"" Trump asked mockingly in New Hampshire on Thursday. ""It's not debate prep. She's resting, she's resting. She's resting and I want to be with the American people.""Clinton has laughed off Trump's attacks on her preparation, even turning it into an attack line during the first debate. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,"" Clinton said wryly after Trump hit Clinton for taking time off the trail. ""And, yes, I did. You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.""Sources said after the first debate that they scripted that line because Trump and his surrogates telegraphed that he would go there at the debate. Because Trump is doing the same ahead of Sunday's contest, it is expected that Clinton will be ready to hit back once again.Unlike ahead of 2016's first general election debate, where aides tried to lower expectations around Clinton, top aides have been heralding the former secretary of state's experience with town halls.""I think Hillary did ... a lot of town halls during the course of the primaries and into the general. So she is very used to the format. She likes it,"" Podesta said on Wednesday. ""She likes answering questions from individual citizens. She listens hard, she relates to people.""Clinton's campaign chairman added that town halls are ""a format that Donald Trump isn't as used to. ... I think it is a natural format for her. She likes engaging with people."""	Clinton mum on Trump implosion -- for now	['Sullivan', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

He's actually describing his own behavior. He's saying, 'I did this and I will do this again. This is what I do when I meet beautiful women.' That's what surprised me the most,"" David Fahrenthold told CNN's Michael Smerconish on Saturday.The video -- for which Trump later apologized -- surfaced on Friday and was previously unaired footage from ""Access Hollywood."" It included Trump on a bus recalling to Billy Bush about a time he tried to ""fuck"" a married woman. Trump then goes on to say he is can grope women because of his ""star"" status.""How the shocking hot mic tape of Donald Trump was exposed""I better use some tic tacks just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. I just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy,"" Trump said in the audio. Fahrenthold also said he was shocked by the language Trump used. ""I mean this is a guy, we're familiar with his voice, we're familiar with the way he's acted on television, (but) we've never heard him use this kind of language,"" Fahrenthold said. According to The Washington Post, Fahrenthold was given a tip about the audio by a source Friday morning.Sources at NBC told CNNMoney's Brian Stelter Friday that they believe someone inside NBC downloaded the footage from one of the network's video servers. The tape was accessible internally since the ""Access"" story was already in the works."	Reporter who broke Trump story says language surprised him	['Trump']	[]
9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/trump-on-howard-stern/index.html	"Donald Trump engaged in crude and demeaning conversations about women over a 17-year-period with radio shock-jock Howard Stern, according to a review by CNN's KFile of hours of newly uncovered audio.Among the topics Trump discussed: his daughter Ivanka's physique, having sex with women on their menstrual cycles, threesomes, and checking out of a relationship with women after they turn 35. Trump's long track record of making misogynistic comments and engaging in lewd conversations about sex took on a new and much darker tone on Friday night, when the Washington Post published audio of Trump, caught on a hot mic in 2005, bragging about how women let him do whatever he wants to them because he's a celebrity.While Trump's comments — in which he describes forcing himself upon women — stand apart from anything he has said in the past, Trump has long engaged in sexually explicit banter over the years, particularly on Stern. Trump appeared on Stern's radio program for decades, and while many of his appearances have been reported on, KFile's review has turned up previously unreported examples of Trump engaging in crude conversations. On Ivanka Trump's physiqueIn more than one interview with Stern, Trump took part in conversations about Ivanka Trump's appearance, including one about the size of her breasts.In an October 2006 interview, Stern remarks that Ivanka ""looks more voluptuous than ever,"" and asked if she had gotten breast implants. Trump is willing to engage in the discussion about his own daughter, telling Stern that she did not get implants. ""She's actually always been very voluptuous,"" Trump responds. ""She's tall, she's almost 6 feet tall and she's been, she's an amazing beauty.""In another interview, from September 2004, Stern asks Trump if he can call Ivanka ""a piece of ass,"" to which Trump responds in the affirmative. ""My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka,"" says Trump.""By the way, your daughter,"" says Stern. ""She's beautiful,"" responds Trump. ""Can I say this? A piece of ass,"" Stern responds. ""Yeah,"" says Trump. On women's agesIn his interviews with Stern, Trump discussed leaving women after a certain age and dating younger women.  In a 2002 appearance, Trump calls 30 ""a perfect age.""""Until she's 35,"" a co-host interjects.""What is it at 35? It's called check-out time,"" Trump responds. In a 2006 interview, Stern asks Trump, ""Do you think you could now be banging 24-year-olds?""""Oh, absolutely,"" Trump says. ""Would you do it?,"" asks Stern. ""I'd have no problem,"" Trump said.Stern then asked Trump if he has an age limit. ""No, I have no age — I mean, I have age limit. I don't want to be like Congressman Foley, with, you know, 12-year-olds.""On his own sex lifeTrump frequently talked about his personal sex life on Stern's radio program, which included him willingly engaging in a discussion about having sex with women on their menstrual cycles. ""Will you have sex with a woman if she's having her period? Go ahead,"" Stern asks Trump in a 1997 interview. ""I thought he was looking at Kate when he said that,"" Trump responded, looking at his ""Art of Comeback"" co-author and fellow guest Kate Bohner. ""She's done that.""""Donald, seriously, you would not, right, am I correct?,"" asked Stern.""Well, I've been there. I have been there Howard, as we all have,"" Trump responded. ""You don't like it?,"" asked Stern.""Well, sometimes you get there by mistake,"" Trump said.In the same interview, Stern also asked Trump,  ""Have you had a black women in bed?""""Well, it depends on what your definition of black is,"" responded Trump. ""Interesting. I like this discussion. His bed is a rainbow,"" Stern said. ""The rainbow coalition, as Rev. Jesse would say,"" Trump said. Later in the interview, Trump says he lost his virginity at ""about 14.""""It was a young woman, who was really beautiful, she the hot little girl in high school or grammar school or whatever,"" Trump said. ""She was hot. I haven't seen her. I haven't seen her.""In a 2008 interview, Trump said he was still having ""a lot"" of sex with his wife Melania.  Later, when co-host Artie Lang asked Trump if he ever had a threesome -- describing multiple women together weighing 300 pounds -- Trump willingly responds in the affirmative, and actually suggests he has slept with three women collectively weighing 375 pounds. ""I wouldn't say 300, I would say could be about 375,"" said Trump.  ""I figure 125 a piece as opposed to 100.""""Haven't we all,"" Trump added about men having threesomes, ""are we babies?""In an 1993 appearance, Stern and Trump discussed wealthy men who cannot get dates, when Stern says the difference with Trump is that he satisfies the women he sleeps with. ""And I couldn't care less,"" Trump replied.On Tiger WoodsIn an April 2010 show, Trump engaged in a discussion on the marital infidelities of pro-golfer Tiger Woods. In the discussion, Trump engaged in extremely explicit discussions with Stern on Woods's sexual habits.""Do you believe in sex addiction?"" Stern asked Trump during a discussion of Woods and his then-wife, Elin Nordegren. ""No, I believe people like sex a lot,"" Trump said. ""People like you, people like me. Tiger.""Asked if he ever slept with two or three women in one day, Trump responds, ""I have no comment. Look, I like sex, so do you.""""She's hot, she's hot though right?,"" Stern asked Trump of Nordegren, after Trump said he's talked to Woods since his sex scandal broke in the news.'Yeah, she's fine,"" said Trump.""You don't think she's that hot?,"" Stern asked.""It depends by what standard,"" Trump replied. ""What standard are you judging?""""I have a very high standard,"" added Trump. ""Howard knows, because he got me in a lot of trouble once, he went over a list of 15 supermodels. You remember the list of supermodels. And he'd ask me, 'how was she?' How was she?' And I was married at the time, you know this was not a good question to be asking.""""I think she's good,"" Trump added of Nordegren's attractiveness.""No, I'd say she's a solid nine, solid nine yeah,"" Trump said, when asked how he'd rate her.When Stern suggested to him he should do a show where he just rates women, Trump said, ""That may be the best idea of all I would say I'm the all-time judge, don't forget, I own the Miss Universe pageant.""""Mr. Trump I'm asking you directly, is her ass too big?"" Stern asked.""No,"" Trump replied.""Body perfect?"" Stern asked. ""Very nice,"" responded Trump.""She's very nice, is she a 10, you know what a 10 is?"" Trump asked.Stern then brought up one of Woods's mistresses, saying, ""She does a position where Tiger Woods— I'm gonna be a little bit graphic— Tiger stood her on her head -- listen to this...""""Spun her around,"" Trump interjected while laughing.""No, no, no,"" said Stern. ""He put his penis in her behind and then put his fingers in the vagina...""Trump responded by laughing, saying he's never done that position.Trump added that Woods is definitely ""not gay.""On beauty pageant contestantsIn an April 2005 episode, Stern asked Trump if there was ever a time when he had sex with Miss Universe or Miss USA contestants.""I never comment on things like that,"" Trump answered.Later, Artie Lang interjects from the background, ""Give us the first letter of the country you had sex with.""""How many letters are there?"" Trump joked. Stern then posed a scenario wherein one of the beauty pageant contestants went up to Trump and asked to have sex with him.""Now you're not the type that would say no,"" Stern said.""I don't want to hurt their feelings,"" Trump replied.Co-host Robin Quivers then asked Trump if sleeping with the contestants could be construed as a conflict of interest. ""It could be a conflict of interest,"" Trump said. ""But, you know, it's the kind of thing you worry about later, you tend to think about the conflict a little bit later on.""Stern then put on a fake foreign accent, saying that ""some of these foreign girls"" say hello ""with vagina.""""Well, what you could also say is that, as the owner of the pageant, it's your obligation to do that,"" Trump said, before discussing how he got away with going backstage when the contestants were naked. ""Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I'll go backstage and everyone's getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it,"" Trump said. ""You know, I'm inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good.""""You know, the dresses. 'Is everyone okay?' You know, they're standing there with no clothes. 'Is everybody okay?' And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I've been very good,"" he added.Later in the episode, Stern asks Trump to assure his audience that ""the chicks will be almost naked"" at his pageant, saying to Trump that before he bought the contest, ""they were starting to take women who were educated over women who were hot.""""They had a person who was extremely proud that a number of the women had become doctors,"" Trump explained. ""And I wasn't interested.""He continued, ""I actually went on the 'Today Show' with Katie Couric a while ago, six years ago, and we had a woman running the pageant who was really into the whole thing of education and everything and I said, 'Look, if you're looking for a rocket scientist, don't turn in tonight. But if you're looking for a really beautiful woman, you should watch.'""Stern approved of Trump's approach, saying, ""I'd rather have a retarded hot woman than a slob who's a doctor.""In a July 2008 appearance, Trump said he got a case of the ""the shakes,"" when it was said Miss Universe would be held in Vietnam.""The contest of all places was in Vietnam, which was very nice, I got a case of the shakes,"" Trump said. ""It was in Vietnam. Vietnam's a hot country. But, you know, when I was going to high school, when I was going to college Vietnam was like the big deal. Like you have to leave college and go fight --. And I said, 'excuse me?' Now I'm going to Vietnam for a beauty pageant.""On Paula JonesIn a 2002 episode, Trump discussed the celebrity boxing match of Paula Jones, who in the 1990s accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment.""It was interesting. That Paula Jones fight, she was not very talented. That was pretty pathetic,"" Trump said. ""It's funny because Paula Jones would get hit, she'd run,"" Robin Quivers said. ""She would run, it's too bad she didn't run like that from Bill (Clinton),"" Trump replied. On infidelity In a 1993 interview, Trump and Stern engaged in a conversation about fidelity in marriage, with Stern relaying how Trump was shocked when he told him that he doesn't cheat on his wife.""Donald asked me during the commercials — and I don't think you mind me saying it — he says to me, 'so you don't get it on with anybody?,"" Stern says. ""I said 'I'm really faithful to my wife' and he goes 'you're kidding? Really? What's that all about?'""I can say to Howard's wife, that's true,"" Trump responds. ""He did say that to me. It's great."" Trump adds, ""I was actually faithful to my wife for many years, until I realized the marriage wasn't gonna work.""Later in the interview, Trump complained about his ex-wife Ivana's accent  ""The funny thing about Ivana is the accent got worse as she grew older, and some people said she wanted it to happen. The accent actually became more pronounced as years went by,"" Trump said. ""It was like the Chinese torture. You know, the water drops on your head,"" Trump said.
