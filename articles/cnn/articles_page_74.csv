""I've never seen an election where it's so polarizing,"" said Cassandra Johnson. ""That's very frustrating to me.""Cassandra Johnson is African-American and lives in Durham, just two and a half hours from Charlotte. ""I think it's in the back of people's mind. Charlotte's so close and you wouldn't think something like Charlotte would happen,"" said Johnston. ""You just see kind of the potential that maybe it could happen here.""Community-police relations have been a topic at the presidential debates. Hillary Clinton wants legislation that will end racial profiling by law enforcement. Donald Trump wants to bring back stop-and-frisk, which he says brought down New York City's crime rate in the 1990s. Undecided voter Lee Edsall, who is also from Durham, said this very topic has her questioning her choices for president. ""This is the first time I've had trouble deciding,"" she said. ""The job is just way too important. It literally could be the end of the world if you get somebody who's likely to fire off nuclear weapons at 3 in the morning."" Johnson and Edsall are frustrated with their options for president. They're also frustrated with police community relations in their state. They decided to seek answers with the Durham Police Department and signed up for the Citizens Police Academy. It's a once a year, six-week program where residents meet with various departments from the Durham police.According to the Durham police, this year they had the most applications for the program to date. Residents had candid conversations with officers about race and bias and participated in a shooting simulation where residents got to experience the split-second decisions officer have to make. ""I can understand why people can make the wrong decision in some cases,"" said Johnson after she watched her colleagues go through the simulation. ""Not because it's with malicious intent, but because it's a split decision.""Part of the program is designed to let officers take a pulse on the community. They need residents to be on their side in order to help keep their communities safe. ""I would think that folks in the community may not fully trust police officers,"" said Officer Laurence Brown, who runs the program. ""It's our job to meet them more than halfway."" Johnson and Edsall know their vote is more valuable than ever, which is why they're weighing their options heavily. ""I can't get past the things he said about women or African-Americans,"" Johnson said of Trump. ""But there are pieces of his platform that I like. I just wish that someone else was saying them.""She also has hesitation about Clinton. ""Her untruthfulness about the emails, Benghazi, I just don't feel she's as honest,"" she said."

He gets calls from CBP daily about suspicious activity on his ranch. It turns out this evening's call was nothing to worry about. But some of the calls have been more serious, even deadly. ""It was in the mid-morning. Our friend Rob Krentz was driving around in his ATV, checking water on his ranch when he happened upon two illegals,"" recalled Ladd. ""One acted like he was hurt when he saw Rob coming. Rob drove up on the guy, and the guy stood up and killed him and then shot his dog.""According to Customs and Border Protection, Krentz's death came at the height of violence at the border. In 2010, there were 421 assaults on border agents in the Tucson sector near Krentz's ranch. Since then, assaults have dropped to 87 in 2015.Immigration could be the most divisive issue in this election for the candidates. Ladd and his fellow ranchers, who live just feet from the border, are voting for Donald Trump.""Political correctness has killed our country,"" said Ladd. ""What appeals to me with Trump and most everything he said is he's dealing with reality."" About 10 years ago, the federal government built the fence on his land to divide the two countries. In recent years, these ranchers have noticed a change in the types of people coming across. ""It's drug smugglers,"" Ladd said as he stood just feet from the border fence. ""That's the danger right now that we're facing.""John and his wife, JoBeth, say they've given dozen of tours to politicians on their ranch, pleading with them for help, but always coming up empty-handed. Fellow ranchers Fred and Peggy Davis live 25 miles up the road on their own ranch and deal with many of the same issues -- they're looking to Trump to fix them. ""It was refreshing to me to finally have somebody step up and have the nerve to say 'We've got to stop this,'"" said Peggy Davis.Trump's strong messaging has resonated with ranchers in the area, but they say a Trump wall isn't enough. ""There's nothing wrong with the wall,"" said Fred Davis. ""It's fine. It makes it harder. But a wall alone is nothing.""Ladd isn't banking on seeing a wall go up in his backyard anytime soon. ""I don't think he's physically going to build a wall,"" he said. ""He's going to build a wall through political relations, which I agree with that.""For the first time in decades, Arizona is in a dead heat in this election. In some polling, Hillary Clinton has pulled ahead in this traditionally red state. It could turn blue for the first time since her husband took office. But a Hillary Clinton presidency scares many border residents. ""When people hear amnesty, we get a flood, another flood of people coming across,"" said Peggy Davis. ""Those people who have come through us for the past 20 years came through us, but came to live with you.""""They tore up our ranchers and our livelihood and put our lives at risk.

He told the President that despite his illness, he had been turned down four times for Social Security benefits and he asked Obama for help. ""Is there anything you can do?"" Crockett pleaded.Obama promised to look into it. Then, in a moment that would overshadow much of the media coverage of his trip, Obama broke into song, crooning, ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett.""""Y'all remember that TV show?"" he said. Most of the stories written about the encounter focused on how the President sang a funny song to a man with a famous name, but Crockett's plight was largely forgotten. At the time, Crockett was struggling with little hope in sight. His father had recently died. He was unable to work due to the illness and he had lost his family's land and childhood home due to foreclosure, forcing him to live in a horse trailer owned by a family friend. More than a year later, CNN returned to Bulls Gap, a small, picturesque town surrounded by rolling green hills and farmland in the northeast corner of this deep red Tennessee. ""I didn't think Obama would help me,"" Crockett, who claims to have ancestral ties with the famous 19th century congressman, said. ""He's the President of the United States."" Two weeks after his meeting with Obama, Crockett said, he received a letter from the Social Security Administration. After months of of being turned down for benefits, his requests had finally been approved. Obama had come through. Crockett, who walks with the help of a cane and continues to fight the increasing symptoms of his disease, has moved out of the horse trailer and into an apartment in nearby Greeneville. He occasionally works with a day program for people with disabilities, which has helped keep him busy since he left his job in a factory building bombs for the military. For the past year, he has followed the presidential race closely. But politically, Crockett, whose county overwhelmingly supported Mitt Romney over Obama in 2012, is in the minority. He plans to support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. As a man with a disability, Crockett took notice last November when Republican nominee Donald Trump appeared to mock a journalist at a rally who suffers from a bone disease the restricts the use of his joints. The video of Trump's theatrical mimicking of the reporter, which a pro-Clinton super PAC used in an ad this year, infuriated Crockett. ""I was mad,"" Crockett said. ""Donald makes fun of people that have the stuff like I have, I said to myself, I said, 'I don't want to vote for this man and I said I hope Hillary gets it.'""Crockett said that even though he was able to meet one president, he probably won't have another chance in the future. But if he met Trump, he said, the meeting probably wouldn't be as cordial.  ""If I got to meet Donald Trump I would say, what makes you think that you should deserve to be president? I'd say, I have MS, and you're going to make fun of people that have a disease and sickness? What in the world is wrong with you?"""	Davy Crockett to Donald Trump: 'What in the world is wrong with you?'

And because Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton appears to have the state's densely populated urban areas like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia locked in her favor, Trump needs Pennsylvania's rural areas and smaller, working-class cities like Scranton to come out on top. The problem? Republicans are outnumbered by registered Democrats by almost a million votes. ""The joke around here is that if you vote Republican on Tuesday, you've got to go to confession on Saturday,"" said Vince Galko, a veteran Republican strategist in Pennsylvania who has worked on former President George W. Bush's re-election effort here. ""Voters in this part of the state have been trained over the years to pull that straight Democratic lever, so it's a challenge for Republicans to get people to split their ticket."" The registration gap, however, has shrunk this election season. About 100,000 Democrats have switched their party identification to Republican, according the Pennsylvania Department of State, outnumbering the nearly 40,000 Republicans who became Democrats. Trump's campaign has made a concerted effort to make inroads among working-class Democrats here, a voting group he'll need to win the state. Trump's ""America First"" message is resonating with longtime Democrats like Debbie Merrigan, a server at the Bucktown Diner in nearby Dunmore who switched her party identification during the last election cycle. Merrigan said she believes immigrants are receiving special treatment from the government at the expense of natural-born Americans, and worries about the influx of refugees fleeing war-torn Syria. ""I've always been Democrat. I switched,"" said Merrigan. ""I'm all for Trump. You've got people coming over. ISIS. It's scary, and you don't know when it's going to happen. With Trump, he can actually do something to stop it and hopefully build a better life for us Americans."" Trump and his vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have made several trips to the area, but it might not be enough to tip the scales here. Polls have consistently shown Clinton leading in the state, and a Bloomberg Poll taken in October found Clinton leading in Philadelphia's four suburban counties by 28 percentage points. ""The real issue is intensity versus registration. Can Donald Trump's intensity overtake the Democrats registration?"" said Galko. ""He can't match the Democrats registration, but he's hoping Democrats can't match his intensity."""	Why this ex-con trucker set up a campaign office for Donald Trump

""They are not fixing the neighborhood back up. People are moving out, and you have a lot of vacant houses.""Al James looks back on his childhood fondly, but admits times have changed. He's looking for a presidential candidate that will bring it back to its better years. ""I am going to vote for Hillary,"" James said. ""She has education on her mind for helping the youth, and what she's trying to propose, that will help the country."" JVL is a predominantly black neighborhood with sections of low-income housing. In just the last year vacancies are up 22% in the area, according to real estate data firm, ATTOM Data Solutions.It's just a 20-minute drive from Ferguson where two years ago people rioted in the streets against police after the death of Michael Brown. Those riots created racial tension and divided parts of the city.""When I was growing, most of the cops were friends,"" recalled James. ""It wasn't until we got to high school that it all started to change. I know they're not from here. Most of the cops that patrol this area now are white cops.""James remembers his days spent at the Gamble Community Center where he'd play from morning until night.""Growing up here families looked out for each other,"" said James standing in front the community center. ""If I was down here and something happened to me before I get back down to my house, my grandmother already knew about it. Now it's every man for themselves. Every family for themselves.""James admits there are some things Clinton has done that he doesn't agree with. But what's most important is a candidate that could handle another situation like Ferguson.""Donald's not the type of person because if the blacks are out and they are upset he will be ready to say, 'Lets send the Marines in there. Let's take them all out,'"" James said.James lives just five minutes from his childhood home. He hopes his vote for Clinton helps turn the ""just vacant lots"" into booming businesses again.""I love my community and my neighborhood,"" he said. ""What's left of it.""Separated from St. Louis by the Missouri River, the town of St. Charles, Missouri, where Drew Burke spent his childhood, feels a world away from James' neighborhood. With freshly manicured lawns dot the tree-lined streets near Francis Howell North High School, where Burke went to school. ""It's a whitewashed area. Not a lot of diversity,"" Burke said as he drove the streets near his childhood home. ""If there were a dozen [students of color] in my graduating class, I would be surprised.""While parts of St. Louis rioted in the aftermath of the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Burke and his neighbors were largely insulated from the turmoil. The Missouri River, he said, can act as a dividing barrier between the two communities. ""There is perception among some residents in this county that there is a very different culture on the other side of the river,"" he said.Doing business in the St. Louis area, Berke has had few interactions with police whenever he travels around town for his job. But James described an entirely different experience on a day to day basis. He avoids neighborhoods like Burke's. ""I hardly ever go to his side of town. For the most I don't go out there because I get profiled,"" James said. ""I'm going to get pulled over. So I just choose not to go out there. I stay away from it. I will go 30 minutes out of my way just so i don't have to go through a certain municipality.""Carefully planning a route just to avoid certain areas because of police is not something that Burke -- and many other white Americans -- have ever had to even consider. Burke said that in some cases, he feels like he gets a pass. ""There are certain neighborhoods in St. Louis where if I rolled a stop sign and the cops saw that I was white in a predominantly black neighborhood, they would not pull me over,"" he said.  On the road together, Burke and James have had a lot of time to talk. They trade stories about St. Louis, the neighborhoods where they grew up and where they still live today. And of course, they discuss the presidential election. They both see the election is divisive, but hope for the best after November.   ""What would make this country great in my eyes,"" said James, ""is just everybody getting along."""	In St. Louis, race still divides
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/politics/critical-counties-el-paso-colorado/index.html	For months now, polls have indicated the swing state of Colorado will remain blue. Hillary Clinton's ground game there has been said to outperform Donald Trump's by several measures. As votes come in, the Democrats appear to have gotten the edge.But there's one patch of ground the Trump campaign has not conceded: El Paso County, Colorado. This reliably Republican territory has seen a fair bit of attention, and it is clearly where the Trump campaign has tried to take a stand.This county's population is white relative to the rest of the state, and it pulled strongly in favor of Republican nominee Mitt Romney over President Barack Obama in 2012. In a state whose politics have been overshadowed somewhat by legal pot, the people of El Paso County have so far elected not to join in.But Trump's controversial candidacy could make room for third-party insurgency dragging down his numbers, move some would-be Republican voters toward Clinton and drive others not to mail in their ballots.El Paso County could prove to be a strong indicator of whether Trump can overcome his many obstacles to deliver on a cut-and-dry Republican opportunity in a swing state.Of course, there is one more thing to keep in mind. This election has seen far more talk than usual about nuclear weapons, and El Paso, home to NORAD, has nukes on the brain. Search data from Google shows El Paso is 80% more interested in the Iran deal than the US on average. Trump criticizes the Iran deal almost every day, while Clinton has made a point of saying she is afraid of Trump's finger on the nuclear button.PopulationEconomyRoutine visitsRepresentationPopularityTop searchesWho's searching?TrendingSearches by candidate	Critical counties: El Paso County, Colorado, a red spot in a bluing state

She immigrated to the United States 16 years ago as a single mom with two young children. She came with ""no papers,"" she said, and couldn't speak English.""The only thing I (had) was a big bag of dreams,"" she said.Cardona's journey has been a battle. She worked hard to learn English, found a job as a high school counselor and survived stage four cancer. She became a US citizen two years ago. She wants a candidate that fights for her and her family. She says that's why she voted for Hillary Clinton.Donald Trump says he will dramatically ramp up donations in final stretch of campaignEntrepreneur Irma Aguirre feels passionate about this year's election as well.Aguirre's baby is her restaurant.  This third generation American with Mexican heritage, owns El Sombrero Mexican Bistro on Main St. in Las Vegas.""This is a celebration of my heritage. It's a celebration of our culture, our cuisine, our people. It's our contribution to the American economy,"" she said, over a bowl of homemade salsa and tortilla chips.She beams with pride of her accomplishments, her culture and her country, but worries about where things are headed.""I think we are going down the wrong path,"" she said.Her desire for change is driving her support for Donald Trump.They're on different sides of the political divide but both Aguirre and Cardona are part of the powerful Latino electorate in the key battleground state of Nevada, a group that makes up nearly 20% of all voters in the state.Campaign strategyBoth campaigns are targeting this voting bloc.  ""We've been engaging the Hispanic community on a near daily basis. We have daily calls with community leaders, calls and meetings with evangelical leaders, pastors, local chamber folks... for over a year now here,"" said Charles Munoz, Trump's Nevada state director.Similarly, Clinton's camp has been working on Hispanic outreach with door knocks, phone calls, and Spanish language television ads.  ""Making sure that Latinos turn out in high rates is a strategic priority for us,"" said Jorge Neri, who heads the Clinton operation in the state.Nationwide, this year's election could see a possible record number of Hispanic voters with 27.3 million eligible to cast ballots. That's an increase of 4 million since 2012, according to the Pew Research Center.Early voting numbers show Clinton's strength in Arizona, other battlegroundsPlus, in at least four battlegrounds, including Nevada, Florida, Arizona and Colorado, the share of the Latino vote four years ago was larger than the 10% share nationwide.Impact of Trump's rhetoric?It's exactly why Trump's statements like, ""we have some bad hombres here and we're gonna get them out,"" at the final presidential debate have GOP pollster Whit Ayers shaking his head.""He started off his campaign with his announcement calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. He has run against non-whites his entire campaign, not only against Latinos, but against Muslims and against anybody who wasn't already a part of the Republican base. That's no way to win a presidential election,"" Ayers said.He believes Trump would need to win ""somewhere north of 40% among Hispanics"" to be competitive this year.""George W. Bush got 44% of the Hispanic vote in 2004, which is one of the reasons why he was re-elected,"" Ayers said. ""But Mitt Romney only got 27% of Hispanic vote in 2012, which is one reason why he lost."" Trump has 2-point edge in new Florida pollHe points to his party's so-called autopsy of what went wrong in 2012. The Republican National Committee wrote in its post-mortem report: ""If Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States (i.e. self-deportation), they will not pay attention to our next sentence.""Cardona cites Trump's rhetoric as part of her motivation to vote for Clinton.""In the way he (says) in interviews something wrong about Latinos, something wrong about Mexicans, something wrong, in general, about women is disrespectful. Totally disrespects me,"" Cardona said.While Aguirre doesn't condone Trump's rhetoric, she countered, ""those aren't the things that I'm focused on. I'm focused on someone that I know is a do-er, someone that, like myself, has a dream, has a vision, and brings it to a reality by working super, super hard.""Getting Latinos to the pollsWorking hard to get Latino voters to the polls, Mi Familia Vota, a non-partisan organization that operates in 6 different states.The organization has knocked on more that 50,000 doors in Clark County, Nevada, alone and registered more than 16,000 new voters this year.Trump's path to 270 runs through ... Maine?""We do have a lot of power and I feel like a lot of Latinos don't realize that,"" said 25-year-old Christian Sierra, in between door-knocks in the rain.Sierra, a first-time voter himself, is a military veteran born in Puerto Rico. His devotion to his country and his culture is why he started volunteering with Mi Familia Vota. He's now paid staff.""We kind of what to cement that culture of being politically involved,"" he said.Sierra is doing his part to make sure Latinos have an impact on the future of their country, no matter which candidate they support."
