Trump indicated he's ""fine"" with the high court's opinion legalizing same-sex marriage and called it ""settled,"" but committed to appointing justices who want to change the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling affirming abortion rights. Who will Trump pick for the Supreme Court?The inconsistency in the question -- what is settled law? --  is sure to concern judicial conservatives who fear he may not live up to his promise to fill the empty Supreme Court seat with someone in the mold of their hero, Justice Antonin Scalia. Above all else, judicial conservatives hope that Trump's eventual nominees to the Court will apply the Constitution as they believe it is written and enforce the limits on government power. They see both the 2015 same-sex marriage ruling -- Obergefell v. Hodges -- and Roe v. Wade as total failures in that regard. The fact that Trump interprets the cases differently might be some cause of concern. ""Conservative legal scholars have long criticized Roe v. Wade for many of the same reasons that they've criticized the gay marriage decision. It's not at all clear what interpretation of the Constitution leads to the marriage decision, but not a woman's right to choose,"" said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law and a CNN contributor. Supreme Court justices build off of precedent, and are often wary of overturning prior decisions in order to seek stability and continuity in the law. It's a legal principle called ""stare decisis,"" which roughly translates into ""to stand by things decided."" But those reversals do occur. Of all the justices on the court, Justice Clarence Thomas gives the least deference to stare decisis. On the one hand, Trump told Leslie Stahl during an interview aired Sunday on ""60 Minutes,"" the issue of marriage equality, ""was already settled."" ""You have these cases that have already gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled, and I'm fine with that,"" Trump said. But on abortion, he thought differently. When Stahl pushed him on the topic, rather than saying the 43-year-old Roe v Wade ruling is ""settled,"" Trump said that the justice or justices he appoints to the bench will be ""pro life,"" leaving open the possibility it could be overturned. He said that if the decision is overturned, the issue will be returned to the states.""Then some women won't be able to get an abortion,"" Stahl pressed. ""Yeah. Well perhaps they have to go to another state,"" Trump responded. Trump -- with the help of conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society -- has put forward a list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees. Many of the judges on that list might not see a difference between the Roe decision and Obergefell. On abortion, it's not so much about being ""pro life"" as it is about interpreting the Constitution with an originalist's approach. Judicial conservatives, like Thomas and Scalia, reject the core holding in Roe that there is a right to privacy in the Constitution that would protect a woman's right to abortion. And on the issue of gay marriage, they reject the notion that the Constitution limits the ability of states to restrict same-sex marriage. Scalia himself wrote a scathing dissent in Obergefell case. ""Today's decree says that my Ruler and the Rule of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court,"" he wrote. ""This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves,"" Scalia added. Josh Blackman an associate professor of Law at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said that Trump's remarks are not entirely clear but could be understood to suggest that even though Roe v. Wade was decided years ago, it is still quite contested. ""By contrast, Obergefell -- as it relates to same-sex marriage -- has largely been accepted as settled,"" he said, noting the exception of Kim Davis and other clerks who have refused to issue marriage certificates.  That means that while same-sex marriage itself might not be coming back to the Supreme Court any time soon, restrictions to abortion, meant to narrow Roe, could very well return to the court sooner rather than later."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/backlash-steve-bannon-donald-trump/index.html	"The announcement Sunday that Trump campaign CEO and ""alt-right"" media chief Steve Bannon would serve as chief strategist and senior counsel to the new President set off alarm bells among civil rights and anti-extremist groups, who are now calling on Trump to withdraw Bannon's appointment.Bannon and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus had emerged as the finalists for the chief of staff position, considered one of the most powerful in any White House. The job ultimately went to Priebus, a decision that some initially took as an indication Trump planned to govern more moderately than he had campaigned. But Bannon's twin role quickly undermined that narrative -- and set off a groundswell of outside pressure.""Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,"" Trump said in a Sunday afternoon press release. ""Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.""But by the early evening, the backlash had begun to grow. Here is a running tab of the groups lining up to oppose Bannon.The Southern Poverty Law Center ""What this signals is Donald Trump bringing hatred of immigrants and Muslims, and misogyny directly into the White House,"" Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center told CNN on Monday. ""It is a disaster.""In a broader attack Sunday, SPLC President Richard Cohen underlined Bannon's close ties to the ""alt-right,"" a loose association of right-wing trolls and white nationalists who operate mostly online and have proliferated on Twitter, where they routinely harass women and minorities.""In his victory speech, Trump pledged to be the president for 'all Americans' and to 'bind the wounds of division' in our country, "" Cohen said. ""Appointing someone like Bannon, who will have the president-elect's ear every single day, makes a mockery of that pledge.""The Anti-Defamation League and J Street The Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tweeted a statement saying it was ""a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the 'alt right' -- a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists -- is slated to be a senior staff member in the 'people's house.'""J Street, a progressive pro-Israel group, also called on Trump to ""rescind this appointment immediately.""The decision, they said in a statement, ""gives the many groups that Bannon and Breitbart have targeted -- from women to Muslims, from Latino immigrants to African-Americans, from LGBT people to conservative Republican Jews who oppose the 'alt-right' -- legitimate reason to fear that their rights may be threatened by a Trump administration.""The Council on American-Islamic Relations The Council on American-Islamic Relations also asked that Trump reject Bannon, calling his elevation to a powerful White House role a ""disturbing message that anti-Muslim conspiracy theories and White nationalist ideology will be welcome in the White House.""""We urge President-elect Trump to reconsider this ill-advised appointment if he truly seeks to unite Americans,"" said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad. People For the American Way As the tensions escalated Monday, People For the American Way President Michael Keegan joined the chorus contesting Bannon's new role, and called on the Capitol Hill GOP to join.""Congressional Republicans need to stand up and call out Trump for choosing Bannon as a senior adviser and 'equal partner' to Trump's chief of staff,"" he said. ""This isn't about partisan politics; no one with Bannon's record should be anywhere near the White House.""IfNotNow and other liberal organizers and activistsWhile the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, would not weigh in, citing ""a long-standing policy of not taking positions on presidential appointments,"" smaller Jewish groups registered their concern.""The Bannon appointment is a signal to the Jewish community that we are not safe in a Trump administration,"" Yonah Lieberman, an organizer with IfNotNow told CNN. ""This is a clear sign that they will not be friendly toward to the Jewish community and a direct threat to our allies, including Muslims and people of color.""AllOfUs, another progressive millennial activist group, also weighed in.""Steve Bannon is an anti-Semite and out fascist, and his appointment to one of the most powerful positions in the White House is an incredibly dangerous indication of where is our democracy headed,"" organizer Max Berger told CNN. ""Trump has made various extreme statements during the campaign and his appointment of a white supremacist nationalist to be his chief strategist is an indication of just how extreme he would be as president.""Rebecca Katz, a former top aide to Reid and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, said Trump's pick was a ""horrendous error in judgment,"" but also further evidence of a lowered standard for this president-elect. ""Donald Trump has a white nationalist who will be just steps away from the Oval Office,"" she told CNN. ""And no one is asking him to apologize because no one expects him to.""Congressional DemocratsThe office of Minority Leader Harry Reid, the outgoing Nevada Senator, said Trump's choice of Bannon to serve as a co-equal to Priebus indicated that ""White Supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House.""Top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi echoed Reid, saying in a statement that the hire was a sign that Trump had no plans to divert from the ""hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign.""""There must be no sugarcoating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump administration,"" she said. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, also called on Trump to pull back Bannon's appointment.""After running a campaign built on inciting divisions and hate, Donald Trump has claimed he wants to unite America,"" he said in a statement. ""Yet he has done nothing meaningful to stop the wave of hate crimes and hate speech he has unleashed, and now has brought that strategy right into the Oval Office.""Later Monday, Sen. Ron Wyden, another Oregon Democrat, tweeted his opposition""Steve Bannon ran a website that trafficked in anti-Semitism & misogyny,"" Wyden wrote. ""He is an unacceptable choice to advise a U.S. president.""Democrats also got a boost from an independent who ran for their presidential nomination and has emerged as one of the party's most vocal leaders. Sen. Bernie Sanders warned on Monday that Bannon's appointment ""should make us very nervous."" ""We're going to tell him and Trump that we will stand together and not be divided up,"" Sanders tweeted.The Trump campaign respondsOn Monday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway responded to the criticism in comments to the press at Trump Tower in New York City.""(Bannon) has got a Harvard business degree. He's a Naval officer. He has success in entertainment. I don't know if you're aware of that. And he certainly was a Goldman Sachs managing partner,"" Conway said, seeming to echo another Trump ally, Newt Gingrich, who on Sunday argued that Bannon could not be anti-Semitic because he worked in Hollywood and with Goldman Sachs.Asked if she was concerned by his work with the alt-right, Conway said, ""I'm personally offended that you think I would manage a campaign where that would be one of the going philosophies. It was not.""""It is easy to see why the KKK views Trump as their champion when Trump appoints one of the foremost peddlers of White Supremacist themes and rhetoric as his top aide,"" Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said in a statement that included links to stories published on Breitbart News, the media empire Bannon presided over before taking leave to join the Trump campaign as its CEO in August.Among the headlines: ""Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy"" and ""Bill Kristol, Renegade Jew,"" a broadside against the conservative commentator and Weekly Standard editor, a Republican who refused to support Trump."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/donald-trump-congress/index.html	"But first, the old Congress and the old president must wrap up year-end business in a so-called ""lame duck session.""  The most important item is to avoid a government shutdown next month by negotiating a bill to fund federal agencies into next year when Donald Trump will be in the White House. Republicans and Democrats don't have a deal yet, but with the election results that had Republicans retain control of both chambers of Congress and win the White House, the GOP may feel they have leverage over wounded Democrats. Current funding runs out December 9. Leaders would like to pass a deal by then -- if not they would have to approve a short-term bill of a week or two to keep the government operating while they negotiate.  ""We have three more weeks to finish up this year's work,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday, complaining that Democrats had blocked spending bills to this point over a variety of issues.  ""So we now have to figure out how to do that.""McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan haven't said exactly how they would like to pass the remaining spending bills. One option would be to tie the bills together and pass them as one giant ""omnibus"" spending package or as a series of smaller bills. That would keep the government running through October 1, 2017, and would ensure that the carefully tailored spending measures for each of the government agencies is in place. But many conservatives hate the idea of passing one giant bill out of fear it's so big they can't reasonably know what's inside it. They prefer a shorter term ""continuing resolution"" that would fund the government at current levels into the spring so the Trump administration can put its stamp on government spending and reforms.  Over the next few weeks, lawmakers will be looking ahead too, readying for Trump to take the reins of power. Already members are discussing with Trump and his top aides how and when to repeal and replace Obamacare, what federal regulations should be cast aside when Trump is sworn-in, and how Trump can meet his campaign promises on immigration, border security, tax reform and other issues.  The session was expected to be far more consequential if Hillary Clinton was elected, but with the Republican set to take office in January, its already certain that two top priorities for President Barack Obama will die on the vine.  His nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court that Republicans refused to act on in an election year will expire at the end of the year. Trump has said he'll name a much more conservative justice instead. And the long-sought trade deal, the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Obama negotiated but that Trump campaigned against, is also dead for the year.  Paul Ryan facing easier-than-expected voteBefore digging into talks over the government funding bill, the first order of business for both parties will be to hold leadership elections to prep for the next Congress.Ryan, who didn't want the job just a year ago when former Speaker John Boehner stepped down, has clashed with both House conservatives and President-elect Trump in the last year. Key members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus declined to commit to backing him for another term in the lead up to the election. But after Trump's upset victory Ryan quickly pivoted to mend fences with the President-elect. Ryan praised him for his ability to tap into the mood of the American electorate, and hosted Trump and his former House colleague, Vice President-elect Mike Pence in his Capitol office and began planning their agenda. Trump also seemed to smooth things over by turning the page on their past squabbles, and focusing on items they could quickly do together. Ryan appears on track to gain another term as speaker when House Republicans huddle for a secret ballot vote on Tuesday afternoon.And when it comes to getting business done next year, Sunday's naming of a fellow Wisconsin Republican, Reince Priebus, as Trump's incoming chief-of-staff should also help Ryan.For congressional Democrats, Clinton's loss still stings. They also picked up far fewer House and Senate seats than expected on Tuesday night and face a new president who wants to undo virtually everything they put in place in the last eight years. House Democrats initially planned to vote on their leadership posts at the end of November, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced on Friday that the election is now scheduled for this Thursday.Even though grassroots Democratic groups around the country are calling for a shakeup, Pelosi and the bulk of her leadership team appear poised to remain in place.Chuck Schumer to succeed Harry Reid?In the Senate, the leadership elections are planned for Wednesday. McConnell, Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn of Texas and most of their top team are expected to stay in place.  On the Democratic side, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer is expected to be elected leader.  He replaces the tough-talking and hard-nosed Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada who has clashed with McConnell for years. McConnell has been complimentary of Schumer in recent days, indicating he thinks the two will be able to cut deals, something McConnell struggled to do with Reid. ""Schumer and I have talked. He's a smart, transactional person. I think we'll get along fine,"" he said.  There is the potential for some drama in the Democratic leadership elections if Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, already a member of leadership, decides to challenge Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois for his No. 2 post. Such a move could set off a bitter battle between the two and make for difficult decisions for their colleagues who would have to choose between the long-serving friends. Murray has not said what she will do but CNN reported last week she was making calls to other Democratic senators to gauge support for a possible challenge.Freshman orientation, Iran and Biden's cancer 'moonshot' Almost 60 new members of the House and Senate will attend freshman orientation sessions this week when they will learn tips about hiring staff, running a congressional office, and abiding by strict ethics rules.Notable freshman in the House include Charlie Crist, who was once a Republican governor of Florida, but will who arrive in Congress as a newly-elected Democrat representative from St. Petersburg. Also Lynn Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, takes the seat he once represented from Wyoming. In the Senate, the arrival of Kamala Harris, D-California, means there will be three African-American senators serving in the Senate at the same time for the first time in history. She joins Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey.  Congress is also expected to renew sanctions on Iran that are due to expire at the end of the year.The only major piece of legislation expected to pass during the post-election ""lame duck"" session is an important bill to boost funding for modern medicine.  The 21st Century Cures bill is backed by Republican on the Hill and the White House and is expected to become law.The bill includes funding for Vice President Joe Biden's cancer ""moonshot"" he has spearheaded in the wake of the recent death of his son to brain cancer.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/israel-right-trump-victory/index.html	"Now that he's the President-elect, Israel's right wing is thrilled and is calling on Trump to relocate the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as soon as he takes office.Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat commended Trump's position on Jerusalem and said the status of the city is not open for negotiation. ""The role of the city of Jerusalem will never change,"" Barkat said the day after the elections. ""It has to be under the sovereignty of the Jewish people. It has to play an inclusive role. It can never function as a divided city."" Other right-wing politicians joined Barkat in calling on Trump to fulfill his campaign promise.It is an often repeated -- and never fulfilled -- promise made by both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 requires the US government to move the embassy to Jerusalem, but the move has been waived every six months since the law was passed. Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama all declined to relocate the embassy after being elected, citing national security.MORE: What Trump told '60 Minutes'Jerusalem: The most difficult questionRiyad Mansour, the Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations, told a conference in Washington, DC on Friday: ""If [the US administration moves the embassy to Jerusalem], nobody should blame us for unleashing all of the weapons that we have in the UN to defend ourselves, and we have a lot of weapons in the UN.""Jerusalem has always been the most difficult question in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even after the world recognized the State of Israel in 1948, it left the final status of Jerusalem open to future negotiations. Israelis see Jerusalem as their united capital; Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.Biden: Trump administration will stand with IsraelEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, said Trump's election allows Israel to fully dismiss the notion of a Palestinian state. ""This is the position of the President-elect, as written in his platform, and it should be our policy, plain and simple. The era of a Palestinian state is over.""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments to the President-elect were much more measured -- he didn't mention Jerusalem or the embassy. ""President-elect Donald Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel, and I look forward to working with him to advance security, stability, and peace in our region.""As the final results of the election were coming in, US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro lauded the Iran nuclear deal -- vigorously opposed in Israel -- and urged Trump's administration to stick with decades of US policy. But when asked what would become of the embassy, Shapiro said, ""Every government, every US administration has looked at that question, has determined that the embassy is where it should be,"" Shapiro said. ""And I can't speculate beyond that.""Palestinians: We'll work with any presidentPalestinian leaders were much more reserved in their comments about Trump's victory. Presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said that the Palestinians were ready to work ""with any president elected by the American people on the principle of achieving permanent peace in the Middle East based on the two-state solution"", with ""East Jerusalem as its capital."" PLO Secretary General Saeb Erekat said a two-state solution has been a priority for Republicans and Democrats.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement would be the ""ultimate deal"" and that he'd ""like to do ... the deal that can't be made. And do it for humanity's sake.""But if Trump recognizes Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel, it would dash the Palestinian goal of a capital in East Jerusalem, making a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians even more remote. It would also ratchet up tensions between the US and Arab countries that want to see a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.US: Israel broke its word on new settlements Will Trump actually fulfill his promises?Palestinian political analyst Mahdi Abdul Hadi doubts that Trump will fulfill his campaign promise. He believes the President-elect will do what his predecessors have done for more than 20 years -- waive the embassy relocation.""What's new?"" he asks. ""It's only rhetoric. It's only slogans, although it's very much symbolic to tell us, 'You Palestinians will not have a capital in Jerusalem.' Nobody can dismiss our presence in Jerusalem. We are deep-rooted here.""With Trump's advisers on Israel repeatedly promising to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Palestinian leaders will look in a different direction in the immediate future.Working with a group of Arab countries, the Palestinians have been drafting a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel's settlement activity in the West Bank. The last time they tried to pass such a resolution in 2011, President Obama vetoed it, making it the only time Obama exercised the US veto power at the Security Council. This time, they hope, the US would either vote in favor of a resolution condemning settlements or, perhaps, abstain.But the future, like so much in Jerusalem, suddenly seems uncertain."

Obama balked at sending US ground troops to fight there and emphasized need for a political solution to the carnage. He also held back from giving major support or significant weaponry to moderate Syrian rebels fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.""I recognize that that has not worked,"" Obama said at a White House news conference.""It is something that I continue to think about every day and we continue to try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end,"" Obama said.He was responding to a question about President-elect Donald Trump's recent suggestion that he would pull US support from the Syrian opposition, as well as campaign vows to gut, rework or void international agreements on climate change and Iran's nuclear program.""It becomes more difficult to undo something that's working than undo something that isn't working,"" Obama said, citing the success of the Iran pact and the accomplishment of getting almost 200 nations to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate change climate.The President also cited tradition. ""These international agreements, the tradition has been, you carry them forward across administrations,"" Obama said, ""particularly if you find they're good for us."" Obama was asked about Trump's vow to undo the Iran nuclear agreement finalized in July 2015 after negotiations between Iran, the US, Germany, the UK, France, Russia and China.Trump repeatedly bashed the Iran deal during the campaign, disparaging it as ""terrible"" and declaring in March at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that his ""No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.""Obama said that Trump would find it hard to do so, particularly because Iran has complied with the deal over its first year.Trump will also have to consider the impact on America's closest allies, Obama added.""For us to pull out would require us to start sanctioning those other countries that were still abiding by the deal because from their perspective they were still abiding"" by the deal, Obama said.  Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and a critic of the agreement, said Trump is ""likely to enforce the Iran deal but to treat any violation of the deal -- no matter how small -- as grounds to re-impose sanctions"" allowed under the pact."

""And that has resulted in what we have to deal with now.""Abdul-Jabbar's concerns echoed those recently brought by NAACP President Cornell William Brooks, who last week said on CNN the Voting Rights Act needs to be fixed. Parts of that law, passed during America's civil rights movement in 1965, were struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2013. ""I'm not doing anything to try to inhibit Mr. (Donald) Trump from governing -- that is his job now,"" Abdul-Jabbar said. ""I do hope that people who were disenfranchised in the process of the campaign get their voting rights back, because we will definitely have to have a reckoning on this.""Abdul-Jabbar has been an outspoken political advocate and backed Hillary Clinton during the election, and spoke at this year's Democratic National Convention.After Donald Trump's victory last Tuesday, the former NBA star penned a column for the Washington Post about what it means to be black during a Trump administration. While the country is ""supposed to come together after an election,"" Abdul-Jabbar wrote, ""it's difficult to link arms when the home of the free embraces the leadership of a racist.""In that column, Abdul-Jabbar also hammered what he called Trump's ""disconnect from black people and black culture.""""For African Americans, America just got a little more threatening, a little more claustrophobic, a lot less hopeful,"" he wrote. ""We feel like disposable extras, the nameless bodies who are never part of the main cast."" Race relations have also been at the forefront of Abdul-Jabbar's advocacy. In response to ongoing tensions between black communities and police, he tweeted this summer that both live in fear ""because they cannot see each other's humanity.""Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Abdul-Jabbar said he hopes the country can now turn its focus ""to understand and appreciate our fellow citizens and communicate with them in a way where we can solve problems."""

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/13/politics/ip-forecast-nov-13-secret-trump-support/index.html	"It's all a part of this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast, where you get tomorrow's news today. 1) Trump's silent army            Team Trump insisted throughout the campaign that their support was always underestimated because there were millions of voters who planned to vote for him but were reluctant to admit that if asked by a pollster or around the water cooler at work.            Was that true? Actually, yes -- at least to a degree.            A leading GOP polling firm, Public Opinion Strategies, asked this question of Trump voters in a post-election survey in California: ""During the campaign, were you sometimes reluctant to say you were supporting Donald Trump?""            Thirty-six percent of Trump supporters answered ""yes."" The percentage was even higher (42%) among California women who voted for Trump. 2)  A new White House volunteer?            Jared Kushner is Donald Trump's son-in-law and was among the most influential advisers to his presidential campaign.  So, of course the President-elect wants him involved in a Trump White House.            But ethics lawyers say there is a problem with giving Ivanka Trump's husband a White House job because of strict rules about what family members can and cannot do in a presidential administration.            Maggie Haberman of The New York Times characterized Kushner as a critical player at a critical time, and said Team Trump is trying to find a way to make it work.          ""His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is said to be looking at ways that he can be described as essentially a volunteer working in the administration. But there are prohibitions against what relatives of a president can do in terms of an actual job,"" Haberman said. ""But Jared Kushner is the person who co-ran Donald's campaign most of the time, through different iterations. He is the most important person who has the new incoming president's ear. That will continue to be the case, regardless of who holds the actual chief of staff title. ""3) A blind trust? Unlikely, but big business decisions looming            Trump has some big decisions to make about his business, and he will be under a microscope as he makes them.            There is no law forbidding a president from presiding over a family business while in office, but there are practical and ethical concerns that are now being considered by the Trump transition team and the President-elect.            Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg Politics led us through some of the issues Trump must settle, in a period where his many critics are looking for an opening to raise judgment or ethics issues.            ""Business leaders and Washington will be watching to see how transparent and thorough the Trump organization is in separating Donald Trump from his business holdings. A blind trust is likely not the answer because that would require him to liquidate all of his assets and that's just not going to happen,"" Jacobs said. ""But if all they do is just transfer the management to the three oldest kids, and not have some kind of independent manager, the conflict of interest are exactly the same."" 4) Dems up in 2018 could become Trump allies            The next election is always influenced by the election that just happened. So for that reason the new President might find some Democratic allies.            There are a handful of Democratic senators from red states on the 2018 ballot, and Trump's success in their states may encourage them to at least listen to the winner.                    CNN's Manu Raju noted some pushback from within the Democratic Party when the retiring Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, issued a scathing statement casting Trump's presidential win as a victory for the forces of hate and intolerance.            ""In states like Indiana, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia and Missouri they could form a bi-partisan coalition to  get closer to that 60-vote threshold to pass legislation and overcome a filibuster,"" Raju said. ""Of course, they also face challenges in their own re-elections in 2018. They could potentially lose, they could have a bigger Republican majority.""5) One 2016 lesson: rely on data less            The election results were a shock to anyone who studied the polls. Or to anyone who checked the political news sites that publish election predictions.            The Washington Post's Dan Balz said there is an important lesson here for journalists and others.             ""I think one of the lessons of this campaign is, the degree to which we all have come to rely on data, which turned out not to be specifically accurate,"" Balz said. ""Whether it was polling, predictive modeling, almost anything ... I think we have to re-examine a lot of the ways in which we go about doing the business of journalism."""

""So if that's going on, it's going on somewhere that I didn't see it,"" Giuliani said. However, he said, he wants to grow the military first -- going from 420,000 troops to 550,000, as well as 350 ships and 1,200 modern aircraft, with an increase in the Marines from 27 battalions to 36. ""He's going to negotiate for peace, but with strength -- not with a diminishing army,"" Giuliani said."	Rudy Giuliani: Donald Trump's camp hasn't talked with Russia	['Trump']	[]

He said after their meeting Thursday that he favors keeping the law's rules barring insurers from turning away those with pre-existing conditions, as well as its allowance that those up to age 26 can remain on their parents' insurance. House Speaker Paul Ryan echoed some of Trump's stances in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" ""Obamacare is failing. It must be replaced. We're going to do that. We're excited about it ... We can fix what is broken in health care without breaking what is working in health care,"" Ryan said.
