Republicans hold the state's governor's office, both of its US Senate seats and all four of its US House seats. The party holds 84% of the state's House of Representatives and 79% of the state Senate. Yet Donald Trump has a very real Utah problem. And it's largely because of one relatively unknown candidate: independent Evan McMullin. In a year where third-party candidates like Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein have made waves, it's McMullin -- a candidate who fell far short of even qualifying for the ballot in all 50 states -- who stands the best chance of having a quantifiable impact on the race. That's because McMullin, according to a raft of recent polling in the Utah, is surging in the state. ""People like to say that Utah is a Republican state or a deep red state. I say it's a principled conservative state,"" McMullin said in an interview Friday in his Salt Lake City campaign headquarters. McMullin's campaign is far from a powerhouse operation -- it's leanly staffed and leanly financed (it had less than $5,000 in the bank at the start of October, according to federal filings.) ""Our campaign is a three-month presidential campaign, which, let me be clear to everyone, is not ideal,"" McMullin, who launched his campaign in August, says with a knowing laugh. Yet driven largely by its digital operation and about $300,000 in small dollar donations, the Provo, Utah-born McMullin and his running mate, Mindy Finn, have been bobbing back and forth ahead, or within a couple of points, of Trump in the state. A deep red stateTo put a potential McMullin-Finn victory in perspective, it has been 48 years since a third-party candidate secured any electoral votes. It's been 52 years since Utah supported any nominee but the Republican Party's.For Trump, Utah's emergence as a potential GOP hole couldn't come at a worse time. Facing an exceedingly narrow path to victory as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her team continue to flip potential swing states into their column, the loss of the west state's six electoral votes is equal parts unthinkable and devastating. For their part, Trump's advisers don't appear publicly concerned about the state. There's been no rash deployment of resources, either in terms of field staff or television advertising, to try and cut down McMullin's rise. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump's running mate, stopped in the state in September, but otherwise big-name surrogates have been absent. McMullin's team says it hasn't identified any broad effort to undercut his support or credentials, short of the standard line that supporting anyone but Trump equals tacit support for a Clinton presidency. In other words, the Trump campaign is either confident that Utahns will revert to form, or supremely unaware of what both McMullin and Clinton campaign advisers say is happening on the ground in the state. McMullin's team points to the release of Trump's lewd ""Access Hollywood"" tape as the moment where gradual momentum turned into tangible numbers. The campaign saw digital engagement grow by 2,000% in the wake of the video. ""What they tell us,"" says Finn, a veteran GOP campaign hand and outspoken Trump critic from the start of his campaign, ""is you've been offering a glimmer of light in what has been a sea of darkness in this 2016 election."" Trump's troubles with MormonsThat message of ""principled alternative"" to Trump appeared to take on new meaning in a state where Trump already wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms. In fact, the root of Trump's problem in the state has been clear for much of the year: Mormon voters seem to want no part of his candidacy. In a state where Mormons make up more than 60% of the population, that's a big problem -- one exacerbated by top state officials, many sharing the faith, either outright rejecting Trump's candidacy or pulling their endorsements. That list includes the state's governor, Gary Herbert, who called Trump's hot mic video ""despicable""; former Gov. Jon Huntsman, who called on Trump to step aside; junior Sen. Mike Lee, long critical of Trump and even more so in the wake of the video; as well as one of the state's highest-profile congressmen, Jason Chaffetz, who pulled his endorsement of the GOP nominee.On top of all of that, in an unprecedented action, the editorial board of the Salt Lake City newspaper The Deseret News, which is owned by the Church of Latter-Day Saints, called on Trump ""to step down from his pursuit of the American presidency."" ""What oozes from this audio is evil,"" the editors wrote. For his part, McMullin downplays the role his faith plays in his rise. ""It's sort of like saying President Obama became president because he had the support of African-Americans,"" McMullin says. ""Every candidate has people who are like them in some way who may find it easier to understand who the candidate is and therefore maybe there's a heightened chance that they'll be supportive of that candidate. But the reality is that it's much more than that.""'Stand on principle'There's no question the tone of the race -- and the major party candidates -- appear to be driving people McMullin's way more so than his faith. A former CIA officer, Goldman Sachs banker and US House staffer, McMullin touts a strong resume and firmly conservative message as his major selling points.And while a handful of Utah state political officials have endorsed McMullin, the state's biggest, boldest names have not. But just as Obama wouldn't have won the White House without the overwhelming support of black voters, McMullin is the clear beneficiary of Mormon voters who can't come to grips with Trump has a candidate. Bemused is probably the best way to describe the Clinton campaign's view of the current state of play in Utah. They put more effort in here than traditional Democratic campaigns -- a campaign office was opened, a field staffer was deployed and Clinton officials have repeatedly made themselves available to local media. But they also acknowledge that there is a ceiling of sorts for a Democratic candidate statewide -- particularly one who holds the sky-high unfavorable ratings of Clinton. But their fight to gain ground in the state has helped create the unlikely dynamic that now exists.Driving through the neighborhoods in and around Salt Lake City with just over two weeks left until Election Day, pockets of political signs protrude in block after block, yard after yard. Blue and orange and green, big bold letters touting candidates for a variety of political offices. But while yard signs are the furthest thing from an indicator of a campaign's momentum, one office is conspicuously absent from virtually every yard: president of the United States. It's as if in this politically involved and attuned part of the country, the race isn't happening -- a not-so-subtle reminder that while there's enthusiasm for races across the state, apparently most feel neither party candidate is worthy of public support. That is exactly the kind of opening McMullin and his team have seized on -- and one that puts them in position to make a bit of history, even if that means contributing to the loss of the GOP nominee. ""We're saying even in that case, stand on principle, stand for what you know is right, stand for what kind of leadership you actually want to see in this country and lets build from there,"" McMullin says.

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/trump-religion-gospel/index.html	"Editor's note: This is the first of two stories on the religious beliefs of the presidential nominees. Read about the faith of Hillary Clinton here""I heard it in his voice,"" said White, a Florida pastor who, outside of Trump's family, is his closest spiritual confidant. ""He was embarrassed."" In the video from 2005, Trump admits to hitting on a married woman and boasts that he can wantonly kiss women and grope their genitals because he is a ""star."" During his phone call with White, the GOP nominee said he regretted his remarks and was grateful for the evangelicals still supporting him. Later that evening, he publicly apologized in a video that was remarkably free from the usual rituals enacted by disgraced politicians. Trump didn't stand beside his wife, Melania. He didn't ask for forgiveness. He didn't lament that he had fallen under sin's sway but that by God's grace and with his family's support he hoped to earn a second chance. In fact, Trump didn't mention faith, family or reconciliation at all.""If he suddenly came out all religious, that would seem staged to me,"" said White, who has known Trump for 14 years. ""Donald has never been public about his faith, and when he has tried, it has been futile. It's not his language, but that doesn't mean it's not his heart."" For much of the 2016 presidential campaign, religion has receded into the background, mainly because the two major party nominees -- Trump and Hillary Clinton --  rarely talk about their faith. Trump is a professed Presbyterian; Clinton a Methodist.  But two-thirds of Americans have said it's important for the president of the United States to have strong religious convictions, according to the Pew Research Center. And nearly 40% say discussion of religion has been lacking in this election cycle. Beyond the policy discussions and ad hominem attacks, it seems, Americans want to know where candidates' moral compasses point. Trump's attempts at public religion have been awkward, at best. He said he does not ask for forgiveness and ""does not bring God into that picture"" when he makes mistakes. He has tried to put money in the Communion plate and referred to the sacrament as ""my little wine"" and ""my little cracker."" He mispronounced a book of the Bible, and when asked about his favorite verse, has either deferred or, in one case, cited ""an eye for an eye,"" an Old Testament revenge scheme specifically condemned by Christ. (Turn the other cheek, Jesus said.) Trump tussled with the Pope and was shushed by a minister in Detroit. He often looks uneasy when pastors lay their hands on him and pray. He says he is proud of his evangelical support but not sure he deserves it.   When asked theological questions, Trump often speaks in terms so vague they approach opacity.Asked ""Who is God to you?"" by the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump answered ""God is the ultimate,""  then began a brief spiel about how he got a great deal on a golf course before circling back to his original definition. ""So nobody, no thing, no there's nothing like God.""  Trump's broad language often serves a purpose, says Michael D'Antonio, author of ""The Truth About Trump,"" a biography. ""Donald keeps his options open. He make things mysterious and unclear so that he can say anything else at another time."" Trump's supporters have a different explanation. Trump is a businessman, not a pastor. He doesn't have practiced answers about religious questions, nor should he be expected to, they say. But that doesn't mean he's irreligious. (Trump's campaign did not respond to several interview requests.) ""I think people are shocked when they find out that I am Christian, that I am a religious person,"" Trump writes in ""Great Again,"" a book published during the presidential campaign. ""They see me with all the surroundings of wealth, so they sometimes don't associate that with being religious. That's not accurate.""Positive thinking Trump's father, Fred Trump, embodied the Protestant work ethic to an extreme. The real estate developer took his children to construction sites, even on Sundays. Life is a competition between killers and losers, he taught them, and you had to be ruthless to survive. Mary Trump, Donald's mother, tried to instill traditional Christian values in her children, her son has said. She shooed them to Sunday school at First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens. Trump proudly displays his confirmation photo from the church, pulling it out to demonstrate his Christian bona fides.  In the mid-1960s, like many upper-middle class families, the Trumps, including teenaged Donald, became attracted to a popular preacher named Norman Vincent Peale. Peale was the pastor at Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, whose steeple has soared above 5th Avenue since the 1600s. Peale was far more famous, though, as the multimedia juggernaut who preached the ""power of positive thinking."" In his books and lectures, Peale married pop psychology with hopeful insights gleaned from the gospel. Sin and guilt were jettisoned in favor of ""spirit-lifters,"" ""energy-producing thoughts"" and ""7 simple steps"" to happy living. ""Attitudes are more important than facts,"" Peale said, and he exhorted his followers to bend the world to their will through mental exertion. ""Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding,"" Peale writes in ""The Power of Positive Thinking."" ""Hold this picture tenaciously. Never permit it to fade.""Published in 1952, Peale's ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" has sold millions of copies and spent 186 weeks atop The New York Times' bestseller list. The famous and affluent flocked to Marble Collegiate. ""It was a celebrity church, and its members, in those days, were generally wealthy New Yorkers of the Protestant executive class,"" said D'Antonio, the Trump biographer. ""It was a place to see and be seen."" It was also a place to buy Peale's many promotional materials. Long before entrepreneurial pastors like Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes marketed their sermons as spiritual self-help, Peale sold record albums and pamphlets with titles like ""How to Stop Being Tense"" and ""No More Gloomy Thoughts."" He was also an enthusiastic champion of the free market, writing columns such as, ""Let the Church Speak Up for Capitalism."" His parables were often about businessmen who had bulldozed their way to the top, not Samaritans who crossed the street to help a stranger.   The Rev. Michael Brown, senior minister of Marble Collegiate, said there were two Norman Vincent Peales: One was the motivational speaker who tried to reach all Americans. The other was a pastor who preached the redemptive message of Jesus.""Out there in civic centers he would say, over and over, 'You can, if you think you can,'"" Brown said. ""In the pulpit of our church he would quote Philippians 4, 'You can do all things through Christ.' "" But other Christians accused Peale of peddling jingles, not the gospel, worldly success instead of salvation, and simplistic solutions at a time of increasing complexity. ""He promises quick, painless, and complete 'solutions' to problems which may be deep and complex, and which may require real discipline and professional treatment,"" wrote religious studies professor and journalist William Lee Miller in 1955.  Nevertheless, Donald Trump loved Peale's preaching, especially his stories about businessmen surmounting obstacles. ""He would instill a very positive feeling about God that also made me feel positive about myself,"" Trump writes in ""Great Again."" ""I would literally leave that church feeling like I could listen to another three sermons."" Trump and Peale became close. Peale officiated at Trump's first marriage, to Ivana, and at the funeral services for his parents. ""He thought I was his greatest student of all time,"" Trump said. The businessman credited ""the power of positive thinking"" for helping him rebound in the 1990s, when his casinos were tanking and he owed creditors billions of dollars. ""I refused to be sucked into negative thinking on any level, even when the indications weren't great.""Trump's book titles evoke Peale's brand of pop psychology. There's ""Think Big,"" ""Think Like a Champion"" and ""Think Like a Billionaire."" In another book, ""Never Give Up,"" Trump gives an example of how he put the power of positive thinking into practice. Scouring the newspapers for real estate deals, he found a rundown property in Cincinnati, which he bought from the Federal Housing Administration. The complex had a reputation for ""rent runners,"" Trump writes, so he hired 24-hour patrols, spruced up the place and hired a ""politically incorrect"" project manager. When the surrounding area got ""rough,"" Trump sold the complex, reaping a $6 million profit. ""Creative, positive thinking can be a powerful source of success,"" he wrote. Preaching prosperitySome years ago, after services at her Florida megachurch, Paula White received a call from Donald Trump. At the time, White's star was rising. She co-pastored a Tampa megachurch with 25,000 members and hosted a show broadcast on Christian television. White says Trump told her he was a fan from afar and quoted three of her recent sermons back to her. He asked the pastor if she ever traveled to New York. In fact, she led a Bible study for players on the New York Yankees. The pastor and businessman met at Trump Tower and began what White calls a ""14-year conversation about God and love and a plethora of things."" White hesitates to reveal much about her relationship with Trump, citing the expectation of privacy between clergy and their congregants. She won't, for instance, say whether she ""led Trump to Christ,"" a claim made this summer by some evangelical activists. ""This is an ongoing walk in his life,"" White said. ""But he is a Christian, and he is born again.""For his part, Trump has called White ""a beautiful person both inside and out.""""She has a significant message to offer anyone who will tune in and pay attention. She has amazing insight and the ability to deliver that message clearly as well as powerfully.""In some ways, Trump's attraction to White seems unsurprising, said Kate Bowler, a historian at Duke Divinity School and author of ""Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel."" ""She's blonde and cute and perky and endlessly optimistic."" Like many prosperity gospel preachers, appearance is part of White's appeal. She favors form-fitting, fashionable attire, often stalking the stage in stiletto heels. In the many glamor shots on her social media accounts, she is perfectly coiffed and impeccably made up. Like Norman Vincent Peale, White preaches a message of boundless optimism and has a strong entrepreneurial streak. She encourages adherents to ""partner"" with her ministry for a monthly fee and sells DVDs of her sermons for $50 a pop. Such endeavors can be lucrative. According to an audit made public by a Senate committee investigating televangelists, White's former church, Without Walls International, took in $150 million between 2004-2006.  At one time, White and her then-husband owned an airplane and several multimillion dollar properties, including a condo in Trump Tower. In 2008, Trump appeared on her television show, where he said his secret of success was the work ethic instilled by his father. ""That's the principle I teach,"" White answered. ""Find your passion and figure out a way to make money.""  Like Trump, White has seen her share of personal and financial troubles. She has been married three times. (Her current husband is rocker Jonathan Cain, the keyboard player for Journey and a co-writer of the epic hit ""Don't Stop Believin'."")After White's divorce from her second husband in 2007, the church they led together faltered and plunged into bankruptcy. Still, White's sermons remain relentlessly upbeat. Though she rejects the prosperity gospel label, White preaches many of its central tenets on her show ""Paula Today"" and at her new megachurch in Orlando.  White believes the world abides by spiritual laws, Bowler said, one of which is called ""seed faith."" The idea: By pledging money to a minister, believers sow a seed, and God will reward them with a bountiful harvest, usually in the form of health and wealth. ""Every time we give, something supernatural happens,"" White says in one sermon. Other Christians call this heresy. Faith is not a spiritual investment that guarantees automatic returns, and there is no evidence, anyway, that God wants people to become millionaires. In fact, the gospel famously said it's hard for rich men to enter heaven.  Many of the Christians who have criticized White also question Trump's religious commitments. In his personal life, he has owned casinos, been married three times and boasted about extramarital affairs. During the presidential campaign, he has denigrated Muslims, Mexicans and women. Christianity Today, the flagship magazine for evangelicals, called Trump ""an idolater"" and ""the very embodiment of what the Bible calls a fool."" A Christian columnist said Trump's ""obsession"" with wealth and power ""embodies a Nietzschean morality rather than a Christian one."" The Pope himself said that anyone who talks about building walls instead of bridges ""is not Christian."" Even Richard Land, a member of Trump's evangelical advisory board, says the candidate he's backing may not be a Christian. ""When a person says that they have never felt the need to ask for forgiveness, they have defined themselves out of the Christian faith as I understand it,"" Land said. White says those criticisms miss the mark. Trump isn't perfect, but nobody is, and he is on the right path, she said. ""I have seen change in him over the 14 years I have known him. He is a growing Christian."" White also said she sees a side of Trump obscured from outsiders. ""I remember him calling me up one morning and saying, 'Paula, I know God says to forgive. But how do we know when to turn the other cheek and when to fight?'""""If he was coldhearted and had no desire or hunger for God, he would not have asked a question like that,"" White says. Several years ago, White brought a friend, Debra George, to Trump Tower. George runs a ministry for prostitutes and children in impoverished inner cities. ""Aren't you scared to go into those areas?"" George recalled Trump asking. She said no, most people are happy to see her, since she comes bearing gifts and asks for nothing in return. George said Trump immediately cut her a check for $10,000 and followed with two more donations of $5,000 each. The two have kept in touch, she said, with Trump asking George to send him her sermons, and George responding with updates on her ministry. ""He has shared with me how much he loves God and loves Jesus,"" George said.Faith vs. works On a conference call with his campaign's evangelical advisory board earlier this summer, Trump earned a trip to the theological woodshed.  He joked that repealing an IRS rule that prohibits pastors from endorsing political candidates might be his only route to heaven.It's a line he has repeated often on the trail, but on this occasion he was immediately rebuked, said Land, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary. (Another member of the board confirmed his account.)""Mr. Trump, with all due respect, the only way to get into heaven is by accepting Christ's atoning sacrifice for your sins, and accepting him as your personal savior,"" a pastor interjected. Trump quietly agreed and quickly moved on, according to people on the line. Perhaps without knowing it, Trump had stepped into one of Christianity's oldest fault lines: faith versus works.  Protestants like the evangelicals on Trump's board stand firmly on the ""faith"" side. No amount of good deeds will save your soul, they say, if you don't assent to the proper Christian beliefs. Catholics and other Christians mostly agree, but also say that faith without works is dead. Even some evangelicals now say the pendulum has swung too far in the ""faith"" direction, with many Americans claiming to be Christians while refusing to demonstrate Christian behavior. In the new book ""You Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit,"" James K.A. Smith, a Christian philosopher, tries to rescue the ancient notion that we are defined by our daily dispositions, routines and disciplines. Rather than sequester ""religion"" as something we do on Sunday, Smith argues that our habits -- he calls them ""liturgies"" -- form ""grooves in our soul."" ""The patterns of your life tell you a lot about your priorities,"" Smith said. The late writer David Foster Wallace sounded a similar theme in ""This is Water,"" a commencement address he gave in 2005. ""Everybody worships,"" Wallace said. ""The only choice we get is what to worship."" Smith was reluctant to pass judgment on Trump's Christianity. He suggested, instead, taking a look at Trump's daily routines, something Smith calls a ""liturgical audit."" As it happens, Trump's book, ""The Art of the Deal,"" published in 1987, opens with a ""Week in the Life"" of its author. Back then, Trump was 41, mildly famous and unconsumed by the crazy fire of a presidential campaign. Trump writes that he wakes around 6 each day, reads the papers and arrives at his office around 9. From then until midnight he is on the phone or in meetings, mainly making business deals. ""It never stops, and I wouldn't have it any other way.""  It isn't all business, though. Trump offers a friend political advice, takes calls from his children and helps raise money to save a farm from foreclosure -- a generous gesture that lands him on the evening news, he notes with satisfaction. In the book, Trump's week ends at 4:45 on Friday afternoon with a visit from David Letterman. Other than a dinner with the late Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, there is no religion, no mention of God nor any hint of introspection. ""I don't like to analyze myself,"" Trump told biographer D'Antonio, ""because I might not like what I see.""  In recent years, Trump has said that he attends church occasionally, on Christmas, Easter and ""special occasions,"" but that he is too busy on most Sundays. He is no longer a member of Marble Collegiate or First Presbyterian in Queens, and it's hard to picture him sitting through a service, or confessing his sins before a congregation, or listening, in quiet hours of Trump Tower, for the still, small voice of God. Trump puts his faith in work, and waits upon the whirlwind."	What are Donald Trump's religious beliefs?

In Georgia, Trump leads Clinton 44%-42%, among likely voters, which is well within the poll's 4.3 percentage point margin of error. Georgia has voted heavily Republican in every presidential election since 1992, when they last voted for a Democrat, former President Bill Clinton.It's just the latest state thought to be safely in Republican hands that has shown the possibility of flipping for Clinton. A poll earlier this week also showed her leading in Arizona, a traditionally red state. Changing demographics in the country and Trump's missteps have been credited with putting more states in play for Democrats.Arizona poll: Clinton leads by 5But Clinton could lose both Georgia and Arizona and still hold on to a commanding advantage in the electoral college, thanks in part to her leads in states like Virginia.The CNU poll out Friday put Clinton up by 12 points, 45% to 33%. That's in keeping with polling in the state that has consistently shown Clinton well ahead in the swing state.Both polls reveal a gender gap that has been perceived nationwide, with Clinton winning among women by a sizable margin and Trump leading among men. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was at 9% in Georgia and 8% in Virginia.Both polls had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points, though Georgia's likely voter sample error margin was 4.3 points, and both surveys were conducted this week mostly before the final presidential debate.

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/trump-on-herman-cain/index.html	"Five years ago, in a move that would foreshadow his current handling of the accusations, Trump publicly defended then-Republican candidate for president Herman Cain, who ultimately was forced to end his campaign amid allegations that he had sexually harassed employees and carried on a 13-year affair. Cain denied the allegations at the time and was never criminally charged. In a November 2011 interview with Fox News host Greta Van Susteren after the initial accusations against Cain surfaced, Trump said the women, both of whom were still anonymous at the time, were seeking fame.""They probably do love their names splashed across the front pages. And frankly, that's not a good situation and I don't think it's a fair situation,"" he said. ""And I think Herman should take very, very strong action, even if he has to bring a major lawsuit against the women.""In the same interview, Trump, who has called himself a ""victim"" in the context of the allegations against him, said that Cain was the target of a ""witch hunt.""""I think it's a very ugly witch hunt and I think it's very unfair,"" Trump said. ""You say, 'Oh, hello, darling, how are you?' And you get sued because you've destroyed somebody's life. It's ridiculous. And I think it's very unfair to him. And unless there's something that we're not seeing — meaning you, I, and everybody else —I think it's a very unfair situation.""About two weeks later, after more accusations surfaced, Trump said in another interview with Van Susteren that the accusations were ""unfounded,"" adding that, ""Nobody knows are they true or not true, but they don't have any evidence or any proof.""Cain dropped out of the race on December 3. Though he denied the allegations, he said he was suspending his campaign because of the ""continued hurt"" they had caused him and his family. When Trump joined Sean Hannity on the radio two days later, he agreed with the host's comment that the allegations were ""mysteriously missing"" evidence.In another interview with Hannity that day, this time on Fox News, Trump said that if John F. Kennedy had been held to the same standard as Cain, he shouldn't have been the president.""Well, it was a tough thing for him,"" Trump said of Cain. ""I mean, they were coming out of the woodwork. And frankly, you know, I guess based on that John Kennedy should not have been president, right?"""	Trump on Herman Cain's sexual harassment accusers in 2011: They're doing it for fame
7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/critical-counties-jefferson-colorado/index.html	If Donald Trump is going to win Colorado, he is not going to be able to do it without the state's populous suburbs. But in recent elections, those very places -- like Jefferson County, Colorado -- have leaned toward the Democratic Party. Jefferson comprises a solid chunk of the Denver metro area. It is home to a slightly smaller Hispanic population relative to the state and a whole lot of beer. Its job picture has been looking good, and its population is relatively well-educated. The statistics underscore the competitive nature of the county, but they also show a place tilting somewhat favorably toward Hillary Clinton. Colorado is a unique state, and there is plenty to keep in mind when you look at it on election night. This state holds its elections by mail, and it engages in some direct democracy. Perhaps most notably, it puts issues such as marijuana legalization directly on the ballot. All that means voters have plenty on their minds as they vote from the comfort of their own homes and that ground game is all-important. The Clinton campaign's ground game efforts have outpaced Donald Trump's, and much fanfare was made over a 12-year-old taking a significant role in the Republican's efforts in Jefferson County. Here are some of the fundamentals and points of interest to keep in mind as votes make their way to election officials in Jefferson County.PopulationBeers for yearsRepresentationPopularityTop searchesWho's searching?TrendingSearches by candidate	Critical counties: Jefferson County, Colorado, underscores Donald Trump's rocky chances
8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/new-jersey-bridgegate-trial-chris-christie/index.html	"For days in September 2013, lane closures on the George Washington Bridge snarled traffic in Fort Lee, New Jersey, just across the river from Manhattan.In a federal trial alleging a political plot behind the lane closings, Kelly testified Friday she told Christie at a meeting nearly a month before they occurred about a traffic study and the effect it would have on the town.She said Christie signed off the traffic study, which she said was billed to her as a survey on how to speed up traffic across the bridge.Kelly and former Port Authority Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni are charged with nine criminal counts, including conspiracy and fraud, in connection with the closures. If found guilty, they could both face time in prison.Christie has denied knowing about the closures beforehand and isn't facing any charges. But he hasn't escaped scrutiny from the controversy that has overshadowed his second term as governor.The trial marks a low point for the man who has become one of Republican nominee Donald Trump's closest allies after dropping his own unsuccessful bid for president this year.The downfall of a starThe case has exposed not only the workings of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a multibillion-dollar agency, but also the way business was done in the administration of the onetime Republican star.One month before the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, Christie's re-election campaign was in full swing, but Fort Lee's mayor refused to back him. At the time, Kelly sent David Wildstein, a former Port Authority executive and political ally of the governor's, a now-infamous email: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" she wrote.""Got it,"" Wildstein replied.Kelly testified Friday that she told Christie about the planned traffic study and potential traffic problems one day before sending that email.The governor, she said, asked her what the administration's relationship was with Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat.""I really didn't know,"" she said.In a statement released after Friday's court proceedings, Christie's spokesman said the governor never knew about the bridge plans.""As the governor has said since January 9, 2014, the governor had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and he had no role in authorizing them. Anything said to the contrary is simply untrue,"" spokesman Brian Murray wrote.Wildstein testified earlier that ex-Port Authority executives and Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from lane closures ""as bad as possible.""  The August 2013 messages are evidence that the closures were an act of political vengeance, according to federal prosecutors. But Kelly had previously chalked up her correspondence with Wildstein to ""sarcasm and humor.""Kelly testified she used the phrase ""traffic problems"" because she often heard Wildstein use it.When Kelly attorney Michael Critchley asked if the words were coded language for the mayor's punishment, she said, ""Absolutely not.""""Poor choice of words?"" the lawyer asked.""Very,"" she replied.Kelly at one point testified about her boss' temper, saying that Christie -- upset about an idea she had proposed -- once hurled a water bottle that struck her on the arm.'Chris Christie is done' Though not on trial, Christie has been dragged through the mud in the court of public opinion. ""Bridgegate is characteristic Jersey skullduggery,"" Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said via email. ""It's the knee-capper rather than the stiletto: crude, blunt messaging that lacks subtlety. It's more Mussolini than Machiavelli.""Debbie Minuto, who owns a bagel shop in Fort Lee, said she's disenchanted with American politics, skipping the last presidential debate to watch British children's cartoon ""Peppa Pig"" with her grandchildren. ""I personally don't care what happens to Christie,"" Minuto said. ""He could do whatever. He's nonexistent. The news comes on. I shut it off."" Jose Perez, part owner of The Cigar Room on Main Street in Fort Lee -- ground zero of the Bridgegate scandal -- said his customers don't even mention the trial.""Chris Christie is done,"" he said. ""I know some judge or something ordered something from Christie, but I'm not even sure what it is.""Ben Dworkin, a political science professor at Rider University, said it's not clear whether Christie can recover politically. ""Bridgegate started a downward trajectory for the governor that has effectively meant his second term has largely been lost,"" he said. ""This tars him, even if he's not at trial himself."""

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/girls-on-the-bus-motherhood-campaign-trail-maeve-reston/index.html	"During the 1972 election, Timothy Crouse penned ""The Boys on the Bus"" -- a book that introduced us to the gritty (mostly male) journalists on the campaign trail.  Over four decades later, the daily grind of election may be the same, but the faces have certainly changed.  Meet CNN's ""Girls on the Bus.""It was a pivotal moment at the end of tumultuous campaign. There were stories to write. We had interviews lined up in Vegas. And yet Lila Grace, now 21 months, was curled up with her head tucked in my shoulder, fingers pinching my skin, as she struggled with that painful barking cough that comes with croup. I began to play that game in my head, trying to rationalize whether it was OK to leave. We had taken her to the doctor; gotten her medicine; her fever had subsided; and I was leaving her in the extremely capable hands of my husband, as well as his mother, who had come to help. But I didn't want to leave her. And I didn't want to miss the debate. When I had Lila in January 2015, I was one of those naive people who thought motherhood was just another thing that you could juggle. A colleague told me that if you'd covered presidential campaigns, you were already prepared for the chaos, the crazy hours, the push-pull between sleep deprivation and adrenaline.But I wasn't ready for that excruciating tension that so many mothers face: the desire to keep doing the job you love and that powerful instinct to be close to your child, all the time, so you aren't missing those magical little moments that vanish as quickly as they come. Why women should stay engaged with social mediaThis is my fourth presidential campaign as a reporter, and it is by far the ugliest and most all-consuming I have experienced. Both the Clinton and Trump campaigns are more opaque than most, making sourcing more difficult. The rhetoric has been harsh and vacuous; the news cycle fast and unrelenting. To break news and cover the campaign well requires being relentless, staying ahead of the story, drilling sources for information at all hours, giving your job every ounce of energy that you have. I have watched, with awe and admiration, female colleagues who seem to do that flawlessly.But I'm still trying to find that balance between doing my job (well enough) and being present with Lila, trying to ignore that endless stream of emails and the pulsating phone.There were those early sleepless days where I felt like I could barely string a sentence together at work. It's amusing to remember how determined I was to find dry ice in Des Moines so I could ship home milk for Lila from the road — and more often than not ended up dumping it in a field on the way to a campaign rally. I still try not to cringe when I come home after long trips, and Lila cries because her (wonderful) nanny is leaving, and she has to adjust to me again. I began to wonder — after Lila picked up the flu while traveling with me during the Florida primary — whether taking her along on the campaign trail was really fair to her, even if I was happier when she was with me. I have relied on other campaign trail moms, like Dana Bash, for advice. I asked her when you stop having that gut punch, every time the plane takes off and you leave your child behind for another work trip.""You will always have it,"" she told me. ""It doesn't ever stop.""This week, I put Lila to bed and caught the last flight out to Vegas for the debate. I did my 2:30 a.m. wake-up call for the morning show, got my interviews done. And then, with strong encouragement from my editor — who always goes home to put her kids to bed before wrapping up her edits and emails for the day — I gave in to that maternal instinct to go home.I watched Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate while Lila amused herself by scattering newspapers around the living room. She drew all over my notes with her crayons, as I tried to keep a log of moments that I would need to write about in the next day's story. I gave up on live-tweeting and contributing to our live blog. I put her to bed while my colleagues picked up my slack, writing their analyses well into the night. So I'm still figuring it out, whether you can be a good mom and still be a girl on the bus. Or whether you have to choose. I hope to have the answer by 2020.
