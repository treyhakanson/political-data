But the issue isn't likely to die down any time soon -- especially as Trump continues to falsely blame Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for starting the ""birtherism"" controversy. Clinton said earlier Friday that Trump's acknowledgment of Obama's birthplace doesn't go far enough and that he must also apologize.""For five years, he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,"" Clinton said at an event in Washington. ""His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie.""Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961.Trump offered no apologies for his leading role in the birther movement and didn't explain what drove him to change his mind. The President dismissed Trump's criticism Friday, joking with reporters at the White House and saying, ""I was pretty confident about where I was born.""Speaking at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, Friday, First Lady Michelle Obama addressed the controversy head on.""There were those who questioned and continue to question for the past eight years up through this very day whether my husband was even born in this country,"" she said. ""Well, during his time in office, I think Barack has answered those questions with the example he set by going high when they low.""Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a North Carolina Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, called Trump a ""disgusting fraud.""Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton started birther movementBirtherism controversyThe birtherism controversy exploded the previous night when Trump said in an interview with The Washington Post that he still wasn't prepared to acknowledge Obama's birthplace. Within a few hours, the campaign released a statement -- attributed to his spokesman -- that said Trump now believes Obama was born in the United States.Trump finally said the words out loud Friday morning.Trump's history of suggesting Obama is a Muslim""President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period,"" Trump said, ignoring reporters' questions despite earlier indications he would hold a press conference. ""Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.""The developments over the past day were steeped in political motivations. With 53 days before the presidential election, Trump is moving into a margin of error race with Clinton and trying to broaden his appeal while maintaining his grip on the GOP base. Trump has tried to improve his dismal standing among minority voters and moderate Republicans in recent weeks, many of whom see birtherism as racially motivated and an insult to Obama.He is also aiming to take the issue of Obama's birthplace and legitimacy off the table by the time of the crucial debate with Clinton September 26.14 of Trump's most outrageous 'birther' claims -- half from after 2011Trump has declined other opportunities during the past two weeks to refute his original birtherism.When local Philadelphia TV station WPVI asked Trump on September 2 about his past statements, Trump replied: ""I don't talk about it anymore. I told you, I don't talk about it anymore.""He repeated the same line when asked about it during a gaggle with reporters aboard his plane last week.And in an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly last week, Trump again said, ""I don't bother talking about it.""Trump's extraordinary attempt to prove Obama was not a natural-born US citizen and was therefore not qualified to be president started on the conservative fringe but gathered momentum and became a major issue. The White House initially tried to ignore the birtherism movement as the work of conspiracy theorists, but Trump's huge media profile propelled the issue through conservative media and it eventually gained traction.The saga only ended in a surreal and extraordinary moment in American politics when the sitting President went to the White House briefing room in April 2011 and produced his long-form birth certificate.'Sideshows and carnival barkers'""We're not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers,"" Obama said at the time, in a clear reference to Trump.In his statement Thursday night, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said, ""Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised.""He was referring to a controversy from the 2008 Democratic primary fight between Obama and Clinton. In a March 2008 interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Clinton said she took then-Sen. Obama's word that he was not a Muslim, but when pressed if she believed he was, she replied, ""No. No, there is nothing to base that on -- as far as I know.""Clinton, however, was not questioning Obama's birthplace.Clinton slammed Trump's comments to the Post while speaking at a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute event in Washington Thursday, saying he needs to stop his ""ugliness"" and ""bigotry.""Donald Trump's unfulfilled promises""He was asked one more time: Where was President Obama born? And he still wouldn't say Hawaii. He still wouldn't say America. This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?"" she said. ""This is the best he can do. This is who he is. And so we need to decide who we are.""Clinton's campaign later tweeted, ""President Obama's successor cannot and will not be the man who led the racist birther movement. Period.""The 'birther' controversyTrump's embrace of the birther controversy seemed outlandish when it began. In retrospect, it looks like a template for the fact-challenged approach he has adopted in his presidential campaign.After Obama's news conference, the real-estate developer claimed credit for getting the President to produce evidence of his birthplace.""Today I'm very proud of myself because I've accomplished something that nobody else was able to accomplish,"" Trump said in New Hampshire, after Obama's news conference.In subsequent years, Obama poked fun at the birtherism controversy and used it to ridicule Trump, most memorably in a savage takedown at the White House Correspondent's Dinner in 2011.""Now, I know that he's taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald,"" Obama said.""And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter -- like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"""	Trump finally admits it: 'President Barack Obama was born in the United States'	['Black', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/16/politics/gop-senators-9-11-lawsuit-bill/index.html	"The potential changes could make it more difficult for the families to pursue lawsuits but could also make it harder for the US to be sued for alleged wrongdoing. ""I have tremendous empathy for the victims,"" said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. ""At the same time, I have concerns about the precedent this bill will set and what it may mean to American servicemen and women and others. ""Let's face it: our alleged drone attacks have killed civilians in Pakistan,"" Corker said. ""Our alleged drone attacks have killed civilians in Afghanistan. And I think once you start opening the door for these types of activities, it can be very problematic.""The late push from the two senators -- who in May held up a final vote on the bill but eventually allowed it to pass on a voice vote -- comes as President Barack Obama is expected to veto the legislation in the coming days. The House passed it just last week. Corker said he hopes a congressional attempt to override a veto won't come until after the election so there is time to negotiate changes that would be satisfactory to both sides. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he is not convinced the Saudi government is culpable even though many of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi citizens. ""They want to blame bin Laden,"" he said about the Saudis. ""All I can say is, from what I can tell, I don't think the government of Saudi Arabia was involved here.""Graham, who said he's in close contact with Saudi officials about the issue, warned it could destroy America's relationship with Saudi Arabia, a critical ally in the tumultuous Middle East.""This is an odd situation in the sense that 9/11 families are high on everybody's list to take care of,"" Graham said. ""It comes at a time when Saudi Arabia believes that America is not a reliable ally. It comes at a time when they think they're being blamed for things they didn't do. All I'm trying to find is a way to move forward with a legal process that doesn't destroy the relationship. That's worth investing some time in.""The bill, known as Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, JASTA, would prevent countries accused of terrorism on American soil from claiming sovereign immunity against lawsuits. Graham acknowledged it might be too late to push through changes.""I don't know if we can get there or not. But I do know this, that Saudi Arabia views this as one of many problems and this could be the breaking point. I don't think they're bluffing. Time will tell,"" he said. A group of 9/11 family members lobbying for the bill blasted Corker and Graham in no uncertain terms.""After a visit to the halls of Congress by an army of Saudi lobbyists led by the Saudi Foreign Minister, JASTA supporters Senator Bob Corker and Senator Lindsey Graham called today for the JASTA veto override vote to be delayed for two months,"" the families said. ""All it took -- apparently -- was a visit by the Saudi foreign minister to get these senators to forsake the families and seek a two-month delay in a vote to override the president's imminent veto.""Congressional supporters of the bill said they are confident Congress will override the President's veto.""It passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and it passed unanimously in the House,"" noted Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip who co-authored the bill with Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who is in line to be the next Democratic leader. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, said he would consider proposals from Graham and Corker, but in the meantime, the White House would have a difficult time getting the 34 vote it needs in the Senate to preserve the President's veto. ""For the President to come up with 34 who will stand by him on this, he's got a lot of work ahead of him.  Most people believe Saudi Arabia and others should be held accountable if they've been guilty of any terrorists activities. So I'm open to any changes or fixes but I think there is pretty strong bipartisan sentiment in support,"" Durbin said.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/16/politics/donald-trump-victory-expansion-fundraising/index.html	Trump Victory, the high-dollar fundraising committee that is the vehicle for Donald Trump to raise money for national and state Republican parties, has added 10 new state GOPs to the contract. The main consequence: Republicans can now give up to nearly $550,000 to Trump Victory -- almost $100,000 more than they could have given when the agreement included just 11 states.Despite widespread hesitation from top Republican donors to support Trump's bid, he has remained competitive with Hillary Clinton primarily due to an online fundraising operation that has exceeded expectations. Yet Trump's newfound strength in recent polls could encourage those who have been disinclined to contribute to finally do so.Which states are included matters little: While the cash must go to the the state GOP's coffers first, parties can transfer the funds to any other state party in unlimited amounts. So presidential candidates tend to include state Republican operations with which they have good relationships and then exert control over which swing-state parties the money is directed to.Trump Victory earlier this month expanded to include the parties of Alabama, California, Kansas, Minnesota and North Dakota. And on Friday, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina -- all states with competitive Senate races -- joined the agreement, the RNC official said. Each state can accept $10,000.Yet given the $2,700 contribution limit to federal candidates, a heavy majority of the money raised by Trump Victory will not be directly managed by the Trump campaign. Large chunks of the $550,000 go to RNC accounts that must be spent on overhead costs and cannot be spent on the presidential race.Clinton has two separate joint fundraising agreements with national and state Democratic parties -- 38 state parties are included, allowing a Democrat to give a maximum of almost $620,000 to Democratic efforts.

""I did think about what gift I could give you for coming on the show,"" Noah said. ""I thought, you are the man who has everything from, from people to influence, and I did notice there is one thing that makes you smile -- so I wanted to give you the gift of balloons.""As balloons began falling from the ceiling, Clinton started laughing and said, ""When I saw the film at the end of the convention, I realized that more than anybody else, I was there playing with balloons and they were going to hook me off the stage. I thought, you know, I really am in my second childhood!"" In the interview, the former president also addressed questions about potential conflicts of interests in a Hillary Clinton presidential administration created by the Clinton Foundation's international donors -- a major issue for the Democratic presidential nominee that has dogged her throughout her contest with Donald Trump. Speaking to those concerns, Bill Clinton said that ""if Hillary becomes president, that has to be totally at arm's length. I can't be involved at all. It needs to be an independent entity, and it will be.""He later added, ""If she becomes president, I would just not take foreign money, not take corporate money, farm out all our international operations to others, and I'm in the process of doing that. Make those that should stay together independent of me, and remove all questions of conflict. I think we can do that.""Clinton also took the opportunity to offer his analysis of the 2016 election, expressing concern over the accelerating trend toward political polarization.""For most of my life, each political party had a 40% base, and then there were 20%, they were genuinely up for grabs. By the time the 2000 race came along between Al Gore and President George W. Bush, it was probably down to 10 (%). It may be down to less now. Because we're getting siloed. We are siloed in the TV shows we watch and the websites we scan, everything,"" he said.""We have one remaining bigotry -- we don't want to be around anyone who disagrees with us,"" Clinton said, prompting light laughter. ""The crowd is laughing but they didn't laugh too loud because they know I'm telling the truth."""	Bill Clinton enjoys balloon drop 'second childhood'	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

End of the story,""  Patti Solis Doyle told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""There was a volunteer coordinator, I believe in late 2007, I think in December. One of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties in Iowa, I don't recall whether they were an actual a paid staffer, but they did forward an email that promoted the conspiracy.""""The birther conspiracy?"" Blitzer asked.""Yeah. Hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. We let that person go, and it was so, you know, beyond the pale, Wolf, and you know, so not worthy the kind of campaign that certainly Hillary wanted to run or that we as a staff wanted to run that I called David Plouffe, who was obviously managing Barack Obama's campaign in '07, to apologize and basically say this is not coming from us.""Jason Miller, a spokesman for GOP nominee Donald Trump's campaign, seized on those remarks, citing them as an admission that the Clinton campaign initiated the birther conspiracy.""With Clinton's 2008 campaign manager admitting on national television and on Twitter that they promoted the rumors surrounding now-President Obama's heritage, Mr. Trump has been fully vindicated,"" Miller said in a statement. ""Not only was a Clinton campaign worker blamed and fired over the activity, we have now been informed that Secretary Clinton was aware of what was going on, with Clinton's campaign manager even apologizing to Obama's campaign manager.""Solis Doyle later clarified her remarks, telling CNN that the email referred to Obama's heritage, not his birthplace.In her interview with Blitzer, Solis Doyle said she was not aware of a memorandum written by Mark Penn, a Democratic pollster and Clinton 2008 strategist, that seemed to question the President's Americanism.   ""I don't know exactly what he wrote, but certainly we never -- the '08 campaign -- never promoted the birther conspiracy. Whether we took whatever advice was in that memorandum, it is clear by the campaign that we ran that we did not use it at that time,"" she said.Doyle also sought to dispel the rumors on Twitter Friday.Trump has falsely accused her campaign of starting the ""birther"" movement. While the former secretary of state has never publicly questioned Obama's citizenship, some of her staff members did question Obama's background during the 2008 Democratic primary fight.Penn's memo in March 2007, while not raising the issue of Obama's citizenship, did identify Obama's ""lack of American roots"" as something that ""could hold him back.""Reggie Love, the longtime traveling aide to Obama, wrote in his book that Clinton and Obama had a heated conversation about the notion that Clinton supporters were sending emails saying that he was a Muslim.In a March 2008 interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Clinton said she took then-Sen.

The US conducted the strike using a drone, hitting him on a motorcycle just outside a house in Raqqa, ISIS's self-declared capital, the official added.Cook called Salman one of the ""most senior leaders"" in ISIS.""He operated as the minister of Information for the terror organization and was a prominent member of its Senior Shura Council -- ISIL's leadership group,"" Cook added, using the government's preferred acronym for the terror group. The US has now killed in the last two months two of the ""very few"" ISIS leaders with direct access to Baghdadi, the official said. Mohammad al-Adnani was killed in Syria in a US airstrike on August 30. He was thought to be in charge of external terror operations. ""Baghdadi's inner circle was already small, and it's getting smaller,"" the official added. Salman is assessed to have been one of the five most-senior officials in ISIS before he and Adnani were killed. Cook said Salman was responsible for overseeing the production of ""terrorist propaganda videos showing torture and executions.""An anti-ISIS group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, earlier told CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali that Salman was killed in a drone strike on September 7 in Raqqa, Syria. The group said Salman was responsible for ISIS propaganda and had been chosen to succeed Adnani. Cook called Salman ""a close associate"" of Adnani. Speaking in the UK last week, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter called Adnani ""one of the most lethal leaders within ISIL, who was actively planning to kill our civilians around the world.""""The removal of ISIL's senior leaders degrades its ability to retain territory, and its ability to plan, finance and direct attacks inside and outside of the region,"" Cook added.

""Well, during his time in office, I think Barack has answered those questions with the example he set by going high when they go low.""The first lady was speaking hours after Trump -- who for five years has etched a reputation as the country's highest-profile ""birther,"" questioning if the President was born in the US -- admitted that Obama was born in America.It was a rare moment of unvarnished political firepower from the first lady, who has largely remained outside of -- and above -- the political fracas this year. Once designated ""The Closer"" on her husband's campaigns for the White House, Obama on Friday entered a race more bitterly fought than either of her husband's own election battles. In her half-hour-long remarks, she argued Trump's brand of politics should be kept far from the Oval Office, predicting his bombastic style of campaigning wouldn't mellow if he wins.""Being president isn't anything like reality TV,"" she said. ""It's not about sending insulting tweets or making fiery speeches, it's about whether or not the candidate can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country.""She continued: ""If a candidate is erratic and threatening; if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fears and lies on the trail; if a candidate has no clear plans to implement their goals; if they disrespect their fellow citizens, including folks who made extraordinary sacrifices for our country; let me tell you, that is who they are. That is the kind of president they will be, trust me.""With virtually unmatched popularity at her back, Michelle Obama sought to cast the race as a make-or-break moment for the country's future. She was debuting on the stump Friday in the hopes of galvanizing suburban voters behind a candidate she once fiercely opposed.Obama: ""I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton""""When she didn't win the presidency in 2008, she didn't throw in the towel,"" the first lady said of Clinton. ""She once again answered the call to serve, keeping us safe as our secretary of state. And let me tell you, Hillary has the resilience that it takes to do this job. See, because when she gets knocked down, she doesn't complain or cry foul. No, she gets right back up and she comes back stronger for the people who need her the most.""At her campaign rally, Obama worked to convince her and her husband's supporters that Clinton is also worthy of their votes. The rally on the campus of George Mason University was timed ahead of the commonwealth's October 17 voter registration deadline.  ""When I hear folks saying they're not inspired this this election, I disagree. I am inspired,"" she said, urging the crowd to register to vote and actually cast ballots for Clinton.Michelle Obama: ""When they go low, we go high""Obamas take to trailClinton's campaign is relying on the Obamas to help persuade the coalition of minorities, young people and women who propelled them to the White House to cast ballots for this year's Democratic candidate. The President made his first solo appeal this week, appearing at a campaign rally in Philadelphia and phoning in to African-American radio to talk up Clinton.""I get frustrated hearing folks say, 'You know, we're so excited with Barack, we love Michelle, they take Hillary for granted,'"" Obama told syndicated host Frankie Darcell. ""This is not a reality show. This is not something where it's all flash and fizzle.""Michelle Obama: ""It matters"" that black kids see the Obamas in the White HouseThe first lady is Clinton's most popular campaign surrogate, with polls pegging her favorable rating near 60%. She's largely avoided the type of policy role that Clinton sought as a presidential spouse, choosing to focus on more broadly accepted topics like supporting military families and combating obesity in children.She's carefully positioned herself as a cultural icon, appearing on popular television programs as a vehicle to advance her agenda. This week she co-hosted Ellen DeGeneres' talk show, partaking in a stunt that saw the host teach the first lady how to shop in a CVS.Those types of appearances have lent the first lady a degree of authenticity the Clinton campaign hopes will extend to the political realm.Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up""When you're in public service, you're first lady, the president and you're interacting with the world, people can smell inauthenticity,"" Obama told Oprah Winfrey during a summit on women's issues in June.
