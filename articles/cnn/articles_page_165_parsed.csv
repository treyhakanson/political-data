""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""RELATED: Charlotte police shoot and kill man, sparking growing protest""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer. Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities. ""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is hosting the roundtable at the Republican National Committee, according to Donald Trump's campaign and a GOP congressional source. McMorris Rodgers worked closely with Trump's daughter on the plans that were officially unveiled last week at an event in suburban Philadelphia. McMorris Rodgers is the only House member to give birth three times while in office. Ivanka Trump is a top adviser and surrogate for her father's campaign and frequently mentions his record of hiring female executives in top positions in his businesses. As a mother of three Trump did several interviews with national outlets about the campaign's new proposals for paid maternity leave and more affordable child care. But she abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine when the reporter pressed her on previous comments by Donald Trump on pregnant employees, accusing the interviewer of bias.RELATED: GOP policy guru: Trump can't 'fake his way through 90 minutes'Tuesday's session will cover workplace flexibility, child care, equal pay and the policies the campaign rolled out last week. Trump will also hear from the roughly 15 House members and senators about the issues they are working on in Congress, according to two GOP sources familiar with the plans.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi swiped at Donald Trump's ""disastrous maternity leave and childcare plan"" ahead of the meeting.""Just like his tax plan, Donald Trump's maternity leave and childcare plan is designed to benefit the wealthy, while leaving hard-working women and families behind,"" Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""Unsurprisingly, LGBT families, fathers and adoptive parents have no place in Trump's pinched notion of hard-working America.""The meeting in Washington comes a day after Trump's daughter met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, at her request, during the speaker's visit to New York.  RELATED: Clinton's challenge: Rebuilding Obama's winning coalitionThe recent focus on this set of issues by the GOP nominee comes as polls show the race tightening, but Trump trailing Hillary Clinton among female voters in recent national and battleground state polls.The new proposals from Donald Trump reduce the costs for families by making child care expenses tax deductible for families making less than $500,000. Trump also proposed setting up tax-free accounts to be used for child care and child enrichment activities. He also proposed providing paid maternity leave by extending unemployment insurance benefits to those working mothers whose employers do not offer paid maternity leave."

Chris Christie have falsely asserted in recent days that Trump dropped his birtherism in recent years, Trump declined numerous opportunities to disavow his previous support of the conspiracy theory.In the two weeks before his sudden statement on Friday, Trump was asked four times about his birther beliefs -- and Trump declined each opportunity to disavow the falsehood or his role in pushing that conspiracy theory.Trump spent Tuesday campaigning in the battleground state of North Carolina, where the latest polls show him in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton."

Libertarian Gary Johnson drew 6% support, while another 6% said they were undecided. Clinton and Trump maintain large advantages in North Carolina with key constituencies -- Clinton receives the support of 98% of black voters, while Trump is backed by 65% of white voters. The gender divide is less severe, however, as Clinton leads Trump among women by 6 points while Trump's advantage among men is 10 points. Majorities said that both Trump and Clinton were worse than typical Republican and Democrat candidates for president, though more were likely to describe Clinton than Trump as ""about the same as usual."" The Elon poll also surveyed likely voters on their perceptions of the candidates' health -- a major focus in the presidential race after Clinton was diagnosed with a case of pneumonia two weeks ago. Seventy-seven percent of North Carolina voters said they think Trump is healthy enough to be president, but only 56% said the same about Clinton. Opinions were sharply divided along partisan lines. Additionally, just under half said that both Clinton and Trump had not provided enough medical information.With fewer than 50 days remaining in the race, 6% of North Carolina likely voters said they remain undecided, according to the poll. But when asked if they had to choose between Clinton, Trump and Johnson, 35% chose Clinton, compared to 18% for Trump and Johnson each. When Johnson voters were asked to choose between Clinton and Trump, slightly more said they prefer Trump, though nearly 4 in 10 continued to indicate no preference. North Carolina likely voters were also asked if they thought Russian President Vladimir Putin or President Barack Obama was a better leader, likely prompted by Trump's recent comments that Putin has been ""far more"" of a leader than Obama. Overall, 60% chose Obama, while 23% said Putin -- but a plurality (39%) of Republicans chose Putin, with about a quarter saying they ""don't know.""The Elon University poll of North Carolina surveyed 644 likely voters, with a margin of error of +/- 3.86 points. It was conducted from September 12-16."	Presidential poll: Deadlocked in North Carolina	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/legal-requirements-terrorism-suspects-rahami/index.html	"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and others have suggested that Rahami be detained by the military as an enemy combatant, in part so he would not have be read his Miranda rights.  Here are five common questions about terrorism suspects and the legal system:1) Do U.S.-citizen terrorism suspects arrested within the United States have constitutional protections in the first place?Yes. There are ongoing debates over the constitutional rights of non-citizens (and citizens traveling overseas), but the Supreme Court has never suggested that a US citizen arrested within the United States receives lesser constitutional protection simply because he's a terrorism suspect. To the contrary, as Justice Felix Frankfurter once wrote: ""The safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people."" Put more bluntly, providing US-citizen terrorism suspects with full constitutional protection is how we can be sure, as a society, that they're punished according to principles of justice, rather than vengeance.2) Can such individuals be detained by the military?Probably not. A federal statute enacted in 1971 (in response to the World War II-era Japanese American internment camps) prohibits the detention of US citizens ""except pursuant to an Act of Congress,"" and no statute expressly authorizes the detention without trial of US-citizen terrorism suspects. The Supreme Court has held that the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), enacted by Congress one week after 9/11, implicitly authorizes the detention of US citizens captured in Afghanistan while fighting on behalf of al Qaeda or the Taliban. But four justices have suggested that the AUMF does not authorize the detention of even those individuals when captured within the United States -- and without such an affiliation, there's no argument that the AUMF applies.3) Can US-citizen terrorism suspects be prosecuted in the Guantánamo military commissions?No. When Congress enacted the Military Commissions Act of 2006, it expressly limited the statute to ""alien"" defendants. And although there are precedents from World War II for trying US citizens in military commissions, that's only when the citizen is accused of international war crimes (which terrorism, by itself, is not). 4) Can US-citizen terrorism suspects be interrogated?Absolutely. No rule, statute, or constitutional provision prevents the government from interrogating terrorism suspects -- so long as none of the interrogation methods involve torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (prohibitions that today apply equally whether the interrogation is conducted by the FBI, the military, and the CIA). There are many examples of lawful interrogations in terrorism cases producing actionable intelligence information. 5) At what point do US-citizen terrorism suspects have to be apprised of their Miranda rights?Not right away. First, Miranda is only an exclusionary rule -- meaning that the penalty for interrogating a suspect without reading him his rights is simply the exclusion of his statements from his trial. Second, even if admissibility at trial were an issue, the Supreme Court has recognized a ""public safety"" exception to Miranda, where the interrogation is designed to identify future threats to the public, and not to elicit further evidence of the suspect's guilt. Thus, in the case of the so-called ""underwear bomber,"" the government conducted a substantial interrogation of the suspect before reading him his rights, but was still allowed to use his statements during that period against him at trial. Finally, there's no direct correlation between the provision of Miranda rights and a suspect's refusal to cooperate. So in a case like this one, there's little reason to think that Miranda really does prevent the government from taking necessary steps to prevent future acts of terrorism.

I do it all the time in business. It's called other people's money,"" Trump said. ""There's nothing like doing things with other people's money because it takes the risk -- you get a good chunk out of it and it takes the risk.""His comments came on the heels of a Washington Post report published earlier Tuesday, which called attention to Trump's funneling of contributions from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to charities in order to settle lawsuits against Trump. Trump has only sparsely contributed to his foundation. Instead, the foundation is largely funded by outside donors -- not Trump himself.Trump did not make those comments in the context of that report on Tuesday.The Republican presidential nominee has frequently lauded the benefits of ""OPM,"" telling his supporters at rallies that he would put the tactic to use for the country's benefit.Trump has frequently called for other countries to chip in larger amounts to help pay for the US military to maintain its bases around the world, in addition to calling for Gulf states like Saudi Arabia to bear a larger financial burden in the fight against ISIS and in building a safe zone to shelter refugees.Trump has called for building a safe zone at the same time as he has stiffly argued against allowing any more Syrian refugees into the US. Even though refugees undergo numerous screenings and a lengthy vetting process that can take more than a year, Trump has argued they could represent a national security threat to the United States."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/chris-christie-bridgegate-new-jersey/index.html	"Until, at least according to US prosecutors, now.It was an unexpected moment during the Monday opening statement by Vikhas Khanna, an assistant US attorney prosecuting two former Christie administration officials now charged with fraud -- the assertion that Christie was aware of the alleged political retribution being carried out by aides. It was one that directly contradicted years of Christie's statements to the contrary, including one as recently as Sunday. ""I have been investigated by three different entities, two of them led by partisan Democrats, who have all found that I had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement in it,"" the New Jersey governor told Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Christie has never been charged and never listed as a co-conspirator by prosecutors.But the revelation put forth by prosecutors underscored once again, for all to see, the scope of the political scandal that played the leading role in destroying his presidential ambitions. And his vice presidential ambitions. And, quite possibly, any cabinet ambitions in a Donald Trump administration.In September 2013, Christie allies shut down lanes of the George Washington Bridge in an alleged effort to exact political retribution on the Democratic mayor of the town of Fort Lee, who had refused to endorse Christie's re-election. Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closuresChristie's blanket rejection of any involvement -- and any knowledge -- of what occurred in September 2013 has been consistent and unyielding. Through investigations, both internal and by New Jersey Democrats, and a battering from local officials and the press, the New Jersey governor remained steadfast. ""How many more investigations do you want?"" a frustrated Christie would ask reporters at one point. Yet, as if to underscore how comfortable he was in his innocence, Christie still decided to launch his presidential bid. It was an effort that sought to recapture the moment -- and momentum -- Christie was party to shortly after his blowout re-election victory in November 2013.But Christie was clearly wounded. He went from leading the party's initial polls to firmly stuck in the middle tier of the pack. And that was before Donald Trump proceeded to run roughshod over the field. For a period, Christie appeared to be getting back on track. His favorability numbers, which tanked in the wake of the bridge scandal, started to turn right-side up in the crucial state of New Hampshire at the end of 2015, aided by a major advertising blitz by the super PAC supporting his candidacy. But it was short-lived. Even as the issue rarely came up during the dozens of town hall he held, Christie couldn't recapture his campaign magic.""I have both won elections that I was supposed to lose and I have lost elections that I was supposed to win,"" Christie told supporters after his sixth place finish in New Hampshire. ""And what that means is you never know, and it's both the magic and mystery of politics that you never quite know when which is going to happen even when you think you do.""But Christie and his aides, in candid moments, couldn't help but talk about what may have happened were it not for the George Washington Bridge -- an exercise repeated in July, as Trump went through the process of selecting his running mate.Christie himself, in an interview on MSNBC, acknowledged that the ""Bridgegate"" scandal contributed to Trump's decision not to select him as his running mate. ""I'm sure it was a factor,"" Christie said. It was a position, aides said, that by the end of the selection process Christie was openly lobbying for -- and one he acknowledged afterward he was disappointed not to receive.""I'm a competitive person,"" Christie said in a CNN interview in July. ""When it was clear that Donald wanted me to compete for this job and to be considered, I wanted to win, of course you do.""For now, Trump advisers say, Christie is firmly encamped inside Trump's inner circle. A confidante and sounding board, Christie has a three-pronged role in Trump's operation: surrogate, adviser and the head of Trump's presidential transition team.Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, made no mention of the court case or Christie's potential plight -- instead making clear he had no plans of abandoning the man who provided his first top-tier endorsement in the primary, saying Christie has ""been a spectacular advocate ever since.""He's also gained repeated plaudits for his transition efforts -- a secretive operation that nonetheless has been lauded by lobbyists, donors and GOP officials who have received briefings on its work. ""It's the most in-shape thing the Trump guys have going right now,"" one lobbyist who attended one of the briefings told CNN. But many of those looped in on the transition operations have long thought one of the recipients of a top job in a Trump administration would be ... Christie.Asked on MSNBC if he wanted a role in a Trump administration last week, Christie responded simply: ""It depends on what I'm offered.""But the question now becomes what can Christie, long considered in the running to be attorney general, can be offered. As one GOP official supporting Trump pointed out: ""Trump respects his loyalty -- and that's why he's fine now. But I have a sneaking suspicion Senate Democrats, who he'd need to get confirmed don't care much about that."""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/washington-post-trump-foundation-report/index.html	"Kellyanne Conway said she's not worried about the Washington Post report that said on four occasions the Donald J. Trump Foundation cut checks to settle suits in a controversial and potentially illegal tactic, given that the foundation is funded primarily with other donors' money, not his own, according to the Post review of legal documents and interviews. ""Trump is using his charities to benefit his businesses, which is against the law,"" Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan of his report. The most substantial donation was $100,000 to Fisher House, a veterans' charity, as part of a settlement with the city of Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.Conway defended the donation as a settlement because of a flag Trump wanted to raise at the Mar-a-Lago.""I think this is a classic Donald Trump,"" she told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""He wanted to raise the American flag as high as he possibly could over Mar-a-Lago. I think a lot of Americans at this point would applaud that. And of course the county said he couldn't do that, it had to be smaller, so they started assessing a $1,250 fine. So the way they wanted to settle it was for Trump to donate $100,000 to a veteran's group.""And another check for $158,000 was distributed from the foundation as a way for a Trump golf course to settle another lawsuit, according to the Post.""I've been talking to the people who are responsible for the Trump Foundation to get some facts and some figures,"" she said. ""It's very important for people to understand what happened in these cases. Donations went to veterans groups ... How did the Mar-a-Lago benefit from him giving $100,000 to veterans? The veterans benefited and I think that's great and I applaud him for doing that.""Burnett said: ""Well, the business benefited by the lawsuit going away and being settled, right? That would be how the business benefited.""""Well, there are many lawsuits everyday against people ... I think you're making things up based on facts as they are not reported in this story, which also uses a lot of conditional phrasing, I'd like to point out,"" Conway said.Conway also added that Trump frequently is ""signing checks privately to help people"" from his own bank account separate from the foundation,""You can only imagine how many people have asked Mr. Trump for his time and his resources and his connections and his money privately, and he does that and he doesn't have cameras in there, it doesn't go through foundations,"" she said.Burnett pointed that the public could verify those donations if Trump released his tax returns, to which Conway didn't directly respond.Trump's Foundation has come under scrutiny from investigators and Democrats over possible pay-for-play schemes. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the foundation to make sure it is abiding by state charity law, and House Democrats have called for the Department of Justice to look at Trump's relationship with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who declined to formally investigate it."
