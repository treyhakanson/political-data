If you tell your supporters in Utah, 'I'm voting for Donald Trump,' that sounds to me like an endorsement,"" CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked the Republican Thursday on ""The Situation Room.""""I think they're different,"" maintained Chaffetz, a Republican. ""I think the endorsement is far different than who you actually vote for. And it's the one vote I actually do for myself. I don't represent anybody else. We all get the same vote. But in the context of either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, it's Donald Trump.""Soon after the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape leaked last month showing Trump bragging about being able to grope women, Chaffetz told CNN's Don Lemon that he wouldn't be able to look in his daughter's eye if he voted for Trump. ""I'm out. I can no longer endorse Donald Trump for president. There's no possible way I vote for Hillary Clinton. But, these are abhorrent. They are wrong ... And, you know, my wife, Julie and I, we've got a 15-year-old daughter. Do you think I can look her in the eye and tell her that I endorse Donald Trump for President when he acts like this in his apology?"" Chaffetz said at the time.In that October 7 interview, he continued: ""I'm not going to put my good name and reputation, and my family behind Donald Trump for President when he acts like this. I just can't do it."" But the congressman has since changed his tune, and announced on Twitter last week that he would pull the lever for his party's standard bearer, saying Clinton is ""bad for the USA.""Speaking to Blitzer on Thursday, Chaffetz added that Clinton ""is so bad, and so wrong for the United States of America. I think her ability to look into the camera and just lie, lie, lie scares me more than anything.""Blitzer asked Chaffetz why he can suddenly now look at his wife and daughter in the eye and vote for Trump after hearing the tape. ""I will never support, condone, defend anybody's actions whether they're words or actual actions to defame or to demoralize or take advantage of women in any shape or form. I want my daughters to understand that, I want America to understand that,"" Chaffetz said. ""But at the end of the day, you still have to make a choice."" Did Chaffetz consider voting for Evan McMullin, a third-party candidate who has mounted a serious third-party bid in Utah?""No,"" Chaffetz said. ""That's a fast track to nowhere."""

There were no noted dissents.In Arizona, voters can request an early ballot to be sent to them before the election. The voters can then mail it back or drop it off at a polling locations as long as it is received by 7 p.m. on Election Night.Democrats in the state argued that thousands -- particularly those in towns near the border and in Native American reservations without reliable mail service -- have relied upon having their ballot collected by organizers in past years to ensure the ballots are received on time.The law makes it a felony, punishable by a year in jail and $150,000 to knowingly collect ""voted or unvoted early ballots"" from another person. It provides for an exception for family members or caregivers. ""It is no secret that ballot collection and delivery has been particularly beneficial for Arizona's minority voters, and legislators who have not traditionally enjoyed broad support in those communities have repeatedly tried to restrict it,"" Democratic lawyer Marc Elias argued in his filing with the Supreme Court Saturday morning.Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan praised the decision. ""We are extremely pleased the Supreme Court reversed the ninth circuit's decision, Reagan said in a statement. ""This commonsense law simply ensures ballot security in the state of Arizona and we're relived that there will be no changes to the law this late in the election cycle. ""In briefs filed by lawyers for the Arizona, lawyers had argued that the law ""will not actually have a discriminatory impact or anything more than a minimal burden on the right to vote,"" and lambasted the appeals court for blocking the ""sensible"" law so close to the election. Joshua A. Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky College of Law, believed a major concern for justices could be the timing.""This could be a close vote,"" Douglas said Friday. ""I could see several justices worrying about the impact of the law while others will be more concerned with the timing issues."" The majority of the appeals court said it recognized that it was blocking the law close to the election but said that its injunction would not affect the state's ""election processes or machinery."" ""The only effect is on the third party ballot collectors, whose efforts to collect legitimate ballots will not be criminalized, pending our review,"" the majority said. In a brief filed by the Arizona Republican Party and joined by the state attorney general, lawyers called the law a ""well-reasoned"" safeguard to a ""fair and transparent election.""They argued that the challengers ""have not and cannot meet their burden to overcome the important regulatory interests protecting voters and ensuring an orderly and fair election process.""They said the law was in effect for the primary election and that the challengers could not identify ""a single voter whose ability to vote was burdened by the law."""

If Donald Trump can bust through, his path to victory remains open. One way or another, the firewall can't happen without a Democratic victory in Pennsylvania. History is on Clinton's side, as Democrats have won this state every election since Bill Clinton in 1992. To see if Trump could upset that trend, look to Bucks County. Situated outside of heavily Democratic Philadelphia, this area could be more open to the Republican nominee. If voters here turn out in his favor, it could make room for a Trump win in Pennsylvania. Data from Google Trends show an increase in searches about Clinton around the FBI announcing it found emails that could be relevant to her use of a private server as well as search queries about the emails and whether the Democratic nominee would drop out. In the same time frame, voters searched Google for reasons to vote Trump.As a whole, much of Pennsylvania is Republican and rural, particularly in its western half. But the population is concentrated in a few areas, particularly Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Clinton needs these towns to turn out for her, and Trump needs to tap into their outlying areas. Keep Bucks County in mind to see how this election plays out, and take a look at Allegheny County across the state -- another one of CNN's Critical Counties.PopulationEconomyTough sellRepresentationPopularityTop searchesWho's searching?TrendingSearches by candidate	Critical counties: Is Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a brick in Hillary Clinton's firewall?

Christie is heading planning for Republican nominee Donald Trump's transition if he wins the presidency.What's next for Chris Christie?In a statement, the New Jersey governor said he was ""saddened"" by the case and repeated his long-standing claim that he had no knowledge of the plot to close lanes as an act of political retribution.""As a former federal prosecutor, I have respected these proceedings and refused to comment on the daily testimony from the trial,"" Christie said in the statement. ""I will set the record straight in the coming days regarding the lies that were told by the media and in the courtroom.""Read Chris Christie's statement on the verdictChristie has also functioned as a high profile surrogate for Trump, and was included on a schedule of campaign stops in New Hampshire this weekend put out by the organization.CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment and not yet gotten a response.The news comes after nearly five days of deliberations from the jury. Sentencing is scheduled for February 21 in the same courtroom. The defense attorney for Kelly said they planned to appeal the verdict and request a new trial. Defense attorneys for both defendants had filed a motion for a mistrial Thursday before the verdict came down Friday.Kelly and Baroni each face a maximum sentence of 86 years, according to Paul Fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case. Kelly and her family were visibly emotional while the verdict was read, while Baroni stared at the jury before hugging his family.Prosecutors alleged that the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge were part of a deliberate effort to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, who did not endorse the Republican incumbent Christie in his 2013 re-election bid.Emails and text messages released in January of 2014 form the basis of the charges. In one particularly damning email, Kelly told former Port Authority official David Wildstein, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""Kelly later said her messages contained ""sarcasm and humor,"" and she claims that she had told Christie about traffic problems resulting from a study a day prior to sending the email."

Judge Richard Allen Griffin and John M. Rogers were appointed by George W. Bush, and Judge Alice M. Batchelder by George H.W. Bush.After the ruling, Marc Elias, the lead lawyer for the Democrats, suggested he could appeal. Elias tweeted ""more to come"" and said that the appeals court order was issued ""without full rsesponse and virtually no analysis.""""We are stunned that a court would rule without even allowing one of the parties to file a memo explaining their case, but that is exactly what the 6th Circuit has done in this decision. We are exploring our options to reverse this unfortunate ruling,"" said Kirstin Alvanitakis, Communications Director, Ohio Democratic Party.Democrats could appeal the order either to a large panel of the 6th Circuit, or to the Supreme Court.Democrats have filed similar lawsuits in Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania, and so far Republicans have won three of those cases, although the Pennsylvania case has not yet been heard.Sunday's order reverses an order filed yesterday by Judge James Gwin of the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. He mostly sided with Democrats against Trump and Roger Stone's group ""Stop the Steal"" and issued  a temporary restraining order. The order also applied to the Clinton campaign.Stark County, Ohio, is a swing county in a swing stateThe Trump campaign Saturday morning appealed the ruling to the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals.Gwin's ruling, the campaign said, ""literally imposes a comprehensive election code the court will apparently continue to invent on the fly.""In Arizona, a federal judge late Friday rejected a similar request from Democrats for a restraining order. Among actions prohibited under Gwin's order: ""Hindering or delaying a voter or prospective voter from reaching or leaving the polling place,"" participating in ""unauthorized 'poll watching'"" activities, including ""challenging or questioning voters or prospective voters about their eligibility to vote, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same"" and ""interrogating, admonishing, interfering with, or verbally harassing voters or prospective voters.""Campaigns and individuals are also barred from questioning voters ""under the guise of the purported 'exit polling' or 'citizen journalist' operations organized and encouraged by Defendants Stone and Stop the Steal.""Gwin's order applies to Hillary Clinton's campaign as well.The Trump campaign denies it is participating in any illegal activity.""Intimidating voters is illegal, and the campaign does not remotely condone such conduct,"" Trump campaign lawyer Chad A. Readler of Jones Day wrote in a 15-page legal filing in Ohio earlier this week. ""This case is one of four coordinated attacks across the country that are clearly long-planned efforts to sow chaos in the Defendants' political efforts, while garnering maximum publicity for Plaintiff's unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims on the eve of the Presidential Election,"" Readler added.Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said the legal action is necessary to limit any questionable activity that prevents voters from casting their ballots.""The concern has been if people were to act upon what Trump and what Roger Stone have been encouraging people to do that you'd have true intimidation and harassment that might scare voters off,"" Pepper said after the hearing. ""I don't want voters to be at all worried about voting on Election Day."" ""We think Democrats and Republicans have every right to hand out leaflets at polls and everything else but what we don't want is harassment or intimidation and the judge is obviously trying to balance that,"" Pepper added.Critical counties: Cuyahoga County, Ohio, could be Clinton's bright spotGwin rejected a request for a restraining order against the state Republican Party.Rejected in ArizonaIn a similar lawsuit to the one in Ohio, Judge John J. Tuchi rejected Democrats' request for a restraining order against Trump and Stone in Arizona.""[W]hatever the shortcomings of the Trump Campaign's statements on this issue might be, simply arguing there is voter fraud and urging people to watch out for it is not, without more, sufficient to justify the extraordinary relief that an injunction constitutes,"" Tuchi wrote.""VICTORY-Ariz Fed Court  dismisses phony lawsuit 2 prevent EXIT POLL by @StoptheSteal.org 2 ""You have no case"" he says to Dem thugs,"" Stone tweeted."

Adding to the damage was the revelation that they were discovered on the laptop of Huma Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, while federal investigators were investigating his sexting with a purportedly underage girl.And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has made the release of John Podesta's hacked emails a daily -- sometimes twice daily -- occurrence in the last 30 days of the election.Friday's batch comes out of the emails the FBI collected in its investigation of Clinton and, recently, turned over to the State Department.The newest emails were largely duplicates of previously released messages, but included some new material, including a February 2010 request from Chelsea Clinton that her mom look into expanding the role of the USNS Comfort in Haiti relief efforts. The emails stem from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by VICE News reporter Jason Leopold and more are expected to come out after the election.The peril for Clinton is unlikely to end on Tuesday, as a handful of Republican lawmakers have begun openly talking about possible impeachment proceedings for her handling of emails and the Congress, if it remains in Republican hands, is all but guaranteed to continue its own investigations of Clinton."

The results of that test help the company group people under personality types measuring openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.Data-crunchers then combine individuals' personalities with their voting history, where they shop, what they buy -- even what they watch on television.RELATED: The final get-out-the-vote flurry beginsThe personality test doesn't indicate that this is the purpose of the test, so it's likely those who fill it out are unaware of how it will be matched with other data freely available or purchasable from cable and credit card companies.With that, according to Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, they know the best way to target the individual and what message to use.""We can then marry this data with cookies to serve people (ads) though social media or digitally, or we can match these data to television viewing data so we can understand where the audiences are that we're interested in, what programs they're watching, and we can then serve them messages during those shows,"" he explained.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.The company does not release examples of ads it's produced for an ongoing campaign, but it did provide CNN with examples from its work for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz when he was challenging Trump in the GOP presidential primaries.One was created for a ""Stoic Traditionalist"" who values time in isolation, is unadventurous and tends to be unassuming in their disposition. It shows Cruz alone with the tag line ""keep calm and Cruz on."" The other, a ""Relaxed Leader"" who is sociable, generally optimistic and empathizes with the emotions of others, depicts the whole Cruz family with the words ""our best days are ahead.""Despite Trump's considerable investment in the venture, as spelled out in filings to the Federal Election Commission, the strategy hasn't always delivered the desired results.Cruz paid Cambridge Analytica $5,805,548, according to FEC filings.But the effort did not secure him enough support to become the party's nominee, though the company maintains it did help him grab the spotlight in the Republican primaries.Sasha Issenberg, author of ""The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns,"" has doubts about the effectiveness of the psychoanalysis and profiling used by Cambridge Analytica, such as in the case with Cruz.He noted that the Cruz campaign thought they needed to figure out nuanced differences between the Texas senator and competitors like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.RELATED: Examining the candidates' positionsIn the end, Issenberg said, the data yielded ""something like 160 different segments of potential voters that were separated on these personality characteristics, but also by issues, by broad attitudes about politics.""They then developed 160 different tracks of digital advertising and direct mail, according to Issenberg. But those distinctions might have been unnecessarily fine.""It basically became unwieldy in the context of the campaign,"" he said. ""The number of people that you need basically just to create all this content often offsets whatever the efficiency gain you would gain by targeting narrowly.""He added, ""You probably would get a lot of the impact if you just sent the same message on gun rights to your neurotic gun rights supporters as you would to your extroverted gun rights supporters.""Though Cruz and fellow GOP primary candidate Ben Carson couldn't ride the company's strategy to success, the firm said it works on eight to 10 political campaigns each year.FEC filings show many of the campaigns helped by the firm -- a US-incorporated affiliate of the SCL Group -- to have been Republican.Cambridge Analytica has been linked to the reclusive GOP donor Robert Mercer, though the company would not confirm or deny the connection.Either way, it will have another test of its techniques when the Republican nominee tries to win the White House in the vote next Tuesday."
