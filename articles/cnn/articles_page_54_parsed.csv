Catalist's voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote.In total, more than 30 million votes have been cast already across 38 states with early voting. And both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump continue to urge their supporters to vote early as Election Day nears.Early voting update: Battlegrounds tight with 30 million ballots castLatinos tend to vote more Democratic than the population as a whole. And in 2012, Latinos voted for President Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by 71% to 27%, according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic Center.Here's a look at the available voting data from each of the three states:FloridaAt this point in 2008, 260,263 Latino voters, or 9.6% of the electorate, voted early. So far in 2016, that number has grown to 596,146, or 14.1% of all early ballots cast.In terms of raw numbers, Hispanic early turnout has increased 129% from 2008, according to early voting data from Thursday. Their turnout numbers increased at a faster rate than white and black voters.CNN looked at data from 2008 because it doesn't have comparable data from 2012.Early voting update: Positive signs for both parties in battleground statesIn the most recent CNN/ORC poll this week, Florida appears to be a tight contest, with Clinton at 49% among likely voters while Trump is at 47%.Obama carried Florida's Hispanic vote 60% to 39%, an improvement over his 57% to 42% showing in 2008, according to the Pew Research Center.GeorgiaAt this point in 2012, 12,933 Latinos, or 0.9% of early voters, cast early ballots. In 2016, that number has increased to more than double at 31,623 people, or 1.7% of all voters who cast their ballot early.The Hispanic electorate in Georgia isn't large, but Hispanic early turnout has increased by 144% from 2012, according to early voting data from Thursday.In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey published Thursday, Clinton sits just 1 point behind Trump in Georgia -- 45% to 44%, within the poll's margin of error.North CarolinaAt this point in 2012, 21,474 Latinos voted early -- about 1.2% of the electorate. So far this year, 37,591 Latinos have voted, a slight increase to 1.8% of early voters.  The Latino vote in North Carolina has a relatively small influence in the state, but has increased in voter turnout this year nonetheless. Early voting among Hispanics has increased 75% so far from 2012, according to early voting data from Thursday.A Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday showed Clinton ahead in North Carolina, 47% to Trump's 44%.Obama won 68% of the Hispanic vote in North Carolina in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center.

1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/nevada-early-vote-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/index.html	In key regions, the party is matching or outpacing the lead President Barack Obama had at this point in 2012 on his way to a nearly 7-percentage-point win of the state's six electoral votes. Clark County -- home of Las Vegas and more than two-thirds of Nevada's active registered voters -- saw its record for single-day early vote turnout shattered Friday when 57,174 people cast their ballots, according to data from the Nevada secretary of state's office that's based on the party registration of those who have voted.Overall, Democrats have built a lead of more than 72,000 votes there -- 13.7 points ahead of Republicans, and slightly larger than Obama's 2012 edge. It's no surprise Democrats are ahead there, but the gap is more than double what Republicans say they need it to be. A GOP official said Trump could afford to lose Clark County by 6 points and still carry the state. Democrats also cast more ballots in Washoe County -- Nevada's second biggest, the home of Reno, and historically a swing region that Republicans believed they would win in this election cycle. Statewide, Democrats have an edge of 46,000 votes, or 6 points. That's roughly the same as Obama's 48,000-vote lead after early voting in 2012 -- which grew when more Democrats than Republicans turned out on Election Day. Nevada could be 2016's best test of polls against early voting data. A CNN/ORC poll out this week found Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton, 49% to 43%. Democrats are bullish that burgeoning Latino turnout will help carry the state -- and also tip other battlegrounds like Florida, Colorado and potentially even Arizona in their favor. In Las Vegas, the Culinary Union Local 226 -- which represents housekeepers, cooks, dealers and more at casinos in town -- has also run its own ground game.Perhaps the biggest question now is whether those Latinos who cast their ballots early include significant shares of new or low-propensity voters. Nevada does not release breakdowns of the ethnicity of their voters. The state is also one of the nation's easiest to analyze for early voting trends. Nevada officials publish up-to-date early voting data daily -- and unlike swing states like North Carolina, the early voting laws haven't changed and the window has remained the same since 2012. Overall, 767,000 Nevadans have voted early -- more than half the state's active registered voters, and ahead of 2012's figure of 705,000 early votes -- when about 7 in 10 Nevada voters cast their ballots early. If 2012's turnout of 81% of Nevada's active registered voters holds in 2016, there could be around 400,000 more votes to be cast. Early vote data is based on party registration. There's no way to know yet whether Democrats necessarily voted for Clinton or Republicans necessarily voted for Trump. Polls show it's likely the vast majority supported their party's nominee, but official results won't come until Election Day. Still, with such a large share of the state having voted early, it will be difficult for Republicans to catch up on Election Day. Nevada is also the site of a crucial Senate race. Democrat Catherine Cortez-Masto is battling GOP Rep. Joe Heck for the seat being vacated by the retiring Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid.

She was a trailblazing columnist who changed the way we look at -- and write -- about politics. I would have been honored just to carry her bags (which I often did). She was a female star, a role model -- not to mention being a brilliant writer who asked the direct questions no one else would. There weren't enough women in the newsroom then, but we were starting to sprout. The boys club was daunting, especially if you wanted to cover politics. I approached it with the sense that maybe I was trying to be initiated into a fraternity where I didn't quite belong.But women did make the move to politics and we did belong. I was in print -- at the Star, then at Newsweek, then at U.S. News and World Report. I ironically always thought that TV was going to be my backup job. Then, of course, print started to literally disappear. And what I discovered was that the skills of being a good broadcast journalist are largely the same as being a good print journalist -- both require the same ability to report, write and explain. Those requirements have remained steadfast.Luckily, other things are very different from back in the day. Here at CNN, it's not uncommon for women to dominate -- whether as correspondents in the field or on political panels. It's not only a different environment, it's a broader environment and I think we cover the news better because of it.But while certain things are better, my younger colleagues have it far from easy. In fact, when I look back -- especially on my days writing weekly at Newsweek (imagine that!) -- the schedule seems so, well, relaxed. At CNN, it isn't uncommon for moms to be at the office early and work through the evenings, particularly in a busy period like the election. The 24/7 news cycle means that they don't have the ability that I had to take a break in my day, go home for dinner, and then continue to work and write in the privacy of my own home. That was definitely true in my print reporter days. And I even remember when, on the campaign trail, all of the focus was getting a story on the evening news. How quaint that all seems now.Today, the girls on the bus are always on -- either traveling, or in the studio or reporting off camera. I marvel -- absolutely marvel -- at their ability to juggle. Sure, I had to juggle things to find balance, too, but not like this. They are champions at what they do, and I stand in awe.When we are in the bureau at the same time -- a rarity these days -- we realize how much we miss the daily camaraderie. In our corner of CNN Washington world, I have my office, and Dana Bash is next door, and Brianna Keilar is there, too. We talk all the time. The great thing about women at CNN is that we value each other and counsel each other. Mommy guilt is a very real thing; we have all been through it, with a sense that no matter where you are you think you should be somewhere else. But we thrive, and so do our children. The support flows both ways between generations here. One tiny example: When I was trying to figure out a cool song to dance to with my son at his wedding, the dance party began in the office next door. We celebrate together, we confide in each other and we trust each other's judgment and reporting.You bring who you are to every story you cover, but you don't cover a story differently just because you are a woman. That diversity may just bring a different question or point of view to an interview or to a piece. It took a while for us all to recognize that, but at least we do now.And that's not changing.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-protester/index.html	"""You have to go back and look and study and see what happened,"" Trump told supporters Friday.So we did. And Trump's description of Obama's response is flatly misleading.Here's what happened: Obama was speaking in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Friday afternoon when a protester stood up holding a Trump sign. That led the crowd of Clinton supporters to boo, a common response to protesters during rallies for both candidates this election.But the President wasn't having it. ""Hold up! Hold up!"" Obama repeatedly called to the crowd, never once addressing the protester and certainly not, as Trump put it, ""really screaming"" at him.More to the point, Obama's rebuke was directed at the Clinton supporters, not the protester. He first told the audience they shouldn't worry about the man, who was peacefully conducting himself.""We live in a country that respects free speech. Second of all, it looks like maybe he might have served in our military and we've got to respect that,"" Obama said. ""Third of all, he was elderly and we've got to respect our elders.""Trump -- who called Obama's response ""a disgrace"" -- didn't mention Obama's plea for respect for the protester. Instead, he said the President ""spent so much time screaming at this protester."" Trump also conveniently forgot to mention Obama's suggestion to angry Clinton protesters.""Don't boo,"" the President said, repeating one of his oft-uttered 2016 phrases. ""Vote."""

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/north-carolina-voter-rolls/index.html	"Michael Hyers, an Air Force retiree from Fayetteville, North Carolina, has spent hours upon hours combing through records, cross-checking addresses and submitting thousands of challenges to voter registrations in an effort to purge voter rolls at the local Cumberland County elections board. He claims to have removed 6,000 people from voter rolls since 2014.He believes it is his duty. ""I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,"" Hyers told CNN, explaining his belief that Democrats have conspired to commit massive voter fraud and he has a responsibility to scrub rolls of voters who have died or moved away.The challenges submitted by Hyers and his group, the Voter Integrity Project, a conservative organization that believes systemic voter fraud exists, became part of a federal lawsuit that accused officials in three North Carolina counties of illegal voter-roll purges that disproportionately targeted African-Americans.The lawsuit, filed by the NAACP, garnered the attention of the Justice Department and independent elections-monitoring groups, and on Friday, a federal judge ordered the state and local boards to restore the purged voters.Federal judge Loretta Biggs described the purges as a ""flawed process"" and specifically noted that one individual in Cumberland County -- where Hyers lives -- challenged the registration of approximately 4,000 local voters.The North Carolina Board of Elections has no evidence the election will be affected by fraud, and in a statement to CNN, a spokesperson said the board works to ensure the integrity of the elections process by investigating allegations, conducting audits during the early voting period and working in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security.Studies have found limited occurrences of voter fraud, such as a 2014 report by Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite, who concluded, ""The scant evidence of arrests, indictments or convictions for any of the practices defined as voter fraud means that little fraud is being committed relative to the millions of votes cast each year in state, local and federal elections.""But Hyers says he has come across news reports and hearsay to the contrary.He also specifically references videos produced by James O'Keefe, the conservative political activist, and his organization, Project Veritas, which shows Democratic operatives purportedly discussing questionable methods to skew the election against Trump. Most of those videos have been found to be inaccurate and highly edited to promote O'Keefe's conservative narrative.Hyers told CNN this has led him to painstakingly research voter records for names and addresses of individuals he says have not voted in two or more federal elections. He then mails letters to those individuals' addresses that explain how his group has determined they may be inactive and urges them to re-register or face possible challenges to their voting status.If the letter comes back to Hyers with the marking ""return to sender,"" he says he files a challenge regardless of the voter's race or political affiliation.""The system is broken,"" Hyers said. ""(The law) was written by the Democrats in such a way as to keep the rolls bloated, so that voter fraud could be done.""Jay DeLancy, who co-organized the Voter Integrity Project in 2011, said his group depends on people like Hyers to do the work that he says official elections boards can't.""We know that there is some level of voter impersonation fraud going on, but it's not prosecutable unless you catch the person in the act, which is impossible to do because there's no ID required,"" Delancy told CNN.Multiple county officials did not to respond to CNN's request for comment regarding how they proceed when private residents such as Hyers challenge registered individuals' eligibility to vote.But in the eyes of Jimmy Buxton, who heads the Fayetteville chapter of the NAACP, all of this amounts to politically motivated voter suppression.Buxton said some individuals such as Hyers and others have found a way to side-step the official process of election boards to examine the accuracy of voter rolls since North Carolina law allows private citizens to submit residency challenges.Buxton said this allows non-government groups to suppress the votes of African Americans, who more often align with Democrats.""It's undercover racism,"" Buxton said.The North Carolina branch of the NAACP filed suit to challenge the en masse cancellations on the grounds that the National Voter Registration Act prohibits systemic voter removal programs within 90 days of a federal election. The suit also charged that the efforts disproportionately targeted African-Americans.In a statement of interest in the case, the Justice Department wrote, ""the purge program at issue here rested on a mass mailing and the silence of voters largely unaware of the potential injury to their voting rights."" The DOJ also has sent election monitors to at least one North Carolina county, Robeson County.The judge's ruling on the case Friday orders the election boards to stop further purges and ensure that voters have the right to vote in person or receive an absentee ballot if they had been denied."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/virginia-felons-voting-rights/index.html	"When Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe announced his plan in April to restore voting rights to more than 200,000 felons, Abdul-Rahman, who spent nearly two decades behind bars for armed robbery before struggling with drug and alcohol abuse, immediately logged online to check on his voting status. He discovered that, for the first time in his life, he was eligible to vote.""I was not whole when I came out of prison, both politically and emotionally,"" says Abdul-Rahman, 53. ""But having my right to vote back has made me feel whole as a human being.""Now, he wants to help other ex-convicts experience that feeling. Critical counties: Prince William, Virginia, a long-term warning to the GOPAbdul-Rahman, who works at the New Virginia Majority, a progressive organizing group, has been canvassing around neighborhoods in Richmond in recent weeks encouraging new voters -- many of whom are former felons -- to vote in next week's presidential election.""Most people in this area won't register because they feel discouraged,"" he says. ""They feel like they don't matter.""A politically charged issueIn April, McAuliffe, a Democrat and ally of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, signed an executive order to restore voting rights to more than 200,000 convicted felons. The order allowed those who had served their time and completed supervised probation or parole the right to vote, run for office and right to serve on a jury.McAuliffe said the move was necessary to remove barriers that unfairly disenfranchised many Virginians, particularly minorities. Republicans, however, decried his decision as politically motivated, saying it was a move to add more Democratic voters to the rolls of a battleground state in an election year. CNN rates the state as close but leaning Democratic.Three months later, Virginia's Supreme Court overruled McAuliffe, saying he didn't have the authority to grant ""blanket, group pardons"" and that he would have to do so individually.McAuliffe quickly vowed to do so, and has restored the rights to more than 67,000 former felons since the July decision, according to Sam Coleman, his spokesman. Coleman added that of these, nearly 21,000 have registered to vote.For those felons whose voting rights have been restored, they need to first check their status to see if they are eligible to vote. If their information is not in the state system, they need to petition the state for approval and, if they're permitted to vote, they then need to register.Empowerment through votingOn Chicago Avenue in the Blackwell neighborhood, residents walk past trash strewn across sidewalks and in vacant store parking lots. They smell the stench from a dead cat lying in the middle of the street, flies surrounding its body. On the lawns of vacant houses, only small patches of grass remain, but they're littered with plastic cups and scraps of paper. In this community, when Abdul-Rahman approaches residents, he doesn't ask them if they're registered to vote. He asks if they want things to change.""Aren't you tired of seeing this when you walk out of your house?"" he asks 43-year-old Jonathan Quarles. ""We won't have to keep looking at the dead cat that has been laying there since last week.""Quarles knows this neighborhood all too well, having grown up here. He's also dealt with some obstacles in his past.He admits to Abdul-Rahman that he has been in and out of jail for years after violating probation but hasn't been back in more than five years. After securing a full-time job at a power washing company in Richmond and now having his voting rights restored, Quarles feels like he is being offered a second chance. ""If you deny a person the right to vote, they will never be equal in a society,"" he says.He says he is going to vote for Clinton because he believes she is the only presidential candidate fit for the role. Katrina Miller, 51, was among the first group of people Abdul-Rahman helped in this neighborhood. She was able to register to vote in August after learning that her voting rights were restored in June.  With a smile on her face and a walking cane in her right hand, she says she didn't know she was eligible to vote until Abdul-Rahman looked up her status. Even though she has not voted yet, she says she's going to vote for Clinton because ""I don't like the things Donald Trump says about women.""Miller grew up in Richmond and joined the Army after high school. A few years ago, Miller was incarcerated for assault and battery and then involved in an accident that left her extremely impaired. She says the lack of employment options and her injuries have left her unable to care for herself, forcing her to live on the street.However, after receiving government assistance, she now lives in an apartment and spends most of her time sitting on a stoop near the Broomfield Christian Methodist Episcopal church, where members clothe and feed her.Abdul-Rahman believes that restoring the right to vote for people like Miller gives them a sense of self-determination.""Voting is power,"" he says. ""The more people who get to vote, the more power they have.""Abdul-Rahman has helped other former felons that carry this same sentiment, such as 52-year-old Howard Robinson, who is eager to get out to the election polls to cast his ballot vote for the first time in his life. Robinson served 30 years in prison for a murder he claims was in self-defense. He is currently on living on disabilities due to mental health problems.On Saturday, he'll help Abdul-Rahman organize a community meeting at the Broomfield church to inform residents about the importance of voting and making sure they turn out on Election Day.""If I have to pay taxes and I am following the laws,"" Robinson says, ""I should have the right to decide who gets to make the laws."""

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/ari-fleischer-blank-president-vote/index.html	"Fleischer, who served former President George W. Bush, announced his decision to leave the option for president blank on his 2016 ticket in an op-ed for The Washington Post published on Friday.""On Tuesday, if someone puts a gun to my head and tells me to make a choice, I'll say 'shoot,'"" Fleischer writes. Fleischer said he would vote Republican for the entirety of the ballot, just not for Donald Trump. And he remains adamantly opposed to Clinton, citing ""the numerous lies she told about her private email server and classified records,"" among others. ""Those lies were the warm-up act — get ready for really dishonest Clinton if she wins,"" he writes. ""If this race were about change, Clinton or policy, Trump could win it. But he made it about himself. Because he is one of the most unpopular people ever to run for president, that was a big mistake,"" Fleischer continued.With three days until Election Day, Americans who are on the fence or undecided are running out of time to make their final decision for president. Instead of leaving the ballot blank like Fleischer, those who are opposed to both major party candidates have chosen to write-in. Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- a former 2016 GOP presidential contender -- voted for Arizona Sen. John McCain, voting straight Republican down the ballot, said his spokesman, Chris Schrimpf.  "	George W.
