David Petraeus and Nidal Hassan under the headline: ""Who is the threat? Insiders.""""We have confirmed that the slide was developed 18 months ago and used locally as a part of a training presentation on best practices for handling classified material and maintaining operational security,"" the US Army Training and Doctrine Command said in a statement. ""As is common with Army training requirements, the local unit was given latitude to develop their own training products to accomplish the overall training objective.""""This particular presentation had not been reviewed or approved by the unit's leadership, and does not reflect the position of the Army,"" the statement continued. ""The training presentation has since been removed."" The slide was used at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, according to reports. Clinton's inclusion would appear to be inspired by her use of a private email server during her four years at the State Department. While FBI Director James Comey said in July that Clinton's actions were ""extremely careless,"" he recommended that no criminal charges be brought against her and none were.The slide identified a handful of ""careless or disgruntled employees"" as examples of an insider ""threat.""Manning, a former Army private, is serving a 35-year prison sentence for providing classified documents to Wikileaks, while Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, fled to Russia after leaking top secret documents in 2013. Hassan, a US Army major, was responsible for the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 people dead. Petraeus, the former Army general and CIA director, pleaded guilty last year to mishandling classified information. He was sentenced to two years probation and fined $100,000. The slide also included a photo of Aaron Alexis, the gunman behind the 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting that killed 12 people.The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""These are really hard-working people that are taking jobs that U.S. citizens don't want.""The former governor of New Mexico was dismissive of recent signals that the Republican nominee could moderate some of his immigration proposals, including his previous call to round up and deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.""He still says he wants to build a wall across the border,"" Johnson said of Trump. ""And, really, he's not going to deport all 11 million. He's going to keep some.""Trump's hard-line position on the issue of immigration has animated his campaign more than any other, but that once-resolute stance has turned fuzzy this week.

By 1951, it was scuttled about 30 miles from San Francisco. No one had laid eyes on the warship for 65 years -- until this week. Scientists led by Robert Ballard, the deep-sea explorer known for his discoveries of the Titanic and the German battleship Bismarck, surveyed the USS Independence this week, using remotely operated vehicles. The Ocean Exploration Trust has made the expedition available on live stream. The effort to rediscover the USS Independence is a partnership with Ballard, the Ocean Exploration Trust and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Aircraft carrier that survived atomic blasts lies at bottom of PacificThe team's monthlong exploration of the California coast aboard the exploration vessel Nautilus has been eventful. It made headlines this month after discovering a cartoonish, googly-eyed stubby squid. Researchers also are mapping and documenting other shipwrecks, including the freighter Dorothy Windermote, which also sunk off San Francisco. The USS Independence remains remarkably intact, resting in depths of 2,600 feet.Studded with all sorts of marine life, the aircraft carrier still has at least one Grumman Hellcat plane and anti-aircraft weaponry left on its deck.Researchers will photograph and measure technical details of the sunken ship. They'll also assess how marine life has turned the ship into their artificial home. 	USS Independence: Sunken World War II aircraft carrier explored	[]	[]
3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/john-mccain-donald-trump-arizona-primary/index.html	"The Republican has been their US senator since 1986, in office longer than some of the people at this campaign stop have been alive. With just days to go before Arizona's August 30 primary, McCain is methodically making the rounds —from police association endorsements to speeches for high tech CEO's to this trucking company's town hall. McCain moves deftly from answering a question on the state's solar energy infrastructure to slamming the President's signature health care law, calling it an ""unmitigated disaster"" in Arizona. Throughout this town hall, he dabbles in self-deprecating jokes about being in office since Calvin Coolidge's presidency and then brings up reality TV star Snookie, of ""Jersey Shore"" fame. The 79-year-old McCain sees his age as a punchline, not a liability. The gathered crowd laughed and listened. ""I thought long and hard before I decided to run for reelection,"" said McCain, his tone shifting to reflection. ""This is a tough business and we all know campaigns are tough. I believe the nation needs the kind of knowledge and background I have on national security."" 2016 candidate matchmakerThere's little doubt what McCain believes will keep him in office for a sixth term — his decades of experience. In the political year dominated by the rise of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, established politicians are choosing to flee the real estate tycoon, embrace him or carefully balance the tenuous line between their establishment experience and his outsiderism. McCain is walking that high wire -- endorsing Trump but recently issued a statement criticizing Trump for his public spat with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the gold star parents of a US Muslim soldier killed in Iraq. In the process, McCain has sought to ward off a Republican primary challenger to his right, and a general election Democratic challenger he hopes to face in November.At the moment, McCain's efforts appear to be working. A CNN/ORC poll of Arizona voters out Wednesday, found that McCain has a significant lead over his primary challenger state representative Kelli Ward, as well as his expected Democratic opponent Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick. That same state poll found Trump up 5 percentage points to Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in the state. McCain's Republican Primary Challenger""I think it's time for you, and for me, to retire McCain"" Ward enthusiastically told the crowd of about 75 supporters a the Phoenix restaurant, and the audience ate it up. Ward's line was expected, especially given that her campaign workers have ""#RetireMcCain"" on the back of their bright yellow t-shirts. The mood at this Ward meet-and-greet is squarely anti-establishment, and McCain is the ultimate established candidate. ""I've actually voted for John McCain,"" said Daniel Monson, as he picked up a Kelli Ward yard sign. He stressed that his vote was in the past and he won't vote for McCain this year, saying he wants a tougher stance on immigration. ""He's been in there since before I've been alive,"" said Rebecca Oakley, referring to the senator's tenure in office. ""He's been in there before the internet. If you've been in there since before the internet, it's time for you to go."" Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college map""Obviously there's an age difference,"" said Ward, pointing out she is about half of John McCain's 79 years. ""Obviously there's a generational difference. He's been in Washington for nearly 40 years. Four decades in Washington. It's a long, long time and people are ready for that change.""Ward projects youth and energy as she works her event, taking selfies with babies and running to her car to make fundraising calls before her next stop. But by nearly all measures, from fundraising to commercial ad buys to state polling, Ward remains a long shot. Closer, though, than any primary challenger in years, said Seth Leibsohn, conservative pundit and radio host in Phoenix. ""She's a very serious candidate. John McCain hasn't faced that in a primary ever."" Trump: 'There could certainly be a softening' on immigration stanceThat Ward is even registering among Arizona Republicans is why Leibsohn introduced the candidate on his radio show recently as the ""little engine that could, taking on one of the GOP establishment's most famous names.""Ward's outsider appeal is McCain's biggest risk in the primary, believes Leibsohn. ""The mood of this country has changed, the mood of the conservative movement has changed. The mood of the Republican party has changed."" But what hasn't changed is McCain's ability to win the home field, said Leibsohn. ""He never stops. And he does a very good job during election years of reconnecting with his base.""         The Democratic Challenger As a Democrat, Kirkpatrick doesn't share much in terms of policy with Kelli Ward. But she does echo Ward's sentiment about McCain's senate seat: change. ""It's time. John McCain has been in Washington for 33 years. And a lot of people feel he's out of touch with what's in Arizona,"" Kirkpatrick said. Kirkpatrick is expected to face McCain in the general election. She senses a different opening created for her in the year of Trump — McCain's continued support of Trump in the face of changing demographics in Arizona. Trump's sagging national poll numbers, hope Arizona Democrats, will nudge reliably Republican red Arizona, closer toward purple.Taste test 2016: Clinton's cookies vs. Trump's cookiesIt's a shift changing with the population of this border state. Pew Research Center data says the Latino population in Arizona is the sixth largest in the nation, making up 31% of the state's population. Arizona Democrats believe Trump's call to build a border wall and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants has created an opening in 2016.""What I don't like is John McCain continues to support Donald Trump in spite of the fact that Donald Trump insulted a gold star family. He said really racist things including immigrants and insulted John McCain himself. What I hear from people is that they feel John McCain is trying to save his political career and does not represent Arizona,"" Kirkpatrick said.McCain's campaign and his super PACs have already pivoted to the November election, rolling out anti-Kirkpatrick ads. The congresswoman hopes to galvanize the anti-Trump forces across Arizona and that adds up to her taking down her state's political Goliath in the general election. Her race to take McCain's seat remains a tight calculus. In 2012, Mitt Romney won the state's 11 electoral votes by 9 points. ""This race is going to be close,"" Kirkpatrick said.McCain, the CloserIf McCain has any doubts, he's not sharing them as the primary ticks closer. This month, as CNN followed him at campaign events in Phoenix, a smiling McCain paused before our camera to say, ""Campaign's gone very well. We're doing very well. We're very confident.""Kirkpatrick's campaign has issued attack ads and statements about McCain's support of Trump despite the GOP presidential nominee's public battle with the gold star family. McCain remains steadfast in his support of his party's nominee, saying, ""I've made my position extremely clear."" In response to Khizr Khan's call for McCain to withdraw his support of Trump, McCain said, ""I understand his anger and frustration as only a grieving family can. I will make my decisions based on what I think is best for America.""McCain's humility remains plainly visible, calling 2016 the ""race of his life."" But he follows up by adding this, ""I've said that in every race I've been in. That's why I've won."""

The pop icon was widely criticized for the comments, but she remained defiant on Twitter Wednesday.""Had I Known I'd Get Such Vicious Hate 4 Supporting Hillary, I Would Have Done It Anyway,"" Cher tweeted Wednesday. ""We Seem 2 b a Country DIVIDED.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/arizona-north-carolina-polls-trump-clinton/index.html	Trump is the choice of 43% of registered voters in Arizona, while Clinton stands at 38%, followed by Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson at 12% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 4%. In North Carolina, Clinton stands at 44%, Trump at 43% and Johnson at 11%. Stein will not appear on the ballot there. Full poll results for ArizonaLooking at the narrower pool of those likely to turn out in November, the race doesn't change significantly in either state. Trump's lead in Arizona widens slightly to 7 points, while the 1-point difference between the two candidates in North Carolina shifts to a tied race. Likely voters become a more meaningful subgroup as the election gets closer and voters settle on whether they will turn out and whom they will support. Campaign manager points to 'undercover Trump vote' in polling gapNorth Carolina could be critical to Trump's campaign, given recent polling suggesting Clinton holds a wide lead in neighboring Virginia and in Pennsylvania. Should those electorally-rich states remain off the board, North Carolina's 15 votes become more important for Trump's path to victory.Full poll results for North CarolinaThe education gap among white registered voters that has been among the sharpest electoral divides in pre-election polling on this race thus far continues in both states, but it is nearly twice as wide a gap in North Carolina as in Arizona. Clinton tops Trump by 8 points among whites with college degrees in North Carolina, but Trump tops Clinton by a whopping 42 points among those whites without degrees in North Carolina, meaning the education gap there stands at 50 points. In Arizona, Trump is ahead in both groups, by a statistically insignificant 2 percentage points among those with degrees and a far wider 30 points among whites without degrees, making for a 28-point gap between the two groups. Poll: Clinton has narrow advantage over Trump in OhioBoth North Carolina and Arizona also illustrate the challenges Trump may face in his newly launched effort to appeal to minority voters. In North Carolina, more than 20% of the electorate was black in 2012, and about 18% of Arizona voters were Latino, according to exit polls in each state. In the new polls, Trump trails by a wide margin in both subgroups. Among blacks in North Carolina, 88% say they support Clinton, 7% Johnson and just 3% Trump. Among Hispanic voters in Arizona, 57% back Clinton, 20% Trump, 15% Johnson and 5% Stein. A key component of Trump's pitch to these groups is his claim to be able to improve their economic situation, yet in both states, non-whites broadly trust Clinton over Trump on handling the economy, with Hispanics in Arizona breaking 61% to 36% in Clinton's favor and blacks in North Carolina breaking 85% for Clinton to 12% for Trump.There's a gender gap between Clinton and Trump in North Carolina, but women and men in Arizona are largely on the same page. Women break 48% to 40% in Clinton's favor in North Carolina, while men break 47% Trump to 40% Clinton. In Arizona, women and men both favor Trump by narrow margins, 4 points among women, 5 points among men.Poll: Clinton up big on Trump in VirginiaTrump's lead in Arizona is also bolstered by support from independent voters, who back him by a 41% to 27% margin, with 20% behind Johnson. In North Carolina, independent voters are more evenly split, 40% Trump to 38% Clinton with 18% behind Johnson. In both states, Trump has an edge over Clinton as more trusted to handle both the economy and terrorism, two top issues for voters nationally. Voters in both states say Clinton is better able to handle foreign policy. In Arizona, where immigration policy has been a front-and-center issue for years, Trump holds a 6-point lead as more trusted on that issue, and he also narrowly tops Clinton by 3 points on handling health care. Arizona has been deeply affected by insurers curtailing their presence in the health care exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, with Pinal County becoming the first in the nation where no insurers are selling their policies on the exchange there. 2016 candidate matchmakerIn North Carolina, Clinton and Trump are about even on who would better handle immigration (49% choose Trump, 47% Clinton), and Clinton has a 5-point lead on handling health care. Clinton's position in North Carolina is bolstered by a sense that she can better handle the responsibilities that come with being commander in chief (50% trust her vs. 43% who trust Trump on that score) and that she better shares voters values (47% think Clinton does, 42% Trump). Trump tops Clinton as more honest and trustworthy (49% to 39%), and 11% say neither major party candidate for president has the edge on honesty. In Arizona, the share who see neither as honest and trustworthy rises to 16%, and Trump continues to top Clinton on that measure (49% to 33%). The two are closer on shared values in the western battleground (44% Trump to 43% Clinton), but Clinton holds a 5-point lead as a better commander in chief. Among veterans, however, Trump tops Clinton on that in both states. In Arizona, veterans say Trump would better handle being commander-in-chief by a 56% to 35% margin; in North Carolina, it's a narrower 49% to 42%. Trump also holds an overall lead in veterans' vote preference in both places.How to register to vote in every US state and territoryPresident Barack Obama's rising approval ratings have been a boon to Clinton nationally, though in these two states, the President's ratings remain mixed. Among registered voters in North Carolina, 49% approve and 49% disapprove, while in Arizona, they tilt toward disapproval, 51% disapprove and 46% approve. Those North Carolina marks represent an improvement for the Democratic President compared with 2014, when majorities disapproved of his work as president just before that year's midterm elections.Both states also feature high-profile races for the Senate in addition to the presidential battle this year. In Arizona, John McCain, the former Republican nominee for president, holds healthy leads over the Republican challengers he will face in next Tuesday's primary election and over his likely Democratic opponent in November, Ann Kirkpatrick. McCain tops Kelli Ward by a 55% to 29% margin among likely Republican primary voters, while he tops Kirkpatrick by a 52% to 39% margin among registered voters.Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college mapIn North Carolina, the race between incumbent Republican Sen. Richard Burr and Democratic challenger Deborah Ross is near-even; 49% of registered voters back Burr, 46% Ross. Burr holds a slightly larger 5-point lead among those likely to turn out in November. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory trails his Democratic challenger Roy Cooper in that race, with Cooper up 6 points among both registered and likely voters.The CNN/ORC polls in Arizona and North Carolina were conducted by telephone August 18 through 23. In Arizona, 1,003 adults were interviewed in English or Spanish depending on the respondent's preference, including 842 registered voters. In North Carolina, the sample of 1,009 adults included 912 registered voters. The margin of sampling error for results among registered voters is 3.5 percentage points in each state.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/iranian-vessels-come-within-300-yards-of-us-destroyer/index.html	"Another US patrol craft and a Kuwaiti Navy ship were also harassed in the incident, which took place in the northern end of the Persian Gulf.At one point, the Iranian boat came within 200 yards of one of the US Navy boats. When it failed to leave the area after the Navy had fired flares and had a radio conversation with the Iranian crew, the US officials said, the USS Squall fired three warning shots. Following standard maritime procedures, the Navy fired the three shots into the water to ensure the Iranians understood they needed to leave the immediate area. Iran nuclear deal one year out: The good, bad, and uglyState Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said incidents like this one ""unnecessarily escalate tensions,"" adding that the US doesn't know Iran's intentions.In an encounter Tuesday, a US Navy official told CNN four Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels conducted a ""high-speed intercept"" of the USS Nitze in waters near the Strait of Hormuz Tuesday, deeming the incident ""unsafe and unprofessional.""The official said two of the vessels slowed and turned away only after coming within 300 yards of the US guided-missile destroyer as it transited international waters near the Strait of Hormuz, and only after the destroyer had sent multiple visual and audio warnings.US sent plane with $400 million in cash to IranThe incidents are only the latest in a series of all-too-close encounters with Iran in the region since December. These brushes have included Iranian rocket launches, drones flying over US vessels and the capture of US sailors in January. They come against the backdrop of renewed US diplomatic contacts with Iran, which has triggered a political backlash among Iranian hardliners, including the powerful IRGC.  In the wake of Tuesday's incident, the Nitze and US Naval Forces Central Command have determined that the Iranian vessels were violating international law and maritime standards, acting dangerously and unprofessionally.The Iranian vessels moved at high speed toward the Nitze, which was operating in accordance with international law in international waters and ignored maritime ""rules of the road"" as set out in the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. According to the Navy official, the IRGC vessels ignored multiple warnings, creating a dangerous, harassing environment that could have pushed the Nitze to take defensive measures, escalating the situation.The US Naval Forces Central Command is responsible for approximately 2.5 million square miles of area that stretches from the Arabian Gulf to the Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, parts of the Indian Ocean and 20 countries.Tuesday's encounter took place as the Nitze and the guided-missile destroyer USS Mason were conducting what the official said was a routine transit near the internationally recognized strait. The official spoke to CNN anonymously to discuss military matters. The four IRGC vessels approached at high speed. After identifying them, the Nitze tried 12 times to make contact by radio without receiving a response, according to the Navy official. As two of the Iranian vessels continued to barrel toward the Nitze at high speed, the destroyer used an internationally recognized maritime danger signal three times.That signal -- five short blasts of the ship's whistle -- is used when another vessel's intentions are not understood or its indicated course is dangerous. At the same time, the Nitze also used visual warnings, firing 10 flares in the direction of the approaching vessels. Again, the destroyer got no response, the official said.Despite the Nitze's close proximity to off-shore oil rigs, the ship altered course to move away from the approaching Iranian vessels and avoid a potential collision. Only after the two Iranian vessels had closed to within 300 yards of Nitze did they slow their speed before ultimately moving away.The intercept was another tense incident between the longtime foes over the past year.In December, as part of a life-fire exercise, Iran's military fired a rocket near the American aircraft carrier, the USS Harry Truman. And in January, the IRGC captured 10 American sailors when their two Riverine Command Boats accidentally strayed into waters near Iran-controlled Farsi Island, in the Persian Gulf. The sailors were released soon after.  Later that month, Iran reportedly flew an unarmed drone over a US warship, a move that a US navy official called ""abnormal and unprofessional.""In July, Iranian ships sailed close to USS New Orleans while Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of Central Command, was aboard. "	Iran US fires warning shots at Iranian vessel after close encounter	[]	[]
7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/donald-trump-outreach-minority-voters/index.html	"A senior Trump adviser characterized the strategy as ""part of an ongoing conversation"" and said the campaign is ""looking forward.""As first reported by The Washington Post, the campaign is planning to make trips to diverse and urban areas and focus on an economic and job-centric theme.  Some of the effort has already been evident. Trump spent much of last week making a pitch directly to African-American voters, though his choice of words was still criticized at times. Trump: There could be a 'softening' on immigrationAsking black voters, ""what the hell do you have to lose,"" Trump made the case that he and Republicans would be better for black Americans than Democrats, who have historically been overwhelmingly favored by minority voters. Trump has previously delivered his message to mostly white audiences in predominantly white suburbs, drawing criticism. On Wednesday night, however, Trump will hold a rally in Jackson, Mississippi, a city that is roughly 80% black, according to Census data. Trump has also discussed openness to ""softening"" his tone on immigration, after a hard-line position that put him to the far right of the spectrum helped buoy his candidacy in the primaries. That change in tone is interpreted as a move to try to improve his standing with Latino voters, a growing demographic. Trump: 'What the hell do you have to lose?'Trump met last weekend with a Hispanic advisory council, and this week will meet with a roundtable of African-American and Hispanic fellows with the GOP's Republican Leadership Initiative. The firebrand GOP candidate has struggled with minorities in recent polls. In a recent Pew Research poll, Trump was at 2% support among black voters and 26% among Hispanics. A Monmouth poll this month found that Trump only picked up 10% of non-white voters. Trump has brought on new campaign leadership in the past week, parting ways with former Chairman Paul Manafort and bringing in Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and Breitbart executive Steve Bannon as chief executive. One of his early endorsers among his former opponents, Ben Carson, has been a high-profile African-American voice for Trump, and Carson's business manager Armstrong Williams confirmed that the retired neurosurgeon would help in the new outreach effort.""He fully recognizes that he's probably not going to win the majority, anywhere near the majority of African-American votes, because of tradition. However, after you enact the right policies,"" Carson told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Wednesday. ""I think people are going to be more interested in things that work ... and I think it's going to be an exciting time in America when that happens."" Williams said the Trump campaign would be making a concerted effort to visit black churches, and added that Trump and Carson are also planning a trip to visit disadvantaged neighborhoods in Detroit.""They will be visiting black churches, and it's important to visit black churches because black churches have always been a pinnacle of the community,"" Williams said, adding those kinds of visits can help boost Trump's credibility among African-Americans. When Carson first endorsed Trump during the primaries they often touted their plans to reach out to minority voters and campaign in areas where Republicans don't usually campaign, Williams said, and Trump felt like he already had a base of support within the black community and that his business background had given him some credibility there. But Trump didn't foresee that he would be cast as a racist. ""What he could not anticipate is there would be a narrative pushed by the Democratic Party and the media that somehow he was a racist. They sort of redefined him to the point that a lot of the support that he thought he had, he began to realize was not there,"" Williams said. Williams said Trump's new campaign leadership support the outreach, and acknowledges it carries risks. But he said Trump is doing it because he wants to. ""With the days left in the campaign, think about this, he's making an investment that could possibly not generate a great return,"" Williams said. ""What's the best case scenario? Could he get four, five or 10 (percent)? ... It's a principled position for him.""Not everyone in the Trump campaign is convinced the candidate can make a credible pitch to minority voters with less than 90 days until the election. One Trump adviser said Trump already has to battle the perception that he is a racist and added that his hiring Steve Bannon could only make that more difficult. Bannon has been criticized for allegedly using racist rhetoric during his tenure at Breitbart. And the website has been accused creating a haven for white nationalist rhetoric. ""Doesn't that eventually undermine whatever minority outreach 'strategy' you come up with?"" the adviser said. Bruce LeVell, the executive director of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, said his group has already spent months on outreach to minority communities that don't traditionally vote Republican.LeVell said he and other members of the coalition often make their Trump pitch on urban radio stations. Rather than criticizing Obama, LeVell said he focuses on the future and how Trump can help disadvantaged communities.""Our sale is 'hey, let us try for four years,'"" LeVell said. ""You've lived 40, 50 years in this community with schools you're having problems with. Give us a chance. Give us four years. If we can't do it, vote us out.""""I think that's going to really resonate with a lot of communities that have been hurting,"" LeVell said."

On Tuesday, he seized on an Associated Press report on the high number of foundation contributors she received in meetings at Foggy Bottom.The sprawling, complex structure of the foundation, its history of contributions from foreign power brokers and its attractiveness as a Republican line of attack mean it's likely to stay in the spotlight.But the glare of public attention hasn't always been so enlightening about the nature of the foundation and its activities. Here's a closer look.What is the Clinton Foundation?Bill Clinton set up the public charity after he wrapped up his presidency in 2001 with the idea of bringing government, businesses and social groups together to tackle big problems. It was kind of a new idea at the time. On Monday, Clinton wrote in a post on Medium that the foundation is about ""creating opportunities and solving problems faster, better, at lower cost so that more people are empowered to build better futures for themselves, their families and their communities.""  Trump, RNC seize on new report to attack Clinton FoundationBut ... what is it?The foundation is made up of 11 non-profit groups that work on four major issues: global health and wellness, climate change, economic development and improving opportunities for girls and women.  How does it work?It's what philanthropists call an operating foundation, which means it doesn't give much money to outside groups to fulfill its mission. In 2014, the foundation gave less than 3% of revenue to other non-profits. Instead, the foundation does its own work, with staff and partners around the world.What kind of work? Health is a big focus. In more than 70 countries, according to the foundation, it helps 11.5 million people, including 800,000 children, with HIV/AIDS get their medication at 90% lower cost -- more than half the adults and three-quarters of the children getting treatment in the world today. But it does all kinds of other work as well. For instance, it helps East African farmers get better seeds and fertilizers. It supported Nepal's reconstruction after the 2015 earthquakes. And it has connected more than 500,000 Latin Americans to job training and entrepreneurship opportunities.Okay. So it's an international do-good group?Yes. And no. The Clinton Foundation does tons of work in the US, too. Some examples: It has a school program that operates in every state, affecting more than 31,000 schools and 18 million students by its count. That program is to improve physical education, child nutrition, health education and staff wellness programs. They also work on prescription drug addiction. The foundation wants to halve the number of opioid overdoses -- right now those drugs kill more Americans than car accidents.Foundation becomes campaign issueIs the foundation the same thing as the Clinton Global Initiative?The Clinton Global Initiative is part of the foundation. Bill Clinton started CGI in 2005. In contrast to other parts of the organization, it doesn't fund or manage projects, or handle any of the money involved. Instead, it's like the OKCupid of the charity world, matching funders with good causes. They do this at events throughout the year, including a big annual meeting in New York every September that's a who's who of global movers-and-shakers. (Bono? Check.)  So ... lots of charity hook-ups? Since the first annual meeting in 2005, CGI says it has helped make more than 3,500 pledges, or ""commitments,"" between funders and projects. In real-life terms, that means more than 430 million people in more than 180 countries have had their lives touched. Carville: People will die if the Clinton Foundation is shut downMore than 46 million children have gotten access to a better education, the foundation calculates. CGI says it has raised more than $313 million to research and develop new vaccines, medicines and diagnostics. And it has helped more than 27 million people have better access to safe drinking water and sanitation.If the Clinton Foundation is doing all this good, why the suspicion?Because of concerns about transparency and -- especially after Hillary Clinton became secretary of state -- concerns that some donors, especially foreign governments, may have been trying to buy influence.Meet Huma Abedin: Hillary Clinton's right-hand womanThe AP reported Tuesday that during her time as secretary, more than half of Clinton's meetings with people outside government were with donors to the Clinton Foundation. These included executives at Estee Lauder, which was working with the State Department on a gender violence project in South Africa, and the founder of a non-profit bank who was asking for help because the government of Bangladesh pressured him to resign.What did the State Department have to say about that? The deputy spokesman, Mark Toner, said in a statement Tuesday that ""individuals, including those who have donated to political campaigns, non-profits, or foundations -- including the Clinton Foundation -- may contact or have meetings with officials in the administration. A wide range of outside individuals and organizations contact the State Department. Meeting requests, recommendations and proposals come to the department through a variety of channels both formal and informal.""  What's the issue with transparency?  Who the foundation was getting money from, basically. When Clinton took the State Department job in 2008, she promised President Barack Obama that the foundation would publish all its donors every year. And ... that didn't happen.State Department ordered to review 15,999 new Clinton emailsReuters discovered that from 2010 to 2013, the foundation's health arm wasn't disclosing all of its donors -- leaving out countries like Switzerland and lumping together individuals as one big group. And the foundation didn't tell the State Department that countries such as Australia and the UK doubled and tripled their donations between 2009 and 2012 while Clinton was secretary.What do Clinton's opponents have to say about all this, you ask?No surprise, Trump has been hitting this theme hard, trying to use the foundation to undermine Clinton. This week in Akron, Ohio, he reeled off accusations without offering proof, saying that, ""No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as secretary of state."" He's calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the foundation. Is it only Republicans who rap the foundation?No. There's been a lot of media coverage of possible ""pay-for-play"" deals while Clinton was at state. So far, though, there are no smoking guns. The Wall Street Journal has said that the foundation has benefitted Clinton friends. And Fox News raised questions about the State Department's consideration of a Nigerian land purchase in March 2013 from two Lebanese-Nigerian brothers who donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation. Clinton left the State Department on February 1, 2013,  and the real estate deal never took place.Any Democratic critics?In a June interview with CNN's Jake Tapper during primary season, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's only remaining Democratic challenger, said that foundation donors like Saudi Arabia created the appearance of a conflict of interest. ""Do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state ... collects millions of dollars from foreign governments ... dictatorships,"" Sanders said. ""Do I have a problem with that? Yeah, I do.""Is it weird that the Clinton Foundation has foreign donors?It turns out that foreign donations to US foundations and charities are common.""Like other nonprofits, the Clinton Foundation is chasing after grant money from the real foundations that have it, like Gates and Rockefeller, as well as foreign governments, most of which also donate to other major nonprofits,"" Inside Philanthropy's editor in chief David Callahan has written.What do the Clintons say in response to all these accusations? The foundation has always rejected the ""pay-for-play"" accusations. The health arm of the foundation said there were various reasons for not disclosing all its donors. Bill Clinton said The Wall Street Journal story about the foundation benefitting his friends wasn't accurate. And foundation spokesman Craig Minassian has said that Clinton's friends are involved in CGI commitments because they also care about making a positive impact. So what happens if Clinton becomes the next president? ""The process of determining the Clinton Foundation's future if Hillary becomes President has not been easy,"" Bill Clinton wrote in his Monday Medium post. ""It's an unprecedented situation, so there's no blueprint to follow.""If Clinton wins, foundation says it won't take foreign moneyThat said, he laid out some steps the foundation will take if his wife wins. It will only accept donations from US citizens, legal residents and US-based independent foundations, he wrote. Bill Clinton will step down from the board and stop fundraising. Because a lot of the international work the foundation does is partially funded by foreign governments' aid programs, they'll move those programs to other organizations so they can continue. And, Clinton added, this September will mark the last annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.How does the philanthropic world see the Clinton Foundation?They're held in high esteem. There are watchdog groups that judge charities on how they're run, how transparent they are and how much they spend on programs -- some charities raise a ton of money, but spend a large percentage on salaries and bonuses instead of their actual cause. Charity Watch gave the Clinton Foundation an A grade, while GuideStar gave it a platinum rating.Daniel Borochoff of Charity Watch noted that in 2014, 87.2% of the foundation's funding went to its programs, ""which is really high."" The foundation, he said, does ""really important, valuable work that saves lives of lots of people.""For a while, another group called Charity Navigator had the Clinton Foundation on a watch list because of media reports about possible conflicts of interest. It didn't judge the merit of the reports but wanted to flag for donors that others were raising questions. How does the charity world see the political brouhaha over the foundation?""It's unfortunate that it's become this punching bag, this political punching bag,"" Borochoff said. ""There's a lot of things that are said that are false. If Hillary Clinton wasn't running for president, the Clinton Foundation would be seen as one of the great humanitarian charities of our generation."""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/obama-louisiana-tour-slain-officers-families/index.html	Obama spent time with the family of Alton Sterling -- a black man fatally shot by a police officer in the city on July 5 -- and the families of three law officers who were killed and three officers who were injured in an ambush there 12 days later.The meetings were not open to the media and no information was released.Obama was in Baton Rouge to tour the flood-ravaged area. Thirteen people died and more than 60,000 homes have been damaged in flooding that started nearly two weeks ago.But the trip also gives him a chance to touch on shootings that roiled the nation last month. On July 5, police say, a police officer shot and killed Sterling, an African-American resident of Baton Rouge, outside a convenience store in the city. Two police officers had confronted Sterling after someone called 911 to say that Sterling, who was selling CDs outside the store, had brandished a gun, police said.Police said one officer shot Sterling after Sterling allegedly tried to reach a gun from his pocket. The shooting is under investigation.Sterling's death -- and a July 6 fatal shooting of a black man by police in Minnesota -- spurred protests across the country. During one such protest on the night of July 7, a gunman shot and killed five police officers in Dallas, saying he was upset with the other shootings, police said.On July 17, violence returned to Baton Rogue, where police say Missouri resident Gavin Long shot six law officers. Three -- Baton Rouge police Officers Montrell Jackson and Matthew Gerald and East Baton Rouge sheriff's Deputy Brad Garafola -- were killed.A SWAT officer subsequently shot and killed Long, police say.Long apparently visited Dallas after the shootings there, posting a YouTube video July 10 in which he spoke of the protests, and a notion that victims of bullying need to resort to brute force.One of the officers injured in the Baton Rouge attack, East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's Deputy Nick Tullier, was on life support into August. Earlier this month, Tullier's father, James Tullier, posted to Facebook a touching story about the deputy having helped a stranded motorist and her children the day before he was shot.
