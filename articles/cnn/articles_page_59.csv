Clinton asked. ""I can tell you this, when I am sitting across the table from the Russians or anyone else, I know who I am representing: the American people.""Cuban, who endorsed Clinton earlier this year and was born and raised in Pittsburgh, went a step further, suggesting that Trump, as president, would take bribes.""A (Vladimir) Putin, or an (Julian) Assange, would say to him, 'Donald, if you do this, I will give you $20 billion.' What is 20 billion to them? What is 30 billion?"" Cuban asked. ""For them, that is nothing. If Donald Trump, who rips off people for thousand -- do you think he is going to do what is right for the country, or do you think he is going to take the money?""Cuban continued, ""Do you think he has the temperament to do the right thing? Do you think he has the fortitude to do the right thing? Do you think he cares about you or his bank account?""Cuban has been an outspoken surrogate for Clinton throughout the campaign, effectively getting under Trump's skin by questioning, among other things, whether he is actually a billionaire. Cuban attended the first presidential debate as Clinton's guest, sitting in the front row.Cuban flew with Clinton from her event in Pittsburgh to Detroit for another rally. Speaking with reporters in-flight, the billionaire said that he was ""serious"" when he said Trump could be bought.Asked by a reporter why billionaire Republican donors like the Koch Brothers wouldn't have just bribed him to get out of the race, Cuban responded, ""They did.""Why didn't it work? ""Didn't offer him enough,"" Cuban said.James Davis, a spokesman for the Koch brothers and their super PAC, said the charge ""is completely, completely inaccurate."" A message left with the Trump campaign was not immediately returned.Seemingly feeding off of Cuban's bluntness Friday, Clinton went further than she typically goes in criticizing Trump.""Honestly, I don't know how he lives with himself,"" Clinton said about Trump's tax policy. ""Doesn't he see the millions of women and families struggling? Or does he just not care?""At her rally in Detroit, Clinton said that if Trump wins next week, the United States would have a president who ""has only ever been in it for himself.""""Just last year, he said again that it wouldn't have mattered if we rescued the auto industry, let it go bankrupt,"" Clinton said of President Barack Obama's 2009 auto bailout. ""What is he talking about?""Clinton's comments come as the campaign reaches its final sprint. Clinton will campaign Friday in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio and Florida and Pennsylvania on Saturday. Clinton aides say they are confident they will keep Pennsylvania blue Tuesday, but feel to do so, they will need to boost turnout in both Pittsburgh and the Philadelphia area. The last Republican to win the state was George H.W. Bush in 1988.Michigan also is a state that last went to a Republican in 1988. Clinton's top aides are confident it will go to Clinton on Tuesday but said Friday's trip is an effort to spur turnout in a state where there is no early voting and everyone votes on Election Day.""Michigan is a state we feel like we've got a lead on. We want to make sure we hold that lead, get the vote out, make sure people are enthusiastic,"" said John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman.Clinton was joined at the Pittsburgh event by Steeler icons Franco Harris and Mel Blount. Jokingly, Clinton referred to them as her ""escorts"" on stage.Polls across the country have tightened on Clinton, who once held a substantial lead nationally and in battleground states. But the candidate seemed more at ease Friday morning, joking with attendees about debating Trump three times.""I'll tell you — some of what I heard from my opponent,"" Clinton said smiling, ""it was really hard not to go, 'What did you say?'"""

""I get a big, fat 'I told you so' on Comey being a bad choice,"" Palmieri wrote in an Oct. 27, 2015 email to campaign chairman John Podesta. The email was included in the most recent batch of emails hacked from Podesta's personal account. Its release comes one week after Comey rocked the presidential race with news that the FBI had discovered new Clinton emails.

""I got it all from former FBI agents. Tremendous anger within the FBI about the way, number one, Jim Comey's conclusion (to not recommend criminal charges in July) and, number two, the way they believed they were being obstructed by what they regard as a pretty corrupt Obama Justice Department,"" Giuliani said. ""Cutting off a grand jury investigation, cutting off subpoenas.""But earlier Friday, Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, said he had ""heard about"" a forthcoming FBI announcement before it became public.""This has been boiling up in the FBI. I did nothing to get it out. I had no role in it. Did I hear about it? Darn right I heard about it,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" He continued, ""I can't even repeat the language I heard from the former FBI agents."" A week earlier -- before Comey's disclosure to Congress -- he told Fox News there was a ""pretty big surprise"" coming, though he did not provide further details. He told Blitzer the surprise was an upcoming advertising campaign: ""I knew that was going to come as a big surprise."" Giuliani insisted to Blitzer that he did not receive a tip from someone currently in the FBI.""In my case, it's real simple: I've talked to no FBI agent, I've talked to no Justice Department official. I have no idea about who's leaking information.""The former mayor added that everyone he does talk to in the FBI is a former agent.Blitzer reminded Giuliani that in an October 28 interview on ""The Lars Larson Show,"" the former mayor said he was in contact with former agents ""and a few active agents, who obviously don't want to identify themselves."" ""Well, the information I've been getting is from former FBI agents,"" Giuliani told Blitzer. ""If I did say that, that was wrong."" Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon suggested earlier Friday that an inspector general could have grounds to look into the possible leaking of information to Giuliani.""This sure seems like adequate grounds for an Inspector General review,"" he tweeted.Soon after Fallon's tweet, Reps. Elijah Cummings and John Conyers, Jr., the ranking members of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, called on the Inspector General of the Justice Department to ""conduct an immediate investigation to determine the source of multiple unauthorized—and often inaccurate—leaks from within the FBI to benefit the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.""Speaking to Blitzer Friday, Cummings said, ""Giuliani made it clear, Wolf, that he was getting information from former FBI agents. Now, Mr. Giuliani knows better. He was a former federal prosecutor. You don't use the former prosecutors to launder information coming in from the FBI. That's basically what he said. That's not right."" Cummings said the continuous leaks from this investigation are a ""threat to our democracy,"" noting, ""normally when you ask the FBI whether there this is an investigation, 99.99% of the time, they say, 'No comment.'  Blitzer asked Cummings if he had confidence in Comey. ""Yes. I do. I believe the FBI director is an honorable man. But he made a mistake here,"" Cummings replied.  "	Giuliani changes story on FBI

""I hope you people can...not just vote on the 8th, [but also] go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that it's 100-percent fine,"" Trump told an audience in Pennsylvania.""Immediate relief is necessary,"" Donald J. McTigue, a lawyer for the Ohio Democratic Party argued in court papers filed in the Ohio case. McTigue said that the defendants' including the Trump campaign, the Ohio Republican Party and Trump supporters are engaged in a ""coordinated campaign of vigilante voter intimidation"" and in violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.For McTigue, the stakes are high. ""There are only nine days left until Election Day, and early in-person voting in Ohio is well underway,"" he argued. ""The Ohio Democratic Party, and untold numbers of Ohio voters, will suffer irreparable harm if the right to vote is imperiled by voter suppression and intimidation.""Election law expert Edward B. Foley of the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, says lawsuits filed before the election can have a specific strategy.""Lawsuits filed now to thwart intimidation at the polls on Election Day have a kind of 'table-setting' function,"" he said.Foley said the goal is to get a case on a judge's docket ahead of time, in case lawyers have to go back to the judge quickly for an emergency order. ""They also put the named defendants on notice that if they actually engage in activities that might constitute unlawful intimidation, then those defendants are potentially subject to contempt-of-court sanctions"" he said.Trump lawyers are firing back.""Intimidating voters is illegal, and the Campaign does not remotely condone such conduct,"" Trump campaign lawyer Chad A. Readler of Jones Day wrote a 15-page legal filing in Ohio.""This case is one of four coordinated attacks across the country that are clearly long-planned efforts to sow chaos in the Defendants' political efforts, while garnering maximum publicity for Plaintiff's unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims on the eve of the Presidential Election,"" he wrote.Readler, argued that ""rattling off a litany of alleged statements and actions by various putative 'Trump supporters' and other sundry third parties at various times in different locales simply does not, as a matter of law, establish a conspiracy by the Campaign to engage in voter suppression.""And he said there is no ""articulable evidence"" that the Campaign's alleged statements and actions are the product of ""racial animus.""""Indeed, the Complaint asserts that the Campaign's alleged comments encouraging citizens to serve as poll observers 'are consistently directed at Democratic-leaning communities with large minority populations', which conflates a vital distinction between a putative racial motivation and a partisan motivation.""Regarding Trump's comments concerning poll watchers Readler argued, ""Candidates are perfectly within their rights to encourage their supporters to serve as poll watchers,"" Readler said. ""Supporters of opposing candidates are perfectly within their rights to debate whether an election is at risk of being 'rigged' because of voter fraud,"" he added.He also warned if the Democrats won an injunction it might reach ""all sorts of innocuous, entirely legal conduct -- such as protesting against a candidate on a sidewalk several hundred feet from a polling place.""That, Readler warned, might have First Amendment implications. ""Plaintiff's sweeping request for relief thus runs roughshod over the First Amendment.""A hearing in the Ohio case is scheduled for Friday."

Additionally, DHS will be monitoring for denial of service attacks from its National Cybersecurity and Communications Center on Election Day.RELATED: No, the presidential election can't be hackedConcerns are mounting that next week's presidential election could be affected following breaches by hackers on election system databases in Illinois and Arizona earlier this year, and the US is also investigating probing of state voter registration systems, at least one of which they have sourced to Russia. But they have yet to see those systems tampered with. This has been an ongoing issue, including what the US says is Russian state-sponsored hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party officials and organizations, as well as the release of documents hacked from a top Clinton campaign official and released via WikiLeaks in a manner consistent with Russian-sponsored operations.The concerns as Election Day approaches include the release of more documents targeting campaigns, with the possible injection of faked documents; tampering with state voting registration systems; and organized trolling operations disseminating fake news -- for instance, of rigged counting.

The forms were submitted to the state by FieldWorks.The county got the shipments on October 14 and October 17. The state requires such voter registration forms to be submitted by October 11. It's unclear how many of these forms got to the state by this time.On November 4, the Delaware County Voter Registration Commission held a hearing to determine whether or not the voter registration forms the county received after the deadline could be considered valid. Delaware County Department of Voter Registration Chief Clerk Mary Jo Headley informed the commission that 3,840 of the forms were invalid for various reasons, including duplicate registration, invalid addresses and other discrepancies. FieldWorks' county office searchedHeadley found 1,160 voter registration forms to be valid. The commission determined that if any of those valid voters show up to the polls on election day, they will have to vote with a provisional ballot. Ballots will be counted Thursday after the election and can be contested while they are being counted.Delaware County officials executed a warrant to search FieldWorks' county satellite office, according to court documents.County officials cited possible ""tampering with public records or information"" as the reason for the search. Police noted they would be searching material ""relating to identifying co-conspirators,"" and ""any/all voter registration forms, including but not limited to ... any templates (physical or electronic) utilized to construct fraudulent voter registration forms."" Police went to the office the night of October 28, according to FieldWorks spokesperson Matt Dorf.Grassroots group 'working closely' with county ""The integrity of our electoral system is a foundation of our democracy, which is why FieldWorks has the most rigorous quality controls in the industry and zero tolerance for fraud,"" FieldWorks said in a statement to CNN.""FieldWorks is now working closely with county officials to provide them with information on our program and applications they are investigating.""FieldWorks is a national political grassroots organization that has worked with a number of Democratic clients in the past. It provides canvass operation services for campaigns by organizing door knockings, phone banks, signature collections and voter registration.FieldWorks sent the voter registration forms to the Pennsylvania Department of State, but when it sent the forms, before or after the deadline, is unclear.""When you look at these, they have Department of State stamps on them that are after the deadline,"" Maddren said. He stated that the majority of the forms were stamped after October 11, but some of the forms do have dates before the deadline as well.It was unclear whether the forms were received before the deadline and then stockpiled by the department, or whether they were received and sent late, according to Maddren.'We run good elections'In the Friday hearing, the Department of State told the Delaware County Voter Registration Commission that the voter registration forms were received before or on the deadline even though Delaware County officials received some of the forms late. During the hearing, commissioners referenced a total of 5,000 voter registration forms received late. It was unclear why that figure differed from the 6,130 number mentioned earlier by Maddren.Both the Pennsylvania Department of State and the Pennsylvania attorney general's office would not comment on the ongoing investigation.In a press conference on October 20, Secretary of State Pedro Cortes reaffirmed his confidence in the Pennsylvania voting system, despite recent campaign rhetoric.""Some have suggested that fraud is rampant and election officials at the local and state level have ill intended motives.

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/bridgegate-trial-chris-christie/index.html	"After more than a month of testimony, a federal jury in Newark on Friday returned guilty verdicts against Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. They were each convicted of seven criminal counts -- including conspiracy and fraud -- for their roles in the September 2013 lane closures on the Fort Lee, New Jersey, side of the George Washington Bridge. Testimony at trial shone an unflattering light on the way business was conducted in the Christie administration.Prosecutors alleged the lane closures, which paralyzed traffic across the bridge from Upper Manhattan, were part of a plot to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who declined to endorse Christie in his 2013 re-election campaign.Christie has long denied knowing about the closures, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. But the former presidential candidate has been unable to elude scrutiny from a political scandal that tarnished his second term as governor.Now that the Bridgegate trial is over, what's possibly next for Christie? Could Christie face criminal charges? After the verdict Friday, Christie said he was saddened by the case and by the choices made by people who were once close to him. ""Let me be clear once again, I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them,"" he said in a statement. ""No believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.""Still, the door remains open for criminal charges, according to legal experts.If Christie were to face charges stemming from the lane closures, it could be over alleged official misconduct, these experts say. Under state law, a public official can be prosecuted for committing an unauthorized act ""with purpose to obtain a benefit for himself or another or to injure or to deprive another of a benefit.""Such a prosecution, however, is highly unlikely. The Bergen County prosecutor's office would have to decide whether there is enough evidence to present the case to a grand jury, which would then decide on an indictment. Prosecutors have wide discretion on filing charges. The Bridgegate trial stemmed in part from a series of damning emails and texts made public in January 2014.For instance, one month before the lane closures, with Christie's re-election campaign in full swing, Kelly texted David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and a political ally of the governor's: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""""Got it,"" Wildstein replied.On the stand, Kelly characterized her messages as ""sarcasm and humor."" She testified that she told Christie about a planned traffic study and potential traffic problems one day before sending that email.In September, Wildstein testified that Christie was informed about the traffic problems at the George Washington Bridge as they were happening. While at ground zero in Manhattan during a memorial event on September 11, 2013, Baroni and Wildstein, then the Port Authority director of interstate capital projects, discussed the traffic issues with Christie, Wildstein testified.Wildstein, the admitted mastermind of the lane closures, testified that Baroni told Christie: ""Governor, I have to tell you there's a tremendous amount of traffic in Fort Lee this morning, major traffic jams."" Wildstein said Baroni had a sarcastic tone during the conversation.The lane closures, which began two days earlier on September 9, 2013, lasted four days. ""You'll be pleased to know that Mayor (Mark) Sokolich is having trouble getting his telephone calls returned,"" Baroni continued, according to Wildstein.Wildstein said that Christie replied, ""I imagine he wouldn't be getting his calls returned.""Wildstein avoided trial by pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation.In October, Christie was hit with a criminal summons after a municipal judge decided there was probable cause on a citizen's complaint over the lane closures.In the complaint, Bill Brennan accused the governor of official misconduct, saying Christie ""knowingly refrained from ordering that his subordinates take all necessary action to re-open local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge from Fort Lee, New Jersey, that had been closed with purpose to injure Fort Lee mayor Mark Sokolich.""Christie appealed the case, which spokesman Brian Murray called ""a dishonorable complaint filed by a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system."" Christie is scheduled to appear in court November 23. The prosecutor's office did not return a call seeking comment.  Stuart Green, a Rutgers University law professor, said it may be difficult to prove misconduct.""Even if he knew (about the lane closings), that's probably not good enough,"" he said. ""Absent some smoking gun that he was himself involved in the planning of the closings, it just seems to me that it would be too hard to get a conviction.""Will Christie be impeached? Don't bet on it. Still, a move by the state Legislature to impeach Christie would be more likely than criminal charges, according to Green.""To bring a criminal prosecution with criminal penalties is to give that sort of political check to the criminal courts. And I think there's good reason to think that that's dangerous,"" said Green, referring to the perils of politicians using the criminal justice system to punish political adversaries.Some state Assembly members have publicly discussed impeachment, but Democrats have said it would be a waste of time since Christie will be out of office soon.""In modern times, no sitting governor of New Jersey has ever been impeached or charged with a crime,"" said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor of political science and law at New Jersey's Montclair State University.  Recent unpopular governors have been voted out of office, and the only one embroiled in scandal resigned, Harrison said. In 2004, Gov. James McGreevey resigned halfway through his term after revealing that he is gay and admitting an extramarital affair with a male staffer. The state Constitution is vague in terms of the grounds for impeachment: ""The Governor and all other State officers, while in office and for two years thereafter, shall be liable to impeachment for misdemeanor committed during their respective continuance in office.""The Assembly has the power to begin impeachment proceedings. A majority vote among its 80 members would lead to a trial in the state Senate. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court would preside. A two-thirds vote by senators is required for a conviction, which could lead to removal from office and a disqualification of holding any other public office in the state.But impeachment is a drawn-out process. The governor's term expires in January 2018. Harrison said it would be unusual for lawmakers to pursue impeachment, because the Democratic-controlled Legislature prefers to have its gubernatorial nominee next year run against Christie's legacy, rather than give the Republican lieutenant governor an opportunity to start the race with a clean slate.Is disbarment a possibility? An ethics complaint over Christie's handling of the lane closures could result in disbarment or lesser sanctions such as a censure or reprimand. Christie was US attorney for the District of New Jersey from 2002 to 2008. ""They'd have to find a fairly close connection between him and the (lane closure) orders,"" Fordham University law professor James Cohen said of the state office of attorney ethics. ""On the other hand, the standard of proof, of course, in that context is not beyond a reasonable doubt.""Rutgers law professor John Leubsdorf said most grounds for disbarring lawyers turn on acts committed in the representation of a client -- which wouldn't apply to Christie in this case. However, there are exceptions to the New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct, which say a lawyer may not commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; or engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. ""The first of these requires only that the lawyer 'commit' a crime, whether or not he's been convicted,"" Leubsdorf said.""In practice, I doubt that the disciplinary authorities would want to try a complex criminal case, but in theory they could. As to the second, I'm not up on everything the governor might have done, but if he lied to the public about his knowledge of what was happening, that seems to qualify.""Leubsdorf added, ""In short, the governor could be disciplined if he was dishonest, or (in theory but probably not in practice) if the disciplinary system found he committed a crime.""Will there be other investigations? Some experts believe Bridgegate could lead to other investigations.  Federal prosecutors said the traffic-choking lane closures were intended to punish Fort Lee's mayor for not supporting Christie's re-election bid.""In my mind, the key question that has emerged as a result of trial concerns the idea of a quid pro quo surrounding endorsement,"" Harrison said.""That raises the question of what the 60 Democrats who did endorse Christie received for their endorsements. That is the landmine where corruption could potentially be demonstrated: Was there a quid pro quo for endorsements received? If I were the state Legislature, that's the question I'd be asking.""Were mayors who endorsed Christie rewarded in any way? ""There's the punishment, but there's also I'm sure the reward,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a CNN contributor.""What were the rewards? Were the rewards legitimate? Or, as with the punishment, were there certain rewards that were beyond the boundaries of what should be permissible?"" What is Christie's political future? Though Christie has said he plans to retire from public life at the end of his term, a victory by Republican Donald Trump in the presidential election could breathe new life into the governor's political career. Christie heads the team planning a potential Trump administration. Christie, who is 54, could always decide on another presidential run. ""Lots of people recover,"" said Ben Dworkin, a political science professor at Rider University. ""It's politics. We have second and third acts. Richard Nixon came back.But Christie's tenure has not endeared him with the state GOP, according to Harrison. ""Behind closed doors, most Republicans will tell you that they are waiting for Christie era to be over so that they can begin the process of rebuilding,"" she said.Others said they believe Christie has been hurt politically by his association with Trump. ""I don't know whether law firms would consider him toxic,"" Cohen said. ""I don't know that anybody is going to welcome him with open arms in terms of a law firm. I think that significant, big corporations are going to say he's maybe not the guy we want as the face of our company in court.""Cohen added, ""I'm not saying he's going to be on the street with a tin can, but I think his prospects don't look perhaps as exciting as they did when he threw his hat in the ring. I could see him doing a politics show with Trump."" "	Bridgegate scandal: What's next for Chris Christie?

The ads will run on at least two popular stations per district, including hip-hop and R&B stations, running at least twice an hour until Election Day, according to House Democrats.And the President has this blunt message to black voters: ""I need you.""""We have the opportunity to build on all the progress we've made, to fight for the issues you and I believe in,"" he says in one ad. ""I'm doing everything I can to make sure our Democrats all around the country have what they need to win, and that's why I need you.""In a separate ad, the first lady says Democrats need black voters to ""continue my husband's legacy, building on the progress we've made.""""On Tuesday, I want you to vote,"" she says.The ads come at an urgent time for Democrats, with polls tightening in crucial battlegrounds, limiting the chances of the party to take back control of Congress. And it comes as early voting data show that Democratic voters -- including African-Americans -- are down compared to the Obama-headlined elections in 2008 and 2012.According to data compiled through CNN partnering with Catalist, a data company that works with candidates and groups, early voting is down statewide in Florida among African-Americans compared to eight years ago when Obama made his first run for president. Among those who have cast ballots already in 2016, 12.3% are black, compared to 15.5% in 2008.Officials with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee say the House Democratic campaign arm is spending ""hundreds of thousands"" on the ads and that they are ""saturating the market"" in these key districts, arguing it will help bolster the get-out-the-vote effort the committee has employed on the ground.The ads are intended to benefit House Democratic candidates, but could also help Hillary Clinton given that they are also focused on two key presidential swing states: Nevada and Florida. The candidates that the DCCC are trying to help include Florida Democrats Charlie Crist and Stephanie Murphy, Bryan Caforio of California, Jay Sidie of Kansas, Brad Ashford of Nebraska and Nevadans Jacky Rosen and Ruben Kihuen.""Each and every voice will make a difference in this high-stakes election,"" said Rep.
