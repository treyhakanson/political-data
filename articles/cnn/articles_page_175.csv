""I cannot fail. And I don't talk about that a whole lot, but there's tremendous pressure to be the first and hope that you're not the last.""The crowd at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual conference murmured in understanding.Stewart was one of a panel of top national security officials addressing the conference as US intelligence agencies wrestle with a national security imperative that starts at home: recruiting and retaining diverse talent.Statistics from the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence show minorities make up roughly one-quarter of their agencies' workforce, far behind the full federal government mark of 35%.Leaders say there are many challenges to changing this reality, including common barriers such as access to recruitment and internships for minorities. There are also industry-specific issues, such as having good credit to get a security clearance and overcoming the mistrust of many in the black community toward the US intelligence apparatus.But now agencies including the CIA, ODNI, DIA and Department of Homeland Security are working to overcome these obstacles and address lagging diversity within their ranks in terms of race, gender, disability status, sexual orientation and religion.While diversity might be an American value, intelligence community leaders say that for their industry, it's a matter of mission.""I really believe there is an exceptionally strong -- if not the strongest -- business case possible that CIA can make within the government for why we need to be diverse,"" CIA Director John Brennan said Thursday, appearing at a conference panel alongside Stewart. ""We don't want to suffer from that group think,"" he said. ""I need to make sure our organization has the diversity in it ... so that we can cover the world's problems.""At times the panel got personal. Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama, another participant, spoke about joining the House Intelligence Committee, which holds mostly classified hearings, and waiting months to see diverse faces before it. ""I had been a member of the committee for nine months before I saw the first woman give a presentation,"" Sewell said. ""I'm just being honest. And it wasn't until two years later I saw an African-American.""Brennan and the CIA have led the way in efforts to close diversity gaps, the panelists said. Brennan has prioritized making the CIA more diverse since he took over the top job there in 2013.In 2015, the agency released a study commissioned by Brennan that found the CIA lacking in its minority recruitment. The report found that only 24% of the CIA workforce and 10.8% of its top Senior Intelligence Service, the highest echelons of the service, were minorities. The percent in positions that feed into leadership jobs, known as GS-15s in government lingo, was only 15.2%.The numbers have been trending downward, as well, with only 19.3% of recruits minorities in 2015, down from 31.5% in 2008.Brennan has continued efforts to change that trend. Earlier this week, he spoke at Miles College, a historically black college in Alabama, and met with high school students in Birmingham.""I don't want the agency to just look like me,"" he told them, according to the Alabama Media Group.On the heels of the report, the CIA released a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy for the next three years.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence followed suit in June, releasing its first public demographics report. That agency increased its minority percentage of the workforce to 25% in 2015, but both agencies lag far behind the overall federal government, which is at 35%, according to ODNI.While the participants hailed the work of the leaders in identifying the problem and increasing their outreach, they said work still remains.""I think that the outreach has been incremental. It hasn't been monumental or transformative,"" Democratic Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana, another panelist, told CNN after the event. ""We can always do more.""But he also gave Brennan credit for his work, including actively engaging with Historically Black Colleges and Universities like Miles. ""For him to actively recruit at HBCUs is unprecedented, so I give him a lot of credit for that,"" Carson said.""The outreach is needed, but beyond the outreach, being able to go and have an environment that's welcoming, that's accepting"" is key, according to Ba-Shen Welch, vice president of strategic initiatives at Miles College. ""Because once you get in the door, it's about staying there too.""Recruiting a diverse staff has its challenges, the national security officials acknowledged.Stewart stressed that outreach has to start early, and that for many in the black community, there used to be ""tremendous distrust"" of the intelligence community that still persists to some extent. Many in the community believe African-Americans are targets of the government's surveillance apparatus, and the distrust grew when the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover secretly spied on African-Americans. ""We've got to work our way down the ladder and demystify that job,"" Stewart said. ""We're losing great candidates by the time they're 13.""The panel repeatedly returned to security clearance tests as barriers to diversity, since they often require having good credit and a mostly blemish-free record.The officials joked that it doesn't have to be perfect -- Brennan said some drug experimentation and activism, for example, can be understood. ""I would not be up here if that was disqualifying,"" he noted, recounting that he admitted during his polygraph exam in the 1980s that he once voted for a Communist Party candidate.But there are advantages to coming from less-represented backgrounds, according to Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Stephanie O'Sullivan, who encouraged the crowd of students, professionals, educators and politicians to embrace what makes them unique.""Don't underestimate the value of being different,"" she said. ""You come at problems differently. Each one of you is unique."" "	Intelligence agencies tackle domestic mission: Diversifying

""When you're being under attack, then you pay attention,"" Seyer told CNN. ""It wasn't until Trump came into the scene that I started paying attention to more politics because I realized how it was affecting me and my community.""As a Latino himself, Seyer said he felt he needed to make social commentary during his shows (and he's performed before with punk rock band Downtown Boys) to get his fans to realize how he sees these issues concerning his community.Poll: Latinos find Clinton more trustworthy than TrumpFrom the start of his campaign, Republican nominee  Trump's rhetoric has angered Mexican immigrants. ""When Mexico sends its people,"" Trump said during his presidential announcement last year, ""they're not sending the best. They're not sending you, they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.""These words have followed Trump throughout his presidential campaign, and last month Trump took a trip to Mexico to visit with President Enrique Peña Nieto to try to make amends.""To see communities on the border of Texas that are like, 'We can't be divided, we can't be separate' is so impactful,"" said Downtown Boys singer Victoria Ruiz in a separate interview. ""This is why we play music -- so that we can participate.""Downtown Boys is well known for weaving social issues into lyrics of their songs -- with Ruiz leading efforts when she commands the stage with her microphone. The band takes long-held issues and challenges them, as punk bands are famous for.""I think it's impossible not to be watching some of these figure heads and how they're expressing a kind of systemic hatred,"" said Joey La Neve DeFrancesco, the guitarist in Downtown Boys. ""It's reached a fever point. It's of course impossible not to be paying attention to someone like Donald Trump.""As of 2015, there are 55 million Latinos in the US, or 17% of the US population. And in the most recent Suffolk University/USA Today poll, only 24% of Hispanic voters opted for Trump, while 65% backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""What we really try to do is open it up, always try and create more dialogue and create more power to confront a lot of things that are holding a lot of people back right now,"" Ruiz said."

Jeff Kuss was killed in the crash June 2 in Smyrna, Tennessee, after he could not complete a maneuver in his F/A-18 jet, according to the report.It said Kuss, flying Blue Angel Number 6, was going too fast and was not high enough when he tried what is called a ""Split S"" maneuver.""He transitioned from the high performance climb to the Split S too low and too fast, and by not deselecting his afterburners during the maneuver, he continued to accelerate,"" the Navy report said.""The net effect of these deviations was that the aircraft was simply too low and too fast to avoid impacting the ground.""The report said Kuss did not take any actions that could have possibly prevented the crash.  He then tried to eject from the aircraft too late, it added.""Although Capt Kuss was a highly trained and respected naval aviator, his deviations from standard operating procedures in executing the Split S maneuver resulted in a fatal loss of situational awareness,"" said the report dated August 25 and obtained by CNN on Thursday.The Split S maneuver will not be performed in Blue Angels shows until at least next year, the report said.Kuss, a native of Durango, Colorado, joined the Blue Angels in September 2014 and had accumulated more than 1,400 flight hours and 175 landings on aircraft carriers, according to the Blue Angels website. He was in his first year on Blue Angels squads flying at air shows and other public performances when the crash occurred.After the crash, Blue Angels flight leader and commanding officer, Cmdr. Ryan Bernacchi, called Kuss ""truly one of the absolute finest Americans this country can produce.""""We lost an aviator that believed so deeply in the Blue Angels' mission of inspiring others and representing the Navy and Marine Corps, our citizens and our great country,"" Bernacchi said.The Blue Angels stopped performances for a month after the crash, canceling three weekends of shows.

But it is the first time he has wondered aloud what would happen to her should she suddenly be deprived of armed protection.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Trump's remarks ""should be out of bounds for a presidential candidate.""""Whether this is done to provoke protesters at a rally or casually or even as a joke, it is an unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of commander in chief,"" Mook said in a statement, adding, ""He is unfit to be President and it is time Republican leaders stand up to denounce this disturbing behavior in their nominee.""MORE: Trump finally admits Obama born in USThe Secret Service declined to comment on Trump's remark, spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said. Several federal law enforcement officials told CNN there is concern Trump's rhetoric could lead to a Secret Service or law enforcement officer getting shot or killed. They feel the consequences could be borne by people who protect Clinton and are first in line if someone makes an attempt on her life.Trump argued Friday that he would be a staunch defender of the Second Amendment and said that Clinton would ""destroy"" the right to bear arms. Clinton has called for tightening access to guns, including instating universal background checks, but has never suggested she would seek to do away with the Second Amendment.Trump made a similar comment after he accepted the National Rifle Association's endorsement last spring.""They should immediately disarm and let's see how good they do. Let's see how they feel walking around without their guns or their body guards,"" Trump said of Clinton and her Secret Service detail during his speech to the gun lobby conference in May.Trump doesn't allow guns at his rallies and his properties don't allow open carrying of guns.Friday's remark comes just more than a month after Trump made comments that were interpreted by many as a threat of violence against Clinton.   ""Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know,"" Trump said during a rally in North Carolina in August.The Trump campaign defended those comments as a call for increased political activity, but the Clinton campaign said unequivocally that Trump's comments were ""dangerous"" and irresponsible for a presidential candidate to make."

The US-led coalition to counter ISIS says it carried out four additional airstrikes near Mosul and Qayyarah Friday, destroying eight ISIS fighting positions and damaging a tunnel entrance. Near Qayyarah, two strikes engaged an ISIS tactical unit and destroyed a vehicle, a weapons cache and 29 watercraft.Qayyarah air base was recaptured from ISIS by Iraqi soldiers backed by US airstrikes in July and the American forces operating there will mainly provide logistics, supplies and support for the Iraqi offensive on Mosul. The move brings US personnel closer to the battle and ISIS' defensive lines. ""When the (Iraqi Security Force) is ready to move on in their operations to get after Mosul, we'll be prepared to support that and the airfield will be ready,"" Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian told reporters Tuesday at the Pentagon. He added that coalition forces are conducting intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance efforts in the area.Asked if US forces advising the Mosul operation faced increased risk, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook told reporters Thursday that ""the secretary (of defense) has made clear that our forces in Iraq are in harm's way. Everyone who is serving there is in a dangerous situation.""The air base is also expected to be rebuilt to allow US and coalition aircraft to operate there, since its proximity to Mosul makes it tactically important. ""This is a partnered effort. This is something we're working from both the land component perspective with the Iraqis and clearly ensuring that, as we begin to put some of our airplanes in there in the future, that it's got the capabilities that we need,"" Harrigian added, describing efforts to prepare Qayyarah. The assault could begin as early as October, according to several US officials. The next stage of the effort to retake Mosul will involve attempts to seize towns and villages on the southern outskirts of the city.Iraqi security forces air dropped thousands of leaflets south of the city over the weekend warning citizens in anticipation of a new offensive. ""Protect yourself, don't be human shields for the enemy, leave the town immediately,"" a leaflet shown by the Iraqi military to CNN said. The coalition is stepping up airstrikes along key infiltration routes into Mosul in hopes of keeping the city from being reinforced further by ISIS, a US defense official added.The coalition announced Friday that it had carried out airstrikes Thursday against a logistics facility in Mosul and an ISIS tactical unit in Qayyarah.The fight for Mosul is expected to be a difficult one. Defense officials and intelligence analysts said ISIS has dug-in since it first seized the city in 2014.There are 3,000 to 4,500 ISIS fighters in Mosul, according to Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. John Dorrian.""There is still a tough fight ahead against an adaptive enemy that will try to challenge us as we hone in on Mosul,"" said Harrigian, the commander of US air forces in the Middle East."

Only 15 of those planes had been fielded with the remainder still on the production line and will be fixed there. The plane's manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, has delivered 108 F-35As. The Air Force plans to buy 1,763 of the jets.Of the 15 grounded aircraft already in the field, 10 had been declared combat ready, one was being used in testing, and the final four were for training, with two of those four training aircraft belonging to the Royal Norwegian Air Force. ""While nearing completion, the F-35 is still in development and challenges are to be expected,"" the Air Force said.Representatives from the Air Force and Lockheed Martin's F-35 program told CNN that the defective cooling lines were not found in all the aircraft. They said the use of the faulty part was limited to one sub-contractor that did not work on all the planes.""Safety is always our first consideration and Lockheed Martin is committed to resolving this issue as quickly as possible to return jets to flying status,"" Michael Rein, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin, told CNN in a statement.The F-35 jet has been described as the most expensive weapons system in history with a program cost estimated to be $400 billion.The F-35A is the Air Force's version of the jet, the US Marines and Navy will also have their own F-35 variants. Neither of the latter services' aircraft were affected. Upon the Air Force F-35's receipt of initial operational capability status in August, Gen. Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, said: ""The F-35A will be the most dominant aircraft in our inventory because it can go where our legacy aircraft cannot and provide the capabilities our commanders need on the modern battlefield.""The grounding of the planes was first reported by Bloomberg News.
