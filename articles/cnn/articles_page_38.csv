I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans,"" Clinton said.""Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,"" said Clinton, who was composed and dignified even as she admitted how painful her defeat was in her first public comments on the result of the election.""This is not the outcome that we wanted and we worked so hard for, and I am sorry that we did not win this election,"" Clinton told supporters and campaign workers in New York.Clinton also addressed the historic achievement for which she twice strived in losing presidential campaigns.""I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.""""And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and to achieve your own dreams.""Clinton's speech was devoid of bitterness and seemed at times to be an attempt to inspire her supporters about the virtues of public service and of fighting for what they believe.But she also put Trump on notice that the core American values which many Democrats believe Trump abhors, citing his proposals for a ban on Muslim immigration and rhetorical assaults on female journalists during his campaign, would not be forgotten.""Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things: the rule of law, the principle that we are equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them.""Tears flowedMuch of the seating at Clinton's remarks was for staff and aides and the campaign was treating it as a farewell to the people who have spent the better part of two years working on her behalf, an aide said.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine also was on hand. The Virginia senator was not with Clinton Tuesday night.""I'm proud of Hillary, because she loves this country,"" said Kaine, who had tears in his eyes, as he delivered introductory remarks.Aides throughout the ballroom were sobbing during Clinton's remarks. Quiet moments in the speech were filled with tears, sniffles and some sobs. Clinton's top aides, seated in the front row, were almost all crying.Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, was wiping away tears. Nick Merrill, Clinton's traveling press secretary, was weeping.The most somber moment in Clinton's speech was when she specifically noted her impact to women and girls.""To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,"" Clinton said, her voice breaking with emotion.There were audible cries -- and some sobs -- throughout the room.Bill Clinton, while working the ropeline, wiped away tears.Huma Abedin cried during the speech but kept a stoic face during much of the ropeline.Clinton worked the ropeline after the event, moving from tearful conversation to tearful conversation.She first spoke with Anastasia Somoza, the 32-year old woman diagnosed with cerebral palsy and spastic quadriplegia who interned for Clinton's Senate office. Bending down to hug Somoza, Clinton told her, ""You were so wonderful in every way. I love you.""""Thank you for all your work,"" Clinton told Somoza's mother.She hugged Joel Bennenson and John Anzalone, two of her pollsters, who acknowledged to other aides last night that they didn't see the Trump wave coming.She hugged Jim Margolis and Mandy Grunwald, who created many of the campaign's television ads.Clinton left somewhat unceremoniously, departing through a blue curtain to the left of the room and later to her motorcade.End of a campaignHer speech marked a bitter conclusion to a campaign that will be remembered for failing to fully energize Democratic voters and for squandering the party's traditional heartlands in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.It also marked what could be the final act on the national stage of the Clinton double act, the political partnership between Bill Clinton and the former first lady and secretary of state that had seemed poised for a remarkable comeback, 16 years after they left the White House.Campaign staffers had spoken throughout Clinton's presidential bid of the extreme pressure many of them felt in facing Trump, whom Clinton argued was temperamentally and intellectually unfit for the presidency and to be in charge of the US nuclear arsenal.Now she is under pressure to call on a nation, split almost exactly down the middle, to unite behind the next president.Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, lauded her speech.""Very classy speech from @HillaryClinton. Important step in bringing our country together,"" he tweeted.It was not the first time Clinton has tasted the pain of ending a defeated presidential campaign. In 2008, she folded her primary bid against Barack Obama in Washington and bemoaned her failure to break the ""highest and hardest glass ceiling"" by becoming the first female president. That was to be her fate again in 2016, though the personal recriminations are likely to be even more intense this time given that Trump is seen by many Democrats as antithetical to American values.Clinton called Trump in the early hours of Wednesday to concede defeat after he shattered her Democratic firewall in the Midwest and swept to victory after the most vitriolic general election in generations.But she did not appear at her election night party in New York. At the time, her campaign chairman John Podesta explained that the campaign wanted to ensure that every vote in still undeclared states was counted -- though her position already seemed hopeless.Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Wednesday that she was with Trump when Abedin, called to say her boss wanted to talk to the president-elect.""I handed him the phone and they had a maybe one-minute conversation, very gracious, very warm. I heard Mr. Trump's side of it,"" Conway told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day. ""He commended her for being smart and tough and running a very hard-fought campaign. And I am told Secretary Clinton congratulated Donald Trump on his victory, and conceded to him,"" Conway said."	Hillary Clinton delivers painful concession speech

Their economic relationship is crucial not only to each country's financial health but to the global economy as well. But rarely, if ever, have two global powers been so intrinsically linked economically while sitting on different sides of so many other issues.Start with the South China Sea, one of the world's tensest geopolitical situations.  China's aggressive seizures of land and building of artificial islands have caused alarm in the United States.  The fear in Washington is that China could become a de facto hegemonic power, coming to dominate Southeast Asian nations who have competing territorial claims in the area but no real military might with which to back them up.The South China Sea is also one of the world's most important shipping waterways. Trillions of dollars of goods pass through it every year -- and the US is concerned that China's expansion could eventually allow them to control the waterways outright, and therefore the ability to impact the free flow of trade.There are a host of other China issues facing Trump, including cyber security concerns and fears of Chinese currency manipulation. Many economists have said China's ongoing economic slowdown could have negative effects globally. And China's massive consumption of coal is contributing to global warming. What should be Trump's top priority on China in the first 100 days?The most immediate concern might not actually be China itself. Instead, look to the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte is reversing decades of foreign policy tradition.The US sees the Philippines as perhaps its strongest ally in Southeast Asia. But on a recent trip to Beijing, Duterte said he wants ""separation from the United States,"" both economically and militarily, and pursue closer relations with China.What happens next could alter the balance of power in the South China Sea. Dealing with the surprise change in the Philippine-US relationship -- and how that might affect China's regional ambitions -- should be a top priority for Trump. Both candidates had tough talk for China on the campaign trail.Trump has focused his attacks mainly on China's economy, saying that Chinese economic policies have been responsible for millions of American jobs that have left the country.  In May, he said: ""We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing."" Strong rhetoric like that might make the first meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping awkward, to say the least. Can Trump fix this in the first term?No. Both countries are playing the long game in the South China Sea. China's new artificial islands, and the military equipment it has installed on them, aren't going away anytime soon. And the US military, under a policy established with the help of then Secretary of State Clinton, has shifted more of its focus to China.  These are both long-term strategies, and both countries have the resources to implement them. Two global powers competing for influence over one of the world's key strategic waterways is a struggle that will likely play out for some time.How big a priority is China for CNN readers?China is the number two international priority, according to a very unscientific poll of CNN readers who took part in our interactive feature on the 10 biggest global challenges facing the next President.

But sources on the transition team say they are fully prepared to hit the ground running. Last week, 22 department heads submitted their transition plans to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for approval. Who could be in the Trump administration?Each of these departments has a ""landing team"" set to parachute into government agencies, get the lay of the land, begin the transition process and get Trump's 100-day plan rolling. That transition plan was delivered to Trump Tower Tuesday. In particular, aides have focused on what Trump can do unilaterally, such as rolling back regulations. One of Trump's key challenges in the coming weeks will be building his cabinet. On the transition team, department heads submitted lists of three names for cabinet positions, taking into account Trump's public statements about who he would like to see in his administration. Department heads submitted a list of three names for top cabinet positions. Given Trump's limited role in transition planning, sources caution that these potential picks are not set in stone. Trump could veto some or choose to add others to the list. The transition team also expects they will see a surge in interest from people who want to serve in a Trump administration now that he is the president-elect.Sources familiar with the Trump campaigns plans for the Defense Department and national security posts said that they are loyal to supporters that ""took a lot of crap"" when they were seen to be part of his team and still they stayed. National security sources also said that former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump at a time when few would even talk about him, will have a lot of say in how they serve in his new administration. Sources also said that House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, could be in line to serve as Homeland Security Secretary and that former Rep. Mike Rogers, a CNN contributor, could serve a top intelligence role in the Trump White House.President Barack Obama's Defense Secretary, Ash Carter, meanwhile sent a memo to Defense workers Wednesday, saying, ""I am committed to overseeing the orderly transition to the next commander in chief. I know I can count on you to execute all your duties with the excellence our citizens know they can expect.""Who will Trump pick for the Supreme Court?As for the lists of potential appointees -- each of those people has been vetted by the transition team, a process that has been overseen by William Hagerty (who also worked on Mitt Romney's transition).As part of that vetting, appointees were judged based on a loyalty test, a source told CNN. That included scouring potential appointees' social media accounts. Some people were weeded out for having been publicly critical of Trump in the past.That included scouring potential appointees' social media accounts. Some people were weeded out for having been publicly critical of Trump in the past.Roughly 80 people have been working full-time, five days a week on the Trump transition -- a much smaller staff than Romney had dedicated to this effort in 2012. But they've also been consulting about 200 content experts -- people who have served in previous administrations, who are working in states or are specific subject-matter experts.This isn't a transition team that's been solely consulting full-fledged Trump loyalists. They've tapped former George W. Bush officials and former Romney people. Sessions has helped bring in advisers from the Hill, while Christie has brought in other governors to offer their expertise.Trump advisers will gather for a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan mid-Wednesday morning and start hashing out what comes next, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer said, though he said the meeting was not in regard to the transition."

Lisa Filipps, spokeswoman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, said that the website had become ""temporarily inaccessible to users as a result of a significant increase in the volume of traffic."" Teams were working to resolve the issue, she said, and by Wednesday morning the site appeared to be up and running again -- albeit very slow to load.There's no guarantee the two things were related, but given the loud insistence of many Americans, every election cycle, to move north in the event of an unfavorable outcome, it's not a huge leap to assume that some despondent voters were exploring options.Twitter reactsMany were tempted to file this under ""you couldn't make it up."" Actor and comedian Ben Schwartz couldn't believe he'd been beaten to the punch, tweeting:""I was gonna write this as a joke but found out it was real. ""The Canada Citizenship and Immigration site crashed around 8 PM"" #electionnight,"" he wrote.Another user couldn't see the funny side of it. ""Canada's Citizenship & Immigration site just crashed. This isn't a joke. #ElectionNight,"" Scott Warner tweeted.Others pointed to the website's crashing as part of a wider theme of signs a Trump victory was inevitable.""Where we stand right now: DOW futures are down 750. The dollar is plummeting. And Canada's immigration website just crashed,"" Nick Bilton wrote.We're not sure where Trump supporters planned to go if Clinton had won. But one fan tweeted -- in all-caps -- ""I'M MOVING TO RUSSIA IF TRUMP LOSES.""As election night wore on, results seemed to show that the odds she would have to learn Russian were decreasing.Looking northwardJittery Democrats -- and maybe some Republicans -- have eyed the northern border throughout the election cycle. In August, CNN reported on a radio DJ who created a website called Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins, welcoming Americans to the sleepy Maritime island in Nova Scotia.As the story spread on CNN and other international networks, American interest grew. The phenomenon goes right back to the primaries. Searches for ""how can I move to Canada"" spiked 350% as Trump swept Super Tuesday in March, according to Simon Rogers, a data editor at Google, at the time. Celebrities including Bryan Cranston, Amy Schumer, Cher and Barbra Streisand have all declared their plans to flee under a Trump presidency. Indeed, the famed Canadian niceness would certainly provide a welcome respite to the relentless nastiness of the 2016 presidential election. As the Cape Breton website assures would-be American refugees: ""The truth is, we welcome all, no matter who you support, be it Democrat, Republican or Donald Trump.""The same thing happened when George W. Bush won his second term in 2004. But there's little evidence that many Americans followed through with their threat.That few actually migrate north is probably at least in part because it's not easy to make the move.  It is possible though. A job offer, a winning ticket in a citizenship lottery or hyper-wealth helps. But for most, the first step is logging on to a functional Canadian immigration website. Good luck getting through."	Planning to flee to Canada? Try accessing the immigration website first

Chuck Schumer. The sources said Murray -- now the No. 4 Democrat -- made a round of calls Wednesday to determine where her colleagues would like her to be within her party's leadership structure. Whether she ultimately runs against Durbin is unclear.The move could be important since the post will be critical in helping guide the party's strategy after President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans ran the table in Tuesday's elections. But it would also cause an internal Senate Democratic battle for the position, something that members are often eager to avoid.

Before polls closed her campaign had been confident of victory. In the end, however, she lost even some states thought to be safely in her column, like Wisconsin. She trailed in others, like Pennsylvania and Michigan. While she won the key demographic groups her campaign targeted, she underperformed President Obama across the board, even among women, according to exit poll data.A slightly larger share of black and Latino voters cast ballots for Trump than supported Mitt Romney in 2012, despite Trump's disparaging remarks on African-Americans, Mexicans and undocumented immigrants.President Barack Obama, who captured the presidency with the help of the African-American and Latino communities, issued several personal pleas to black voters to back Clinton in recent weeks. ""If we let this thing slip and I've got a situation where my last two months in office are preparing for a transition to Donald Trump, whose staff people have said that their primary agenda is to have him in the first couple of weeks sitting in the Oval Office and reverse every single thing that we've done,"" Obama said last week during an interview on a syndicated radio program.But not enough African-Americans, along with Latinos, heeded the call.Some 88% of African-American voters supported Clinton, versus 8% for Donald Trump, as of very early Wednesday morning. While that's a large margin, it's not as big as Obama's victory over Mitt Romney in 2012. Obama locked up 93% of the black vote to Romney's 7%.Some 12% of the electorate was African-American this year, compared to 13% four years ago. That's a key drop, especially when paired with a smaller-than-expected growth in Latino votes.This lowered turnout happened even after Trump repeatedly made sweeping comments about how black communities were in the worst shape ever. Referring multiple times to ""inner cities,"" Trump said black people live in poverty, have no jobs and get shot walking down the street. ""What do you have to lose?"" he asked.Read: Trump: Black communities in worst shape 'ever, ever, everClinton's support among Latinos was even more tenuous, despite Trump pledging to build a wall on the Mexican border, accusing undocumented immigrants of being criminal aliens and promising to deport them. Only 65% of Latinos backed her, while 29% cast their votes for Trump. In 2012, Obama won 71% of the Hispanic vote and Romney secured 27%.Hispanics inched up to 11% of the electorate, up from 10% in 2012.Read: What Donald Trump has said about Mexico and vice versaBeyond the Obama coalition, Clinton was also not as popular with white voters as Obama was.

White voters made up 70% of the electorate this year, down from 72% four years ago.Read: White, working class and worriedAsian voters, which made up a tiny 4% of the electorate, were also less supportive of Clinton than of Obama.

But Obama secured 60% of these young voters to Romney's 37%.Read: Donald Trump's trouble with women -- an incomplete listWhen it came to women voters, Clinton won 54% compared to Trump's 42%.

Trump had 59,535,522. That difference of 219,762 is razor-thin considering the nearly 120 million votes counted so far. The totals will continue to change as absentee votes trickle in.It's a fascinating turn of events for Trump, who four years ago tweeted, ""The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy,"" following Mitt Romney's loss in 2012. If Clinton hangs on, she would become the first presidential candidate since Al Gore in 2000 to win the popular vote but lose the election. Trump, who clinched the nomination by securing 270 Electoral College votes, currently leads Clinton 290-228, though Michigan and New Hampshire have yet to be called.Prior to Gore's defeat to George W. Bush in 2000, three other candidates -- Andrew Jackson, Samuel Tilden and Grover Cleveland, all in the 19th century -- had won the popular vote and lost the election. Entering Tuesday, with most polls showing Clinton with marginal but steady leads, Trump's chances of victory were seen as remote. The Electoral College map was considered favorable to Clinton, who was said to have several paths to the winning threshold of 270 electoral votes. But Trump obliterated Clinton's firewall, picking off unexpected wins in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as well as sweeping swing states like North Carolina, Florida and Ohio.

""They want to take their borders back, they want to take their monetary back. ... I think you're going to have this more and more.""One statistic that sums up EuropeThe rate of economic growth in the European Union is currently forecast to be 1.8% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. At the same time, the European Central Bank is continuing its quantitative easing program by buying €80 billion in bonds until next March at least.  All the while, the rate of unemployment in the EU is 8.6%.  I throw these numbers at you because they are the clearest sign that although the economic situation in the EU is improving, it still has a long way to go -- especially with the US growing at a faster rate, the US central bank considering raising rates (not cutting them), and the unemployment figure hovering around half the EU number.  The economic challenges facing the EU remain considerable, especially if the Union is to play its full role as a global partner in creating faster and sustainable economic growth.  And there is always the possibility of another calamity.  Let us not forget:1. Brexit2. Elections in Germany and France in 2017 3. Greece and the issue of debt relief 4. Constitutional reform in ItalyAny one of these issues has the potential to sink the Union into despair and disarray. What should be Trump's priority on Europe in the first 100 days?The first issue for Trump will be what to do about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership -- the gargantuan free trade deal being negotiated between the EU and US.  European politicians have already been leaking that the deal is pretty much off the rails, and the President-elect will have to decide if it's worth pursuing a trade deal that - at best - is going to run into fierce opposition.  In the current anti-globalization environment, TTIP is swimming against the tide. Trump has expressed reservations about these giant deals.  Since he came out against the Asian treaty TPP, it is highly unlikely that the President-elect would expend political capital on its European counterpart.  For now, TTIP is dead. The other issue of course is Brexit.  Trump has already rejected President Obama's comment that the UK would have go to the back of the queue in negotiating a free trade deal with the US.  He said the UK would be at the front of the line for such a deal.  It is possible that once Brexit comes around, the longstanding traditional close ties (yes, the dreaded ""special relationship"") between the US and UK would mean some sort of negotiation would take place sooner rather than later, especially if TTIP collapses.  But always remember: There is no overarching trade treaty with the US at the moment for Europe, so a failure here would not be devastating. Finally -- elections, elections, elections.  Having just won an election himself, Trump will be sympathetic to French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who both go to the polls in 2017.  The tricky part is now to give something to their friends without taking sides.  Expect very little to be done during a febrile election year where Brexit dominates the European agenda. The US watches from the wings and waits. Where will US-Europe relations be at the end of Trump's first term?  Militarily, all eyes will be on how Trump interacts NATO.Economically, the US will remain stronger, with faster growth and lower unemployment. Politically, Europe will just be coming out of Brexit. The EU will still be deciding what its reformed role will be -- and much of that depends on how the public react to the changes. Oh and on trade -- maybe, just maybe, there is some sort of US-EU trade agreement. But I wouldn't bet on it. "	Will Donald Trump help hold the European Union together?

I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall,"" Trump said in his announcement speech in June 2015.One statistic that sums up the Mexico issueMexicans abroad, mainly in the US, sent nearly $25 billion in 2015 to their relatives and loved ones back home, Mexico's Central Bank reported in early February. That's a 4.75% increase from the previous year.It's the first time remittances were the most important source of revenue for Mexico since 1995, when the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) started tracking the figure. Oil has always been Mexico's cash cow -- oil exports earned Mexico $23.4 billion in 2015 -- but the sharp decline in petroleum prices has significantly changed the equation.Remittances are an important indicator of the symbiotic economic relationship between Mexico and the US. When Mexican immigrants feel the US labor market is hostile to them - regardless of whether that hostility is real or perceived -- they tend to return home, and therefore, remittances decrease.Ironically, a reduction in remittances hurts local economies and creates an incentive for other Mexican laborers to migrate (legally or otherwise) to the US.What should be Trump's top priority on Mexico in the first 100 days?The Mexican peso has lost about a third of its value in the last two years due to many factors, including plunging oil prices and emerging-market jitters.  The US presidential election seems to have had a significant impact as well.Trump promised to build a wall between Mexico and the US if he won the presidency.  The President-elect also vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a trade agreement between Mexico, the US and Canada that has been in effect since 1994. This kind of rhetoric caused anxiety among investors who feared that a Trump presidency would jeopardize trade between the two countries, which totaled $583.6 billion in 2015.The top priority on Mexico for Trump should be giving assurances that trade between the two countries will not be disrupted -- and that both countries will continue to be partners in other areas, including fighting drug cartels and protecting the rights of each other's citizens.Can Trump right the ship with Mexico in the first term? It's complicated. The presidential campaign made it clear that a significant portion of Americans -- Trump supporters -- would not object to rounding up millions of undocumented Mexican immigrants and deporting them.The US and Mexico have always been dependent on each other, but it's a complicated love-hate relationship between two countries that don't see each other as equals, have different priorities, and are led by politicians who don't understand or trust each other. A glaring example is the war on drugs. The US criticizes Mexico for its multiple criminal drug cartels and for its failure to end the violence and climate of impunity created by the narcos over the decades. And Mexico is critical of its neighbor for its seemingly insatiable appetite for illegal drugs -- a demand that fuels the drug trade with American dollars and creates a market for illegal assault weapons in Mexico.One solution to this problem could be a binational agreement to selectively legalize controlled substances like cannabis, while working jointly to focus law enforcement efforts on hard drugs and crimes like extortion and kidnapping.Another big challenge is illegal immigration. The US criticizes Mexico for failing to create the kind of economic conditions that would ensure Mexican laborers stay home, instead of risking their lives by illegally crossing the border. In turn, Mexico accuses the US of hypocrisy for exploiting illegal Mexican labor in the hospitality and construction industries, not to mention agriculture.A deal on comprehensive immigration reform will be difficult to achieve. But a good start would be a worker program that allowed Mexicans to work legally - and temporarily - in the US for industries that have historically had a shortage of workers.How big a priority is Mexico for CNN readers?Mexico ranked 6th in this very unscientific poll of CNN readers who took part in our interactive feature on the 10 biggest global challenges facing the next President.

""The Democrats do fine in presidential elections; their problem is they can't get out the vote in the midterm elections."" The diminutive justice, a trailblazer in gender discrimination law who enjoys near rockstar status among young fans -- has been repeatedly asked over the years about retirement. It's not that she shows any signs of slowing down -- indeed she is as incisive as ever from the bench and boasts about her workout routine. But she is, after all, 83 years old and has survived two bouts of cancer. In recent years she's  hinted that part of her retirement calculation depended upon the fact that a Democrat would succeed President Barack Obama.Elle Magazine asked in 2014 her whether she would resign while Obama is in office.  Ginsburg noted the Senate would be an issue for the President with a GOP filibuster.""Who do you think President Obama could appoint at this very day, given the boundaries that we have? If I resign any time this year, he could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court,"" she said. ""[Senate Democrats] took off the filibuster for lower federal court appointments, but it remains for this court. So anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they're misguided."" And then last summer she went on a tirade against Donald Trump.
