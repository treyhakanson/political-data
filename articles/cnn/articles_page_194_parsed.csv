""26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military -- only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?"" Trump tweeted in 2013.Here's a look at the facts. Q: Did Trump's stats give the full picture?A: No. He left out a very important figure: More than half the victims are men.According to the advocacy group Protect Our Defenders, of the 20,300 members of the military who say they were sexually assaulted in a 2014 survey, 10,600 were men, who are most often victimized by other men. Retired US Air Force chief prosecutor and Protect Our Defenders president Col. Don Christensen said that shouldn't come as a surprise because men make up 85% of the military.""The rate of assault is higher among women, but most of the victims identified in the surveys are men,"" he said.Q: Trump suggested the problem is caused by men and women serving side by side. Really?A: That has nothing to do with it, say experts. ""There are a lot of factors that make certain people more vulnerable, but simply the fact that men and women work together is not one of them,"" said Kate Germano of the Service Women's Action Network.""They have served for decades and decades, and to say that women and men working together is the reason behind the sexual assault rates is obviously not true,"" she added.Q: Yeah, haven't women been part of the military for a long time?A: Sure have. Going back to the Revolutionary War, in fact, with their roles expanding since then. Women followed their husbands throughout that war and, with the permission of commanding officers, served in military camps if they proved they could be helpful. During World War I and II, tens of thousands of women served as nurses and support staff at home and abroad in non-combat roles. Congress allowed women to advance to general and admiral ranks in 1967. But it was not until the 1990s that women were able move into combat positions.Q: Trump's main point was prosecution rates are low. Does he have that right?A: Definitely. Last year, there were 543 prosecutions and 254 convictions involving a sex offense. That's just a small fraction of the number of reported and estimated attacks. According to the Defense Department's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) program, there were 6,083 reports of sexual assault involving service members in 2015, and, because of underreporting, the Defense Department estimates the true number of sexual assaults to be over 20,000.Q: Trump suggested a military court system is needed to handle such cases. But isn't there already one?A: Yes, there is. But some lawmakers and critics say it's in need of a major overhaul. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a leading advocate for changes to ensure service members have their sexual assault cases properly investigated and prosecuted, has sought reform, although so far without success. She has pushed for an independent system, removing the military chain of command from the handling of such cases. ""We need to create an unbiased military justice system where trained prosecutors handle these cases, so that sexual predators can get punished instead of protected as they are today,"" she said. ""It is our responsibility to the men and women who serve our country to create a military justice system worthy of their sacrifice.""

The vote to send the bill to the President comes two days before the 15th anniversary of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans. House Speaker Paul Ryan was pressed about the pushback from some in the diplomatic and legal community about the precedent it would set, but said, ""this bill passed overwhelmingly in the US Senate so I think that those concerns have been taken under consideration and members are acting accordingly and that's why this bill will pass."" The White House had no comment on the House's action Friday.After the Senate bill passed in May, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said ""it's difficult to imagine the President signing this legislation.""""I know that the advocates of this legislation have suggested that they have taken into account our concerns by more narrowly tailoring the legislation,"" Earnest said. ""But, unfortunately, their efforts were not sufficient to prevent the longer-term, unintended consequences that we are concerned about. This legislation would change longstanding international law regarding sovereign immunity. And the President of the United States continues to harbor serious concerns that this legislation would make the United States vulnerable in other court systems around the world.""House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, refuted that the bill interfered with the sovereign immunity of other countries, and said international acts of terrorism deserve to be exceptions in terms of legal liability.""We can no longer allow those who injure and kill Americans to hide behind legal loopholes, denying justice to the victims of terrorism,"" Goodlatte said.""There are always diplomatic considerations that get in the way of justice, but if a court proves the Saudis were complicit in 9/11, they should be held accountable,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, a sponsor of the Senate bill. ""If they've done nothing wrong, they have nothing to worry about.""Saudi Arabia has denied any role in the attacks and has never been formally implicated, but 15 of the 19 hijackers that carried them out were of Saudi descent. The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, has warned lawmakers that if the bill became law, the country would sell $750 billion in US assets, including treasury securities. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, said in a statement that ""today's vote sends an unmistakable message that we should combat terrorism with every tool we have, and that the families of those lost in attacks like that on September 11th should have every means at their disposal to seek justice.""Pointing to the concerns raised by the White House, Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, said Friday, ""I remain hopeful that we can continue to work with the Administration so we can resolve these issues so the legislation can be signed into law by the president.""House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi previously acknowledged that after the Senate easily passed the bill the administration reached out to try to make some changes but said it was ""a little late.""Recently unclassified documents detail contact and support between some of the hijackers and individuals who may have been connected to the Saudi government. The ""28 pages"" that were long secret also note suspicions about ties between the Saudi royal family and al Qaeda, though the documents also say the speculations have not been verified."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/north-korea-trump-clinton-nuclear-test-asia/index.html	"The test -- Pyongyang's fifth and most powerful -- had enough force to ""rip the heart out of a city,"" one expert said. It marks one more step in North Korea's efforts to develop the missiles and miniaturized warheads needed to reach its perceived enemies. And it raises the possibility that if North Korea succeeds, it will look for black market buyers for its lethal goods.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seized on the test to discredit his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, arguing that ""it's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state."" Clinton avoided commenting on Trump's North Korea positions in remarks Friday. Instead, after meeting with foreign policy experts in New York, she called for cranking up sanctions on North Korea, pushing China to do more, and drew a line in the sand.""We are not going to let North Korea pursue a nuclear weapon with the ballistic missile capacity to deliver it to United States territory,"" Clinton said. ""That is absolutely a bottom line.""Analysts say the internal logic driving North Korea's leadership means the standard international response to the nuclear tests -- denouncements, international meetings, possibly new sanctions -- will likely fail once again. And they say that it won't be long before a President Clinton or President Trump is forced to confront the issue and its impact on Asia.""This administration is handing over what's shaping up to be the number one national security problem for the next administration, whether it's Clinton or Trump,"" said Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Beyond the lethal improvements to a nuclear arsenal that's already estimated to include a stockpile of 15 to 20 weapons, analysts say North Korea could sell the technology and bombs to terrorists. In the past, North Korea has sold missiles to Pakistan and Iran, it tried to sell to Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and supplied Syria with a nuclear reactor that Israel promptly bombed.Clinton flagged the terrorism concern in New York Friday.""ISIS and North Korea are not entirely unconnected because the greatest threat of all would be terrorists getting hands on loose nuclear material,"" Clinton said, ""so it's vital we bring the world together to stop North Korea's dangerous game."" Cha says data that CSIS has collected make it clear the 45th US president will be dealing with Pyongyang sooner rather than later.""You can be certain they will do something when the next president comes in,"" Cha said. ""There's a window before and after US presidential elections where they've done things before, so they'll be putting themselves front and center and neither candidate has really said much about what they'll do.""Trump laid out a position on North Korea as early as 1999 in a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled, ""America Needs a President Like Me."" In that piece, he said he'd bomb North Korea if it didn't give up its nuclear ambitions.""I would let Pyongyang know in no uncertain terms that it can either get out of the nuclear arms race or expect a rebuke similar to the one Ronald Reagan delivered to Muammar Ghaddafi in 1986,"" when the US president launched airstrikes against Libya for sponsoring terrorism, Trump wrote.More recently, after the North Korean nuclear test in January, Trump said the US should pressure China -- Pyongyang's closest ally -- to rein in its close ally because it has ""total control"" over its neighbor. If it doesn't, Trump said, ""We should make trade very difficult with China.""In February, he appeared to suggest the assassination of North Korean president Kim Jong Un, telling ""CBS This Morning"" that he ""would get China to make that guy disappear in one form or another very quickly.""Then, in a May interview with Reuters, he said he would be willing to meet with the North Korean leader.Trump has also proposed withdrawing some US troops from Asia and has said that Japan and South Korea, two strong US allies, should develop their own nuclear capabilities to deal with North Korea, rather than continue to rely on the US to protect them.That proposal, analysts and administration officials point out, would mean dispensing with the US security umbrella that has been key to stability in Asia since the end of World War II.Others say that starting a trade war with China would cause ripples of economic damage across the world, not least in the US. And a meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader would be a radical departure from established practice and policy.""Trump has said all kinds of things, no one really knows what he means,"" Cha said. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.Clinton, meanwhile, has her own problem areas to address.While she was secretary of state, North Korea broke off international talks aimed at ending its nuclear program and violated UN bans on testing long-range missiles and nuclear weapons. Friday in New York, she called for a ""rethinking of the strategy"" and, in an area of agreement with Trump, pushed an urgent effort to convince China to rein North Korea in.China generally opposes sanctions, saying they're counterproductive, and has enforced them in lackluster fashion. China's leaders, obsessed with stability, are deeply concerned about the impact if North Korea collapsed, and Chinese towns along the border are also economically dependent on trade with North Korea.But Beijing has been increasingly frustrated with North Korea's young leader, creating gaps between the two that haven't existed before, analysts say.Clinton said Friday she thinks ""we have an opening here that we haven't had for the last several years that I intend to do everything I can to take advantage of.""She also said she thinks there's a role for more sanctions.That's a position that Republicans also take. Since North Korea first conducted a nuclear test in 2006, international sanctions have focused largely on its weapons.In March, the United Nations passed the first set of sanctions that went further, banning all weapons trade; requiring the inspection of all cargo leaving and entering the country; expanding the number of individuals being sanctioned; requiring countries to expel North Korean diplomats accused of illicit activities, and prohibiting the import of luxury goods such as Jet Skis and watches.There's still room to pressure North Korea further, as Clinton, along with Republicans such as California Rep. Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, suggest.An act passed by Congress gives the administration the power to sanction non-North Korean entities acting as an agent for the country -- in other words, Chinese companies and financial institutions. ""We have a lot of leverage,"" Clinton said Friday, ""and we are going to exercise that leverage.""President Barack Obama said in a statement Friday that the US would pursue new sanctions at the UN along with its allies. So far, though, ""the Obama administration still hasn't sanctioned a single Chinese entity on secondary sanctions,"" said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation. In a January 2015 executive order, the administration also gave itself the authority to sanction any North Korea entity for simply being a North Korean entity.""The administration has barely scratched the surface when it comes to using all of the tools at its disposal to push back against"" North Korean illicit behavior, said Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."	North Korea nuclear test becomes election weapon	['Israel', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

Trump's campaign followed suit, with Trump spokesman Jason Miller telling CNN that the campaign would suspend normal campaign activities.Johnson's campaign also announced that it would not campaign on September 11 either."

""She understood that to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or politicians.""""Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it was not necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that that had a great, great impact,"" Trump added. ""I look forward to being with her family tomorrow.""Schlafly was most well-known for her work opposing the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s, emerging as one of the leading female critics of the feminist movement.""Phyllis Schlafly is a conservative icon who led millions to action, reshaped the conservative movement, and fearlessly battled globalism and the 'kingmakers' on behalf of America's workers and families,"" Trump said following her death. ""I was honored to spend time with her during this campaign as she waged one more great battle for national sovereignty.""In her latest book -- ""The Conservative Case for Trump"" -- released Tuesday, Schlafly argued that conservative Christians should follow high profile evangelical leaders, including Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, and support Trump's candidacy.""Trump has gone to great lengths to court national leaders in the social-conservative movement and has convinced many of the most prominent ones that he genuinely supports their policy positions,"" she wrote in the book co-authored by Ed Martin and Brett M. Decker.Trump, who is handily winning with evangelical voters according to the most recent Pew poll, will protect the Christian faith from Muslims abroad and the political left in the US, Schlafly and her co-authors wrote.""Christianity is under attack around the world -- most dramatically from Islamists, but also insidiously here at home with attacks on religious freedom,"" they wrote.

For 125 years the state has allowed straight-party voting which allows a voter to vote for all candidates of their desired political party by making one mark rather than voting for each partisan candidate individually. In 2015, however, the Michigan legislature passed a regulation that eliminated it.   Challengers, including  individual voters, Common Cause and the A. Philip Randolph Institute, argued in briefs filed with the Supreme Court  that if straight ticket voting were to be eliminated for the next election it would cause voter confusion and longer lines at polling places, particularly for African-American voters who rely on the practice.  Meet Gavin Grimm, the transgender student at the center of bathroom debate""It is about the unconstitutional consequences for millions of voters of eliminating this option in the unique context of Michigan elections—massive confusion and even longer lines at polling places deterring voters, especially African-American voters, from voting,"" wrote Mary Ellen Gurewitz a lawyer for the groups. Gurewitz argued that straight party line tickets serve an ""essential function"" in Michigan, ""in a state which offers no option to vote by mail, no early voting and no easy voting by absentee ballot."" Ginsburg hopes Garland vote happens 'sooner rather than later'Lawyers for the state defended the law passed and argued in the state's briefs that ""neither the Equal Protection Clause, nor the Voting Rights Act require straight-ticket voting"". They pointed out that Michigan has joined 40 other states ""by requiring voters to actually vote for each candidate they intend to support.""""Requiring voters to actually vote for individual candidates would not be a harm to any voter, let alone an irreparable one,"" they argued.Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito said they would have granted Michigan's request.

""He believes President Obama was born here,"" Conway said of Trump. ""I was born in Camden, by the way, New Jersey. He was born in Hawaii.""Trump has been one of the biggest proponents of repeatedly debunked theories about Obama's place of birth, which prompted the President to release his birth certificate showing he was born in the US.Giuliani: Trump believes Obama born in USAs recently as Tuesday, Trump declined to say Obama was born in the US.But Conway was unequivocal. ""There's no question to me he was born in the United States, but he's not been a particularly successful President, and that's what this campaign is about,"" Conway said. Asked why Trump doesn't say it himself, Conway replied: ""You have to ask him.""The birther issue has come up again on the campaign because it has been a problem for Trump in the African-American community. Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and her former opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders, have denounced Trump's past questioning of Obama as racially motivated, using that on the trail to portray Trump as bigoted. One of Trump's top surrogates, Ben Carson, told CNN on Tuesday that it would be a ""good idea"" for Trump to apologize for his past birther comments. 11 of Trump's most outrageous 'birther' claimsOn Tuesday night, Trump was asked about it by Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, ducking the opportunity to outright state that Obama was born in the US.

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/2016-election-gaffes/index.html	"It arguably torpedoed Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was surreptitiously recorded claiming in 2012 that 47 percent of the nation won't support him because they want freebies from the government. But that seems downright quaint beneath the behemoth shadow of ""mistakes"" in 2016.To wit: Donald Trump triumphed in the Republican primary contest despite insulting nearly every interest group in the nation. Hillary Clinton didn't skate through the Democratic primary, but she certainly benefited from Trump hoovering every ounce of media oxygen during her less-than-stellar moments on the trail, as she tried to match the excitement as a primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, who self-described as a democratic socialist while officially running as a Democrat. On both sides of the political aisle, mistakes were made. Stupid things were said. And yet, here we are. You'd think, given the unprecedented distrust and poor favorability voters have for both major party candidates, that the time would be ripe for a third party option.But this week, the Libertarian alternative blanked on a foreign policy softball and the Green Party alternative has a warrant out for her arrest. And Clinton likely regrets saying ""you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" referring to people who are racist, sexist, homophobic or xenophobic.Let us pretend for just a moment that truth really does matter and words really do have consequences (lol, I know, right?), and apply the the longstanding rules of political gaffe coverage to this bewildering and unprecedented election.Looking back, here are just a few of the ""gaffe"" moments of 2016:'Basket of deplorables'Whet your gaffetites with this mishap from Clinton Friday night. Speaking at a fundraiser that was open to the press, Clinton said, ""To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it."" Clinton then said some of these people were ""irredeemable"" and ""not America."" She went on to describe the rest of Trump supporters as people who are looking for change in any form because of economic anxiety and urged her supporters to empathize with them.The comments were predictably trashed on Twitter and drew comparisons to Romney's remark and President Barack Obama's ""bitter"" comment about Pennsylvanians in 2008.""What is Aleppo?"" Johnson -- a third-party nominee who has received an uncharacteristic amount of attention and scrutiny because of the main-party candidates' lack of likeability -- was asked a simple question about the humanitarian crisis facing the city of Aleppo, Syria, as a result of the nation's ongoing civil war. ""What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo,"" Mike Barnicle asked Johnson on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" in September. ""What is Aleppo?"" Jonson asked, appearing genuinely curious. ""You're kidding me,"" Barnicle responded. ""No,"" Johnson said, looking around the room. ""Aleppo is in Syria,"" Barnicle explained. ""It's the epicenter of the refugee crisis."" ""OK, Got it,"" Johnson said. ""Got it."" Johnson later issued a statement that he was human and would continue to make mistakes, but would surround himself with qualified advisers when he's in the White House. Insulting key statesWith the Iowa caucuses just a few months away, in October 2015, Trump insulted Hawkeye State voters by retweeting a post suggesting residents there were mentally ill. Trump tweeted, ""@mygreenhippo #BenCarson is now leading in the #polls in #Iowa. Too much#Monsanto in the #corn creates issues in the brain? #Trump #GOP.""The slight was even too much for Trump, who blamed an intern in a statement that could probably win a short-form poetry contest.  Iowa Republican caucus-goers ultimately did reject Trump, choosing Ted Cruz instead.Sorry for insulting coal miners whose vote I really wantSometimes when you try to appeal to one voting demographic, you brutally insult another. Clinton certainly did so when discussing her energy plan at a March CNN townhall. ""We're gonna put a lot of coal miners and a lot of coal companies out of business,"" she said at the time. The remark came back to bite her when she actually visited coal country, and was confronted by an unemployed miner about what she said. ""I don't know how to explain it other than what I said was totally out of context for what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time,"" Clinton said during a swing in West Virginia two months after the initial remark. ""It was a misstatement because what I was saying is the way things are going now, they will continue to lose jobs ... It didn't mean that we were going to do it. What I said was that is going to happen unless we take action to help and prevent it."" Mocking the disabledTrump swears he did no such thing, but in November 2015 he was accused of imitating New York times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who suffers from arthrogryposis.""Now the poor guy, you ought to see this guy,"" Trump said, positioning his hands to look like a person who has the bone disease. ""'Ah, I don't know what I said! I don't remember!'""Clinton has used this footage of this rally in her television ads, attacking Trump. Choking another party's candidates is funny because we disagree with their policy positions!Plenty of candidates in the past have been in trouble for not shaming supporters who say uncouth things during rallies. John McCain in 2008 was criticized for laughing when a supporter asked him, ""How do we beat the bitch?"" Trump in 2015 was castigated for not correcting a fan who said Obama was ""not even an American."" So it is fair to bring up Clinton, who in October 2015, laughed with a supporter who said he wanted to ""strangle"" then-Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina? ""I wouldn't mess with you!"" Clinton said.Ha! Ha! Ha! Right? (No.)Invoking 9/11 when attacked for ties to Wall StreetOne of Bernie Sanders' most effective attacks against Clinton was his critique that she was too cozy to Wall Street. She had to know it would come up regularly, and during a Democratic primary debate in November, she bungled her response by bringing up the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 to defend her support for bankers. ""I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,"" Clinton said. ""Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy. And it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.""Still not a good answerClinton had another opportunity to address the Wall Street issue when she sat down with CNN's Anderson Cooper in February. Instead of invoking the terrorist attacks, she took a flippant approach. When Cooper asked if she thought it was wise to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from big banks before launching her campaign, she shrugged and responded, ""Well, I don't know. That's what they offered."" Looking for a save, she added, ""They're not giving me that much money now.""Bernie Sanders Democrats were not amused. Attacking family of a fallen American soldier One of the most emotional moments of the Democratic National Convention came when the father and mother of a Muslim-American soldier confronted Trump from the podium about his rhetoric about Muslim Americans. ""You have sacrificed nothing and no one!"" the father, Khizr Khan, said about Trump. Trump responded by insulting the mother of the fallen soldier by insinuating that her husband didn't allow her to speak because she was a woman. And in response to the accusation that he has not sacrificed?  ""I think I've made a lot of sacrifices,"" Trump said. ""I work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures.
