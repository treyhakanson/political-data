I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!"" he said.Former Congressman Mike Rogers said Tuesday he parted ways with Trump's transition team, removing an establishment national security voice from the planning process of the next president's cabinet.Rogers was told Monday on the phone that he was out, according to a source familiar with the transition. The source said this was part of an effort to replace the transition team members associated with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who previously headed up the transition team's efforts until being replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  ""Sometimes in politics ... there are people who are in and people who are out. And the people who have been asked to move on have some relationship with Chris Christie,"" Rogers told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday night.  ""And so there's a whole series of about five of them that fit that criteria that were asked to leave in the last few days. And you know what? That's absolutely the campaign's prerogative. I hope they all stay engaged,"" he added.Kushner has been rubbing allies the wrong way in his recent efforts to purge the transition team of Christie associates, sources say.Kushner's father was prosecuted by then-US Attorney Christie in 2004 for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions.Trump's team of bitter rivalsRogers, who had been working on the transition team for months under Christie, was sidelined as the campaign and transitions merged into one presidential team, with members of Trump's inner circle that were with him through the campaign taking more prominent roles in the transition, according to one source familiar with the transition activity.But another source, a longtime Christie associate, cautioned that there was no ""purge"" of Christie staff, the team that began the transition months ago, and that such a characterization is ""overblown."" While some Christie staff have left, others are continuing on with the transition team.A high-ranking Trump insider said the so-called ""purge"" focused only on lobbyists.The Christie associate said it makes sense that Pence would want some of his own people involved now that he is running the effort.""I think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they'll get that settled pretty soon. I think they're going to need to do it because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important,"" Rogers told Cooper.Earlier Tuesday, Rogers positively described his time period working with the transition team as a ""privilege,"" in a statement to reporters, and said he was handing off his responsibilities as a national security adviser to the transition organization to Pence and ""the stellar new leadership team."" ""I look forward to continuing to provide advice and counsel as needed to the incoming Trump administration as they work to make America great again,"" Rogers said in the statement.Speaking to CNN's Jim Sciutto on ""The Lead,"" Rogers said later Tuesday that he felt the transition team was ""going in a different direction,"" though he noted some confusion on the team.""Is there a little confusion in New York? I think there is. I think this is growing pains,"" Rogers said.The news of Rogers' departure was first reported by Bloomberg. Rogers' participation in the transition team was seen as a heartening sign for traditional GOP national security advisers.Sources tied to the transition team talking to CNN described the organization's internal disagreements -- mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more non-traditional influences on national security issues -- as a ""knife fight"" on Monday.'Knife fight' as Trump builds an unconventional national security cabinetRogers chaired the House Intelligence Committee while he was in Congress and is an Army veteran and former FBI agent with an expertise in national securityHe has also been critical of Russia's role in recent hacking episodes, including the hacks of Democratic political groups during the election which the US government attributed to high levels of Russian government. Trump repeatedly declined to acknowledge Russia's role, saying the evidence was inconclusive.Amid the churn in Trump's transition team the Obama White House Tuesday night said it's moving forward with a broader sharing of information.""We received the MOU signed by Vice President-elect Pence this evening,"" said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokesperson. ""The next step is for the President-elect's transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government. Once we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts as we continue our work to facilitate the transition to the next administration.""

1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/rudy-giuliani-foreign-policy-discussion-secretary-of-state/index.html	"The former New York City mayor spoke Monday about his foreign policy vision at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council and, according to the Wall Street Journal's description, Giuliani ""suggested several times that he would be interested in the (Secretary of State) post."" He also laid out some potential foreign policy priorities. He discussed the fight against ISIS and Mideast peace in addition to US relations with Russia, which he said is not a military threat, and China, which he said Trump will seek to engage on trade. He seemed to waver on how highly a Trump administration would prioritize renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal. Terrorism was at the top of Giuliani's potential international agenda. Giuliani said that ISIS ""short-term, I believe, is the greatest danger, and not because ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, but because ISIS did something al Qaeda never did -- ISIS was able to spread itself around the world."" He pointed to attacks in Orlando, Florida, and Nice, France, as examples of the unique threat posed by a global terror network like ISIS. Regarding the Middle East, Giuliani warned against regional tensions being stoked by Iran. But Giuliani -- a strident critic of the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by the Obama administration -- seemed to back off of a total withdrawal from that agreement, suggesting that reworking the deal would be a lower priority than combating terrorism. ""You have to set priorities. So if the priority is, let's eliminate ISIS, maybe you put that off a little bit. And you get rid of ISIS first. And then you get back to that,"" Giuliani said, when asked if he would potentially spend his first two years as secretary of state locked in a diplomatic fight over the Iran deal.Business ties a problemTrump's transition team, however, is also looking into whether his business ties would complicate his confirmation and his role as the top diplomat, according to a source familiar with transition talks.Some of those ties, previously reported, including lobbying for Citgo, a US-based subsidiary of the Venezuelan oil conglomerate, at his old law firm. His current firm has also done business with Qatar. The source said some of another financial issue regarding Giuliani, like the money he took from the Iranian exile group MEK, may not be as much as a concern, as the group who had many of the GOP establishment lobbying on their behalf and paid for speaking engagements.Business ties might not be the only difficulty. Republican Sen. Rand Paul called the ties to foreign governments ""worrisome,"" but said more importantly, Trump should pick a Secretary of State who opposed the Iraq war like Trump said he did. ""I hope Donald Trump will pick somebody consistent with what he said on the campaign trail -- Iraq war was a mistake, regime change in the Middle East is a mistake.""Both Giuliani and John  Bolton, another possible Secretary of State nominee, were notable supporters of the invasion of Iraq. Trump was not involved in politics at the time and now says he  opposed the Iraq war despite a 2002 radio interview in which he expressed grudging support. But he pushed the idea that he was opposed to the war repeatedly on the campaign. http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/donald-trump-iraq-war-reality-check/Russia and ChinaGiuliani also issued a cavalier dismissal of the threat posed by Russia, calling for a more cooperative relationship while also suggesting that military force be more readily threatened. ""Russia thinks it's a military competitor, it really isn't,"" Giuliani said. ""It's our unwillingness under (President Barack) Obama to even threaten the use of our military that makes Russia so powerful.""And the former New York City mayor said a Trump administration would ""prefer to engage with (China) on economic issues such as trade,"" even as diplomatic tensions between the two nations grow as a result of the standoff over territorial claims in the South China Sea.Trump transition memo: Trade reform begins Day 1Giuliani is among those rumored to be under consideration by the Trump transition team for secretary of state. Other names include John Bolton, a veteran diplomat and former US ambassador to the UN under President George W. Bush, President of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass and Sens. Bob Corker and Jeff Sessions. Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?"	Rudy Giuliani sketches foreign policy vision amid secretary of state buzz
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/donald-trump-trade-memo-transition/index.html	"The document lays out the skeleton of Trump's trade policy for the first 200 days of his presidency, focusing on a set of principles including renegotiating or withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement -- a frequent promise Trump made on the campaign trail.Who would be in Trump's Cabinet?The memo itself notes that plenty could change before Trump starts his presidency on January 20, 2017, calling the contents ""for discussion purposes only."" But the draft memo reveals what the Trump transition team has developed as a blueprint for Trump's administration based on its pre-election work and Trump's own campaign promises. ""The Trump trade plan breaks with the globalist wings of both the Republican and Democratic parties,"" the document notes. ""The Trump administration will reverse decades of conciliatory trade policy. New trade agreements will be negotiated that provide for the interests of US workers and companies first.""What would happen if the US left NAFTA?The 200-day plan is built around five main principles, plus an extra plank on manufacturing jobs. First is renegotiating or withdrawing from NAFTA, second is stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, third is stopping ""unfair imports,"" fourth is ending ""unfair trade practices,"" and fifth is pursuing bilateral trade deals. The final focus, to ""retain and return manufacturing jobs,"" focuses on lowering the business tax rate and eliminating regulations on businesses and restrictions on domestic energy. The provisions on TPP are almost certainly moot, as congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle say the deal will not come up for ratification in the lame duck congressional session. Trump would then not need to take any action to kill it, because the deal would be effectively dead. Congressional leaders say TPP is deadThe plan also gives benchmarks for Days 1, 100 and 200 of the Trump administration.Day 1: Begin NAFTA reformOn Day 1, Trump would begin reforming NAFTA, including ordering the Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to begin a study on what the ramifications of withdrawing from the treaty would be, and what would be required legislatively to do so. He would also have the US Trade Representative notify Mexico and Canada that the US intends to propose some amendments to the treaty, which could include measures on currency manipulation, lumber, country of origin labeling and environmental and safety standards.A draft presidential memorandum at the end of the document that could be used to order the review of NAFTA orders the report to pay ""extra consideration to the effects such a policy change may have on the middle class, manufacturing and service sector workers, and foreign direct investment into the United States.""Trump would also submit legislation on currency manipulation, review whether our trading partners engage in ""harmful"" practices, and would order the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US to review food security in trade and reciprocity in international corporate takeovers (i.e. whether a US company would be able to buy a Chinese company like a Chinese company would be able to be buy a US company).Day 100: Target ChinaBy Day 100, the plan says, Trump would continue NAFTA renegotiations, would pursue cracking down on China by seeing if they could be labeled a currency manipulator and through bilateral trade negotiations. He would also bring the intelligence community into the trade world. Day 200: Consider formal withdrawalBy Day 200, Trump would be considering formally withdrawing from NAFTA and continuing to pursue bilateral trade agreements. The document notes that Congress has granted the President Trade Promotion Authority -- power for the President to get trade deals through Congress more swiftly -- until 2018 and it could be extended until 2021. The memo notes caveats, including that there could be negative consequences of withdrawing from NAFTA. But the document also notes those impacts could be mitigated if the US were to pursue bilateral trade agreements with Canada and Mexico.The Trump transition didn't respond to a request for comment about if Trump had reviewed the document and what his thoughts were.

3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/republican-supreme-court-nomination/index.html	"President-elect Donald Trump is no traditional Republican, but he has demonstrated he would rely on the conservative establishment for high-court advice. His lists of potential nominees sprung from advisers within the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation.Who will Trump pick for the Supreme Court?Some consultants cut their teeth in the 1980s Ronald Reagan administration, adept at selecting judges at all levels of the federal bench who were young and committed.Yet conservatives have not been without internal rivalries over who was best for the high court at a particular moment, such as when Antonin Scalia beat out Robert Bork for the 1986 nomination and John Roberts prevailed over Michael Luttig in 2005. All were appeals court judges with Republican administration bona fides. Sunday night on ""60 Minutes,"" Trump injected criteria related to the substantive views he would seek in a new justice, notably opposition to abortion rights. ""The judges will be pro-life,"" he said, again expressing interest in reversing the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark that made abortion legal nationwide.Yet the President-elect said that he believed last year's decision allowing gay marriage in all 50 states was ""settled.""""It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it's done,"" Trump declared of the recent gay marriage ruling.Trump has not said when he will make his selection, but there is bound to be jockeying among conservatives today over who should succeed Scalia, the right-wing intellectual and provocateur who died in February. That's before whatever opposition might emerge among Democratic senators who saw Republicans fatally stall President Barack Obama's choice of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.Not since 1969 has a president begun his tenure with a Supreme Court seat ready to be filled. Yet, even with a lifetime spot there for the taking, naming this new justice may not go as smoothly as when President Richard Nixon tapped Warren Burger, a law-and-order judge on the D.C. Circuit to succeed retiring Chief Justice Earl Warren. Warren announced his intention to retire in June 1968, expecting then-Democratic President Lyndon Johnson to choose his successor. But senators blocked Johnson's attempt to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas.Warren stepped down in June 1969 after Nixon appointed Burger. Fortas, ensnarled in a financial scandal, resigned that year, too. It took Nixon three attempts and about a year to fill that seat. After the Senate rejected federal judges Clement Haynsworth of South Carolina and G. Harrold Carswell of Florida, it confirmed Harry Blackmun, a U.S. appeals court judge in Minnesota who had been best man at Burger's wedding.Avoiding another SouterOn the current bench, the longest serving justice is Anthony Kennedy, whom Reagan appointed at age 51 in 1988. President George W. Bush, who would be Trump's most recent GOP predecessor, named Roberts at age 50 and Samuel Alito at 55. Ideology has been paramount for Republican administrations. And they've generally gotten what they wanted. An exception was the 1990 selection of David Souter, then 50, whom President George H.W. Bush's chief of staff John Sununu declared a ""home run"" for conservatives.Souter, who like Sununu was from New Hampshire, ended up with one of the most liberal records in recent decades. He retired in 2009, succeeded by President Obama's choice of Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice. George H.W. Bush's other appointee was Clarence Thomas, at age 43, in 1991. Thomas, and African-American lawyer who served in both the Reagan and Bush administration, succeed the first black justice, Thurgood Marshall.Diversity does not appear a priority for Trump. His first 11 candidates offered during the campaign are all white jurists. His second list of 10 issued a few months later was more diverse.Among those candidates who would be under more serious consideration, based on past GOP criteria of seeking those who've been tested, are US appeals court judges such as Steve Colloton of Iowa, William Pryor of Alabama, and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin.Trump may have a second opportunity during his four-year term, given the ages of current justices. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83, Kennedy, 80, and Stephen Breyer, 78. So his advisers might be thinking not only of this first choice but who could be next.Bork v Scalia; Roberts v LuttigIn 1986, Reagan aides debated whether to name Scalia or Bork, both of whom were on the D.C. Circuit to a Supreme Court opening. Patrick Buchanan, a former Nixon speechwriter who joined Reagan's staff in 1985, had written in anticipation of vacancies: ""The stakes here are immense -- whether or not this President can leave behind a Supreme Court that will carry forward the ideas of the Reagan Revolution -- into the 21st century. While Bork is [an] ex-Marine and brilliant judge, I would lean to Scalia for the first seat [of Reagan's second term]. He is an Italian-American, a Roman Catholic, who would be the first Italian ever nominated ... .""Reagan opted for Scalia, then 50, who won easy Senate approval.In 1987, for a new opening, Reagan chose Bork. But Democrats had in the 1986 midterm elections gained control of the Senate and were ready to oppose a judge with a controversial record that critics said would undercut civil liberties. Bork was defeated on a vote of 58-42.Nearly two decades later, in July 2005 after Justice Sandra O'Connor announced she intended to retire, top advisers to George W. Bush were down to Roberts versus Luttig, with a couple of close runners-up that included Alito. Roberts, then on the D.C. Circuit, and Luttig, on the Richmond-based 4th Circuit, had worked together in the Reagan administration beginning in 1981 when they were on the team that prepared O'Connor for her confirmation hearings.Vice President Dick Cheney was among those in the White House favoring Luttig, an uncompromising conservative with a combative reputation. Bush ultimately chose Roberts, known for a more collaborative style.Before Senate hearings had begun, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died, and Bush nominated Roberts to the chief's position. Bush then chose White House counsel Harriet Miers for the O'Connor spot. Miers, a graduate of Southern Methodist University law school who had scant constitutional law experience, faced sharp criticism from conservatives who believed she would hurt their cause. Bork called her nomination ""a disaster on every level.""Miers withdrew and Bush chose Alito, a 15-year veteran of the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit. The Senate confirmed him in January 2006, and O'Connor, who had announced her desire to retire more than six months earlier, stepped down.That series of events illustrates a maxim of nomination political that might apply even more in today's tumult. A president's first choice may not be the final choice."	Republican blueprint for Supreme Court nominations

Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said no official request has been made.""The President-elect has not requested security clearance for any family members and no paperwork has been submitted to this effect. Any reporting otherwise is inaccurate,"" Miller said Thursday.Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told news outlets Wednesday that she didn't have specific details on security clearance, but that if it was requested, then it appeared to be informal.""It sounds to me that was an envelope question posed by someone,"" Conway told Fox News. ""It doesn't sound like it was a formal request.""She also told NBC's ""Today"" show, ""I only know what I read, which is that the inquiries were made very informally, and that's all I know.""Trump to turn business empire over to his childrenIt is unusual for a president's children to be so clued in to White House policy. But the three kids have long been essential advisers to their father's presidential bid, and were named last week to the presidential transition committee -- which raises conflict-of-interest questions given that they will also manage Trump's massive business enterprise.And Kushner, who has been one of Trump's most trusted confidants is expected to be heavily involved in Trump's White House, perhaps in a formal capacity.If given merely ""secret"" clearance, the four might have access to secure communications technology or perhaps to travel schedules and Secret Service procedures. It would likely not mean the Trump children start getting operational or analytical intelligence reports in their inbox -- unless they have a job that requires it. More likely, it would mean if there is a document they need to see for what they are doing, then they will have the functional clearance to look at it.Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect new reporting."

Some of it pretty troubling and not necessarily connected to facts, but being used effectively to mobilize people,"" Obama said at a news conference alongside Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. ""And obviously, President-elect Trump tapped into that particular strain within the Republican Party and then was able to broaden that enough and get enough votes to win the election.""Obama said countries across Europe, as well as the United States, were confronting populist movements based on a fear of intruding global forces, arguing people ""are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world."" He said leaders should heed lessons from results in the US and in Britain, which in June voted to exit the European Union.""It starts looking different and disorienting. And there is no doubt that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right,"" he said. ""That sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity. And that can be a volatile mix.""He said Americans must guard against those trends during Trump's presidency, and insisted he, too, would speak out against divisive language even after he leaves office.""We are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a them,"" he said. ""And I will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the future of the world is going to be defined by what we have in common as opposed to those things that separate us and ultimately lead us into conflict.""'Between frustration and anger'Explaining Trump's win to Europeans, who themselves face rising populist movements in countries across the continent, Obama theorized Americans were simply ready for a change in Washington and were not rejecting his policies outright.""People seem to think I did a pretty good job,"" he said, alluding to surveys showing his job approval rating near its highest point. ""And so there is this mismatch, I think, between frustration and anger. Perhaps the view of the American people was just that need to shake things up.""Obama is on a week-long, three-stop foreign swing that has taken new urgency following Trump's election. He's expecting questions from leaders in Greece, Germany and Peru about Trump's motives and his plans going forward.Global leaders have expressed concerns over Trump's suggestion on the campaign trail that the US might not keep its current level of international commitments, including to NATO. Obama Tuesday also called Greece a ""reliable ally"" in its commitment to the transatlantic alliance, even under tremendous strain from the country's debt crisis. ""We are proud to count Greece as one of our closest allies and one of our greatest friends,"" Obama said at the news conference, commending the country's ability to meet its financial obligations to NATO despite austerity measures.

Ahead of the meeting, Obama had said he would stress that debt reduction strategies beyond austerity must be utilized in Europe going forward.""I will continue to emphasize our view that austerity alone cannot deliver prosperity,"" Obama said, traveling with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who was expected to discuss Greece's persistent debt crisis with officials here.Obama is the first US president to visit Greece in 17 years, and he focused intently on the debt situation and the influx of refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war.RELATED: Obama faces sharp repudiation and a legacy nightmare"	Obama: Donald Trump tapped into a 'troubling' strain
6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/merrick-garland-what-now/index.html	"Senate Republicans torpedoed Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court by refusing to hold a hearing on him for months, and Donald Trump's victory killed it outright. That likely means the Supreme Court will continue with a conservative majority for years to come.But as Garland takes his seat again as the chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, he will be remembered by liberals as the nominee whose seat on the Supreme Court was stolen by Republican senators. Those senators changed forever the Supreme Court nomination process. ""I think the right way to think about this is that he is returning to the DC circuit with his stature enhanced,"" said Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who served as Obama's Solicitor General until last spring and successfully argued blockbuster cases such as same-sex marriage and Obamacare before the high court.Who will Trump pick for the Supreme Court?Verrilli said that Garland has been an ""example of how to act with dignity and class and character"" during the contentious process and added that Garland should serve as an example of ""what it means to act in the public interest."" Verrilli believes the fact that the Republicans refused to hold hearings for Garland has forever and perhaps irreparably changed the Supreme Court nomination process. ""I'm sure that President (Donald) Trump will nominate a person of integrity, character and qualification,"" Verrill said. ""But I just think it's going to be impossible for Democrats in the Senate to think anything other than this was a seat that was stolen from them for partisan reasons by the shredding of the norms that ought to govern the Supreme Court confirmation process."" To be sure, Garland's court, the DC Circuit , is incredibly important because it is charged with reviewing challenges to administrative agencies. The court, for example, is currently mulling a challenge to the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, as well as an important Second Amendment case concerning a DC gun law. Supporters of Garland hope and believe his presence on the appeals court will serve as a check on the Trump administration. ""The job of a DC Circuit judge is particularly important because that court hears key cases against the federal government, and thus could serve as a crucial check against any Trump administration abuses of power,"" said Elizabeth Wydra of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, one of the groups that led the charge to get Garland confirmed. Garland has been absent from his day job for the most part this year because he recused himself after his nomination. The recusal freed him up to concentrate on the confirmation process and also insulated him from cases he might have heard had he ever reached the Supreme Court. For awhile his nomination kept him busy as he traveled to the Hill and met with senators — even those who vowed to block his confirmation hearing. He filled out a Senate questionnaire and gave only a few public interviews and talks. As the election settles in there are some who are looking for long shot bids to get Garland on the court — prospects that have little to no chance. But the precedent set by Senate Republicans who refused to hold hearings will likely continue to engage and outrage some constitutional scholars for decades to come. ""My concern was this was a major step in the wrong direction, what happened with Merrick Garland, and it makes it harder, I think, when the tables are turned for the other party to get this process back to where it needs to be,"" Verrilli said."

Wilson spared Carrion time behind bars, sentencing him instead to probation.Wilson noted Carrion had already been fired from his job as a result of his conduct, has a felony conviction on his record, and was dealing with ""extraordinary"" circumstances at home, including caring for two loved ones with psychiatric issues.""He has suffered severe consequences,"" Wilson said. ""Not every crime needs a prison sentence.""Assistant US Attorney Cassie D. Palmer requested 18 months imprisonment and a lifetime of supervised release in a memorandum submitted prior to sentencing. Palmer wrote that Carrion claimed to have stopped viewing child pornography ""cold turkey"" following his termination from JPL in 2013 but that evidence ""strongly suggests otherwise."" She said Carrion's home IP address connected to a site known to share child pornography on multiple occasions in 2014.The judge did not offer Palmer an opportunity to speak about her position prior to imposing sentence.Carrion's sentence includes a year of house arrest and 10 years of supervised release. It marks a humiliating low point in an otherwise high-flying career. Carrion ""operated and designed"" the ground system that gave the commands to take and reconstruct images of ""Saturn and its rings, Jupiter and its moons"" and various other galactic images, according to his LinkedIn biography.""If it's flying in deep space,"" Carrion wrote on his LinkedIn profile, ""it likely has my imprint on it.""Investigators from NASA's inspector general's office became aware of inappropriate internet browsing on the JPL network in spring 2012, according to court papers. Someone had been accessing websites known to host sexually explicit content, including stories about child abuse. An investigation revealed that the traffic was coming from Carrion's government-issued computer.Agents seized Carrion's computer and other government-issued items, including two external hard drives and 22 CDs and digital video discs. On them, investigators found more than 5,000 images and 65 videos of child pornography and 60 child sex abuse stories.Nearly 3,000 of the images and five of the videos involved children under age 12, according to prosecutors.Three of the victims were identified by the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children. One, identified in court papers as ""Misty"" provided a victim impact statement to be considered by the judge prior to sentencing.Misty said she was sexually abused by her uncle beginning at age 4. Images of the assaults were put on the internet and downloaded by Carrion, according to prosecutors.Misty said she continues to feel victimized by knowing that she is ""forever in pictures that people are using to do sick things.""""What happened to me hasn't gone away,"" she said. ""It will never go away."""	Ex-NASA engineer who downloaded child pornography sentenced to probation

Avakian, a champion of the LGBTQ community, was running for Secretary of State.  As labor commissioner since 2008, Avakian often made news for his tough calls against businesses discriminating against gay and transgender customers.The most noteworthy was when Sweet Cakes by Melissa refused to make the wedding cake for the same-sex couple in 2013, citing the owners' religious beliefs. Shop owners Melissa and Aaron Klein were ordered to pay $135,000 in emotional damages. They were also told they couldn't refuse customers based on sexual orientation. Melissa Klein claimed the ruling stripped the couple of their First Amendment rights. ""According to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech,"" she said in a Facebook post at the time. ""Sweet Cakes by Melissa"" eventually shut down completely, though their Facebook page remains active.Avakian was also responsible for slamming a $400,000 fine on a Portland bar owner who refused service to transgender customers, according to the Oregon Live.In his bid for Secretary of State, Avakian promised a push for ""progressive values"" like wage equality and reproductive freedoms. His conservative opponent promised to adhere to the position's basic, more traditional roles, like auditing public records and officiating elections.In the end, the opponent, Dennis Richardson won 48% of the popular vote, beating Avakian by nearly 100,000 votes. The victory makes Richardson the first Republican to win a statewide office in Oregon since 2002. "	Oregon official who shut down local bakery loses election
