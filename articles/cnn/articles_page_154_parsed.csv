It binds us together. It reaffirms that all of us are America, that African-American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story,"" he added. ""It is central to the American story.""Saturday's opening ceremony for the museum also was attended by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and Chief Justice John Roberts. Thousands are expected to have descended on the National Mall this weekend to celebrate the museum's opening.Calling it an ""act of patriotism"" to understand African-American history and the struggles of all Americans, Obama said ""a great nation doesn't shy away from the truth.""""We're not a burden on America or a stain on America or an object of shame and pity for America. We are America,"" Obama said. ""And that's what this museum explains.""""Hopefully, this museum makes us talk to each other and listen to each other and see each other,"" he added. Obama also said the museum can provide context to the current national debate on the relationship between law enforcement and black communities that recently made headlines following the police shooting deaths of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina.""Perhaps it can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Ferguson (Missouri) and Charlotte. But it can also help black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past, but within the white communities across the nation, we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing,"" he said.""It reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow aren't ancient history. It's just a blink in the eye of history,"" Obama continued.Star-studded eventSaturday's event included musical performances by Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle and Denyce Graves, as well as appearances by Robert De Niro and Angela Bassett, who read the words of black poets and historians. RELATED: Congressman: Black history museum is 'an American story'The effort to bring this museum to life began decades ago but was finally set in motion in 2003 when Bush signed a bill creating it. Ground was broken in February 2012. The Smithsonian says the museum is the only one in the US exclusively focused on African-American life, history and culture, but organizers say it is also meant to capture the story of all Americans.One of those who have worked for years to see this museum come to life is educator and historian Lonnie Bunch, founding director for the museum. Asked what does it mean to him to see it finally open, he said, ""It means that finally the African-American story on the National Mall is accessible to everybody, and in many ways it means that my ancestors are smiling,"" he told CNN. ""This is framed in  a way that this is everybody's story. It is not a black people's story. It is a story of America.""Slavery and freedom at focusOfficials said the chronicling of slavery and freedom are the centerpiece of the museum. That exhibit contains such items as a slave cabin from South Carolina, a bill of sale for a 16-year-old girl for $600, shackles used on slaves and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation.RELATED: Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violenceThere is also an exhibition focusing on the fight against segregation, which discusses the era from end of Reconstruction through the Civil Rights Movement. Here, visitors see such things as abolitionist Harriet Tubman's hymn book to a dress Rosa Parks was making shortly before she was arrested for not giving up her seat on a segregated bus; a Tuskegee airplane used to train African-American pilots for World War II flights; a segregated Pullman train car as well as a stool from the Woolworth store where there were sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960; and separate water fountains. A separate section examines the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power era of the 1960s and 1970s and other activism remembering many activists, including Lewis and Dr. Martin Luther King.The museum holds more than 3,000 artifacts -- with many contributed from ordinary Americans from across the country. There are also tens of thousands of other artifacts which have been contributed which could be rotated later into exhibition space. Obama on Trump: 'Even most 8-year-olds' know slavery was a bad time for black peopleThere are also many iconic items celebrating the achievements in sports, music, television and film including Michael Jackson's fedora hat worn during his 1984 ""Victory Tour,"" boxer Muhammad Ali's headgear, musician Chuck Berry's Cadillac, baseball star Jackie Robinson's bat, some of Olympian Gabby Douglas' items as well as a statue honoring American athletes who held their hands up as a demonstration of solidarity during the 1968 Gold Medal ceremony. Obama featuredOne exhibit honors the legacy of Obama's election. During an interview airing Friday, he voiced his appreciation for all of those whose work helped make the museum happen.""We were an outgrowth of Frederick Douglass and white abolitionists who partnered with him,"" Obama told ABC News. ""We were the consequence of these Freedom Riders. Of all races. Young people idealistically coming down here and being willing to challenge an unjust system.""Also interesting is the design of the building. Sitting next to the Washington Monument on the National Mall, the exterior is made up of 3,600 bronze-colored panels. The architects of the building drew on imagery from both African and American history for the outer layer, saying they were trying to reach towards the sky to express faith, hope and resiliency. The building is three-tiered and is inspired by a traditional wooden column that features a crown or corona -- or African headdress -- at the top. At night, the corona glows from the light within the building."	Obama: African-American museum helps tell fuller story of America	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Lewis', 'Roberts', 'Black', 'Obama']	[]

We appreciate that they are concerned about Charlotte,"" Jennifer Roberts told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""At this point, we do have very stretched resources for security and they are working around the clock. If there would be a way to delay those visits in terms of giving us a chance to get our city back to order and back to more of a state of normalcy, that would probably be ideal.""Clinton's campaign announced late Friday that she would postpone a visit to the city after having announced that she would go to Charlotte on Sunday. An aide said the campaign had consulted with Roberts' office about the visit, and were told about concerns that a trip would drain vital city resources.A campaign spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, said Clinton will instead visit on October 2.Also late Friday, two Trump campaign officials said they were no longer considering a post-debate trip next week to the city, though they didn't mention Roberts' plea.Trump took to Twitter Friday night to criticize Clinton over her decision to announce, and then reverse, her plans to visit the city.""Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!"" he tweeted.Trump, however, visited Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last month, days after flooding devastated the area, opening him to criticism from Clinton that he disrupted the response.The shooting of Keith Lamont Scott has sparked protests in Charlotte and is the latest incident to fuel a national discussion about lethal police force, particularly against African-Americans.Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violenceClinton called Friday for officials in Charlotte to make public a police video showing the fatal shooting of Scott.""Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay. We must ensure justice & work to bridge divides. --H,"" Clinton said in a tweet, the ""H"" indicating that she personally approved the message.Two police videos from a dashboard camera and an officer's body camera show how Scott died, but have not been released to the public. Police allowed Scott's family to view the videos Wednesday."	Clinton, Trump scrap plans to visit Charlotte after mayor's plea	['Roberts', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""North Korea's unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland,"" Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Maryland. ""It's consumed an awful lot of time -- I think it's fair to say -- of senior leadership's time over the past few weeks.""The North Korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. ""Only a couple of days ago, the United States has again threatened the DPRK by flying the strategic bombers 'B-1B' over the military demarcation line on the Korean peninsula and landing in South Korea,"" Ri said. ""We will never remain onlookers at it and the United States will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination."" Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry met Friday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation.""The United States will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies,"" Kerry told the ASEAN meeting.He called on allies to ""vigorously"" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged ASEAN members to ""ensure that the DPRK pays a price for its dangerous actions."" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a blunt call for international action at the UN Wednesday. ""Right before our eyes, North Korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt,"" Abe said. ""There is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now.""The perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals Japan and South Korea closer together. It's putting China on the spot as Washington pushes Beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the South China Sea complicate cooperation. And it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force Iran to the negotiating table.That's still unlikely to stop North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, experts said. Indeed, US officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early October.""From North Korea's perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there's a substantial shift in dialogue with the US,"" said Alison Evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm IHS.""For North Korea, it's the recognition that's the important thing. It needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized,"" Evans said, adding that, ""The leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival.""RELATED: US B-1 bombers fly over South Korea in show of forceUS officials say the Pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. Meanwhile, the Union of Concerned Scientists said there is some speculation that Pyongyang may try another satellite launch around October 10, the anniversary of the founding of its Worker's Party of Korea.North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January. In the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches.In May, North Korea's 32-year-old leader Kim Jong-un made the country's ambitions official, announcing that Pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy.Pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on September 9, the anniversary of the DPRK's founding in 1948.And Tuesday's rocket launch was ""substantially larger and more powerful than anything North Korea has tested before,"" according to 38 North, a program devoted to analyzing North Korea at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.All this testing is unlikely to win it the US recognition it craves, though.After the more recent nuclear test, President Barack Obama made clear that ""the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state.""Obama said that the US would work with Asian allies, the UN Security Council and international partners to implement existing measures and ""take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.""However, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that Obama administration will soon no longer calling the American shots on the issue.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has held out the possibility of meeting with Kim in a dramatic break with US political conventions. He earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that South Korea and Japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons.""At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee in March. ""We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself.""The statements have rattled Tokyo and Seoul, and while Trump has said that China must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with Beijing on trade could also roil that effort.The Republican candidate's tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding American policy in the region and is likely to be something that US officials are asked to address in their consultations Friday. Hillary Clinton has also articulated a strong stance on China, but is less likely to take the protectionist steps that could spark a trade war with the Asian power. On North Korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up US sanctions.International sanctions levied in March after the January nuclear test were the first on North Korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. They ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps.The international community could squeeze North Korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, echoing the way UN sanctions targeted Iran by banning the export of its oil.""That is a big step,"" Klingner said, ""it will impact the people of North Korea.""China signed on for the March sanctions, but its officials have repeatedly said they believe sanctions are counterproductive and experts say China historically hasn't thoroughly enforced them against North Korea. US tensions with China over the South China Sea could make it harder to cooperate.Dunford said Wednesday that ""China seeks to limit our ability to project power and to undermine the credibility of our alliances in the Pacific.""The US can take additional unilateral steps to get tougher on Pyongyang, Klingner said, by sanctioning non-North Korean entities that act as an agent for the country -- most likely Chinese entities and financial institutions.In the meantime, US military officials are planning.From October 3 to 21, the US and South Korea will carry out the joint exercise ""Red Flag"" in Alaska, which will include an aerial exercise ""simulating attacks on nuclear facilities and scenarios of sudden missile attack,"" a ministry spokesperson with the South Korean Defense Department told CNN.North Korea derided South Korea as a ""puppet warmongers"" in a statement about the Red Flag exercises.

This source added that the meeting with Trump came to fruition following a phone call between the GOP nominee's representatives and Netanyahu's office after it was clear that a similar meeting was going to take place with Clinton. Another source disputed that account, saying Trump's camp reached an agreement with Netanyahu's office first.Additional details about the meetings, including what will be discussed, were not immediately disclosed.Clinton and Trump, the respective Democratic and Republican candidates for president, are set to face off in their first debate Monday night.Clinton had also planned to visit Charlotte, North Carolina, on Sunday, but scrapped those plans due to the unrest following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott earlier this week.Netanyahu met with President Barack Obama on Wednesday in what was likely their last face-to-face consultation. The relationship between the leaders of the two close allies was often contentious, with the White House accusing Netanyahu of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran.The Obama administration, in turn, has publicly opposed Israel's expanded settlement activity in the West Bank and has expressed disappointment at Netanyahu's occasional skepticism about the viability of a two-state solution in the region.Obama has looked to boost the relationship with Israel during the homestretch of the presidential campaign, which he hopes Clinton will win.Obama took a step toward solidifying the alliance this month by completing a long-term, $38 billion security aid package for Israel, the largest such agreement ever for a US ally.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/23/politics/clinton-emails-state/index.html	"DC District Court Judge James Boasberg said the department must process 1,050 pages of emails between now and November 4, releasing any non-exempt documents aside from those that are determined to be duplicates of those already released. It is unclear exactly how many pages the State Department will have to release as part of that order, but it is expected to be significantly fewer than 1,000 pages. That's because a ""substantial number"" of the recovered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates, a Justice Department attorney representing the State Department said in court. The State Department has appraised approximately 15,000 documents recovered by the FBI, believed to have been sent by or to former Secretary Clinton while she was in office. Of those, over 9,400 have been deemed personal and therefore not subject to release, the attorney said, while approximately 5,600 are believed to be work-related.Production will begin October 7, with subsequent releases October 21 and November 4 -- four days before the election. The State Department will then process 500 pages of the remaining documents per month until all have been released.    The order by Judge Boasberg comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch. An attorney for Judicial Watch pressed the judge to order the release of all the relevant records prior to the election.Saying he was sympathetic to the efforts of the State Department's heavily-taxed FOIA division, Boasberg offered his 1,500-page order. ""I think it's important the public have as much clarity as possible,"" Boasberg said, but later quipped, ""sometimes I wonder if there's anything other that FOIA processing going on at State.""The Judicial Watch case is one over over two dozen FOIA lawsuits related to Clinton's emails.In a statement to CNN, State Department Spokesman John Kirby reiterated the State Department's commitment to release the official emails, and said, ""All releasable records and portions of these records will be posted on State's FOIA website."""

The incident began Sunday when Hagerstown police officers received a 911 call that a bicyclist hit a car, according to police.One of the videos shows the girl walking away from police and then attempting to ride away on her bike before she was then pulled back by one officer.""Get off of me!"" the girl cried repeatedly, as she struggled with the officer for several minutes before two cops lifted her up and put her in the back of a police car.The videos show passersby watching as officers repeatedly told the girl, who was handcuffed, ""you are going to get sprayed,"" and ordered her to put her feet inside the patrol car.The girl continued to scream until an officer pepper-sprayed her through the open car window and another officer closed the door.""I can't breathe,"" cried the girl, who is not being identified by CNN.Her lawyer said she was sprayed four times, while the police chief said it was once. The attorney, Robin Ficker, posted a video taken by a witness on the scene, and the lawyer included the following a message on Facebook:""This little girl, 5 ft. 105 lbs, was brutalized by Hagerstown police after, she, on her bike, was hit by a car, but refused medical treatment. They slammed her against a wall, arrested her for refusing treatment, maced her 4 times in the police car while handcuffed, and took her to the police station instead of the hospital!""Hagerstown Police Chief Victor Brito strongly defended the actions of the officers in a news conference Thursday, saying the girl had become ""assaultive"" and ""combative"" and would not cooperate with police. She can be heard on the videos cursing at the officers. The cops told her they wanted to contact her parents, but she wouldn't give them any information. ""Every time we use a level of force, regardless whether we are justified or not, we lose,"" Brito told reporters.The police chief said the officers had tried to deescalate the situation and recognized that pepper-spraying the teen did not ""look great"" for law enforcement, but was necessary as a last resort. The girl, her mother, and Ficker spoke to reporters to express anger with the actions of the police, which led to demonstrations in the city and ignited a storm on social media.""The cops knew she might not be OK, but they didn't treat her that way,"" Ficker said.When asked by a reporter if the teen acted appropriately in dealing with the police, the girl's mother suggested that the situation ""could have been handled better (by her daughter),"" but added: ""I don't know that she was even in the right frame of mind.""""You don't take a 15-year-old child, and put them in handcuffs, and shut a door, and mace them four times,"" said the girl's mother. ""Why was she not transported to the hospital? Why?""Police said the girl refused medical treatment at the scene.The teen was later charged with disorderly conduct, assault and possession of marijuana, according to police."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/23/politics/us-military-sinks-isis-navy/index.html	"While Iraq is nearly entirely land-locked, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that cross that country are navigable, and ISIS has been using watercraft for a variety of purposes, including transporting fighters and conducting improvised explosive attacks.\The US-led anti-ISIS coalition provided CNN with video of a September 10 airstrike against an ISIS tactical unit aboard a boat near Bayji, Iraq. Barges, skiffs and motorized watercraft have been observed operating along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for the purpose of ferrying ISIS fighters and equipment across the rivers, Operation Inherent Resolve spokesperson Col. Joseph Scrocca told CNN, adding that it happens often when anti-ISIS Iraqi troops control the area's bridges. Coalition bombs have also targeted bridges used by ISIS, thereby further necessitating the terror group's reliance on boats. ""They have also been used by Daesh for waterborne improvised explosive device attacks,"" the spokesperson added, using another name for the terror group. A US Apache attack helicopter in July destroyed one such waterborne IED, a boat full of explosives. The vessel was attempting to remove a newly built Iraqi bridge spanning the Tigris River, according to the US military. ""It destroyed the boat so it didn't go attack the bridge,"" US Army Col. Christopher Garver, a spokesman for the military coalition against ISIS, told reporters in August. But while the US and its allies have been striking ISIS boats for months, the last few weeks have seen a major uptick in the number that have been sunk, with over 50 destroyed on September 16 and 14. Those strikes occurred near the towns of  Qayyara and Sultan Abdallah, which lie along the Tigris River south of the ISIS-held city of Mosul.Experts think that the increase in the rate of strikes is tied to the upcoming effort by the US and Iraq to retake Mosul, which military officials have said could start as early as October.As part of its defensive efforts, ""ISIS is going to try and move fighters up and down the river,"" retired US Navy Cdr. Chris Harmer told CNN.Harmer thinks the US is attempting to scuttle the ISIS vessels in particular so that the group can't position its forces via the water. The Tigris River runs directly through the heart of Mosul, dividing Iraq's second-largest city in two.He also called the boats an ""easy target in terms of avoiding civilian casualties"" for the US.ISIS, he said, might try to destroy bridges to slow the Iraqi military's assault on Mosul, noting that ""a speedboat with 1,000 kilograms of explosives going into a bridge"" is a lot harder to defend against than a conventional IED that would have to be set by ISIS operatives on foot. Historically control of the two rivers has been critical to Iraqi military campaigns. During World War I, the British used small armed river boats traveling up the Tigris and Euphrates in its campaign against the Ottoman Turks.   Harmer, now the senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, said that the Iraqi military had never really mastered riverine warfare -- fighting on the river -- making the coalition's support all the more essential.And despite the large number of boats sunk, Harmer thinks ISIS may have no trouble seizing additional vessels from Iraqi fishermen, farmers and others who have used the river for thousands of years.""There's always been a steady state of traffic flow on the river,"" Harmer said."

He said lawmakers were trying to be ""sensational"" by seizing on Bresch's multi-million-dollar compensation.And he slammed an article in USA Today for questioning whether his wife, Gayle, improperly used her position in an education group to boost the drug's prices, calling it a ""cheap shot"" and ""tabloid"" journalism. He praised Mylan as a West Virginia company that saved the country $180 billion.Bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the lifesaving allergy drug EpiPen, which is one of the company's signature products. The drug, which cost around $100 in 2009, shot up to as much as $600.The move sparked outrage from parents with children who rely on the drug, and even prompted comments from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the need to rein in rising drug costs. One of those parents was actually a colleague of Manchin -- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- and multiple members of Congress called for hearings on the spiking cost.Above all else, Manchin said it was unfair to blame Mylan for the dramatic increase in EpiPen, saying it was a problem in a ""convoluted"" system and middlemen that helped raise the price.""Heather is the most caring, sharing, generous person I've ever met in my entire life - most accomplished and tougher than nails,"" he said. ""Absolutely,"" Manchin said when asked if his daughter was forthright to House lawmakers during a contentious hearing Wednesday. ""But people have to listen, too.""He added: ""We can criticize and beat the living crap out of anyone we want to, and that was proven yesterday. But does that solve the problem? Do they really want to solve the problem?""Bresch earned nearly $19 million last year. Manchin suggested that the attacks on his daughter's compensation, which he called ""pretty sensational,"" were to be expected given her success.""You have to expect that, you know,"" he said. ""I make $174,000. They haven't attacked me yet, but I'm sure that people who make less than 174 would attack us, too.""Asked if his daughter performed well, Manchin said that while anyone can always improve, she succeeded given the circumstances.""That's a hostile environment,"" he said.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/road-to-270-electoral-college-map-4-september/index.html	" And, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency.Why two congressional districts could be key to this electionWith four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate.What's changed?-- Iowa (6) moves from from ""battleground"" to ""lean Republican""-- Utah (6) moves from ""lean Republican"" to ""solid Republican""-- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground""-- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground"" Explore the map and make your choicesRoad to 270: Electoral College mapNote: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.The state of playDonald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up ""battleground"" category into the ""lean Republican"" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor. That leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina. Maine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results.  Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate.  Maine's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground,"" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory. Finally, Utah moves back from ""leaning Republican"" to being solidly being in Trump's column. There is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging.For all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump.It is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall.Ohio poised to go down to the line on Election DayThat's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio.Clinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.Solid Republican:Alabama (9), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (3), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (38), Utah (6)West Virginia (5), Wyoming (3) (163 total)Leans Republican:Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Iowa (6), (33 total)Battleground states:Florida (29), Nevada (6),  Ohio (18), Maine 2nd Congressional District (1) Nebraska 2nd Congressional District (1), North Carolina (15) (70 total)Leans Democratic:Colorado (9), Michigan (16), New Hampshire (4), Pennsylvania (20), Virginia (13), Wisconsin (10),  (72 total)Solid Democratic:California (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), DC (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maine (3), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3), Washington (12), Minnesota (10), New Mexico (5) (200 total)"	Road to 270: CNN's general election map	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

Spokespersons for the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan and the FBI declined to comment.The allegations first surfaced in the Daily Mail. The online sexting relationship allegedly went on for months between Weiner and a girl claiming to be just 15. The Daily Mail reported she said he sent her numerous photos, one of him in a pool and at least one bare-chested.The outlet reported that the girl said she reached out to Weiner in January on Twitter.In a statement to CNN, Weiner neither confirmed or denied sending the texts.""I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgment about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt,"" he said.Weiner continued: ""While I have provided the Daily Mail with information showing that I have likely been the subject of a hoax, I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position. I am sorry.""CNN has not been able to confirm this was a hoax.In a statement, a spokeswoman for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump noted that Weiner donated $550 to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign last year.""The announcement by the FBI and New York Police Department that they are investigating close Clinton ally Anthony Weiner's inappropriate relationship with an underaged female is extremely disturbing,"" Jessica Ditto said. ""The Clinton campaign should immediately return all campaign contributions from Weiner. America has had enough of the sleaze that is Clinton, Inc.""Huma Abedin, one of Clinton's closest aides, announced last month that she was separating from Weiner after photos emerged of him allegedly sexting with another woman while their son was in bed with him. That woman was described in the New York Post as a 40-something divorced woman from the West.Weiner left Congress in June 2011 when sexually-charged, sometimes explicit, texts with women other than his wife first emerged. His social media habits continued after leaving Congress and contributed to his poor showing in the 2013 New York City mayoral race, a contest in which he had once been a leading contender.
