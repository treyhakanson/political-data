The video has been shared tens of thousands of times on social media.The ballot booth video is from @lordaedonis, who was pretty active on Twitter Tuesday, both before and after the video grabbed people's attention. ""Everybody keep tryna tell me I said the machine was rigged & I never said that, it was just weird how it happened,"" he Tweeted.""I went to vote, and I had heard there was stuff already going on, like problems,"" @lordaedonis, who asked to be referred to as Aedonis Bravo, told CNN. ""Then when I went in there I hadn't pressed any buttons proper, and it wouldn't let me pick Trump.""Bravo said a polling official at the Dorothy Emanuel Recreation Center in Philadelphia was quickly able to remedy the situation by pressing ""two or three buttons"" after he asked for assistance. Bravo was then able to complete his vote for Trump.Bravo didn't offer an explanation for what might have happened, however election judges in another part of the state told CNN that voters have to unselect a candidate if they first accidentally hit a wrong button. In the video, the screen's far left column lists all the offices, with flashing lights for the ones that have yet to be voted upon. There's a solid red light in the Democratic column in the box for Clinton. A finger jabs repeatedly at the box with Trump's name to no avail.      Calls to the Philadelphia City Commissioners' office to inquire about any reports of issues at the polls were not immediately returned."	Viral video shows voter fraud? Take a closer look

But how will the world greet him? Here's a rundown of Trump's past comments:MexicoDonald Trump mentioned Mexico frequently on the campaign trail. The GOP nominee's first controversial campaign remarks came in his presidential announcement speech, when he called some Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and criminals. He also promised to ""build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.""In July 2015, he tweeted: ""I love the Mexican people, but Mexico is not our friend. They're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade. FIGHT!""Trump mixed the insults with some pleasantries, including on a visit to Mexico in August to meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto. But there could well be anxiety south of the border as Mexico wakes to the news of a Trump presidency.ChinaThe US president-elect has signaled a tough line with China over trade, accusing it of ""taking our jobs and taking our money.""In an interview last month, Trump warned that he would be willing to cut off US relations with China over its business practices. ""They're not going to do it, because if China ever did that, and if we ever cut off relationships with China, China would go bust so fast. I mean, China lives off the money out of the United States. They devalue their currency and they take our businesses,"" he told KSNV's Jim Snyder.When President Barack Obama visited China in September for a G20 summit, Trump hit out over the lack of a red carpet from Air Force One.He has repeatedly accused Beijing of manipulating its currency to make its exports more competitive and threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese imports.He has also previously accused China of cyber attacks and using North Korea to antagonize the United States.""China controls North Korea. So now besides cyber hacking us all day, they are using the Norks to taunt us. China is a major threat,"" he tweeted in April 2013.Trump's challenge: Can he stop conflict in the South China Sea?IranTrump has been highly critical of the Obama administration over Iran, saying a landmark multilateral agreement last year over Iran's nuclear program ""gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing -- it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.""""Iran continues to ... [do] many bad things behind our backs. Time to WALK and double the sanctions. Stop payments!"" he tweeted in July last year.Saudi ArabiaTrump may not find too many friends in Saudi Arabia. He slammed Obama for his veto -- subsequently overridden -- of a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue the kingdom, saying it was ""shameful and will go down as one of the low points of his presidency."" Trump said that as president he would sign the legislation. Saudi Arabia described the law as of ""great concern.""Additionally, in June 2015, Trump tweeted: ""Saudi Arabia should be paying the United States many billions of dollars for our defense of them. Without us, gone!""Although Trump refused to release his tax returns, he filed a personal financial disclosure form with the Federal Election Commission in May which revealed he has business interests in at least 22 countries, including Saudi Arabia.Germany and FranceIn January, Trump described Germany as a ""total mess"" as he lamented terror attacks in Germany and France, and urged both countries to ""GET SMART!""Interviewed on NBC's Meet the Press in July, Trump indicated that he would implement tougher immigration controls for those two nations, saying ""we have problems in Germany and we have problems with France"" when it comes to Islamist extremism. What's needed, he said, is ""extreme vetting.""He also blamed France for a series of devastating terror attacks on its soil, saying: ""It's their own fault, because they've allowed people over years to come into their territory.""READ: The massive implications of Trump's Muslim travel ban in 5 mapsUnited KingdomIn December last year, Trump angered many in the United Kingdom by suggesting it has a ""massive Muslim problem.""A public petition set up in the wake of Trump's call to ban Muslims from the US garnered so many signatures -- more than half a million -- that UK lawmakers had to hold a non-binding debate about whether he could be banned from visiting Britain for hate speech. London's Mayor Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major western capital, told CNN that Trump's views of Islam were ""ignorant"" and that he hoped he would not win the presidency.Trump's mother is Scottish and the property mogul famously owns golf courses in Scotland. But he did himself no favors with many Scots when, on a visit to Scotland in June, he congratulated them via Twitter on the Brexit vote, saying they ""took their country back."" The majority of Scots voted to remain in the European Union, not to leave.READ: Trump's Brexit-style win is bad news for BritainBelgiumIn January, Trump described life in the Belgian capital, Brussels, as living in a ""hellhole"" because of issues over multicultural integration.But he may have made some amends -- while raising questions about his knowledge of geography -- at a rally in Atlanta in June, when he declared, ""Belgium is a beautiful city.""PakistanTrump hasn't spared Pakistan from criticism either in years past, referring to the discovery of fugitive al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden there in 2011.""When will Pakistan apologize to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden for 6 years?! Some 'ally,' "" he tweeted back in July 2012.In another tweet in January that year, Trump said: ""Get it straight: Pakistan is not our friend. We've given them billions and billions of dollars, and what did we get? Betrayal and disrespect—and much worse.""SyriaTrump said in March that the US should take in no more refugees from war-torn Syria, suggesting they pose too much of a threat to ""civilization as we know it.""Four months earlier, he tweeted: ""Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?""South AfricaSome South Africans may also object to Trump's language. Back in April last year he called the country ""a total - and very dangerous - mess.""In 2013, he also slammed the ""corrupt and pathetic"" South African police for not arresting a sign language interpreter ridiculed for his incoherent translation of the Nelson Mandela memorial service.RussiaOf course, there are some countries about which Trump has spoken favorably. Most notable in the election campaign were his warm words for Russia, at a time when US-Russian relations have hit a post-Cold War low.""It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond,"" Trump said about Russian President Vladimir Putin in a statement last December. ""I have always felt that Russia and the United States should be able to work well with each other towards defeating terrorism and restoring world peace, not to mention trade and all of the other benefits derived from mutual respect.""Back in 2014, he said Putin had become ""a big hero"" whereas Obama's popularity was falling. READ: Trump's challenge: Can he avoid a direct confrontation with Russia?IsraelIn a video message to supporters in Israel last month, Trump said he would ""make America and Israel safe again"" and that his administration would ""stand side-by-side with the Jewish people.""He also tweeted ""I think Israel is inspiring!"" He, like his rival Hillary Clinton, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York in September.Trump may have work to do, though, to win over all Israelis. During the campaign, some critics accused Trump of including and sharing anti-Semitic themes in his tweets.IndiaAlso last month, Trump said that if elected, the US would be ""best friends"" with India, adding: ""There isn't going to be any relationship more important to us.""""Such amazing people in India. This trip is very enlightening!"" he tweeted back in 2014.AustraliaAnother nation to be complimented by Trump is Australia, described as ""a beautiful country with terrific people."""

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-blue-wall/index.html	"That bedrock belief, which Republicans and Democrats had shorthanded to ""the Blue Wall,"" was torn asunder as Trump romped through a series of Great Lakes states that had been Democratic cornerstones for decades. A trio of reliably Democratic states won by Trump, or with a Trump lead as of Wednesday morning -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- were never assumed to be a given, but every Clinton path to the White House took the Blue Wall as the starting point for any path by Hillary Clinton to 270 electoral votes. A fourth, Minnesota, showed just a slim lead for Clinton, and was too close to call by Wednesday morning.The 18 states and the District of Columbia that have supported Democrats for president since 1992 gave Democrats 242 electoral votes -- placing Clinton only 28 votes away from clinching the nomination. Analysts on both sides of the aisle spent most of the past months devising the path of least resistance for obtaining that margin.Tuesday made that exercise a fool's errand. Trump outright won two of the three -- Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- and leads narrowly in the third, Michigan.The last time Republicans won in Wisconsin? 1984.The last time they won Michigan? 1988.The last time in Pennsylvania? Also 1988.And the last time Minnesota went red? 1972.Powered by an energized white working-class who dot small towns across those states, a Republican wave swept across and crumbled that wall. Trump's message on trade channeled a dissatisfaction with the de-industrialization that has changed the economy in the Rust Belt, and results show that it resonated on Tuesday evening. His voters showed up.Clinton was also not as popular with white voters as Obama was. She won only 37% of the white vote, compared to Obama's 39%. Surprisingly, Trump also garnered a slightly smaller share than Mitt Romney, capturing 58% of the vote to Romney's 59%.Republicans have striven for cycles to flip some of those states, particularly George W. Bush, who made efforts during his presidency to take Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. But their position behind the wall was fortified each time GOP candidates tried to win them -- and failed.Democrats, too, took the states largely for granted this cycle. Pennsylvania, to be sure, was pegged as a top-tier battleground from virtually the first day of the general election. Clinton did not visit Wisconsin a single time after the Democratic National Convention, and the state was not targeted for advertising during the final weeks. Pundits mocked Trump's last-minute trip to Minnesota. trAnd Michigan was largely overlooked for the entire race, scrambling in the final days to bring Clinton and President Barack Obama in a last-ditch effort to protect their turf.By that point, it appears, it was too late."

Burr's win takes another seat off the map for Democrats and increases the chances that Republicans will hold the Senate.A former head of the ACLU, Ross was vulnerable to Republican attacks on her legal record. Rival groups portrayed her in advertisements as extreme and out of touch with the middle-of-the-road state.Republicans have so far managed to hold key Senate seats in Indiana, Ohio and Florida, according to CNN projections.

Virginia was much too close.  Clinton was falling behind in Florida. Wisconsin -- a state that the Clinton campaign considered to be in the bag -- was too close to call.Well before midnight and still hours before the 2016 presidential race would be called, Clinton supporters began to leave.Descending the steps down to the ground floor and walking out through the glass doors into the chilly night, some were crying and others were consoling family and friends. Many looked shell-shocked -- unable to comprehend that the woman they believed would become the country's next president was going to be defeated by Donald Trump.One woman named Kerry wept as she headed toward the exits, saying she had to hurry home to her 16-year-old daughter.""Because I promised her hope. I promised her hope. And this man is despicable,"" she said, her words broken between sobs. ""I don't know what happened. I'm so disappointed in this country, and I don't know what to say to her. I don't know what to tell her.""Kerry, who does IT work at a school and lives outside of New York City, said before walking away that she was ""horrified"" for her daughter.Ginny Barahona Marana also left early with her elderly mother in tow. Barahona Marana said she wasn't sure what the country would look like under a President Trump.""What's going to happen in the Supreme Court? What's going to happen with policy?"" she said. ""If he should become president, it's not somebody who cares about all Americans. It's somebody who cares about some Americans.""           As she explained that she is half-Latino and half-Asian, Barahona Marana said almost sheepishly: ""I'm the margin that was supposed to bring this in.""Inside the Javits Center, the shock was not only contained to Clinton supporters, staff and volunteers. It also reverberated through the press. Huddled together, journalists, too, expressed disbelief at what increasingly appeared would be a Trump victory.One reporter said the entire evening felt like an out-of-body experience; another wondered if the night could be a dream.At 2 a.m., Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, took the podium, on a stage shaped like the United States.""It's been a long night, and it's been a long campaign. But I can say, we can wait a little longer, can't we?"" he said.Podesta said more votes needed to be counted, and that the conversation should continue the next day. ""Everybody should head home. You should get some sleep,"" he said.Even before Podesta was done speaking, people began to walk out, exposing more beige-gray carpet now littered with plastic cups and crushed Dasani water bottles.For 21-year-old Fermin Villalpando, who lingered after Podesta's remarks, the possibility of a Trump presidency was both shocking and troubling because of his background. Villalpando's parents were both born in Mexico.""My mom and also my dad are very scared,"" he said. ""It's going to become probably a little more dangerous just to be of Hispanic heritage.""Others were still in disbelief.""Maybe we'll just wake up tomorrow and they'll say, 'Oh, it's OK. We just found a whole bunch of ballots, she won Florida,'"" one woman was overheard saying to her companions.One man insisted into his cellphone: ""Hillary did not concede.""But at 2:40 a.m., the news finally came.""Hillary Clinton has called Donald Trump to concede the race,"" CNN's Dana Bash reported on air. Minutes later, the network called the 2016 presidential race for Trump.At the Hilton Hotel some two miles away in Midtown, Trump took the stage to deliver his victory speech.""I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us,"" Trump said. ""Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.""As Trump continued with his remarks, the stage at the Javits Center was already being disassembled.And the cannons placed throughout the room containing opaque, green-tinted confetti meant to look like shattered glass were emptied out into boxes, unused.

And just to boil it down, it is, this is how it works, this is democracy. This is why we live in the best country on the planet, because when people rise up, they do it with their votes.

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/paul-ryan-next-moves/index.html	"But as the realization sinks in that Donald Trump is the president-elect, the focus turns to the next election --- Ryan's own bid in a week to gain another term as speaker. And should he win, the question of how much power the Wisconsin congressman will enjoy.There is some lingering criticism about Ryan's handling of his relationship with Trump as the speaker dials up members of his conference to secure their votes in the internal GOP election that is scheduled for next Wednesday. The last time the speaker addressed House GOP members he told them on a conference call he could no longer defend the Republican nominee after a video tape released depicting Trump speaking in vulgar terms about women -- a message that didn't go over very well.Ryan was quick after Trump's victory to set aside the public feud with President-elect Donald Trump and pledge to work together. ""We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people. This has been a great night for our party, and now we must turn our focus to bringing the country together,"" Ryan said in a statement after Trump secured his White House victory. One source close to discussions among members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus told CNN that if Ryan doesn't make a ""big statement tomorrow to show he strongly supports Trump and will work with him,"" his job could be at risk.But other Republicans are ready to move on and chart a course with a Ryan-Trump alliance. North Dakota GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer, a strong supporter of Trump's, told CNN recently it was a mistake when Ryan announced he was turning his focus just to congressional races last month after the release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tapes. Although Cramer warned the speaker about a public break with Trump on that conference call, he told CNN last week, ""certainly in my mind it doesn't disqualify Paul Ryan to be speaker of the House."" Cramer is standing behind the speaker and expects him to win re-election to his post. As the election returns came in on Tuesday night showing Trump heading to a victory, one senior member of the Freedom Caucus told CNN that a Trump win could ""certainly help the speaker."" Other Trump supporters outside Congress may have leftover anger with Ryan, who even before that October break with the nominee, had an awkward and mostly arm's length relationship with the Republican presidential candidate. Ryan initially held off officially endorsing the businessman when he won the party's nomination in May, and spoke out against some of his controversial statements on the campaign trail.  Will anyone challenge him?Even before the election results came in showing Trump wins in unlikely areas, there were signs that Ryan could face some resistance in keeping his gavel. Several leading members of the conservative Freedom Caucus declined in recent days to say whether they would back Ryan for another term. But no House Republican has launched a challenge against Ryan, and House GOP leadership sources are confident that he can win a majority in the secret ballot contest next Wednesday among House Republicans. But they acknowledge that it only takes a small number of members to deny the speaker the 218 votes he needs on the House floor in January to officially be sworn in. While much of the focus has been on members of the Freedom Caucus, there is a bloc outside of that group who backed Trump and may be irked that the speaker didn't campaign with the candidate who won state after state he wasn't expected to carry. Ryan tried to mollify his critics in the final days of the campaign - doing a series of local interviews in key House districts and on conservative radio programs in Wisconsin emphasizing his efforts to elect ""a unified Republican government.""He rarely mentioned Trump's name during these interviews and instead unloaded a steady stream of attacks on Hillary Clinton, who he warned was a liberal who would the country through another series of scandals and lurch the government sharply to the left. The day before the election Ryan stressed in a radio interview with a conservative host that a GOP-led Congress can quickly enact things with Trump in the White House like repealing Obamacare. ""We are on the same page with Trump on this,"" Ryan said. ""We are on the same page as our nominee on this so when he says he wants to a special session, which means he wants to do it early, we are ready to go. We can do that."" The speaker defended the times he broke with Trump, saying ""if I see conservatism being disfigured I'm going to stand up for conservatism."" But also emphasized on Monday ""what matters here is that we come together.  There are different kinds of conservatives, there are different kinds of Republicans. What matters is we unify and all go vote, most importantly the last thing we want is a Hillary Clinton presidency."" Agenda going forward and working with TrumpOn Wednesday afternoon, Ryan will again address rank and file GOP members on a post-election conference call hosted by Oregon GOP Rep. Greg Walden, who heads the House Republican's campaign committee.  Certainly Ryan will get credit for his tireless work to keep the House GOP majority. He raised more than $40 million, shattering fundraising records, during the last year as speaker and traveled across the country to stump for incumbents and challengers. Most political analysts predicted the large House majority would shrink, but the speaker's work helped keep those losses down to single digits.    The question is whether Ryan's efforts in the final days of the election to appear more supportive of Trump will help insulate him from Republicans who are upset about how the speaker treated the incoming president. Trump spent little time during his campaign laying out policy details so he will gain an eager partner to tackle major priorities that have been out of reach under the last eight years of the Obama administration. The president-elect could lean on the speaker's expertise on these issues, but he would need to get past the bad blood he had with Ryan, who he just weeks ago called ""weak and ineffective.""  One key bridge to smooth over the relationship is RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who is a longtime friend of Ryan's from Wisconsin politics. Ryan's close relationship with Mike Pence, Trump's running mate could also help him, although Pence last week declined to say in an interview three times that Ryan should be re-elected speaker. After that awkward development Pence did travel to Wisconsin and affirm his support for the speaker, a friend and former colleague from the House. Ryan, even before the contentious primary process was over worked to craft a detailed ""Better Way"" agenda, and secured the billionaire businessman's support for it. The speaker argued that the roadmap would give a Republican president plans to address tax reform, overhaul of health care programs, and launch regulatory reforms.    "	Paul Ryan's next moves
7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-wins-biggest-surprises/index.html	"Trump's defeat of Hillary Clinton turned on its head years of wisdom about how campaigns operate, how America's demographics are changing and how a controversial nominee can affect down-ballot candidates. Here are the five biggest surprises of Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning:1) Trump wonThe polls were wrong. Projection models were wrong. Veterans of previous presidential campaigns were wrong. Trump's victory is one of the most stunning upsets in American political history.  American voters swept Republicans into power, handing the GOP the White House, the Senate and the House in a wave that no one saw coming. Political professionals will now spend the coming weeks and months studying just how and why everyone missed it.See full results2) There is a Trump coalitionOverwhelming support from white, working-class voters swept Trump to victory. Most important: Democrats' so-called ""Blue Wall"" of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin crumbled, with Trump winning two of the three outright, and leading in Michigan in the early Wednesday hours.Democrats won urban areas, as usual. But Clinton ran far behind President Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 numbers in exurban America. And in rural regions, white voters supported Trump by margins that often topped 40 percentage points. In some places, it was the ""hidden"" Trump supporters the campaign had touted but polls never found. Elsewhere, it was Democratic turnout falling off from 2012 levels.The difference was particularly evident in states where Clinton had struggled in the Democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, whose protectionist message on trade largely matched Trump's. 3) There wasn't a Clinton coalitionOr, at least, strong turnout from new Latino voters and support from college-educated women was nowhere near enough to match Trump's strength with white voters. Clinton was hurt by a downtick in African American turnout, which had helped Obama. But her loss also reflected the reality for a Democratic Party that has drifted leftward and relied more heavily on an urban base in the Obama years. ""Blue dogs"" -- conservative Democrats -- are gone. And the working-class voters who used to support politicians like Bill Clinton were nowhere to be found for Hillary Clinton. Read more: Why Clinton lost4) Campaign tools are limitedClinton's campaign infrastructure was as impressive as any ever assembled. It had targeted, identified and reached crucial voters in battleground states. She'd also outspent Trump on TV ads, set up many more field offices, and dispatched more staff to swing states, much earlier. Trump, meanwhile, ran a scattershot organization, entirely reliant on the Republican National Committee for all get-out-the-vote operations. None of it mattered. Or, perhaps, it did -- Clinton, after all, won Nevada, a testament to the left's organizing prowess, and she came close in Florida after racking up huge leads in the heavily populated, heavily Latino southeastern portion of the state. But it was not enough. Clinton's operation didn't catch problem areas in the Rust Belt. By the time Clinton and Obama made last-minute visits to Michigan this week and closed the campaign in Philadelphia on Monday night, it was too late. 5) No down-ballot damageRepublicans everywhere assumed Trump would be a drag on the party's hopes of keeping Senate control. He wasn't. At all. And in some states, Trump appears to have helped Republicans. He had coattails, outperforming the GOP Senate candidates in Indiana and Missouri, and ran roughly even with those in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. The results suggested there just weren't many split-ticket voters -- a reality that would have terrified Republican senators prior to the election, but that turned out to work in the party's advantage. ""Democrats believed they had the golden ticket when Donald Trump officially earned the nomination,"" Ward Baker, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a memo early Wednesday morning. ""They worked to nationalize every race -- and when the bottom fell out of Clinton's candidacy, they had no message, no strategy, and no ability to pivot to local issues."""

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/merrick-garland-supreme-court/index.html	"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can do a victory lap now for his success in keeping President Barack Obama from shifting the ideological balance of the Supreme Court.Democrats, meanwhile, have to ask whether Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, a 63-year-old moderate, was a mistake. Some progressives hoped for a younger candidate, with a more diverse background, might have better excited liberals. It was McConnell who seized the moment after the death of Scalia last February to announce there would be no confirmation hearings until after the election. ""The next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country,"" he said at the time.  There's no way of knowing if McConnell was certain a Republican would win. But it was worth a shot for the veteran senator. He held to his promise and denied Obama's pick, federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland, a hearing or vote. And now, he has likely ensured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for years to come.  ""Thank you, Majority Leader McConnell,"" raved Carrie Severino, who runs the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. In a statement she reiterated that the ""people deserved to be heard"" and added that ""a sizable majority of voters named lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court as one of the most important factors in their voting decision."" Indeed, national exit polls reflect that 21% of voters said the Supreme Court was a major factor in how they voted. ""Merrick Garland is a fine man and a dedicated public servant,"" said John G. Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation. ""But there is no question Hillary Clinton said that she was looking for a judge who would favor a little guy over a corporation, a minority over a non-minority. She was looking for a judge that would put a thumb on the scale rather than dispense equal justice under the law,"" he said. When progressives recover from the shock of their loss, they are sure to reexamine what they might have done differently. Did the President, for example, miscalculate when he chose Garland? Obama admitted openly that Garland was a consensus candidate. The President wanted someone Senate Republicans couldn't refuse.   And on paper, Garland was exactly that. His credentials are impeccable and he's a powerful thinker. His admirers are legion, and include conservatives like Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch. Garland showed his personal side at an emotional Rose Garden ceremony, allowing Americans to get a glimpse of his character off the bench.  ""Merrick Garland is an extraordinary jurist who is indisputably qualified to serve on the highest court of the land-- nobody really argues otherwise,"" Obama told an audience in Chicago last spring.  Obama press secretary Josh Earnest Wednesday said the White House's view of the nomination hasn't changed. ""It's deeply discouraging how unfairly he has been treated by Republicans in the United States Senate who abdicated their responsibility to give him a hearing and a timely vote,"" Earnest said.And progressives, early on, worked in various publicity campaigns to insist #WeNeedNine. But as the Republican recalcitrance solidified, the progressive effort went dormant over the summer months. Indeed, despite the extraordinary impact the election would have on the Supreme Court, Garland's name rarely came up on the campaign trail. A 60-something white jurist who attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School didn't excite the base in the same way, perhaps, another candidate might have. Some yearned for a nominee who had lived life outside the judicial monastery. Or even attended a school not affiliated with the Ivy League. Some Democrats hoped for an African-American candidate. Someone like Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the US District Court for the District of Columbia. Or Judge Paul Watford of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Others pushed for Judge Sri Srinivasan who would have been the first Indian-American to take the Supreme Court bench.Lately, even the justices have spoken openly about their desire for a more diverse judiciary.  ""The greater variety of people you have serving, the more likely that every side of every issue will be engaged and will be thought about,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- the court's first Latina -- told an audience at the University of Wisconsin Law School earlier this year.
