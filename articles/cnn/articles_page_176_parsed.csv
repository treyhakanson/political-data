The former president celebrated his 65th birthday with a ""Decade of Difference"" fundraising concert in Los Angeles featuring performances by Lady Gaga, Usher and U2's Bono and The Edge. Clinton celebrated his 50th birthday with a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and his 1996 presidential campaign at Radio City Music Hall.Jason Miller, Donald Trump's spokesman, knocked the fact that the names of attendees to Clinton's party will not be released beforehand.""The Clinton Foundation's lack of disclosure surrounding this high-dollar event is deeply troubling and makes a mockery of Bill Clinton's claim that the foundation is 'as transparent as we can be,'"" Miller said.But because the event is a fundraiser for the foundation, those donors eventually will be listed on the Clinton Foundation's website."

Employees can only get paid during their parental leave by using ""earned and unused vacation days and personal days,"" the manual states, according to the Huffington Post. The Las Vegas property is owned by Trump and managed by a subsidiary of the Trump Organization.Employees at Trump hotels in New York and Miami, as well as at the billionaire's luxury Mar-a-Lago estate and club, also told the news site that they are not eligible for eight weeks of paid parental leave.The report comes a day after the Republican nominee unveiled a series of child care policy proposals -- which his daughter helped craft -- including guaranteeing six weeks of unemployment benefits to working mothers whose employers do not guarantee paid maternity leave.Asked Wednesday morning on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" whether all of Trump's employees are eligible for the eight-week paid parental leave that Ivanka Trump touted in remarks Tuesday night, the Republican nominee's daughter responded approvingly.""It is,"" said Ivanka Trump, who is an executive vice president at the Trump Organization.And the Trump Organization's senior vice president of human resources Deirdre Rosen said in a statement Tuesday that the corporation offers ""an industry leading eight-week paid parental leave policy.""Asked about the Huffington Post report on Wednesday, Rosen said in a new statement that ""the policies and practices allowing employees to enjoy a healthy work-life balance vary from property to property.""""We take an individualized approach to helping employees manage family and work responsibilities,"" Rosen said in the statement.A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization declined to explain which Trump Organization employees are not eligible for the eight-week paid parental leave.The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment about whether Ivanka Trump mischaracterized the Trump Organization's parental leave policy.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/donald-trump-children/index.html	"As the campaign enters its final stretch, some of Donald Trump's children are showing signs of impatience and struggling to stay on message.In the past 24 hours, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have cut off interviews when pressed for answers on tough questions. Trump Jr. strayed from the campaign's talking point about the Republican nominee's tax returns -- that they'll be released once an IRS audit concludes -- when he said unveiling the documents would ""detract"" from his father's message. And Trump Jr. caused a firestorm when, during a Thursday interview with a Philadelphia radio station, he raised the specter of the Holocaust by saying if Republicans acted like Hillary Clinton, the media would be ""warming up the gas chamber."" The campaign later said Trump Jr. was referring to capital punishment, though the Clinton campaign quickly seized on the remarks.""The particular wording is extremely insensitive, divisive and probably pretty consistent with the type of rhetoric he heard around the house growing up,"" Clinton campaign chair John Podesta told reporters on a conference call.Representatives for the Trump campaign didn't respond to requests for comment on this story.Trump, Clinton turn to their daughtersThe developments are notable because Trump's children are typically his best surrogates. Ivanka, in particular, often softens Trump's image and the children are known for exerting power behind the scenes and bringing discipline to the freewheeling campaign.The influence of Trump's children was seen in the firing of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. His children personally vetted vice presidential contenders this summer. And at the Republican National Convention, his four adult children -- Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany -- each delivered speeches that sought to show more human sides of their father. Ivanka Trump used her convention speech to wade into policy, making a case to women by arguing for paid maternity leave and equal pay. Her primetime Thursday night introduction of her father was well-received -- particularly as she revealed a softer side of the billionaire businessman that no other speaker or surrogate had been able to show before.And after a week in which Republicans largely focused on Clinton's deficiencies rather than on Trump's attributes and personal story, Ivanka Trump warmed up the crowd by offering a new window into the Republican nominee. She urged viewers to give her father a second look by saying that ""if It's possible to be famous and not really well-known, that describes the father who raised me.""She was by her father's side this week when he unveiled a child care policy crafted with Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, that guarantees six weeks of leave for new mothers. When Cosmopolitan magazine's Prachi Gupta grilled Ivanka Trump on what that policy meant for gay couples -- asking if after an adoption, ""they would not be receiving special leave for that because they don't need to recover or anything"" -- the interview turned contentious.  ""So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and I think my father has put forth a very comprehensive and really revolutionary plan to deal with a lot of issues. So I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that,"" she said. Ford fact checks Trump: We will be here foreverWhen pressed on how Trump would pay for his proposals, including increased defense spending an a US-Mexico border wall, Ivanka Trump cut off the interview. ""I'm going to jump off, I have to run. I apologize,"" she said. She followed up with a series of tweets Thursday encouraging Cosmopolitan to ""keep the focus where it belongs -- advocating change.""Trump Jr., meanwhile, stepped into several controversies in interviews conducted Wednesday. Speaking with WTAE in Pittsburgh, he said that releasing his father's tax returns would ""detract"" from his message -- a position House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, disagreed with Thursday morning. He attacked New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman for failing to investigate the Clinton Foundation, ""which has decades of pay-to-play -- of meetings through the State Department."" But when asked about The Donald J. Trump Foundation -- his father's charitable organization, for which Trump Jr. is a director -- paying for a portrait of Trump, he denied knowledge as a campaign aide ended the interview. ""No, I don't know anything about that,"" Trump Jr. said. As reporter Bob Mayo asked ""how come you didn't know,"" an off-camera voice interrupted to say: ""Alright, that's it. We have to move on to the next one. Thank you."" Trump Jr.'s  ""gas chamber"" remark was the most provocative. It came as he complained about how the treatment his father has received by the political press compares to coverage of Clinton. ""The media has been her number one surrogate in this. Without the media, this wouldn't even be a contest. But the media has built her up. They've let he slide on every indiscrepancy, on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the thing,"" Trump Jr. told Philadelphia-based conservative talk radio host Chris Stigall on Wednesday. Trump Jr. added: ""I mean, if Republicans were doing that, they'd be warming up the gas chamber right now.Gas chambers were used by Nazis in the Holocaust -- the genocide of 6 million Jews and millions of others during World War II.Trump's campaign denied that Trump Jr. was referring to the Holocaust, saying he meant the ""gas chamber"" used in capital punishment.""The liberal, dishonest media is so quick to attack one of the Trumps that they never let the truth get in the way of a good smear,"" Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in an emailed statement. ""Don Jr. was clearly referring to capital punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign -- something that's only gotten worse as Trump's poll numbers have improved."""	24 turbulent hours for Donald Trump's children	['Sanders', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	['gay']
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump-tax-release/index.html	"""I released mine. I think we should release our returns, I'll leave it to him when to do it,"" Ryan, who was the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2012, told reporters at his weekly news conference on Capitol Hill.Trump has pledged to reveal his returns, but cited advice from financial advisers not to do so until an audit for some previous years filings by the Internal Revenue Service is complete. Democrats and some Republicans continue to press the businessman for greater transparency on the issue. Donald Trump Jr. offered a different reason for not releasing the records: The public would scrutinize them.""Because he's got a 12,000-page tax return that would create ... financial auditors out of every person in the country asking questions that would detract from (his father's) main message,"" Trump, Jr. told the Tribune-Review in Pennsylvania in a piece published Wednesday.Senate Democrats pounced on the issue Thursday. They attempted to force a vote on new legislation that would require Trump and other future presidential candidates to release their returns after accepting their party's nomination for the White House, but Republicans objected.Questions about Trump's taxes only increased last week after Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, released 10 years of his returns, which is standard for most candidates for national office.  As the governor of Indiana, Pence's returns were fairly simple. But Trump, who regularly boasts about his multiple businesses, faces questions about whether he claims the same net worth to the IRS that he does in public and how much he pays in taxes.Ryan noted Trump's argument for holding back now, saying: ""I know he's under an audit and he's got an opinion about when to release those and 'll defer to him on that."""

These latest arrests have highlighted tensions in Europe over ISIS' ability to exploit these routes to infiltrate Western cities. The latest arrests come after other similar cases were revealed in a recent CNN investigation.The fear that ISIS will hide among refugees has been voiced by some in the United States as well, particularly as the Obama administration prepares to increase the number of refugees it takes in next year to 110,000.""We have no idea who these people are, where they come from -- we have no idea,"" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told a crowd in Iowa on Tuesday, hours before the increase was revealed. ""We have no idea what we're getting into.""But how significant is the threat in the US? Let's break it down.ISIS has used migrant routes to move operatives into EuropeIn the aftermath of the Paris attack in November, authorities revealed that two of the attackers -- who blew themselves up outside the Stade de France -- entered Europe through Greece using fake Syrian passports and posing as refugees. They were accompanied by two other alleged ISIS operatives who were held briefly by Greek authorities, released a month later, then re-arrested in the aftermath of the attack, as detailed by CNN.Cases like this -- and the arrests Tuesday in Germany -- emphasize what is a difficult reality facing European law enforcement: ISIS has used migrant routes to ferry operatives into Europe, and some of those operatives may still be in hiding.""They're not entirely sure who is in their country,"" Heather Conley, director of the Europe Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN. ""And so now they're scrambling after the fact to try to establish who (these migrants) are.""Europe faces major security challengeSince the surge in migrants last summer, Europe has taken steps to improve their security vetting by investing in external border control.But the realities of geography are against them. Because of their proximity to the Middle East and North Africa, where the majority of the influx originates, European authorities aren't able to screen refugees and asylum seekers until they've arrived on their shores.""They're already in Europe today, and it makes that extremely difficult to do that screening,"" said Conley, noting that many of these migrants enter Europe either without travel documents or with forged ones.""Particularly, there was a sense that if you had Syrian passport documentation you received a more favorable hearing by Europeans,"" said Conley, since they are seen as refugees rather than economic migrants. ""So European officials have discovered a lot of forged documents and passports.""What does this mean for the US?Again, geography is key.Syrian refugees applying for resettlement in the US are put through a multi-step screening process before they're able to enter the US, and the process can take up to two years.They typically apply from Jordan, Lebanon or Turkey, where the US has beefed up vetting personnel in recent months.They are referred by the United Nations, then undergo interviews and background checks. Several federal agencies, including the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are involved in the process, reducing the chance that forged documents escape notice and other signs of fake identities are missed.""Can mistakes happen?"" asked Conley. ""Yes. But even the incidents we've seen have been so statistically small that I do not think there's any reason for concern.""But what happens when the US increases the number of refugees it absorbs?A senior administration official told CNN the Obama administration plans to increase the overall quota for refugees in the 2017 fiscal year from 85,000 to 110,000.This number includes refugees from conflict zones around the world, and it's not yet clear how many of these slots will be open to Syrian refugees specifically.White House to increase number of refugees to 110k in 2017After resettling just under 1,900 Syrians in the initial years of the civil war, the US committed to admit 10,000 in FY2016 -- a goal it exceeded last month.The administration was able to make this increase by scaling up its effort to screen applicants in the region, boosting staffing at key processing locations in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt, and accelerating the security vetting and interview process.Nevertheless, State Department officials stand by the rigor of their vetting process, and insist refugees are the most thoroughly screened group of travelers to the US."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/clinton-foundation-donna-shalala/index.html	"""When she's president, there's no process you could set up that would eliminate conflict of interest -- so we actually have to reduce the size of the foundation and what it does,"" Shalala, who was secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, said in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day.""""What we have to do when she's president is we have to actually eliminate any aspect of conflict of interest -- so all the international programs are spun off,"" she said.""There's no evidence that policy was impacted by anyone requesting an appointment. So let me dispute any indication that Mrs. Clinton's behavior on policy was changed in any way,"" Shalala said. ""The most important thing is, this is a magnificent foundation that has reinvented philanthropy.""She said its work on issues like AIDS medication has to continue, noting that those programs will be transitioned to other charities -- ""but not under the Clinton Foundation umbrella.""Shalala's comments come as the Clinton Foundation is targeted by Republican nominee Donald Trump and his GOP allies in the presidential race. Trump has cast the foundation as a ""pay-for-play"" enterprise -- allowing top donors to receive special access to Hillary Clinton during her four-year term as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. He's also linked the foundation to Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. ""She put her emails on a secret server to cover up her pay for play scandals in the State Department,"" Trump said in a speech in Pittsburgh last week. ""Nothing threatens the integrity of our democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.""Bill Clinton told PBS' Charlie Rose in an interview this week that he'd also remove himself from the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation, an operational charity that runs health care and climate change programs worldwide. He's also said if Hillary Clinton is elected, the foundation will cease accepting donations from foreign countries and from corporations -- accepting only contributions from American individuals and charitable organizations. In his interview with Rose, the former president insisted Trump's ""pay-for-play"" accusations are inaccurate. ""All this stuff has been dragged out, and not one example -- not even one -- of something wrong has been cited,"" Bill Clinton said. Still, emails released as part of a conservative organization's lawsuit over Clinton's private email server show State Department aide Huma Abedin and then-top Clinton Foundation official Doug Band discussed getting representatives of foundation donors seats to an official lunch with Chinese President Hu Jintao.""I don't care who asked for what. It never happened. It just did not happen,"" Shalala said.Pressed on whether it was appropriate to even ask, she said: ""No one should cross any line. Requesting a courtesy meeting, when I was secretary of HHS, for instance, by a Republican senator, was not unusual.""A State Department spokeswoman said in August that the department found nothing inappropriate about the emails.""The State Department does not believe it is inappropriate for the administration to consider individuals suggested by outside organizations when deciding who to invite to an official function,"" State Department Director of Press Relations Elizabeth Trudeau said in a statement.Bill Clinton's final foundation fundraiser will be a birthday bash Friday night at the Rainbow Room in New York. But Shalala said that party's guest list won't open doors to any new criticisms of the foundation.""For that party, I looked at the list and other than two people, all of them are people who have been annual donors to the foundation and are long-time friends of the president,"" Shalala said. ""The two people are my guests, who I paid for: farmers in North Dakota -- my twin sister and her husband.""In an effort to stave off concerns about similar problems through his Trump Organization, Trump has said he'll sever all ties to his personal business if he's elected president.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/john-kasich-trans-pacific-partnership/index.html	"""I have never been an ideological supporter of free trade. The ideologues use to come to me and be frustrated with me,"" he told the media during the White House press briefing.""But when you look at these agreements in a real sense - and this one is much different  than even NAFTA,"" Kasich added. ""This is China. This is Russia. These are fledgling countries in Asia and we want to pivot to Asia? We have to do this.""The two-term Republican governor met with Obama in the Oval Office on Friday. In an exclusive interview Thursday night, he told CNN's Dana Bash he doesn't mind the political backlash he could face. ""I welcome the fact that people will criticize me for putting my country ahead of my party,"" Kasich said. Kasich and Obama could be facing an uphill battle: Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton oppose the 12-nation Pacific Rim deal, which Obama has pitched as a way to counterbalance China's rise in the region. ""This is the first time the candidates in both major political parties say they are opposed to free trade. It's astounding to me,"" Kasich said. In the Oval Office, Kasich joined Obama, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former George W. Bush administration Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and others for a meeting on the 12-nation Pacific Rim deal. ""This is an opportunity for the Congress to carry out its responsibility,"" Kasich said. ""You gotta get this done. I'd love to think it could happen next year. I'm not convinced it can happen after this year,"" he added.Kasich waded into the presidential debate a bit, but mainly focused his efforts on rallying Republicans away from Trump's protectionist stance and toward the party's pro-trade orthodoxy. ""I think I need to spend my time making the case that we don't want to hurt United States national security issue(s), we don't want to turn our back over there, and frankly, we don't want to put ourselves in a position where we're not taking advantage of economic opportunities,"" he said. Kasich also defended the prospect of Obama pushing the TPP toward passage in a ""lame duck"" session of Congress, after the November 8 election but before a new president and Congress are sworn in. ""Frankly, if I have to come down here and spend some time lobbying my Republican colleagues, I'm more than glad to do that,"" Kasich said. ""There's definitely some people I can call and talk to,"" he said. ""This is a big deal. I mean, if we were to just walk away with this -- with both candidates saying they don't want this -- we turn our backs on Asia.""He also played down the political potency of Trump's anti-trade position in manufacturing-heavy Ohio, saying it's not why Trump might win the state. ""I don't think that's what it will turn on. And frankly, part of the problem that the Clinton campaign has is that there's literally no enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton. There just isn't right now. I don't know if it will change but that is her challenge,"" Kasich said.Kasich also talked politics, saying it's ""very unlikely"" he will vote for Trump, his former GOP primary rival. ""Too much water under the bridge,"" Kasich said. But one other thing's for sure: ""I'm not voting for Hillary.""Referencing his refusal to attend the Republican National Convention in his home state, Kasich said, ""I think my actions have spoken very loudly -- louder than even my words."" Touting his campaign stops for House and Senate Republican candidates across the country, he said his goal this fall is to ""get Republicans out to vote -- period."" ""We want to re-elect Senator [Rob] Portman and we want to elect people down-ticket,"" he said, conceding he knows that'll help Trump, as well. ""Because of the success that we've had in Ohio, Ohio's turning more red. It's more Republican,"" he said. ""And why? Things are going pretty well. So when you produce things and people feel good, it has an impact. I think Ohio now is more Republican than it's been in a very long time, and that, of course, accrues to any Republican."" If Trump wins the election and offered him a role in his administration, Kasich said he'd help -- as he would with any president. ""If there's something I can do and something I agree on, absolutely,"" Kasich said. As for his own political future -- and whether his aggressive campaign schedule for Republicans this cycle foreshadows a 2020 run for president -- Kasich deflected. He said he's campaigning for House and Senate candidates ""because I feel responsibility.""""I mean, you know, look, I don't have any idea what I'm going to do with my political future, I really don't,"" he said. ""I'm not closing any doors. But I'm not here plotting and scheming what's going to happen down the road.""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/texas-lyceum-poll-trump-leads-clinton-seven/index.html	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump leads Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely voters in the state 39%-32%, a new Texas Lyceum poll shows. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson picks up the support of 9% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein garners 3%, according to the poll.A sizable 17% said they don't know who they'll vote for.Among a broader sample of registered voters, Trump leads Clinton in a four-way race by just a single point, 30%-29%, but both Johnson and Stein will be on the Texas ballot in November.The poll showed a yawning racial gap in the state's electorate. Trump holds a large lead over Clinton among white voters, 54%-19%, while the Democratic nominee claims advantages among African-Americans (69%-2%) and Hispanics (39%-27%). Texas and its 38 electoral college votes have been reliably pocketed by Republicans for decades -- the Lone Star State has backed the GOP presidential nominee in every race since 1980.But Trump's 7-point lead in the Lyceum poll is a relatively slender advantage. In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney carried the state over President Barack Obama by roughly 16 points. Four years before that, John McCain defeated Obama there by about 12 points. The Lyceum poll was conducted September 1-11 using phone interviews with 502 likely Texas voters. It has a margin of error of 4.37%.
