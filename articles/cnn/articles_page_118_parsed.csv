He defended his comments during the debate, saying: ""I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family.

""Over thirty days from the American people voting, Mike Pence will be out there campaigning tomorrow, is the message to the American people that Mike Pence rallies, don't believe what he says?""""No, not at all,"" Conway responded. ""They were talking about two different things (on) Syria. And I just talked to Gov. Pence about 10 minutes ago and he says hello.

And Mr. Trump said Hillary was making it more about military action.""Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton II: The nastiest linesThey were referring to when one of the debate's moderators Martha Raddatz asked Trump about the humanitarian crises in Aleppo. ""Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said,"" Raddatz said. ""He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.""""OK. He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree,"" Trump said. ""I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.""Clarification: This post has been updated to make clear that Conway was defending Trump, who she called a ""gentleman,"" and not his lewd comments, which she called disgusting."

The video has prompted some Republicans to distance themselves from the candidate. Though Trump made a defiant apology this past weekend, he downplayed the recording as he answered the first question of the night.""It's locker room talk, and it's one of those things,"" he said before pivoting to another topic. ""I will knock the hell out of ISIS.""What's ISIS got to do with 'locker room' talk?Unsurprisingly, professional athletes grew irate at the insinuation that similar lewd remarks were commonplace in men's locker rooms. Here's what they had to say.3 times Trump defended his 'locker room' talkIt confused Los Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford.Portland Trailblazers guard CJ McCollum said he hadn't heard any ""locker room talk"" like that before.L.A. Galaxy player Robbie Rogers tweeted that he was offended by Trump's remark.Oakland A's Pitcher Sean Doolittle pushed back against that notion of ""locker room talk.""So did Chris Kluwe, a former Minnesota Vikings punter and outspoken Deadspin columnist.As did Cleveland Cavaliers forward Dahntay Jones.No, nonconsensual sexual advances aren't part of the locker room, Philadelphia 76ers guard Kendall Marshall insisted.""It's a Ted Bundy quote,"" sniped UFC mixed martial artist CM Punk. Not ""locker room talk.""Blake Griffin, a star Los Angeles Clippers forward, used the comment as an opportunity to mock Trump's heavy breathing.Retired NBA center Jason Collins, the league's first openly gay player, riffed off of a tweet from John Amaechi, a fellow former NBA player who is also gay, about Trump's apparent lack of foreign policy communication with his running mate. He also found room to get in a breathing dig. On a serious note, former Olympic hurdler Queen Harrison said ""locker room talk"" -- like the phrase ""boys will be boys"" -- weren't valid excuses for making lewd remarks.More than anyone, though, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Chris Conley seem to take issue with the comments. He rattled off a Twitter rant pushing back against Trump followed by some words for wisdom.Jacob Tamme, tight end for the Atlanta Falcons, dropped the mic by saying that he needed another shower after beating the Denver Broncos Sunday afternoon."

That's a less commanding victory for Clinton than in the first debate, but she still boosted her edge over Trump among debate watchers on handling the economy and being the stronger leader. More than 6-in-10, however, said Trump did a better job than they expected, while 21% thought he did a worse job than expected. Clinton also exceeded expectations, but by a smaller margin: 39% said she did better than they were expecting her to, while 26% thought she did worse. Read the complete CNN/ORC poll resultsThere was a wide gender gap in perceptions of who won the debate, with 64% of women saying Clinton did the best job vs. 49% of men. Most who watched the debate said that they had heard a great deal about the 2005 video revealed Friday in which Trump used sexually aggressive language during a taping for ""Access Hollywood."" Most, 59%, said they thought his remarks in that video did reflect his views about women generally, 37% said it did not. Women were more apt to say it reflected his views than men (63% of women thought so vs. 55% of men). A scorched earth debate, on The Daily David ChalianStill, most said the way Trump handled the video in the debate didn't change their views on him: 58% were unmoved by it, while one-quarter said they viewed him less favorably after hearing his explanation from the debate stage, and 16% said it improved their view of the Republican presidential candidate.Neither Trump nor Clinton shifted their favorability ratings among debate watchers compared with pre-debate measures, but by a wide margin, Clinton was seen as the candidate who cared more about the needs and problems of the audience members who asked the questions (67% said she did vs. 21% who picked Trump). She also was seen as better addressing concerns that voters had about how they would handle the presidency (59% said Clinton did better on that score, 32% Trump). In an incredibly contentious debate, Trump was far more often named as the candidate who spent more time attacking his or her opponent (68% Trump to 16% Clinton, with 15% saying both spent equal time attacking), and Clinton held the edge as having the temperament to serve effectively as president (64% chose Clinton, 27% Trump).Debate watchers overall were slightly more likely to be Democrats than the overall population, and they started out largely backing Clinton over Trump when asked whom they'd support for president. Overall, though, few felt their votes would be moved by what they saw from St. Louis Sunday night. A majority, 53%, said the debate did not affect how they would vote, while those that were moved were split between Clinton (25%) and Trump (21%). The CNN/ORC post-debate poll includes interviews with 537 registered voters who watched the October 9 debate. Results among debate watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Respondents were originally interviewed as part of an October 5-8 telephone survey of a random sample of Americans, and indicated they planned to watch the debate and would be willing to be re-interviewed when it was over."

And it sounded disappointingly familiar to those living under authoritarian regimes.To start, here's what Trump said: ""I hate to say it, but if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation (Hillary Clinton's email scandal).""When Clinton responded by saying it's good that someone with Trump's temperament isn't in charge, he interjected, ""because you'd be in jail.""So why did the comment elicit such passionate responses from both Republicans and Democrats?Bad companyTrump supporters argue that if Clinton was not a well-known politician, she very well may have been charged and faced jail time for using a private email server for official business while secretary of state.The FBI investigated and concluded there was not enough evidence to merit a criminal prosecution before handing over its findings to the US Department of Justice.But Americans of all stripes consider the peaceful handover of power to political opponents one of the most demonstrable symbols of the country's healthy democracy. Here are some other leaders and countries that have jailed political opposition while in power.Vladimir Putin is often accused of jailing his political opponents. A prominent example: Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oligarch and Putin opponent, spent 10 years in prison on charges many believe were politically motivated. He now lives in exile in Switzerland.Leopoldo Lopez, an opposition leader in Venezuela, is serving a 14-year prison sentence on charges that a former prosecutor says were fabricated by the government.Taiwan's former president, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated after his political party lost power in 2008.Augusto Pinochet assumed power in Chile after a coup in 1973, disappearing and arresting political opponents. Current Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi has been accused of helping orchestrate the coup that led to the ouster of the democratically elected Mohamed Morsy, who has been sentenced to death on charges many in the international community say are politically motivated.North Korea has executed its top education official and defense minister in the last two years.Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe put a lawmaker in jailAnd an entire wing of the notorious Evin prison in Iran is believed to house political prisoners.That's just a snapshot of the cases around the world in recent history, but the point is this -- many Americans believe jailing political opponents, or threatening to, is the hallmark of a dictatorship, not a vibrant democracy.And that's a view shared by Democrats and Republicans.Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's press secretary, said Trump was wrong.David Frum, a prominent neoconservative, tweeted ""Who would consent to serve as Attorney General to a president who believed he could direct prosecutions of his political opponents?""And former Attorney General Eric Holder also said that jailing Clinton would constitute an abuse of his power.""You cannot underestimate the history was made in our country. A line was crossed that I don't know has been crossed in my lifetime, maybe ever. He threatened to jail his opponent,"" CNN political commentator Van Jones said.He went on to call it a ""new low in American democracy."" Said CNN's Dana Bash: ""Not to sound too corny, but what makes this country different from countries with dictators in Africa or Stalin or Hitler or any of those countries with dictators and totalitarian leaders is when they took over, they put their opponents in jail.

Now, some Democrats are leveling the same charge at Trump.""This is a watershed moment for Republicans across the country,"" O'Malley told Tapper. ""Any Republican that fails to repudiate Donald Trump's super predator braggadocio is not going to have a future in the new Republican Party.""Democrat Van Jones also leveled the charge while condemning Trump's behavior, calling the Republican nominee ""a sexual predator"" and a ""super predator"" to deflect attention from his own remarks.""What he has actually confessed to, not been accused of but confessed to, is a crime,"" Jones, a CNN political commentator, said Sunday. ""He came to prominence by attacking immigrant Mexicans and saying they are rapists. It turns out it was all projection. He's a sexual predator, he's a super predator and he can not attack Bill Clinton to get out of it.""Hillary Clinton was confronted about her use of the term ""super predators"" during the Democratic primary by an activist who asked whether Clinton would apologize to African-Americans for supporting policies that had negatively impacted the black community.In her 1996 speech, Clinton referred to some young offenders as ""super predators"" who ""must be brought to heel"" by law enforcement. Democratic rival Bernie Sanders seized on the remarks, calling the term racist. Clinton apologized earlier this year, saying she shouldn't have used the phrase and wouldn't do so today.Trump has also pointed to Clinton's use of ""super predator"" in an attempt to damage Clinton with African-Americans. During the first presidential debate, he invoked her use of the term, calling it a ""terrible thing to say.""
