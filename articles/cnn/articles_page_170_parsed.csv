Now, after three years of federal investigations, a couple of indictments and jury selection, the trial of a former aide of New Jersey's governor and one of his longtime political allies will begin this morning in federal court.Though Christie himself has not faced any charges related to this incident -- he's denied all involvement from the onset -- he's expected to remain a key figure in the trial, unable to fully escape scrutiny from a controversy that's overshadowed his second and final term as governor.On Monday, prosecutors said Christie knew of the road closures while they were happening. The allegations came during opening arguments in the case involving Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority, and Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff.In case you forget how Bridgegate all went down -- and what's at stake in the coming weeks -- here's an explanation of how we got to this point.So, what's Bridgegate again?In November 2013, Christie won re-election to his second and final gubernatorial term (he's term limited), cruising to a decisive victory fueled in part by his strong showing of leadership in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Despite his popularity at the time, not everyone endorsed the Republican, who needed bipartisan backing in a blue state. Mark Sokolich, the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, was among the politicians who didn't support the incumbent governor. The following September, on the first day of the school year, Port Authority officials abruptly shut down some of the traffic lanes on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, drawing the ire of motorists.Initially, Christie's administration characterized the closures as a part of a traffic study. Later on, though, Port Authority officials testified that no such study ever happened.One month before the lane closure, with Christie's re-election campaign in full swing, and Kelly texted David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and a political ally of Christie: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""""Got it,"" Wildstein replied.The messages, contrary to the Christie administration's spin that chalked it up to ineffective bureaucracy, offered evidence that the closures were an act of political vengeance, according to federal prosecutors.""They agreed to and did use public resources to carry out a vendetta and exact retribution,"" US Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman said in May 2015.Who was charged in Bridgegate?Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority and Kelly were indicted on numerous conspiracy and fraud charges in May 2015. Wildstein avoided trial by pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation.The Bridgegate charges stem from a series of damning emails and texts made public in January 2014. In response to the charges, Kelly chalked up her correspondence with Wildstein to ""sarcasm and humor."" Then, she lambasted Wildstein for lying about her involvement in order to get himself a plea deal. What about Christie?Those facing charges had clear and direct ties to Christie. However, the governor has not faced charges and he has maintained he had no knowledge of the lane closures, denying any wrongdoing. Shortly after the texts surfaced, Christie fired Kelly, noting that he felt ""embarrassed and humiliated"" by the ""abject stupidity"" of her actions.Two months after those emails went public, lawyers retained by Christie's office released a Bridgegate report that exonerated Christie.""It's a search for the truth and we believe we have gotten to the truth,"" former federal prosecutor Randy Mastro, whose law firm produced the Bridgegate report, told NJ.com in 2014 upon its release. ""What we found was Gov. Christie had no involvement in the decision to close these lanes, and no prior knowledge of it.""Will the governor testify at the Bridgegate trial?It remains to be seen whether Christie will be subpoenaed. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday, the governor said he would have ""no problem"" testifying if called upon. However, he didn't think he would be called he has ""no knowledge of this incident at all."" ""Of course, I will,"" Christie told CNN. ""I've been more open about this than anybody in public life. I've been investigated by three public entities, two of them led by partisan Democrats who have all found that I had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement.""it's unclear what the developments from Monday's court date, and prosecutors saying that Christie was aware of Bridgecate, means for the possibility that the governor will testify. Even if Christie doesn't take the witness stand, the governor will likely remain front and center in the federal trial. Last month, a former Christie staffer, who worked underneath Kelly, claimed that he ""flat out lied"" about his staff's involvement in Bridgegate during a December 2013 news conference.What's at stake for the defendants?If a jury finds Baroni and Kelly guilty, they each could face prison time for their involvement in Bridgegate. Fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case, told The New York Times at the time of the indictment that Baroni and Kelly each face a maximum sentence of 86 years. It was more likely that Baroni and Kelly would receive up to three years behind bars if convicted, Fishman added.Of course, they could also leave the court as free people, should a jury clear them of all charges.As for Christie, who Trump has said would head his transition team, the Bridgegate trial has the potential to drag him through the mud â€” if not in a court facing a trial before his peers, then in the court of public opinion."

They are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling,"" Trump said on Fox News on Monday. Trump pointed to how Israel used profiling and ""done an unbelievable job.""Trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but It's illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status. ""They see somebody that's suspicious, they will profile,"" Trump said. ""Look what's going on: Do we really have a choice? We're trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse.""RELATED: Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombingsTrump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, disputed that Trump meant police should start ""racial"" profiling.""I mean if authorities are going to look the other way, then at least we have a presidential candidate who is telling the Americans who say, 'I'm are so tired of looking the other way' we don't have a vetting process, we don't have borders,"" she told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""Outfront"" Tuesday. ""We have people so worried about political correctness that look at what this did the other night, people were injured.""The man suspected in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey was captured Monday after a manhunt and shootout. Ahmad Khan Rahami is suspected of bombings Saturday in New York City and Seaside Park, New Jersey, and is believed to be connected to pipe bombs found Sunday night in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sources told CNN.Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment on the issue of profiling Tuesday. But Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, defended Trump's comments.""I think it's all about common sense,"" Pence told MSNBC's Kelly O'Donnell. ""Talking with law enforcement officers, they'll tell you that today they feel like they operate in an environment of political correctness, where they can't use common sense to be able to target resources and target their energies against individuals who would be the most likely potential threat to our families and to the safety of our communities.""Trump 'bets' terror suspect not on a watch listPence acknowledged the difficult balance between smart policing and respecting civil liberties, but cited Rahami as an example of how political correctness can hinder law enforcement. The FBI said Tuesday that Rahami's father was interviewed after a tip alleging that he called his son a terrorist, but the FBI never investigated Rahami or placed him on a FBI database of potential terrorists.""I don't know why that occurred but it smacks of the kind of political correctness and eggshells that law enforcement feels that they have to walk on in the environment that we're in today,"" Pence said. ""Of course it can (go wrong and infringe upon people's rights), but we're talking about common sense profiling."""

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/18/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-terror-attack-response/index.html	"Trump is often loose with his language in describing what has taken place, and couples it at times with bragging about his own calls for toughness. Clinton, meanwhile, often urges restraint and waiting for more details, and at times pushes gun control measures. These different styles were evident Saturday night after an explosion injured 29 people in a Manhattan neighborhood. Trump immediately said a ""bomb went off."" Clinton, meanwhile, called for support for first responders and said she wanted to ""let this investigation unfold.""Here's a side-by-side comparison of the first reactions from Clinton and Trump to incidents at home and abroad that have taken place during the 2016 campaign:New York bombings, September 17, 2016Clinton: The New York City blast occurred on the same day an explosion went off near a Marine Corps charity run in New Jersey and a man stabbed nine people at Minnesota mall, leaving people across the country on edge. After being briefed by staff, Clinton spoke with reporters at the back of her plane after touching down in New York. ""I have been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota. Obviously we need to do everything we can to support our first responders, also to pray for the victims. We have to let this investigation unfold. We have been in touch with various officials, including the mayor's office in New York, to learn what they are discovering as they conduct this investigation. And I will have more to say about it when we have some facts,"" she said.Trump: ""Just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what's going on,"" Trump said before officials had determined the cause of the explosion, within 30 minutes of the initial reports of an explosion in New York. Orlando nightclub shootings, June 12, 2016Clinton: Her first live reaction to the Orlando shooting came in a series of phone interviews. Speaking with NBC, Clinton called it a terrorist attack and noted that ISIS -- by that time -- had taken credit for it.""This is a terrible, personal tragedy for all of them as well as a real shock and tragedy for our country,"" she said. ""So many people are still waiting to hear what happened to their loved ones who are unaccounted for. So I think we need to keep our focus there as well as our thoughts with the first responders who risked their lives and performed incredibly bravely in Orlando. ""And even as we figure out more about what happened, we need to get to work. This was a terrorist attack. ISIS appears to be claiming credit for it. At a minimum, they seem to have inspired it. I have a plan to defend our country from the, so called, loan wolves and to work with our allies to dismantle the global networks that fuel this kind of radicalization.""Trump: Trump said on Twitter the day of the attack: ""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!"" It was not clear at that time whether the shooting had been an act of ""radical Islamic terrorism.""The next day, he suggested on Fox News that Obama was somehow complicit in the attack, saying: ""We're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind,"" Trump said. ""People can't believe it. ... They can't believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can't ... mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There's something going on. It's inconceivable.""Brussels bombings, March 22, 2016Clinton: Her first response came through a statement released by her campaign. It said: ""Terrorists have once again struck at the heart of Europe, but their campaign of hate and fear will not succeed. The people of Brussels, of Europe, and of the world will not be intimidated by these vicious killers. Today Americans stand in solidarity with our European allies. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and wounded, and all the people of Belgium. These terrorists seek to undermine the democratic values that are the foundation of our alliance and our way of life, but they will never succeed. Today's attacks will only strengthen our resolve to stand together as allies and defeat terrorism and radical jihadism around the world.""Trump: ""I will tell you, I've been talking about this a long time, and look at Brussels,"" Trump said the day of the attack on Fox News. ""Brussels was a beautiful city, a beautiful place with zero crime. And now it's a disaster city. It's a total disaster, and we have to be very careful in the United States, we have to be very careful and very vigilant as to who we allow in this country.""""It's going to get worse and worse,"" he said. ""In my opinion, this is just the beginning. It will get worse and worse because we are lax and we are foolish -- we can't allow these people, at this point we cannot allow these people to come into our country. I'm sorry.""San Bernardino attack, December 2, 2015Clinton: She was campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire, and called for gun control legislation. ""They should not have been able to do this,"" no matter ""what motivated"" the shooters, Clinton said. ""I don't believe we can stop every incident of gun violence but we sure can stop a lot of them. ... We need to take action now.""Trump: Trump immediately tweeted: ""California shooting looks very bad. Good luck to law enforcement and God bless. This is when our police are so appreciated!""The after shooting, on CNN, he said: ""Whenever there's a tragedy, everything goes up, my numbers go way up because we have no strength in this country, we have weak, sad politicians.""Paris attacks, November 13, 2015Clinton: Clinton's first comprehensive reaction to the Paris attack came during the November 14, 2015, debate in Iowa. ""Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight,"" Clinton said. ""But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, the barbaric, ruthless, violence jihadist, terrorist group.""She added, ""This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander in chief. And I will be laying out in detail what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism. Our country deserves no less because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend on us being secure and strong.""Trump: The day after the attack, Trump immediately seized on the issue of gun control. ""When you look at Paris -- you know the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris -- nobody had guns but the bad guys. Nobody had guns. Nobody,"" Trump said at a rally in Beaumont, Texas. ""They were just shooting them one by one and then they (security forces) broke in and had a big shootout and ultimately killed the terrorists. ... If you have 25 people in there with guns, OK, it would've been a totally different story.""He also lammed Obama's leadership: ""We have leadership who doesn't know what they're doing."" And he said ""we have to be insane"" to continue to allow Syrian refugees into the US."	Trump and Clinton respond to New York bombing	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	['god', 'guns']
3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/hillary-clinton-north-carolina/index.html	"Clinton's challenge: Rebuilding Obama's winning coalitionA sign of how seriously the Democratic nominee is taking North Carolina: it's the first place she visited last week when she returned to the campaign trail following a bout with pneumonia. President Barack Obama traveled to Charlotte this summer for his first campaign appearance with Clinton and is expected to return to the state repeatedly in October.The focus on North Carolina -- a state President Barack Obama carried narrowly in 2008 but lost four years later -- comes as polls show Clinton faltering in other battlegrounds such as Florida and Ohio. A win here would almost certainly offset losses in those states and guarantee her the presidency. And the raging culture war over LGBT rights playing out in the state offers her an opportunity to appeal to progressives and encourage them to show up on Election Day. Clinton has reason for some cautious optimism. A Quinnipiac poll released September 8 shows Clinton with a 4-point lead, just outside the margin of error.  ""It's a coin toss,"" said J. Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College.  ""We are dealing with a 45/45 split. The electorate is baked, the remaining 10% are folks who will decide at the last minute, and say 'I can't stand either one.' We are in a holding pattern unless something monumental happens.""Why Democrats are anxiousRepublican nominee Donald Trump is fighting hard for the state. He held a rally last week in Asheville and will be back in North Carolina Tuesday.But the election is playing out as the state is grappling with the fallout from House Bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill that requires people to use the bathroom of their biological gender. It also bans municipalities from passing rules barring discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.Since the legislation's passage earlier this year, North Carolina -- with a long reputation as being one of the more progressive southern states -- has seen a blow to its image. The NBA, NCAA, and ACC have pulled major sporting events out of the state, resulting in millions in lost revenues, a substantial economic and cultural blow to a sport-crazy state.State politics upendedAnd the state's politics have been upended. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory is lagging his Democratic challenger and GOP Sen. Richard Burr is in an unexpectedly competitive re-election race. Democrats see the issue as a rallying call to engage the Obama coalition and possibly, moderate Republicans.""I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen,"" Clinton said at her Greensboro rally. ""And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina.""But Carter Wren, a Republican strategist doubts that House Bill 2 or McCrory's standing, will determine the presidential race here.""The polling stuff I have seen on HB2, it didn't cut, everybody had an opinion, but it didn't change how people vote,"" he said. ""It's all about Hillary and Trump and mostly about character, that's what people are questioning more than the issues.""Kaine splits with Clinton on some Trump supporters as 'irredeemable'And Clinton is facing the same trouble here that she is nationwide: ginning up enthusiasm -- especially among young voters -- that she'll need to replicate Obama's winning coalition. Even voters here who are enthused by Clinton's candidacy recognize that others aren't that plugged into the race.""Some of my friends are on the fence. They say Trump is horrible, but they are not sure about Clinton,"" said Cydnee Mebane, 19, who saw Clinton speak in Greensboro. ""They say they won't vote or they will vote for a third party. With my generation, we are either apathetic or too smart for our own good.""Daisy Goodwin, 65, was initially for Clinton during the primaries in 2008, but flipped to Obama. She expressed fear over what a Trump presidency would look like, and frustration that during voter registration drives, ""a lot of people said they aren't going to vote."" 'Where is Oprah?'""She should bring Barack and Michelle. That will turn people out and we have to go door-to-door,"" said Goodwin, a retired beautician from High Point. ""And where is Oprah?""Another challenge for Democrats is broadening their appeal among white voters, who have been increasingly voting less Democratic in Southern states, a trend that can't be entirely offset by gains with other demographic groups. While the African American vote remained steady from 2008 to 2012, a notable share of white voters shifted from Obama -- he won 31% of the white vote in 2012, down from 35% in 2008 according to exit polls. Obama: Would be 'personal insult' to legacy if black voters don't back ClintonStill, Trump has clear vulnerabilities. ""If I am Trump, my problem is with undecided voters who supported [Mitt] Romney,"" Wren said. ""There are a fair amount of those people who voted for Romney, don't like Clinton but don't like Trump.""That's especially true in North Carolina, a state with an influx of new residents drawn to a tech boom in cities like Charlotte and Raleigh. The population growth has swelled the ranks of unaffiliated and more educated voters. Clinton and her allies have flooded the airwaves with millions in ads, targeting veterans, black millennials, suburban white voters and black churchgoers. Nearly $13 million in TV ads have been reserved through November. Priorities USA launched a $400,000 digital ad buy on Facebook, Instagram and Pandora with one ad called ""Most Racist Person,"" where Trump falsely claims that Obama is not an American citizen. This past Saturday, Democratic volunteers from around the state gathered at different campaign offices to get pep talks before they fanned out to register new voters. Democrats have boasted about their superior ground game, rattling off number of offices (33), paid staff (300) and volunteers (thousands). Republicans counter that buildings don't vote. ""Office numbers are a false metric and completely miss the point that, as we saw in the primary, Mr. Trump is not a typical politician and attempts to measure the strength of his campaign by old world comparisons like these fail to reflect the enthusiasm and grass-roots support seen by the thousands of supporters and new voters he is attracting to his events and his campaign,"" said Jason Simmons, Trump's North Carolina state director.Ultimately, the biggest question for Clinton is whether she can pull off the coalition that united behind Obama in 2008. He won at the time by orchestrating one of the most sophisticated and granular mobilization efforts the state has ever seen. Buoyed by a jump in the registration and participation of black and younger voters, the Obama campaign flipped a 13-point Democratic defeat in 2004, to a 14,000-vote win just four years later. On Monday and Tuesday, the Mothers of the Movement -- women who have lost their children to gun violence or at the hands of the police -- will stump for Clinton here.  ""It was a very strong effort to reach the young people, you have a huge HBCU population down there and we had a very well-organized church strategy,"" said Rick C. Wade, who was Obama's national black vote director in 2008. ""It was the inspiration that Obama represented and I think that's the challenge. How do you get Hillary to connect with those folks?"""

That advantage makes Hillary Clinton the continued front-runner in the race headed into next week's critical first debate, Rove said. ""He's got to win all the Romney states, and as you know, three of them are up for grabs -- North Carolina, he's behind; Arizona, Georgia, barely ahead. He's got to win Florida, got to win Ohio, but that only gets him to 253. He's got to find another 17, and I think he'll win Nevada, I think he'll win Iowa, but even then that only gets him to 265. And that last five, he's got to win either New Hampshire and the second district of Maine, or Pennsylvania, or Michigan, or Wisconsin.""Rove, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, is a chairman of the Crossroads super PAC, which has thus far refused to deploy its significant resources on Trump's behalf, focusing instead on preserving Republican control of the United States Senate. The GOP entered the year in an uphill battle for the Senate, with six Republican incumbents running for reelection in blue states President Obama carried in 2012. Democrats must seize five seats, or win four and the presidency, to wrest control of the upper chamber away from the GOP. Rove says Republican chances of holding the Senate are ""better than 50-50,"" in part because this year's electorate has ""a record number of undecideds, a record number of weak adherents"" who do not want to give either presidential nominee ""a blank check.""The conversation with Rove was taped in Kiev, Ukraine, around the Yalta European Strategy conference, at which Rove and Axelrod participated in a panel discussion on the American election. During the panel, Rove, who has been a persistent critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and trade, pointedly declined several invitations to say he would vote for the Republican nominee this fall.In his ""Axe Files"" conversation with Axelrod, Rove suggested that should Trump lose in November, Rove said Republicans could look to their party in Texas, a diverse state where the GOP has firm control, for clues as to how to proceed.""We're a party in Texas that represents the diversity of our state. ... I think that's the formula for Republicans, and it doesn't involve sort of changing your principles; it involves sharing your principles with every community in every corner of the state.""To hear the whole conversation with Rove, which also covered Rove's rise in politics; his misgivings, based on what he knows today, about the 2003 decision to invade Iraq; and the tragic family histories he and Axelrod share, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

Trump also took aim at ""magazines"" and other media that publish instructions on how to make explosive devices, saying, ""Those people should be arrested because they are inciting violence.""""So I see the other day, and they're all talking about it so wonderfully because it's called freedom of the press -- where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make the same bombs that you saw.

Debate crunch time, and questions about Trump's prep      The first presidential debate is a week from Monday, and Donald Trump has made time on his Sunday schedule for prep sessions with senior advisers. But the unconventional nature of his candidacy extends to his study habits, and some on his team are a bit worried.     Maggie Haberman of the New York Times shared her reporting on Trump's aversion to holding mock debate sessions, among other things.     ""He's playing it a little bit loose and in his sort of free-form style,"" said Haberman. ""But a lot of people around him are concerned that won't translate quite as well in a general election debate.""2. Obama skipping Clinton Foundation event      The Clinton Global Initiative, an offshoot of the Clinton Foundation, will hold its annual -- and final -- gathering Monday and Tuesday in New York. It's held at the same time as the United Nations General Assembly for obvious reasons: Major global leaders are in New York and can be sprinkled throughout the CGI sessions.       But one big name will be missing from this CGI meeting.      Julie Pace of the Associated Press notes that the Clintons' initiative has come under fire this election year.      ""Hillary Clinton would be happy if she could get through the rest of the campaign without having to talk anymore about the foundation, but she's going to have to grin and bear it for a few more days,"" said Pace.    ""This is a three-day gathering with lots of celebrities, lots of big donors -- but there's some speculation it might not be as glitzy as in past years. And there's going to be one very notable absence headlining this meetings, and that's President Barack Obama.""3. Clinton targets millennials in Ohio       It's no secret Hillary Clinton has issues with younger voters, and she is looking to turn the tide.     On Monday, Clinton will travel to Ohio to make her case to millennials by retracing some of her early work as a lawyer.    Abby Philip of the Washington Post says trying to get younger voters to relate more to Clinton is the big goal.      ""The focus of the speech is going to be about her early years -- what she did after she left college -- the focus on idealism and reminding young voters that she was kind of like them,"" said Phillip.       ""And also like someone else, a young community organizer from Chicago, Barack Obama.""     Will this humanize her? Make her seem more like a real person and less like a politician? Stay tuned.4. Signs of progress for Trump in swing state       Ohio is always a giant presidential battleground, and the GOP primary candidacy of its governor, John Kasich, adds another interesting wrinkle this year.      Kasich is no Donald Trump fan -- far from it -- but some Ohio Republicans see signs that even former Kasich primary voters are turning to Trump in the general election.           There's a lot of talk about the influx of newly registered Republican voters and CNN's Sara Murray reports that GOPers surveying those new party members in the Buckeye State are finding firmer-than-expected Trump support.      ""They're finding Donald Trump has strong support from Democrats who are now Republicans, Independents who are now Republicans,"" Murray said. ""People who registered to vote for John Kasich in the primaries are now backing Trump. And what should be particularly worrisome for Democrats in Ohio is that they (the GOP) are finding far more support than they expected among female voters."" 5. Mixed ballots in Ohio pose dilemma      Suppose you're working a Republican phone bank in Ohio and a voter tells you they plan to vote for Hillary Clinton for president and Republican Rob Portman for U.S. Senate. Do you take time -- and resources -- to follow up with that voter to make sure they cast their ballot?     Democrats privately concede that Portman appears to be on an easy path to re-election, so it is less of a conflict for them. Ohio is a tough state, and the Clinton campaign will try to motivate every last potential voter to turn out, no matter who they support for the Senate.     But what about the Republican Party's ground-game efforts? Ostensibly such efforts are on behalf of all Republicans, but GOP candidates who don't have the best relationship with Trump don't all trust the RNC to fight on their behalf.      So Portman is relying on his own get-out-the-vote effort. Those who have seen recent GOP polling in the state say this is one good reason why: Some 20% of Clinton voters in Ohio say they are planning to vote Republican for Senate."

""That's not a word I would use. I wouldn't use it,"" Kaine said. Clinton had told a roomful of donors: ""To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call ""the basket of deplorables."" Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.""She later added: ""Now some of those folks, they are irredeemable.""Clinton has since said she shouldn't have used the word ""half"" -- but has stuck with her criticism of many of Trump's supporters, including white nationalist David Duke. But Kaine said some of Trump's supporters will never be persuaded to back Clinton. ""I think we would be unrealistic to think that some people are going to fundamentally change their view. If they've held to a view for five years, as Donald Trump has, that President Obama is not a citizen of this country, I don't think they're going to change their views,"" Kaine said. However, Kaine said, others can be won over -- pointing to progress in his home state of Virginia, which when he was born still had segregated schools and wouldn't let women into the University of Virginia. ""Today we've opened the doors of opportunity and our economy is in the top 10 and people who fought in every step of the way have realized, 'Wait a minute, we're better when we let everybody around the table, we're actually a stronger,' "" Kaine said. ""I've seen that transition work in my state from fighting against equality, fighting against inclusion to embracing it and being stronger as a result,"" Kaine said, echoing Clinton's ""stronger together"" campaign-trail theme. ""That's what stronger together means -- I've seen it work in Virginia and I know that that's the path we're on as a nation,"" Kaine said. ""That's the choice."""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/18/politics/john-kerry-russia-syria-ceasefire/index.html	"The nation's top diplomat, in an interview with CNN's Elise Labott, said, ""We have made it crystal clear to Russia to what the consequences might be. The President, myself, we've had conversations, we know what's happening, we are being vigilant.""Concerns about hacking into US election systems have heightened in the wake of digital break-ins to Democratic campaign organizations, which federal authorities have linked to Russian intelligence services.  ""I do not believe Russia will have the ability to effect this election and we are going to be absolutely vigilant about it,"" Kerry said. ""The President has made that clear and Russia is warned.""Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, also recalled the exhilaration and exhaustion of a national campaign's final stretch. ""Right now you're getting into October. October is the month when your juices, your blood really begins to flow. You're down to 30 days,"" said the former Massachusetts senator. ""You've been at this for two years plus whatever it is. Uh, it's exhausting but you can see the end, the stakes really descend on you. You really have a sense of just how much is up for grabs here in terms of the future of our nation. And I think that energizes, that clarifies the focus, it provides an intensity and a passion. And I'm confident that over the next month we will see a sharpening, if you will, of the differences of the arguments between the candidates.""But Kerry declined to weigh in on specifics of the tight race between Hillary Clinton, his predecessor at Foggy Bottom, and Republican nominee Donald Trump.In the interview Kerry was also sharply critical of Russia for failing to enforce a ceasefire agreement in Syria, calling on Russia to ""stop the grandstanding, stop the showboating and get the humanitarian assistance going."" Kerry's comments come as convoys carrying humanitarian aid are blocked from reaching some of Syria's hardest-hit areas.  ""It is now Sunday morning. This started Monday night of last week -- this past week. And the humanitarian assistance is supposed to be flowing,"" Kerry said. He pinned the blame on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is at war with insurgents. The United States and Russia are split on who they back in the Syrian civil war, but are attempting to work together to combat terror groups in the country. Kerry complained that Assad's government is blocking the aid and has continued the violence, and said Russia must pressure Assad. ""The regime, once again, is blocking it. So Russia's client, Russia's supported friend, is the single biggest blockade to the ability to move forward here,"" Kerry said. ""So let me just say this clearly: Russia signed up to a cessation of hostilities. Assad said he would live by it. Then he needs to stop and let the joint implementation center get set up so Russia and the United States can coordinate in order to avoid the kind of terrible thing that happened yesterday that we all acknowledge and regret,"" Kerry said. His comments come the day after the US-led coalition fighting ISIS admitted it struck Syrian forces rather than a terror target.Kerry also issued a broader call for Russia to pressure Assad. ""The biggest judgment they need to make is to stop Assad from bombing people indiscriminately, which he continues to do,"" the secretary of state said. ""And if you are serious about having a ceasefire, and they say they are, then they should keep Assad from flying right now and prove their sincerity about a ceasefire,"" he said. ""But to allow Assad -- who is a spoiler; he doesn't want a ceasefire -- to allow him to continue to go after opposition, pretending that they are Nusra, is in and of itself a huge challenge to this effort.""Kerry said ""there are no good options"" to stop the crisis in Syria, and that the options that do exist are ""ugly."" ""One option is trying to move toward a ceasefire and trying to get to the table to have a negotiation. But the other option moves to more arms in the area, more fighting, more destruction, more migrants, more refugees. More children, women, schools, hospitals hit. Literally, possibly the destruction of Syria as an entire nation and state. And it is getting close to that even now,"" Kerry said. ""So the options are not pretty. But you've got to put to test the seriousness of purpose of a nation.""He acknowledged that Defense Secretary Ash Carter and others at the Pentagon have expressed reservations about a ceasefire agreement and in trusting Russia to help enforce it. ""Nothing in this agreement is based on trust,"" he said. ""It is based on very specific steps that each side has to take. And that includes pulling back from this key access road in the north near Aleppo. It includes restraining both sides, Assad, and for us, the opposition, from engaging. And then it includes the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and delivering a real cessation of hostilities.""Kerry also weighed in on the explosion Saturday night in New York City, saying ""the security in the city of New York will be unparalleled as it always is"" in the wake of the incident.""I'm not concerned about that. But I think we need to be concerned for every American and for the folks in New York on a day-to-day basis. Understand what's going on. The teams are doing that and as I said, they could not be more qualified or capable,"" he said."	Kerry: Russia 'is warned' about tampering attempts on US elections systems	['Trump']	[]
