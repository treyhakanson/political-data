""It's going abysmally bad for Trump right now,"" said Javier Palomarez, chief executive of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, in a blunt assessment of Trump's outreach to Hispanic voters.The Trump campaign's sudden decision to spotlight minority outreach efforts with less than three months until Election Day came amid mounting concern in his campaign that some voters viewed the GOP nominee as racist.But some have viewed Trump's efforts thus far as ham-handed. That's partly because he regularly makes his pitch to minority voters in front of almost entirely white audiences. But it's also because -- even as the Trump campaign has added events with more diverse audiences -- they've tended to be small roundtables stacked with participants selected by the campaign.""He talks about us, and he doesn't talk to us,"" said Bettina Inclán, the 2012 director of Hispanic outreach for the Republican National Committee. ""It doesn't matter whether you are white, black, brown, yellow or red, (voters) want authenticity -- that you're not just going to them for their vote but you care about their issues.""Pastor defends submitting questions to Trump campaignShe was one of multiple strategists and leaders of minority efforts who questioned whether Trump's appeals were truly aimed at non-white voters and whether they are focusing more on optics than actual engagement.""Sometimes these outreach efforts seem like they're geared to appease Republicans and white voters who are leaving him,"" Inclán said.Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, dismissed that perception.""Mr. Trump is committed to being a president for all Americans, and unlike Hillary Clinton, that includes campaigning hard for everyone's vote,"" said Miller, as he knocked Clinton for her relatively light public schedule. ""Mr. Trump knows that by working together, we can improve economic opportunities for everyone, make our communities safe and break up Washington's rigged system that has left too many behind.""Ahead of Trump's visit to an African-American church in Detroit on Saturday, a New York Times report suggested Trump's latest diversity stop would be scripted by his advisers. After receiving advance questions from Bishop Wayne Jackson for Saturday's question-and-answer session, Trump's advisers prepared an eight-page transcript of replies for the candidate.The pastor now says he plans to ask some questions that haven't been pre-screened and said Trump would also address his congregation.""He's been preaching to African-Americans from a backdrop of white people,"" Jackson, the pastor of the Great Faith Ministries Congregation in Detroit, told CNN on Friday. ""His statements are that 'I'm going to make the black community better.' ... We want to know how you're going to do that."" Jackson told reporters Saturday that Trump's answers weren't scripted, though he acknowledged Trump was ready for the questions.""He just sat down like a normal guy and answered the questions,"" Jackson said.Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has turned down opportunities to speak to diverse audiences. He declined an invitation to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People convention, as well as four different invitations from the National Urban League to participate in questionnaires, briefings or conventions, according to the group.Another blow to Trump's efforts came this week when he delivered his highly anticipated immigration speech. While several of his advisers and Hispanic supporters expected him to moderate his approach, Trump delivered an enforcement-focused address that baffled and offended even some of his supporters.Rev. Tony Suárez, who sits on the executive evangelical committee for Trump, called the policy address ""disappointing and confusing.""Unlike other high-profile Hispanic supporters who dumped Trump after the speech, Suárez said he hasn't left the advisory board because he doesn't want to make a ""rash decision."" Still, he said if Trump's latest speech is an indication he's backing mass deportations, the GOP candidate would ""virtually close the door of every immigrant majority congregation in the United States.""Political operatives and leaders of minority-focused organizations said there are plenty of more authentic and effective opportunities available for Trump to engage with minority voters.Inclán suggested Trump buy television advertising in Spanish in Nevada -- a state where polls show him within striking distance of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton -- to highlight his business record and focus on job creation.In the past, GOP candidates have focused their efforts on minority business or evangelical communities. Less-scripted campaign stops, like stopping by Versailles -- an iconic eatery in Miami -- for coffee with Cuban Americans, could also benefit Trump, Inclán said.In a more intimate environment, some voters have come away with a more positive impression of the bombastic billionaire.Oz Sultan, who identified himself as a conservative Muslim, recently participated in a meeting at Trump Tower with the candidate and young Republicans like himself who are part of the GOP's Republican Leadership Initiative, a program with a diverse class of activists.He went into the meeting torn between voting for Trump or Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson. He said he was impressed with Trump's interest in the issues that were raised and walked away leaning toward Trump.Chicago rapper gets political: Donald Trump ""is the problem""""I think that was a human side of Trump that we saw,"" Sultan said. ""It definitely made me really reconsider him.""Alfred Liz, whose parents were born in the Dominican Republic, also said he was surprised by Trump's affable demeanor at the roundtable.""When people are actually able to meet him and get to know the real Donald Trump, he's completely different,"" he said. ""When people get over that barrier that's been put in place and enforced by Democrats, then people will be able to see that that's the guy they want to vote for.""Perhaps the most resounding criticism of Trump's new outreach effort, though, is that the candidate should have started his appeal to minority voters far sooner.A Suffolk University/USA Today poll released this week was the latest to illustrate the chasm between Trump and Clinton when it comes to non-white voters. While 24% of Hispanic voters opted for Trump, 65% backed Clinton. And he received just 4% of the African-American vote, compared to her 92%.Trump backer apologizes for blackface tweet, but stands by message""Minority outreach, stakeholder engagement and coalition-building -- those are long-term projects. Those aren't just things that happen when you say you're going to go and engage the African-American community,"" said Jeff Polesovsky, who served as the political director of Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign and deputy campaign manager when Kasich ran for re-election in Ohio in 2014. That year, Kasich won 26% of the African-American vote. ""You have to spend a lot of time listening, understanding their needs and then reacting with a sense of urgency,"" Polesovsky said. The Trump campaign ""made it political before it even got off the ground.""Now, it may be too late.Palomarez, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce head, said he believes Trump has little chance of improving his numbers with Latino voters after his latest immigration speech.""Honestly, it just seems like there's no going back. The offense is so deep, so outlandish,"" he said. ""I really don't know when or how or if the Republican community will ever recover."""	Donald Trump's minority outreach off to rough start

The Paris agreement only goes into effect if 55 nations sign on.Because the US plan was termed an ""executive agreement,"" the White House says Obama did not require Senate approval for ratification.""I believe that history will judge today's efforts as pivotal,"" Obama said after he and Xi formally submitted their nations' plans.In talks with Xi after the announcement, Obama raised areas over which Washington and Beijing remain firmly at odds, including over the rising Asian power's territorial grabs in the South China Sea, its engagement in cyber warfare, a monetary policy often unwelcome in the West and longstanding concerns over human rights abuses.""We will have candid conversations about some of those differences, issues like human rights, or cyber, or maritime,"" Obama said. ""I am absolutely committed to ensuring not only that this is a productive meeting but that we are also setting the stage so that the next US administration comes in with a relationship that is on a strong and productive footing.""Confrontation at airportObama, who touched down in Hangzhou just after 2 p.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), is embarking on a final bout of delicate overseas diplomacy before his successor is elected in November. He arrived in Asia on Saturday for meetings with some of his most nettlesome counterparts.A pomp-filled arrival ceremony on the airport's tarmac was marred, however, by scuffles between US officials and Chinese security, who attempted to keep members of the media and some senior Obama aides away from the US President.""This is our country. This is our airport,"" one Chinese official insisted when US presidential aides said that American reporters were allowed to view Obama's arrival. Officials also briefly attempted to block US National Security Adviser Susan Rice from moving toward the President.The confrontation lasted only moments before the US delegation sped away toward the city center.It was likely just the first tense moment on a trip rife with tension for Obama, who, during his final presidential trip to Asia, is taking a final stab at face-to-face negotiations to resolve simmering disputes. A complicated relationshipObama's aides insist China is a success story for the administration but acknowledge the persistent differences between the countries. They said those divergences would be covered in Obama's talks with Xi, as they have been for the past several years.""Part of what I've tried to communicate to President Xi is that the United States arrives at its power, in part, by restraining itself,"" Obama told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview ahead of the Asia trip, previewing his message.""So where we see them violating international rules and norms, as we have seen in some cases in the South China Sea or in some of their behavior when it comes to economic policy, we've been very firm,"" he added. ""And we've indicated to them that there will be consequences.""""Our relationship with China ... defies easy and simple definitions,"" said Daniel Kritenbrink, Obama's senior director for Asian affairs. ""We recognize and are comfortable with the fact that there exists a broad range of tensions in the US-China relationship. We don't shy away from that tension.""Tension-filled agendaFor Obama, this week's trip to China and Laos is one of his last opportunities to shape American foreign policy before other leaders adapt their approach to the US based on the next president. He hopes to make a closing argument in some of his most fraught relationships before the business of state is handed off.Aside from Xi, Obama planned formal meetings with the leaders of Turkey and the Philippines amid new disagreements.READ MORE: Why Obama shouldn't expect much from G20In talks Sunday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Obama confronts a prickly leader who remains nonetheless indispensable to the United States.Since an attempt to overthrow him failed in July, Erdoğan has taken harsh tactics to consolidate power, worrying human rights advocates and US officials alike. The Turkish leader is expected to press Obama on an extradition request for US-based cleric Fetthulah Gulen, under suspicion in Turkey for helping plot the coup. Gulen denies involvement, and the US is demanding evidence of his involvement, but rejecting the request could worsen ties between the two countries.For the US, alienating Erdoğan remains an unwelcome prospect given Turkey's critical role in the battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Even on that front, disagreements persist. Washington has pressed Ankara to end airstrikes on Syrian Kurds, whom the US is backing in the fight against ISIS terrorists.Deep divides over Syria have also marred Obama's relationship with Putin, adding to a litany of discord between the US and Russia that's driven relations to their lowest level since the Cold War.It's a final attempt to salvage what's become one of the most acrimonious relationships on the global stage. Putin's persistent support for the Syrian regime, Moscow's moves in Ukraine and the charge that Russia may be meddling in the US presidential contest have built a deeply antagonistic dynamic between the two leaders.At his second stop, in the Southeast Asian nation of Laos, Obama is planning his first face-to-face with the controversial new leader of key US ally the Philippines.President Rodrigo Duterte's lewd comments about women and his harsh approach to battling drug crime have earned him the label the ""Donald Trump of the Philippines.""Obama has worked hard to develop the Philippines' partnership with the US and its role as a regional counterbalance to China. He's visited the country twice in his second term, and announced on a stop there in November the return of a US military presence at a critical naval base on the South China Sea.But Duterte's derogatory comments and a spike in extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers put the relationship in stormier waters.Farewell tourObama is expected to complete one more foreign swing as President, traveling to Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November and likely making additional stops in a presidential farewell tour.But that trip is scheduled after the presidential election, meaning his stops in China and Laos this week will be his final chance to interact with world leaders before either Trump or Hillary Clinton make him a lame duck.Amid his contentious bilateral agenda, Obama will find close allies at hand as well. His top global partner, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, is attending, as is Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Obama's newest foreign friend.Obama is planning to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May for the first time since she replaced his stalwart partner David Cameron. The consequences of the Brexit vote were likely to arise in the summit's various economic sessions.Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, fresh from his meeting with Trump, also was scheduled to travel to Hangzhou for a slightly less scrutinized session with global leaders."

Burns, however, was never in the Army Reserve. He was in the South Carolina National Guard, from which he was discharged in 2008, CNN found.As far as a Bachelor's degree, North Greenville University told CNN he only attended the school for one semester. Burns admitted that he did not finish his degree when CNN asked him about it. When CNN confronted Burns about the various professional and social exaggerations he had featured on his biography, Burns first said the page had ""obviously"" been either ""manipulated or either hacked or added.""But the site host, Wix, said there was no evidence of a hack. ""This is not fair at all,"" Burns told Blackwell during the interview. ""I thought we were doing a profile and all of a sudden you're here to try to destroy my character.""""I'm not here to destroy your character,"" Blackwell replied.At one point, Burns told Blackwell he believed the interview was off the record, to which Blackwell responded, ""I didn't agree to that.""Burns abruptly ended the interview by walking away.CNN followed up with the Trump campaign and was provided with a statement from Burns:""As a young man starting my church in Greenville, South Carolina, I overstated several details of my biography because I was worried I wouldn't be taken seriously as a new pastor. This was wrong, I wasn't truthful then and I have to take full responsibility for my actions,"" Burns' statement reads.  Burns said he did not know if he had been vetted by the Trump campaign.

3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/politics/cnn-poll-of-polls-clinton-leads-trump/index.html	Clinton holds an average of 42% support to Trump's 37% across five nationwide telephone polls conducted between August 9 and 30. That 5-point lead represents a strong starting point for Clinton heading into the fall campaign season, but a CNN Poll of Polls earlier in the month averaging polls conducted in the week after Clinton's convention in Philadelphia found the Democrat ahead by 10 points, 49% to 39%. The shift brings the race back to where it was before the conventions in July. In a CNN Poll of Polls before either convention, Clinton topped Trump by an average of four points.37 big moments from a wild political summerDuring the time the polls included in the average were conducted, both candidates have faced a wave of negative news stories. On Trump's side, that included an overhaul of his campaign's leadership, a slew of prominent Republicans announcing that they would not vote for the GOP nominee and a much-criticized effort to reach out to black voters while speaking to mostly white audiences. Clinton has been dogged by questions about her use of private email while secretary of state and a steady stream of criticism about the way the Clinton Foundation interacted with the State Department during her time in office.The average suggests Clinton has taken a bigger hit, losing seven points since early August while Trump dipped just two points. But Trump's starting point was far lower, and below that of a typical Republican candidate. In 2012, the Democratic convention was held in early September, so there isn't an equivalent pre-Labor Day marker, but in the first CNN Poll of Polls compiled completely after the convention ended, Obama stood at 49%, even with Clinton's post-convention mark, while Romney's 46% far outpaced Trump's 39% average in early August.In the new averages, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson stands at 9% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein holds 4%, about the same as their standing in early August but well below the 15% threshold they will need to reach to be invited to participate in the three televised debates set for this fall. Only one of the polls included in the average, the Fox News Poll, was sponsored by a group whose polls will be included in the calculations the Commission on Presidential Debates will complete to determine eligibility for the debates. Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college mapLabor Day typically marks the start of an intense period of campaigning in the final two months before Election Day. It's likely there will be many polls released next week to mark that campaign kickoff, and since voters typically begin tuning in more closely to the campaign once the summer ends, those figures will be more meaningful for all candidates.The CNN Poll of Polls averages results for the five most recent publicly released national polls that meet CNN's standards for publication. All polls used in calculating the average include both Gary Johnson and Jill Stein on the list of candidates tested. The average uses results among registered voters where available. This Poll of Polls includes: The Pew Research Center Poll conducted Aug. 9-16, the Quinnipiac University Poll conducted Aug. 18-24, the Monmouth University Poll conducted Aug. 25-28, the Suffolk University/USA Today Poll conducted August 24-29 and the Fox News Poll conducted August 28-30. The poll of polls does not have a margin of sampling error.	CNN Poll of Polls: Clinton's lead cut in half

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/orange-county-blogger/index.html	"Peter Ronald Wexler, who had been held without bond for nearly a year prior to trial, was ordered to be released by US District Judge Josephine L. Staton, who presided over his week-long trial in Santa Ana.Staton declared a mistrial after jurors indicated they were hopelessly deadlocked on 16 of 20 counts against Wexler. He was accused of threatening to behead and slit the throats of FBI agents, including David Bowdich, who was formerly in charge of the bureau's Los Angeles field office.Wexler, 50, testified that he relied on sarcasm and hyperbole to get points across on his blog, which dealt with topics that included US foreign policy in the Middle East, presidential politics and policing in America. He said he intended to be provocative in his posts, but none were intended to convey threats against Bowdich or any other agents.In order to win a conviction, prosecutors needed to convince jurors that Wexler's comments were ""a serious expression of an intent to physically harm or murder"" Bowdich and other agents and that ""a reasonable person"" would interpret them that way as well.A spokesman for the US Attorney's office in Los Angeles declined to comment on the verdict and could not immediately say whether prosecutors would seek a new trial.Wexler's attorneys, Caleb Mason and Marri Derby, said they spoke with jurors after the verdict, who told them the panel was stuck on an 8-4 split in favor of acquittal. ""Mr. Wexler is very happy about today's results,"" Mason said. ""He's very glad the justice system has worked so far.""Derby said he was moved to tears by the verdict.FBI agents visited Wexler's RV, parked in a mobile home park in Anaheim, last September after learning of blog posts purportedly in support of cop killers and the terror group ISIS. He politely turned agents away at the door but then began blogging about the visit.""Is it murder to kill an FBI Pig who knocks on your door without a warrant?"" Wexler allegedly wrote in a blog post. ""I think not.""Is blogging about beheading FBI agents a criminal threat or free speech?A day later, he allegedly posted ""a personal MEMO to David Bowdich,"" the FBI's top agent in Southern California.""If your (expletive) goons ever show up at my house again,"" the post read, ""my knife will strike the necks."" He told agents on his blog not to bother him again ""unless you're looking for a Left-Handed Shave with my kitchen knife, a Schrade SCHF9, whch can chop down a tree and perfectly slice a juicy red, vine-ripened tomato, in that order!""(The left-handed reference apparently applies to ""Jihadi John,"" an ISIS executioner who appears in several Internet beheading videos.)Wexler wrote that Bowdich should be ""shot in the back!""""That (expletive) just got under my skin, and my trigger finger is suddenly getting very itchy,"" Wexler said.The postings included a photo of Bowdich's head placed in the crosshairs of a riflescope and superimposed onto the the bodies of ISIS beheading victims.Bowdich, who has since been promoted to a top job at FBI headquarters in Washington, testified that he was told of the threats, took them seriously and was concerned for his family's safety.Following the posts, prosecutors portrayed Wexler as a serious threat not only to Bowdich, but to those investigating him as well. They sought and received special permission to conduct a pre-dawn SWAT raid to arrest him despite a peaceful encounter weeks earlier and persuaded a federal judge he posed a continuing danger to the public and should be held without bail prior to trial. Mason, a former federal prosecutor, told jurors during closing arguments that the government was attempting to criminalize free speech because Wexler had criticized members of the FBI. He called the verdict a vindication.""The government has a black eye on this one,"" Mason said. ""This case should never have been brought."""

Both spent the year's hottest months battling controversy and challenges from within and out their party ranks. As the fall campaign kicks off after Labor Day next week, let's recap an unforgettable political summer. Donald Trump was the only Republican candidate left standing by Memorial Day.Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination, but Bernie Sanders refused to drop out. On the international stage, North American leaders pulled off this awkward handshake.And the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, a decision Trump championed.On Capitol Hill, Democrats held an overnight sit-in of the House to protest lack of action on gun bills.The FBI wrapped its investigation of Clinton's emails. FBI Director James Comey did not recommend prosecution. But he did say that Clinton was ""reckless"" and ""extremely careless"" in transmitting classified material through her private server.But instead of capitalizing on it, Trump decided to praise Saddam Hussein.And his Twitter account posted a graphic popularized by white supremacists.Pokemon GO swept the nation, and Clinton tried to show that she is hip with it. (She is not.)Trump clarified his position on mosquitoes.Trump announced Mike Pence as his running mate and revealed this short-lived campaign logo.At the Republican convention, Trump entered on the first night like a World Wrestling Champion. (He is literally a member of the WWE Hall of Fame. It's true. Look it up.)Melania Trump plagiarized her convention speech from Michelle Obama. Trump air-kissed Mike Pence.Ted Cruz caused a ruckus when he refused to endorse Trump from the convention stage.""Never Trump"" Republicans made a last stand on the RNC floor.They failed, and the Republicans nominated Trump.Still, many were unhappy.On the final night, Trump gave one of the longest acceptance speeches in history.Before the Democratic National Convention began, Wikileaks released a trove of private Democratic Party emails showing the party privately favored Clinton over Bernie Sanders.  Sanders supporters were furious, and Democratic Party Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned. Experts said Russia was behind the hack. So Trump invited Russia to hack Clinton. The Democratic convention continued on amid the turmoil.Howard Dean came to peace with the Dean Scream. And so did Meryl Streep.Clinton presented this subtle visual metaphor.Tim Kaine was nominated for Vice President.Clinton overcame challenges from Sanders supporters and officially became the Democratic nominee. She was impressed by the balloons.But the most powerful moment came when a Muslim family whose son died fighting in the Iraq War challenged Trump. That got Trump's attention -- so much so that he attacked the Khan family.It was the start of a tough week for Trump. He joked about kicking a baby out of his rally.And then he made a comment that many interpreted as a call to shoot Clinton. Meanwhile, a man in New York was arrested for scaling Trump Tower with suction cups, because things definitely weren't weird enough already. Clinton's email scandal continued to dog her. Trump is down in the polls? ""Says who?""Trump went to Mexico to meet with the president who once compared him to Hitler.And finished his day in Arizona making clear there's no ""softening"" in his immigration stance.Alright, with that, onward to the debates, the fall and Election Day.

Obama previewed the message he will send to Chinese President Xi Jinping at his last meeting with G20 world leaders.Obama bids farewell with Asia pivot in flux""Part of what I've tried to communicate to President Xi is that the United States arrives at its power, in part, by restraining itself,"" Obama said. ""You know, when we bind ourselves to a bunch of international norms and rules it's not because we have to, it's because we recognize that over the long term, building a strong international order is in our interests.""Obama said the US has been ""very firm"" in response to Chinese assertiveness, including in the disputed South China Sea, where the US has opposed territorial moves by China in contested areas. ""We've indicated to them that there will be consequences,"" he said.Critics, however, have accused the US of not doing enough to check the rising power.Obama is also expected to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the summit. It will be their first meeting after a failed coup attempt in Turkey, which led to a crackdown on the nation's journalists and mass jailings.Obama did not indicate the US would publicly rebuke Erdogan. Turkey remains an important ally in the fight against ISIS in the Syrian civil war on its borders, one of many shared interests. ""You now have a reaction (to the coup attempt) by the Turkish government that understandably is scared and concerned,"" Obama said. ""Imagine if something like that happened here in the United States, the challenges that we would have in figuring out how to re-stabilize our country. ...

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/politics/trump-super-pac-paul-manafort-rick-scott/index.html	"In conference calls and private meetings, people close to the group Rebuilding America Now have begun expressing worry that they no longer have the campaign's blessing that they labored to earn from Paul Manafort.And after once imagining an ambitious, aggressive fundraising campaign in which they match Hillary Clinton's super PAC operation with a $100 million-plus budget, group officials and donors -- including Florida Gov. Rick Scott -- are now selling a more restrained operation, one focused on merely three or four states and spending about half of the original target.The super PAC this summer aired almost $13 million in television ads, more than any other Trump group, giving them some air cover until the Trump campaign was able to begin advertising two weeks ago. This week, however, it suddenly stopped the paid media campaign, despite prior statements that they would be on television until Election Day.The ouster of Manafort --  the longtime Washington lobbyist -- as Trump's campaign chairman has caused alarm. Trump's new leadership, especially Breitbart Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, has strong ties to a rival super PAC run by aides to GOP megadonor Bob Mercer. And while Rebuilding America Now officials stress they have a path forward, some in the organization are now looking over their shoulder more than ever.Rick Scott's unusual roleThe one saving grace, according to interviews with a dozen people with ties to the group: Scott, the Florida governor who chairs the super PAC. He has made a significant contribution to the super PAC from his own personal fortune, CNN has learned from a super PAC aide.""We were the one blessed by the current regime, and the regime left,"" said one super PAC official, who said that his concerns have been soothed by Scott's success. ""It was fits and starts before that, and it's fits and starts now."" Scott's is an unusual role: the chief executive of the nation's third largest state -- with a net worth estimated to be over $100 million -- holding a side gig glad-handing the nation's wealthiest Republicans to help the party's presidential nominee.""He knows how to win campaigns like this, and how to inspire the financial support to get them over the goal line. He's done it,"" said Alex Castellanos, who is crafting the super PAC's ads. ""Scott is just a relentlessly efficient business guy.""A key part of Scott's pitch: he too, has given to the cause.""I'm in. I need you in,"" Scott will say when on fundraising calls, according to one group official.The size of Scott's personal contribution will not be disclosed until the super PAC's next financial report in October, but the gift is the subject of much buzz and speculation in Tallahassee. The figure is expected to be far less than the $85 million he spent on his own governor's race in 2010. It could also come from Scott's own PAC, Let's Get to Work.""Stay tuned,"" super PAC spokeswoman and Scott adviser Melissa Sellers said when asked about a personal donation.A former hospital executive and Republican donor in his own right, Scott is described by associates as a hyper-aggressive, early-rising ""bulldog"" with a national donor network that few in American politics rival. Close with Fortune 500 CEOs from his time in the private sector and fluent in the language of the mega-rich, Scott is at ease cold calling fellow millionaires, being rejected and pushing back aggressively.Some friends, nervous about how history will judge Trump, have counseled Scott to not cast his lot with a Republican nominee who he cannot control -- though the pair speaks by phone several times a week.""I'm kind of glad there are hurricanes and Zika that take up a bunch of his time,"" said one person close with Scott who is encouraging him to scale back.But according to donors and other individuals close to the group, Scott has so far largely failed to woo other top contributors. One major donor so far has stepped forward: Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus, who has given $3 million to the super PAC, according to two people with knowledge of his giving. California real estate tycoon Geoff Palmer gave the group $2 million earlier this summer, according to the group's first campaign finance filing.Rival super PACs say they too expect to receive donations from Marcus, and the donor is said to be open to funding other groups beyond just Scott's.Big GOP donors on the sidelinesOther expected contributors, though, have yet to commit. Scott so far has failed to win over Sheldon Adelson, the Trump-supporting billionaire who continues to withhold massive checks from GOP finance officials despite Scott's personal pitches. An Adelson spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.T. Boone Pickens, the energy magnate once thought to be a major part of any Trump super PAC operation, is still on the sidelines. And earlier this year, the super PAC's founder, longtime Trump friend Tom Barrack, ended his involvement with the group, sending the group temporarily into a tailspin. The $32 million in pledged donations that he said were en route have yet to arrive.Group allies stress that donors are on the cusp of making major donations to the super PAC but are not prepared yet to go public. Super PAC aides had a presence at the most recent meeting of top donors to the Republican Governors Association in Aspen, according to a person present at the function, though one top RGA donor said that Scott himself has made few pitches to the group. And Scott has long relationships with Florida's top Republican donors -- including those allied with Jeb Bush, like developer Bill Edwards, or those who have otherwise said they will not back Trump, like Marco Rubio-allied billionaire Norman Braman. But Braman, Edwards and a few of Scott's major donors did not respond to requests for comment about any conversations with Scott's PAC.Targeting Florida and OhioWeak fundraising means a smaller budget: While Rebuilding America Now has decided to go all-in on two states -- Ohio and Florida -- there are questions about what the other one to two target states will be: Pennsylvania and Virginia are considered leading contenders.Group officials declined to say how much they had raised so far, though they maintain that major commitments -- including one of $20 million -- is still on the table. Marcus' $3 million gift is also said to not be the group's largest contribution so far, according to one person familiar with Marcus' giving.And many donor targets from Rebuilding America Now's list have not made contributions, according to interviews.In Cleveland's Ritz Carlton hotel during the Republican National Convention, super PAC officials pitched their work to about 15 of the Republican Party's leading donors. Given many Republican donors' antipathy for Trump's politics, the room comprised the most likely people in the country to write checks then to finance their ad campaign.There was hedge fund billionaire Steve Feinberg; supermarket magnate John Castimidis; veterans of Mitt Romney's star-studded operation like Tom Tellefsen of California and John Rakolta of Michigan; and a handful of donors with ties to new vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence, including Pence's longtime finance aide, Marty Obst. Others were there on behalf of GOP stalwarts like Woody Johnson, Harold Hamm and Joe Craft.wYet several of the donors and representatives that sat in the Ritz that day say they have had little to no follow-up with the PAC officials since they left the briefing. Donors privately told CNN that they were impressed by the organization and were willing to make introductions, but an immediate personal contribution wasn't in the offing.A Hamm spokeswoman, Kristin Thomas, said he planned to donate merely to the RNC and campaign itself: ""We're pretty direct in our giving.""Poor quality ads?One donor who has been courted described the whole meeting as chaotic and ""a bizarre experience."" ""The main question is where the money is going,"" said the person, who recalled questions being raised about the super PAC's commission rates and deemed the television spots to be ""very poor quality.""One highlight of the meeting was when Manafort, the campaign's polished campaign chief, called in and gave what had long eluded super PACs operating in the Republican nominee's shadow: the blessing of Trump Tower, which would make any of the pro-Trump groups a de facto authorized entity.Manafort told the small group that he approved of Rebuilding America Now, which is led by a longtime Manafort lobbying associate, Laurance Gay, and that he wouldn't be offering the same nod to competing Trump super PACs. And Pence, too, gave the group legitimacy, issuing a statement of support that today prominently appears on its website.Asked if Pence still stood by his statement that ""supporting Rebuilding America Now is one of the best ways"" to back Trump, a Pence spokesman would not embrace that group specifically.""Governor Pence is not doing any events to assist these efforts,"" Pence aide Marc Lotter said. ""He supports all groups seeking to elect Donald Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton."" Pence issued his support before Manafort left the Trump campaign, and the checks apparently left as well."

One looking for the fish's official name, however, is likely to stay hooked -- a formal description of the species isn't expected to be published until later this year.Last week, Obama established the largest protected marine sanctuary in the world when he more than quadrupled the size of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument to protect reefs, marine life habitats and other resources. The expansion will add 442,781 square miles to the monument, making it now a total of 582,578 square miles.The dorsal fin coloration of the male is a circular red spot ringed with blue which scientists said reminded them of Obama's campaign logo.""It's very reminiscent of Obama's (campaign) logo,"" Richard Pyle, a marine biologist, told the magazine. ""How appropriate that a fish we were thinking about naming after him anyway, just to say thank you for expanding the national monument, happens to have a feature that ties it to the President.""The species was discovered this past June during a research trip to Kure, the world's northernmost atoll, National Geographic reported.RELATED: Obama highlights climate agenda on tiny Midway islandPyle and his colleagues later confirmed that the fish was a new species -- the first member of the genus Tosanoides found outside of Japanese waters. This is not the first time Obama has had a fish named after him.Scientists named an aqua and orange speckled freshwater darter found in the Tennessee River Etheostoma Obama in 2012. At the time, scientists named others of the more than 200 species of darters discovered after other presidents. "	A reel honor: Scientists name new fish after Obama
