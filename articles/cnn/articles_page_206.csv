Biden said the criticism of Clinton has been ""veiled and unspecific,"" but she needs to show voters that she understands their challenges and pain.""The truth is Hillary knows it's a problem. And she's trying to figure out how to remedy it,"" Biden told CNN about perceptions of Clinton's trustworthiness. ""My advice to her the best way to remedy it is to talk about what you care about. Talk about it with some passion and people will see through it.""Poll: Nine weeks out, a near even raceDemocrats are sending their full bench to the campaign trail, with Biden and President Barack Obama working aggressively to keep the White House in their party's hands. They are set to campaign more than any sitting president and vice president have in a generation for their successors.At a Labor Day rally here in Pittsburgh, Biden and vice presidential hopeful Tim Kaine appeared together Monday for the first time in this election cycle. Both men are trying to improve the Democratic ticket's standing with white working-class voters.""People are looking for a ladder,"" Kaine told CNN. ""They want to see there is a ladder that they can climb and that's what Hilary and I are talking about. At the end of the day, that will pose a comparison that is very, very stark.""How Donald Trump could winA year after Biden decided against running for president himself, he said he is ""100 percent"" invested in helping Clinton. He said Trump was not qualified to be president, but acknowledged it was ""an incredibly confusing year,"" and Democrats should not grow complacent.""I just can't fathom what he'd do,"" Biden said of a Trump presidency. ""The idea that he cares about the plight of middle-class people is just inconsistent with what he's done.""With both candidates facing record-high disapproval ratings, Biden said he worried Clinton could struggle to reach voters.""This could be the most negative campaign in the history of modern politics,"" Biden said. ""My question is, is anybody going to be able to break through what is just sort of a notion of a pox on both your houses?""Sanders solo stumps for Clinton, but do Dems buy it?For Clinton, under constant siege over her use of a private email server as secretary of state and facing questions over whether Clinton Foundation donors had improper access to her State Department, polls have shown trustworthiness is her most significant weakness.Asked whether Clinton had been successful trying to explain the controversies, Biden said, ""It's been a moving target."" But he added that he was ""absolutely confident she is doing it by the book.""""She is going to figure out what she is going to say,"" Biden said, ""to be crystal clear to the American people about what the relationship will be between the family and the foundation going forward.""One issue dividing the Democratic Party is trade, particularly the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation accord that Obama is trying to win Congressional approval before his term ends. Kaine and Clinton oppose the agreement, which Obama and Biden support.Why the Clinton Foundation controversies won't go awayAsked how he and the President could win over Kaine and Clinton, Biden declared: ""We're not.""""They don't think it's a good enough deal to support. The President and I think it is,"" Biden said. ""But the bottom line is we're going to attempt in a lame duck (session of Congress) to actually have a vote.""Eight years after Biden was tapped to be Obama's vice president, he offered one piece of advice for Kaine.""Understand that the bureaucracy is gigantic,"" Biden said. ""As well as you think you know it, take control of it, grab it by the throat. And make sure you follow up in detail on whatever initiative the president gives you."""

She was 92.While her supporters remember her as a champion of traditional family values, her critics denounced her work and beliefs as dated and offensive. However, no amount of criticism ever stopped Schlafly from speaking her mind.Below are 10 quotes that define Schlafly's life as ""the first lady"" of the American conservative movement:1. On the Equal Rights Amendment2. On immigrants who don't speak English""You can't be an American if you don't speak English. Our public schools should be mandated to teach all children in English."" (December 14, 1995)3. On women being drafted into the military""The purpose of our military is to field the finest troops possible to defend our nation and win wars. The goal of feminists, however, is to impose a mindless equality, regardless of how many people it hurts."" (May 18, 2016) 4. On what she called the ""transgender agenda""""Anyone with a child knows that children learn about the world through binary options: up or down, hot or cold, big or little, inside or outside, wet or dry, good or bad, boy or girl, man or woman. But the radical feminists, who staff women's studies departments at most colleges, have propagated the idea that we have to get rid of the 'gender binary' along with the expectation of distinct roles for men and women."" (August 31, 2016) 5. On climate change""Of course, climate changes. Many changes are due to factors over which humans have no control, such as winds, ocean currents and sun activity. But the liberals want us to believe that climate change is also caused by gases expelled when humans burn so-called fossil fuels."" (September 21, 2011)6. On the gender pay gap7. On women in combat""There's a reason why no woman has ever won our nation's highest award for valor. The Medal of Honor recognizes a willingness to charge toward danger, to seek out and remove a threat, while everyone else is running away."" (August 26, 2015)8. On globalism and foreign aid""It should be clear that teaching Americans we are now part of a global economy and teaching schoolchildren they are citizens of the world is a deceitful message to con us into a plan to add the poor countries around the Earth to our list of welfare handout recipients."" (November 20, 2013)9. On multiculturalism and diversity""The United States is the world's most stunning example of a nation that has peaceably and successfully assimilated people from many disparate cultures. So why are some people trying to separate us into factions, emphasizing what divides us instead of what unites us?"" (December 14, 1995)10.

What's behind Iran's provocations in the Persian GulfLess than two weeks ago, US naval ships in the northern Persian Gulf were harassed by an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessel, which came within 200 yards of the US ships. Following standard maritime procedures, the USS Squall fired three warning shots to ensure the Iranians understood they needed to leave the immediate area.US Army Gen. Joseph Votel, Commander of US Central Command, last week called the Iranian conduct ""concerning."" Navy report: Failure at every level for US ships captured by Iran""In recent days, we have witnessed even more provocative activity by the IRGC and Navy vessels. That type of behavior is very concerning, and we hope to see Iran's naval forces act in a more professional manner,"" he said. Votel believes the ""unsafe, unprofessional"" behavior is an attempt by Iran to ""exert their influence and authority in the region."""	Iran escalates high seas harassment of US Navy

And it may suggest that foreign leaders are now just as interested in who will sit in the Oval Office next as they are in Obama as he heads for the exit.Obama is not only confronting regimes in Russia, China and North Korea that are at times openly hostile to Washington -- or at least willing to make clear they don't want to play by its rules -- but over the long weekend, he got headaches from allies as well, notably Turkey and the Philippines.""Who is he?,"" the fiery new President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, asked Monday at a news conference, referring to Obama. The Southeast Asian leader warned he would lash out if the US President raised extrajudicial killings in the Philippines' new war on drugs in an anticipated meeting in Laos.""I am a president of a sovereign state. And we have long ceased to be a colony of the United States,"" Duterte continued. ""Son of a b****, I will swear at you.""RELATED: Duterte's gay slur strains close US-Filipino tiesIt was a stunning show of disrespect for an American president. And though Obama shrugged off the comments from the ""colorful"" leader during his own news conference Monday, the White House later canceled his meeting with Duterte, conferring instead with the President of South Korea. Duterte later apologized for any offense caused. Asian troublesDuterte is not the first erratic president of the Philippines, but his unpredictability and willingness to fan latent colonial resentment against the US represents an unwanted disruption for the White House at the end of Obama's tenure. It comes in a regional cauldron where Beijing is making aggressive moves in the South China Sea and Southeast Asian nations are increasingly important to US efforts to rein in the rising power.Obama had hoped to spend his final journey to Asia as president talking up the highlights of his pivot to the region. The fact sheet the White House put out at the conclusion of the G20 touted the economic progress under the eight years of the Obama presidency. And in one key outcome of the summit, he and Chinese President Xi Jinping formally agreed that both their nations would join the Paris Climate Agreement committing to cutting carbon emissions.But that bright spot aside, his trip to China has offered reminders that since Obama took office in 2009 -- and especially since Xi emerged as a nationalist leader after taking office in 2012 -- Sino-US relations have worsened.RELATED: Obama has 'blunt' meeting with Putin At the start of his trip, a logistical spat over missing airline airplane stairs needed for Obama to reach the red carpet at Hangzhou airport and verbal altercations between US and Chinese officials grabbed headlines. At one point, a White House official warned a Chinese counterpart against restricting access of pool reporters under the wing of Air Force One, noting that it was, after all, a US plane. ""This is our country,"" the man yelled back.Obama shrugged off that incident, too, acknowledging that disagreements over press access often arise with China but contending that they were not emblematic of the US-China relationship.The Republican hoping to succeed Obama, however, took a much dimmer view of the episode.""Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac!"" Donald Trump tweeted.Beijing said that an ""unprofessional"" American press had ""hyped"" up the incident. ""China has warmly and friendly welcomed all the leaders who are attending the G20 summit, why would we cause problems to the American delegations on purpose?"" said Hua Chunying, China's foreign ministry spokesperson.Either way, the flap served as a symbol of the tensions over issues of sovereignty that can occur between an ascending authoritarian state and an established democratic superpower used to getting its own way -- clashes that some analysts fear could play out on a geopolitical stage in years to come.Frosty tiesAnother country that has expanded its power base by thumbing its nose at the United States -- Russia -- also grabbed the spotlight during the G20 summit. Obama and President Vladimir Putin were pictured on Monday locked in an unfriendly stare, clearly with little love lost between them.""Typically, the tone of our meetings are candid, blunt, businesslike -- and this one was no different,"" was how Obama described it to reporters.He referred to ""gaps of trust"" over Syria, warned that the US has ""more capacity"" both ""offensively and defensively"" when it comes to cyber espionage and stressed that the US has no intention of easing sanctions against Russia over its action in Ukraine.The tough talks were a reminder that the ""reset"" of Russia relations that Obama pioneered at the start of his administration is now but a memory, while Putin has also taken advantage of chaos in the Middle East to reinstate Russian influence with Syria and Iran.Turkish tensionsObama also invested significant first-term political capital in improving relations with another foreign leader he met at the G20 -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey -- with whom tensions were on display in their joint appearance.Even though Obama bemoaned the ""terrible attempted coup"" that failed to topple Erdogan in July, the Turkish President did not shy away from raising differences with the US in front of the press.""All forms of terrorism are bad. All forms of terrorism are evil,"" Erdogan said, then mentioned the names of a Kurdish group with which the US is allied in Syria but is regarded by Ankara as a terrorist organization.As he headed to Laos, Obama professed to being undeterred by the unpredictable unfriendly international environment at the end of his presidency.""I think we all to have recognize these are turbulent times. A lot of countries are seeing volatile politics,"" he said at his news conference. ""But then when you look back over the course of eight years, actually you find out things have gotten better.""I tell my staff when they feel worn out sometimes that better is always good,"" he added. ""It may not be everything that needs to get done, but if it's better than before we started, we'll take it."""	Obama at G20: President suffers slings and arrows of restive world
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/05/politics/donald-trump-immigration-legal-status/index.html	"The Republican nominee vowed last week during a major speech in Phoenix that undocumented immigrants seeking legal status would ""have one route and one route only: to return home and apply for reentry like everybody else.""But asked Monday aboard his plane whether he could rule out a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, Trump declined.""I'm not ruling out anything,"" Trump said. ""We're going to make that decision into the future. OK?""Trump's answers came as reporters repeatedly pressed the Republican nominee over his position on providing a pathway to legal status to some undocumented immigrants living in the US.But the apparent shift only further muddled Trump's position on immigration, less than a week after Trump's speech in Phoenix, which aimed to clarify Trump's stance on a core issue in his presidential campaign.In the week before that speech, Trump suggested he was ""softening"" his stance and would be open to a pathway to legal status for non-criminal undocumented immigrants -- before shifting away from that days later.Trump reaffirmed in his immigration speech last week that no undocumented immigrants could hope to obtain legal status under his administration without first leaving the US, but did not say outright that he would deport all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.Trump's latest repositioning Monday on the question of legal status came one day after key campaign surrogates and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, gave conflicting answers about whether the nominee's immigration plan still includes mass deportations. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump has moved away from that idea, while Pence and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway were coy about specifics of the immigration proposal.Trump on Monday again stressed that those seeking citizenship would have to first leave the country -- a bar he had previously set for both acquiring citizenship and legal status.""To become a citizen, you're going to have to go out and come back in through the process. You're going to have to get on line. This isn't touchback. This is you have to go out, and you have to get in line and you have to come back in to become a citizen.""While Trump said unequivocally in his immigration address last week that undocumented immigrants could not obtain legal status without leaving the US, he did not reissue his call for deporting all undocumented immigrants.Instead, Trump focused on the need to secure the border and deport undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes in the US and those who have overstayed their visas, and left the door open to reexamining the cases of the remaining millions of undocumented immigrants.""Then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain,"" Trump said. ""That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.""Trump allowed a small pool of reporters and photographers to join him aboard his private plane Monday between campaign stops in Ohio -- a first, which came on the same day Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton took her inaugural flight on a plane with her entire traveling press corps. The rest of Trump's traveling press corps continued to fly on a separate plane on Monday.Trump said Monday aboard his plane that he was open to regularly allowing a pool of reporters to travel on his aircraft going forward."

""Who does he think he is? I am no American puppet. I am the president of a sovereign country and I am not answerable to anyone except the Filipino people,"" Duterte scoffed in a speech Monday. ""Son of a bitch, I will swear at you.""A statement from Duterte's office Tuesday claimed the ""son of the bitch"" insult was aimed at the journalist whose question prompted the fiery response, and not at Obama. Obama has worked hard to develop the Philippines' partnership with the US and as a regional counterbalance to China. He's visited the country twice in his second term, and announced on a stop there in November the return of a US military presence at a critical naval base on the South China Sea.But Duterte's derogatory comments and a spike in extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers put the relationship in stormier waters.Obama and Duterte had been set to meet in Laos this week, where Obama is attending a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders. The statement from Duterte's spokesman said the ""meeting has been mutually agreed upon to be moved to a later date.""Read more: Who is Rodrigo Duterte? From 'Punisher' to Philippines PresidentObama instead met Tuesday with President Park Geun-hye of South Korea. In his speech Monday, Duterte also blamed the United States for causing the unrest on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao. ""As a matter of fact, we inherited this problem from the United States,"" he said. ""Why? Because they invaded this country and made us their subjugated people. Everybody has a terrible record of extrajudicial killing. Why make an issue about fighting crime?""Duterte was referring to the US's history as a colonial power in the Philippines, and specifically to one infamous massacre in the southern Philippines -- the 1906 Battle of Bud Dajo -- in which hundreds of Filipinos, including women and children, were killed.""How many died? Six hundred,"" Duterte said Monday. ""If (Obama) can answer that question and give the apology, I will answer him.""Obama indicated Monday he was wary of meeting with Duterte, suggesting the bombast could prevent making substantial progress between the two nations.""I always want to make sure if I'm having a meeting that it's productive and we're getting something done,"" Obama said during a news conference. ""If and when we have a meeting, this is something that is going to be brought up,"" Obama said, referring to the Philippines' controversial record of combating drug crime since Duterte took office earlier this year.Later, on Monday afternoon, the White House announced the meeting was canceled.The Philippines war on drugs Since Duterte was elected, more than 1,900 people have died, including at least 700 in police operations that were part of the President's hard-line war on drugs.""Double your efforts. Triple them, if need be. We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier, and the last pusher have surrendered or [been] put behind bars -- or below the ground, if they so wish,"" Duterte said during his State of the Nation speech on July 25.Read more: Duterte's crackdown -- 6 stories from the front linesDespite the bullish tone, a government spokesman insisted the Duterte administration is against any form of extrajudicial killings.""We do not condone these acts,"" Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar said.""(The) government is here to save our people from the drug menace and punish the offenders, including the big-time ones.

""It is stunning that we are facing this and especially from a foreign power that has the capacity, with the consensus is that they have used, to extract information and to enable that information to be made public.""'Strong evidence'US intelligence officials say there is strong evidence showing Russian intelligence behind hacks into the DNC and attempted hacks into other Democratic organizations.Clinton said it was ""interesting that this activity has happened around the time Trump became the nominee"" and said the Republican nominee's ties to Putin -- including glowing statements -- ""raises even more serious questions about Trump.""""Look, he very early on allied himself with Putin's policies,"" Clinton added. ""He seems to have this bizarre attraction to dictators, including Putin.""On the Russian president, Clinton said it was ""very clear [Putin] is quite satisfied with himself"" for the intrusions.While speaking to the American Legion, a veterans' organization, last month, Clinton said she would treat cyber attacks ""just like any other attack"" and would ""be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.""Email serverClinton started flying with her campaign press corps on Monday, debuting a Boeing 737 plane for the next 63 days of the campaign. In flight, Clinton headed to the back of the plane and took over a dozen questions from reporters. This is the first time Clinton took questions from her traveling press corps since Ashland, Ohio on July 31.During the question and answer, Clinton responded FBI notes on her interview with the investigative body and denied that she knew anything about aides wiping her server with a sophisticated program known as BleachBit.""I don't know anything about that,"" Clinton said. ""That was not something I was aware of and I think the fact point out that there was no connection. It wasn't something, as far as I understand, that was related.""Clinton's conversation with reporters was cut shot during her flight because she had a fit of coughs while answering a question.

Kaepernick's protests have spurred outrage in certain quarters, with some, including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, calling for him to leave the country. Obama took a measured approach Monday, saying that members of the military, getting in harm's way for the flag and the country, could feel spurned by Kaepernick's protest, he is also glad that Kaepernick is speaking up.""As a general matter, when it comes to the flag the national anthem and the meaning that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who've fought for us -- that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are,"" he said. ""But I don't doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that need to be talked about and if nothing else what he's doing has generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about.""Obama continued, ""But I'd rather have young people engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than those who are just sitting on the sidelines."""
