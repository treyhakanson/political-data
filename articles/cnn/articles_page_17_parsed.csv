There are a certain set of enduring images, usually with Biden looking goofy and Obama looking slightly vexed, upon which these imaginary conversations are projected. (Wow, that was possibly the driest, most stodgy way to describe the concept of a meme ever. Forgiveness, please. It all falls apart if you think about it too much.)Humor is a powerful tool to remind the bereft that life is without inherent meaning and sometimes imagining the Vice President getting back at political opponents by farting a lot is the only way to answer to the void. Also, you know, there are only a limited number of days left to celebrate the eight-years-long bromance between the Leader of the Free World and his right hand man. Don't cry because it's (almost) over, Biden fans. Smile because it happened, or at least, you imagined it did. 	The 11 most soothing Joe Biden memes for a post-election America	['Obama']	[]

Ginsburg's future was on the minds of many in the audience during a meeting sponsored by The Jewish Federations. Donald Trump's unexpected victory at the polls means that if anything were to happen to the 83-year-old justice in the next few years, she might be replaced by a conservative. The moderator, lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, asked her what the election meant. Ginsburg, treading carefully, responded, ""most immediately a vacancy will be filled."" And then she repeated something she said even before the election when Senate Republicans blocked the nomination hearings of President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. ""Eight is not a good number for a multi-member court,"" she said. She also suggested perhaps the legislative branch get moving again. ""There is an existing vacancy and President Trump will fill it. Then, perhaps Congress will do some work. One reason the court has not had as many petitions as usual is that there hasn't been any legislative activity,"" Ginsburg said.Trump's election and actions by Senate Republicans will have a critical impact on the court, which will likely maintain its conservative majority for years to come. It will also mean that Ginsburg will remain in the minority on some social issues that closely divide the justices. Some liberals have questioned whether Ginsburg should have stepped down during the Obama administration. In 2014, Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, suggested in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times that she step down in order to ""advance all the things she has spent her life working for."" But she did not heed that advice. And now, the liberal icon who has inspired generations of young lawyers for her early work on gender discrimination, will likely seek to stay on the bench at least until a Democratic president wins an election. That will keep her in the spotlight -- something she has dominated like no other sitting justice. On ""Saturday Night Live,"" for example, Ginsburg has been the subject of a recurring comedy sketch. Just last weekend actress Kate McKinnon, who plays the justice, joked about the fact that Ginsburg's plans might have suddenly changed. ""You're damn right I was gonna retire,"" McKinnon/Ginsburg said. She then proceeded to pour vitamins down her throat.  The real Justice Ginsburg, who is a devoted opera fan, had her own appearance Saturday night. She joined the opening night cast of ""The Daughter of the Regiment"" at the Washington National Opera, playing the Duchess of Krakenthorp in a non-speaking role. At the curtain call, she wore her costume -- a shimmering acid green dress -- and she curtsied. With a broad smile, she looked ready for an encore.

Even though Trump later called Obama a ""very good man"" and Obama said it was his aim to make sure Trump would be ""successful,"" there were frowns. Frowns all around. But, if perception is reality, it's also important to know there were, in fact, some light moments as the photos below show. Did these two pivotal figures in our nation's history get along for a spell? Was there a juncture of mutual understanding? We're not saying there are going to be any beer summits in this pair's future but, at the very least, they made an effort to smile."

""The US and China can achieve mutual benefits and win-win results. I would love to work with you to enhance the cooperation between US and China. I'm sure the Sino-US relations will achieve better development."" Confusion reigned over the weekend, when a translation error in Chinese media suggested the two had spoken, contradicting Trump, who said that he hadn't yet talked to Xi. Uncertainty aheadAs the results of last week's election dawned, Chinese residents grappled with the idea of a President Trump. ""We're surprised by the result,"" said a woman interviewed by CNN. ""I think the whole idea is bizarre,"" a man told CNN. ""Western democracy is too. It's chaotic.""Certainly, the abrasive candidate's campaign trail rhetoric left little room for diplomacy. ""We can't continue to allow China to rape our country,"" Trump said to supporters. ""It's the greatest theft in the history of the world."" Annually there is $650 billion annually in trade between the two countries, although Trump may put some of that at risk -- he's proposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports, risking starting a trade war. In terms of foreign policy, Trump has largely shied away from giving his opinion on the South China Sea issue -- where the Asian giant has been building on existing reefs to advance territorial ambitions in the region. Some analysts say that the incoming leader's inward focus might present an opportunity to consolidate these gains. "	China's Xi and Donald Trump speak following upset election win	['Trump']	[]
4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/13/politics/donald-trump-60-minutes-first-interview/index.html	"""I am so saddened to hear that,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"" when she said Latinos and Muslims are facing harassment. ""And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'""Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom Stahl said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign. Trump's election has left Democrats angry and many minorities fearful about the future.Yet Trump also criticized the protests that have broken out in cities across the United States since his defeat of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. Trump said he's seen ""a very small amount"" -- including ""one or two instances"" -- of racial slurs being directed at minorities, particularly in largely white schools, since his election. ""I would say don't do it, that's terrible, because I'm going to bring this country together,"" Trump said. Richard Cohen, President of the Southern Poverty Law Canter told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday that there have been more that 300 incidents that their organization has recorded. ""He needs to take a little bit more responsibility for what's happening,"" Cohen said. As for anti-Trump protests, Trump said, ""I think it's horrible if that's happening. I think it's built up by the press because, frankly, they'll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could've been there before. If I weren't even around doing this, and they'll make into an event because that's the way the press is.""Here are seven topics Trump addressed the interview:FBI reviewIn the wide-ranging interview Trump also said he's still deciding whether to ask FBI Director James Comey for his resignation. Trump demurred when asked about his plans for Comey -- whose decision to end the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server was widely panned by Republicans. ""I think that I would rather not comment on that yet,"" Trump said. ""I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. ... There's been a lot of leaking, there's no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him.""Clinton to donors: FBI letters were double whammy to campaignHe admitted he isn't sure about Comey's future. ""I'd want to see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did,"" Trump said. Comey has more than six years to go in his ten-year term.Trump also balked when asked whether he'd carry out his campaign pledge to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. He said Clinton ""did some bad things"" and that he's ""going to think about it"" -- but that he is more eager to focus on health care, immigration and other policy matters. ""I don't want to hurt them,"" Trump said of the Clintons, noting he'd spoken to both Hillary and Bill Clinton since his victory. ""They're good people. I don't want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do '60 Minutes' together,'"" he said. Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's late-campaign season disclosures as a reason for her loss. The former secretary of state told donors in a conference call Saturday that Comey delivered a double whammy to her candidacy in the final days of the campaign by taking another look at emails related to Clinton's private server before abruptly saying he found no wrongdoing.In the interview, Trump also discussed lobbyists' role in his transition, his distaste for the Electoral College and the future of the Trump business brand. And he waded into how abortion and gun rights would be affected by his Supreme Court nominations.Same-sex marriage and abortionTrump said he's ""fine"" with same-sex marriage remaining legal across the country, and wouldn't appoint Supreme Court judges with the goal of reversing that ruling. ""It's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it's done,"" Trump said. He added: ""These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled. And I'm -- I'm fine with that.""Trump also pledged to appoint judges who oppose abortion rights and oppose restrictions on Second Amendment gun rights. If Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, were overturned, Trump said, decisions on whether to legalize or ban abortion would return to states. Women seeking abortions whose state has banned them will ""perhaps have to go -- they'll have to go to another state,"" Trump said. ""We'll see what happens. It's got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go,"" he said. Deporting undocumented immigrants who have committed crimesTrump did not repeat his campaign promise to deport all undocumented immigrants, pledging to focus first on deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in the United States.""What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,"" he said. ""We have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate.""He said he still plans to build a US-Mexico border wall. ""After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people,"" he said.House Speaker Paul Ryan said Sunday that despite Trump's campaign rhetoric, lawmakers were not about to form a deportation force to round-up and deport undocumented immigrants. The focus was on securing the border instead, he told CNN.Ryan: 'We are not planning on erecting a deportation force'Draining the swampTrump's rallying cry on the campaign trail was that he'd ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. But so far, Trump's transition team is filled with the usual suspects -- lobbyists and longtime Washington hands. Trump didn't chafe at that characterization of his transition team. ""Everybody's a lobbyist down there,"" he said, referring to Washington. ""That's the problem with the system -- the system. Right now, we're going to clean it up. We're having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits. We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist,"" Trump said. He said relying on those lobbyists now while planning to eliminate them later is no contradiction. ""I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out,"" Trump said. Fighting ISISTrump stuck by his often-mocked claim that he knows more than American generals about fighting ISIS -- despite having no experience in government, the military or elected office before winning Tuesday's presidential contest. Asked if he still feels he knows more, Trump said: ""I'll be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job they've done. OK, look at the job they've done. They haven't done the job. ""Now, maybe it's leadership, maybe it's something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is we're going to get rid of ISIS.""Iraqi forces retake ancient Assyrian village of Nimrud from ISISDitching the Electoral CollegeTrump won more electoral votes than Clinton -- but he didn't win the popular vote. Still, he says, he favors ditching the Electoral College and handing the presidency to the winner of the popular vote. ""I'm not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. you know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There's a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play,"" Trump said. On the Trump brandTrump and his children both said they're not sweating any negative impact on their family's businesses resulting from a long and contentious campaign -- or from backlash to the President-elect. ""I don't think it matters. This is so much more important, and more serious,"" Ivanka Trump said. Her father added, ""I think what Ivanka's trying to say, 'Who cares? Who cares?' This is big league stuff. ... We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing."" Trump isn't putting his family's business in a blind trust -- leaving it to his children instead -- but does plan to turn down the salary typically paid to presidents. ""I've never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I'll take $1 a year. But it's a -- I don't even know what it is,"" Trump said, before turning to Stahl and asking, ""Do you know what the salary is?"" When Stahl told Trump it is $400,000 per year, he said, ""No, I'm not going to take the salary. I'm not taking it.""Trump also signaled he has no real plans to change his tone -- even though it's seen by many as evidence of a man too combustible for the presidency. ""Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated,"" Trump said. ""I don't want to be just a little nice monotone character, and in many cases I will be."""

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/obama-trip-greece-germany-peru/index.html	"Now, as he embarks upon his final scheduled overseas trip as President, Obama faces an altogether different scenario: Trump is his successor, and instead of a cheering farewell tour, he's embarking upon a reassurance mission for deeply shaken foreign allies.At stops in Greece, Germany and Peru, Obama will be left explaining the US election results to foreign counterparts whose anxieties about Trump he's been fueling for more than a year by denouncing Trump from podiums across the globe. Obama must now convince foreign governments and populations that the future isn't as bleak as he once predicted.Air Force One touched down at the Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport in Athens just past 3:30 a.m. ET (10:30 a.m. local) on Tuesday. Obama was met with a red carpet and military pageantry before meeting with the Greek President and Prime Minister later in the day.Speaking from the White House briefing room before he departed, an upbeat Obama insisted that he would deliver a message of confidence in the future of transatlantic ties during his talks this week.""There is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue,"" Obama said, describing Trump as having ""expressed a great interest in maintaining our strategic relationships.""In fact, he claimed that the President-elect had voiced a change in viewpoint during their Oval Office meeting last week on a key multinational issue.""One of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance,"" Obama said. ""One of the most important functions I can serve at this stage during this trip is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States. And they're vital for the world.""Trump, Putin speak about future of US-Russia tiesAides said Obama would confront the election results directly in public remarks and in private conversations with leaders as the core aspects of his foreign policy legacy now appear in question.Indeed, with right-wing nationalist movements gaining steam in capitals across Europe and the world, Obama faces the daunting task of plotting a way forward with a liberal alliance that now appears more fractured than ever.But Obama will also stress his view that Trump must be given every chance to succeed when he assumes office in January, a message Obama voiced in the Rose Garden the day following the election and again during his meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday.""This office is bigger than any one person and that's why ensuring a smooth transition is so important,"" Obama told journalists at the White House.That will not be an easy message to relay in Europe, where leaders were worried merely at the bombastic rhetoric on the campaign trail, let alone the prospects of Trump in the White House. The President-elect has repeatedly questioned core transatlantic and transpacific principles, including suggesting the US would no longer provide a defense umbrella for Japan and South Korea as well as expressing skepticism toward NATO.Trump has vowed to unravel nearly every aspect of Obama's foreign policy, decrying what he says are bad trade deals, leaving pending agreements with Pacific nations and the European Union virtually dead. And he's promised to scrap key multilateral accords that formed large parts of Obama's foreign agenda, including a deal reached in Paris last year to reduce global carbon emissions and the pact with Iran to curtail its nuclear ambitions.""The whole trip was designed to give Europe a boost of self-confidence because Europe was increasingly worried about the nature of the US presidential campaign, the tone and tenor coming from then-candidate Donald Trump,"" said Heather Conley, senior vice president for Europe at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.""Now the President has the unenviable task of ... explaining what Europeans are now coining the 'Trump effect,'"" Conley went on, noting the heavy slate of elections and referenda across Europe in the coming year that liberal leaders worry now tilt toward nationalist views in the wake of Trump's victory.""They are very worried, because the same populist, nationalist expressions, whether that's on immigration, whether that is on free trade, have certainly running very strong political currents within Europe,"" she said.What Donald Trump has said about the worldAt his first stop in Athens, Obama plans to tour the Parthenon and meet with Greece's left-leaning Prime Minister as the country continues to work through its debt crisis. The pair are also likely to discuss the ongoing refugee crisis, which has resulted in massive waves of migrants fleeing Syria's civil war arriving on Greece's shores.Obama also plans to deliver a major address about democracy, using its ancient birthplace to argue for the enduring values of open and free societies. Aides said he'll confront last week's election results directly, as well as the vote in the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union, linking the two as evidence that the benefits of globalization haven't yet reached everyone.But he'll also provide a rebuttal against arguments for a more walled-off continent, insisting Europe works better as a joint power.""I believe that European integration is one of the greatest political and economic achievements of modern times, with benefits for EU members, the United States and the entire world,"" Obama said in an interview with the Athens newspaper Kathimerini before he arrived Tuesday. ""Europe is our largest economic partner, and we have a profound economic interest in a Europe that is stable and growing.""In Germany, Obama huddles with Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he described during Monday's news conference as ""probably ... my closest international partner these past eight years.""In the aftermath of Trump's win, Merkel's leadership role in the West has suddenly intensified, leaving her as the most stalwart voice for the type of open and globalized society Obama has backed after he leaves office.He'll also meet with the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Italy, and ""signal our solidarity with our closest allies and express our support for a strong, integrated, and united Europe.""Merkel finds herself in a stronger position than other US allies in Europe, including France's Francois Hollande, who is deeply unpopular and faces powerful right-wing forces; Italy's Matteo Renzi, who has expended political capital on proposed constitutional reforms that face a referendum vote next month; and the United Kingdom's Theresa May, who is occupied with navigating Britain's exit from the EU.But even Merkel is facing a backlash from the right over her policy on refugees. There's little expectation that Trump will provide her the same political backing Obama has as she attempts to map Europe's future.""We must adjust to the fact that US foreign policy will be less predictable, at least for a considerable time,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Der Spiegel this week. ""It is to be hoped that in government, not everything is eaten so hot as it was cooked in the election campaign. But the expectations that have been aroused in the American population are huge.""Obama ends his swing in Peru for a meeting of Pacific leaders, his final attempt to cement his eastward shift in foreign policy focus, even as a centerpiece of that plan -- the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal -- appears dead.He'll meet for a final time with China's President Xi Jinping as ties between Washington and Beijing enter a deeply uncertain phase. Trump has threatened a more pugilistic approach, vowing to brand China a currency manipulator during his first 100 days in office."

The appointment of Bannon, the brains behind the far-right Breitbart News outlet, has been criticized because of Bannon's connections to the alt-right movement, which has promoted ideology steeped in white nationalism, misogyny and anti-Semitism. His polarizing persona is a stark contrast to the message of unity that Trump's team has been promoting since the business mogul defeated Hillary Clinton last week to win the US presidency.Miller said that recent media coverage has been ""irresponsible"" and that positive aspects of Trump's victory are not getting as much attention.Cuomo countered that even though Trump won, the country remains divided. He wondered aloud how the Bannon hire could be perceived as a nod toward unity. Miller responded that Cuomo was focused on trying to create further division.""Not fair. You put Bannon in position, not me,"" Cuomo said. ""He is seen as the architect of a very effective strategy that Donald Trump used during the election, which you guys now say needs to be left behind. But you're bringing the architect of it with you.""Miller said that Bannon did a fantastic job of helping Trump implement his vision, and added that he will be working ""hand in glove"" with Reince Priebus, Trump's pick as White House chief of staff and a less controversial choice.""We're talking about President-elect Donald Trump,"" Miller said.

""I think we didn't do a very good job of engaging communities that were going to be at risk, who have been targeted.""Those who grew up with an African-American president, he said, ""made assumptions about the character of this nation"" that ""have been proved false.""""With protest, there has to come activism,"" he added.""We've got a lot of work to do in America to become the kind of society that we claim to be,"" Stevenson told CNN.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/tpp-trade-deal-trump-obama-trip/index.html	"The timing is particularly delicate for Obama, who travels to Europe and then Peru this week in a final foreign trip capped by a conference of the very foreign leaders who negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Obama is fulfilling the commitment he made at the start of his presidency to attend the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, a demonstration of his commitment to ""pivot"" US policy toward Asia -- of which the TPP is the embodiment of his economic efforts.The initiative to shore up US influence and secure job-creating economic ties with Pacific countries was painstakingly negotiated over several years with 11 other countries together comprising 40% of the world economy. The implications of its demise for US standing in Asia and its allies there could be profound.RELATED: Congressional leaders say TPP is deadProponents saw the TPP as a multifaceted agreement knitting the US into the world's fastest-growing economies while setting US standards for trade, labor and the environment. It also served strategic and security goals of strengthening alliances against China's regional ambitions and North Korea's burgeoning nuclear program. Those broad ambitions ran aground against the populist, anti-trade sentiment that swept the US election campaign amongst both Democrats like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Republicans.Trump's hostility to trade deals -- a pillar of US engagement with Asia -- and his campaign proposals to change longstanding alliances there had already unnerved the region. Now, the TPP's dire prospects will further deepen questions about America's long-term commitment to Asia and reduce its economic clout there, Asian leaders and analysts said.""For America's friends and partners, ratifying TPP is a litmus test of your credibility and seriousness of purpose,"" said Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during a visit to Washington this month.Trump was clear about his stance on the pact. He offered more detail about his anti-trade stance during the campaign than almost any other issue, calling the TPP ""another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country.""Many Asian nations fear living in a region dominated by China and see America's presence as a counterbalance to Beijing's rising power. But without the deal, Lee and others have warned that US economic influence in the region is at risk of eroding and -- without a counterbalance -- China's power will only increase.""Asian countries want America to be engaged,"" Lee said. ""But we need to know that this engagement will be sustained, we need to know that agreements will be upheld, and that Asia can depend on America.""As a result, Trump's campaign suggestions that the US scale back the Asian security umbrella it's had in place since World War II and that South Korea and Japan do more to defend themselves rattled those allies badly. Michael Green, a former top adviser on Asia to President George W. Bush, said Trump's comments about security ties were more worrying to Asian nations that his anti-TPP stance. The remarks ""were so unnerving"" that Asian allies ""are just focusing on trying to establish some kind of broad normalcy and locking in commitments to the basics of the relationship,"" Green said.The TPP also had security aims. Secretary of State John Kerry has issued warnings about the strategic fallout of abandoning TPP, calling the deal ""a key way to gauge American engagement in the Asia Pacific"" and warning of the ""serious consequences"" of rejecting it in terms of American security, values and leadership.RELATED: America's Brexit: What Trump means for world tradeRejecting TPP ""would be a gigantic self-inflicted wound on our nation,"" he said in October at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.The US needs close Asian partnerships to face what might be its most serious threat in the coming years: North Korea's steadily progressing nuclear weapons program. Close cooperation between the US and its Asian allies will also be important to deal with China's increasingly aggressive claims to disputed territory in the South China Sea.Those alliances would be damaged ""by us turning our back on an agreement already reached prompted and promoted by us, led by us, which we then turn around and reverse and say, 'sorry, we didn't mean what we said,' "" Kerry said.Just a little more than a year ago, that argument was part of what boosted Obama's effort to get the trade deal through Congress. But popular sentiment has been moving against trade deals, with even Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton opposing the TPP despite praising it as secretary of state.Trump in particular struck a chord with his anti-trade rhetoric. The states that pushed him over the top to victory -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina -- have all been upended by trade competition, and voters there believe that trade has cost them their jobs.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters last week the Senate would not act on the trade deal during the lame-duck session of Congress. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said the GOP does not have the votes to pass it in the House. And Sen. Chuck Schumer, who will become the chamber's top Democrat in January, told labor leaders Thursday the deal would not be ratified, according to a source familiar with his remarks.Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy US trade representative and key negotiator of the deal, said that beyond the damage to US leadership, there are economic costs to cancelling the pact.With the vast number of consumers who buy US goods live outside the country, she said, ripping up trade deals with five of the fastest growing nations in the world doesn't help generate growth or create jobs at home.""Globalization is here to stay,"" said Cutler, who now runs the Asia Society Policy Institute's Washington office, speaking at a discussion hosted by Georgetown University Thursday. ""No one can stop it.""Cutler hopes that Trump will come to realize the benefits TPP would bring both to the US economy and US power once he assumes office.""It's easy on the campaign trail to criticize the achievements of the previous administration,"" she said. ""But once you're in the White House, what seemed to be a black-and-white issue is now very complicated.""Green, the former Bush adviser, noted that Trump's frequent refrain on the campaign trail was not that that he opposed trade but that he would negotiate better deals. Given that, Green believes there could be hope for Trump to renegotiate the deal down the road, given the number of people in his party who are pro-trade.""I think TPP is in a deep sleep,"" Green said, ""but I don't think it's dead."""

""Bannon, who obviously helped drive the strategy and the political positioning of Mr. Trump during the election is very controversial as you've said, but somebody who obviously the President-elect has great faith in,"" Daley told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" ""So there's a conflict to the outside world. I don't think the inside the world, the Trump world, views this as much of a conflict. I think it's exactly where President-elect Trump is and that is he's got two competing forces that he wants to compete and that may be a good thing for his presidency.""RELATED: Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Bannon's selection as chief strategist -- a role complementary to Priebus new job as White House chief of staff -- has sparked outcry from people who have noted his website, Breitbart.com, has used racist and bigoted language throughout the campaign. Bannon is largely credited with supporting Trump's combative style at a time in the campaign when other aides wanted him to stay on script.  ""Much of the campaign after Mr. Bannon came in was very reflective (of his style) -- the aggressiveness on so many issues, the allowing of social media to get a little out of hand,"" Daley said. In one instance, Trump drew heat after blasting former Miss Universe in a series of late-night tweets. But Trump has promised to be more conciliatory since winning the White House and, in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" called on his supporters to not use racist language. ""Mr. Bannon took this campaign and took a certain tack and it worked, I get that, it worked. So therefore you can celebrate that. But the fact is, that may make -- if that's translated on a constant basis in Washington -- fighting not only his opponents, but his own expected allies in a very aggressive and sometimes controversial, very controversial way and also offending much of America,"" Daley said. ""And that's the struggle that I think President-elect Trump's going to have to manage."""	Former WH aide Bill Daley cautions against Bannon-backed strife	['Trump', 'Cuomo']	[]
