Michele Bachmann insinuated on Saturday morning that the Clinton campaign was behind leaking the decade-old audio recording of Donald Trump spewing vulgarities about women. ""I think what we've been hearing last Friday night is actually pretty predictable. The Clinton campaign had to change the conversation because she had a lot of really bad news this week,"" Bachmann said on CNN Saturday morning.""And so this 11-year-old bad boy locker room talk, this is how she wanted to do it. She's trying to tell the media what she wants them to focus on; the questions she wants Anderson Cooper and the people in the room to ask her on Sunday night."" Ahead of the second presidential debate that is scheduled to air Sunday evening, Bachmann appears to be standing behind the GOP presidential nominee despite the crude remarks that were uncovered by Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold.The Clinton campaign did not respond to a CNN request for comment. CNN's Brian Stelter reported that sources with NBC thought someone from inside NBC downloaded the footage from one of the network's video servers. Although Fahrenthold is aware of the identity of the source, he is granting the individual anonymity as per requested, according to The Washington Post. The audio is from unaired footage of ""Access Hollywood"" and catches a candid moment of Trump with a hot mic. Trump, while on a bus with Tv personality Billy Bush, divulges a story about attempting to ""fuck"" a married woman and later goes onto boast about groping women because of his ""star"" status.    ""I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. I just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy,"" Trump can be heard saying in the audio.When Bachmann was pressed on how she felt about the comments from the perspective of being a woman and mother, the Minnesota Republican devoted her answer to instead slamming Clinton.  ""Nothing happens by accident from the Clinton campaign. This was absolutely a planned premeditated event to drive the conversation,"" Bachmann said.

Mike Pence, said he was ""offended"" by Trump's remarks and canceled plans to represent him at a political event on Saturday. Trump apologizes for sexually aggressive remarksThe third-most powerful Senate Republican, John Thune, a member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's inner circle, called on Trump to ""withdraw"" and let Pence top the Republican ticket. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the party's 2008 nominee, announced he won't vote for Trump.Vice President Joe Biden condemned Trump on Twitter: ""The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. It's not lewd. It's sexual assault.""Even Trump's wife, Melania Trump, condemned the remarks, saying in a statement released by Trump's campaign, ""The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me.""This does not represent the man that I know,"" she added. ""He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.""'They can't make me quit'Donald Trump, however, was unwavering.""I'd never withdraw. I've never withdrawn in my life,"" Trump told The Washington Post Saturday morning. ""No, I'm not quitting. I have tremendous support.""He also told The Wall Street Journal there is ""zero chance I'll quit.""The comments suggested that Trump was eager to fully turn away from the lewd and sexually aggressive terms he used to describe women in the 2005 conversation and instead pivot toward his political opponents, whoever they may be.8 questions about the Donald Trump tape""They're not going to make me quit, and they can't make me quit,"" Trump told the Post.He later tweeted, ""The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly -  I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA""The interviews took place less than 24 hours after previously unaired footage surfaced of Trump bragging about being able to grope women and trying to have sex with a married woman during a 2005 taping for ""Access Hollywood.""Can Donald Trump recover from this?In that timespan, Republicans have quickly condemned Trump for the comment many of them have deemed ""inexcusable"" and ""indefensible,"" prompting Trump to issue his first-ever apology of his nearly 16-month campaign.But Trump also signaled a willingness to fight in the 90-second video statement he posted online just after midnight on Saturday, quickly turning from apologizing to attacking Clinton for her husband's sex scandals.But the apology did not quell the firestorm.Several Republicans, including Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, formally pulled their support of Trump on Saturday morning.And the Republican National Committee put a temporary pause on its mail operations aiding Trump's campaign in terms of messaging to assess the current situation and decide if they need to change their message on mailings and other get-out-the-vote operations, a top RNC official told CNN.Republican sources say one option under consideration is ending the joint fundraising agreement between the party and Trump's campaign so the RNC could focus its fundraising exclusively on critical down-ballot races and encourage donors who were opposed to Trump to continue to support the party.Another Republican source who deals with the joint effort between the campaign and the GOP told CNN it's also under consideration to do a more formal pivot to down-ballot races.Pence 'cannot defend' remarksAnd after a campaign source told CNN that Pence decided not to attend the Wisconsin political event hosted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, Pence released a statement explaining that he was ""offended"" by Trump's remarks. He also noted he is looking ""forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart"" at the debate on Sunday.Can Trump recover from this?""As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the 11-year-old video released yesterday,"" Pence said. ""I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people. We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.""""Wisconsin is off"" for Pence, a campaign source told CNN earlier Saturday, adding that the decision was made in the morning.The source gave no reason for the cancellation, but the Trump campaign had announced Friday evening that Pence would attend the event in Trump's stead after Ryan said he was ""sickened"" by Trump's comments and announced Trump would no longer attend the event.RNC official calls Trump remarks 'inexcusable,' 'reprehensible'Multiple sources told CNN that Trump was asked not to come by Ryan, and one source said the message was delivered via intermediaries.Ryan declined to discuss the controversy at the event Saturday, though he acknowledged ""there is a bit of an elephant in the room.""Trump and Pence spoke Saturday morning, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Another source said Pence told the GOP nominee that the only person who could effectively speak on the matter was Trump himself.Ready to fight backTrump indicated he will head into the debate prepared to fight Clinton by raising the marital infidelities of her husband former President Bill Clinton -- a shift since Trump said as recently as Thursday night he would not raise the issue in Sunday's debate.12 times Trump declared his 'respect' for womenThe real estate magnate spent the day at Trump Tower in New York doing some debate prep, at which former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was present, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.And Trump argued to the Post that he will be able to weather the comments that have come back to haunt him in part because Clinton, the Democratic nominee, is ""so bad"" and ""so flawed as a candidate.""""Running against her, I can't say it'd be the same if I ran against someone else, but running against her makes it a lot easier, that's for sure,"" Trump said in the Saturday morning interview.Trump also told both the Post and the Journal that he is considering delivering remarks Saturday evening to encourage his supporters and address the controversy.Republicans slam Trump â€” but slow to pull endorsementsAnd he also said of the 2005 comments that ""people get it. They get life.""Pressed a final time by the Post about the possibility he could quit the race, Trump firmly shut the door on that option.""Zero chance. I've never quit in my life,"" Trump said. ""I can give you my word that I'm never leaving."" "	Donald Trump: 'Zero chance I'll quit'	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Crapo', 'Ayotte', 'Paul']	[]

Mike Crapo, who is up for reelection, on Saturday became the first sitting Republican senator to back away from Trump following the incendiary comments. ""This is not a decision that I have reached lightly, but his pattern of behavior has left me no choice. His repeated actions and comments toward women have been disrespectful, profane and demeaning.""Soon after Crapo's announcement, Ayotte, who is also up for reelection, also said she would not vote for Trump. In August, Ayotte had said she would vote for Trump but not formally endorse him. She said Saturday she will instead be writing in Pence on Election Day.Arizona Sen. and former Republican Party nominee John McCain, who is up for reelection, said Trump's behavior ""make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.""Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared ""Enough!"" in a Facebook post, adding, ""Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw.""Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Trump has ""forfeited the right to be our party's nominee.""Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who had said after the Republican National Convention that she would not support Trump, reiterated her stance that she is ""still not voting for Hillary, and still plans to write in someone.""Alabama's Republican governor, Robert Bentley, said in a statement he ""cannot and will not vote for Donald Trump.""In the House, Alabama Rep. Martha Roby said Saturday she will not vote for him and that he should step aside. Roby is from a safe district and is often featuring in GOP family friendly initiatives.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman issued a statement Saturday night in which he pulled his support and said he would instead vote for Pence.Friday night, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz became the first sitting Republican congressman to pull his support for Trump in the wake of the 2005 video, which was surfaced by The Washington Post earlier in the day.Utah Gov. Gary Herbert on Friday became the first sitting Republican governor to withdraw his vote over the comments, which he called ""offensive and despicable.""Ignoring Trump going forwardHouse Speaker Paul Ryan told Republicans Monday he will no longer defend Trump -- and will instead use the next 29 days to focus on preserving his party's hold on Congress. ""The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities,"" Ryan's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said in a statement.Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Michigan, said in a statement Monday that Trump was neither his first nor second choice during the Republican primary, and going forward would stop answering questions about Trump. He said in the statement: ""Our families deserve a campaign that is focused on the issues, something our 2016 discussions are solely lacking this close to Election Day.""Sticking by TrumpMany Republicans, beginning on Friday night and into Saturday, slammed Trump over the remarks but either said he was preferable over Democrat Hillary Clinton or didn't address their support for him at all.Pence said he does not ""condone"" Trump's remarks and ""cannot defend them"" but is ""grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized.""Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, tweeted he is ""disgusted by Mr Trump's words"" and is ""profoundly disappointed by the race to the bottom this presidential campaign has become.""House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said ""there is absolutely no place"" for Trump's language in American society and that he ""must"" make a ""full and unqualified apology.""Top Trump surrogate Ben Carson said ""in no way do I condone Trump's behavior"" but said he was ""fairly certain"" progressives knew about Trump's 2005 remarks but waited until now to damage his candidacy.Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise said ""women deserve to be treated with respect. Period,"" and that Trump should make ""a direct apology."" Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, a rising star in the party, called Trump's remarks ""lewd and insulting.""Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul called Trump's comments ""offensive and unacceptable"" -- but a spokesman didn't respond when asked if Paul was still going to vote for Trump.Pence for presidentSeveral Republicans said Pence should lead the ticket.South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 3 Senate Republican and a member of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's inner circle, wants Trump to ""withdraw,"" saying, ""Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.""Nevada Rep. Joe Heck -- who is running for Democratic leader Harry Reid's Senate seat -- said Trump should ""step down and allow Republicans the opportunity to elect someone who will provide us with the strong leadership so desperately needed."" Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Virginia, said Trump's comments were ""disgusting, vile and disqualifying"" and called for Pence ""or another appropriate nominee"" to replace him.Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Missouri, wrote, ""I withdraw my endorsement and call for Governor Pence to take the lead so we can defeat Hillary Clinton.""Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner said if Trump wishes to defeat Clinton, he must ""step aside,"" adding, ""I will not vote for Donald Trump.""Utah Sen. Mike Lee posted a Facebook video asking Trump to step down: ""Your conduct, sir, is the distraction.""Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk tweeted that Trump should drop out and that Republican Party leaders should engage rules for an emergency replacement.South Dakota Gov.

Deb Fischer tweeted.A special category for Ted CruzFirst Ted Cruz made a big show of not endorsing Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention because Trump had insulted his wife and suggested his father helped kill JFK (not true). Then, Ted Cruz ultimately endorsed Trump, although not wholeheartedly. Now, a source close to Cruz confirms he is considering withdrawing that endorsement. But he has not yet.#NeverTrump digs inRepublicans who have opposed Trump for months were only too happy to once again declare their opposition to him.Former presidential candidate Jeb Bush said that ""no apology can excuse away Donald Trump's reprehensible comments degrading women.""Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Saturday made it clear he would not vote for Trump, adding, ""Nothing that has happened in the last 48 hours is surprising to me or many others.""Nebraska Sen.

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-nuclear-arsenal/index.html	"The 30-second ad, which is running on national cable TV and in six battleground states, according to a Clinton official, marks the campaign's most direct warning yet to voters that Trump is too erratic to be commander-in-chief and could endanger the country and the world's safety and security as president. It includes an image of a missile inside a silo as an alarm sounds in the background.The ad, entitled ""Silo,"" splices the first person testimonial of a former nuclear missile launch officer with comments Trump has made, including saying he wants to ""bomb the s--- out of"" ISIS, wanting to be ""unpredictable"" and declaring: ""I love war.""It was put together before The Washington Post published a bombshell story on stunningly demeaning comments Trump made about women in 2005.In the ad, former Air Force officer Bruce Blair, who is now an arms control scholar at Princeton University, reflects on his time as a launch officer controlling intercontinental ballistic missiles.""If the president gave the order we had to launch the missiles. That would be it. I prayed that call would never come,"" Blair says in the ad. ""Self control may be all that keeps these missiles from firing.""An alarm roars and a countdown clock then sounds revealing a missile in an apparent nuclear silo, before the ad pivots to footage of Trump:""I would bomb the s--- out of 'em,"" Trump says.""I want to be unpredictable.""""I love war,"" the Republican nominee says in a third clip.The ad then pivots back to Blair, who offers a final warning: ""The thought of Donald Trump with nuclear weapons scares me to death. It should scare everyone.""The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The ad will air in the battleground states of Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, in addition to time on national cable TV, a Clinton campaign official told CNN.The TV spot evoked the infamous ""Daisy"" ad President Lyndon Johnson ran against 1964 Republican nominee Barry Goldwater, which featured a little girl counting down petals on a daisy before a man's voice counts down to a nuclear explosion, featuring a mushroom cloud.The ad is also similar to the Clinton campaign's ""Just One"" ad the Clinton campaign aired in August which also warned that Trump was not stable enough to be president and included similar clips of Trump to those used in the latest ad.Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton super PAC, also ran an ad last month that included Trump's past comments about being willing to use nuclear weapons that finished on the message: ""Donald Trump. Dangerous. Unfit to be President."""	New Clinton ad questions Trump's fitness to command nuke arsenal	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""I never heard anything like this out of him. And so let me say, we're appointing a leader, we are electing a leader to the free world. We're not electing a Sunday school teacher.""But despite his misgivings, Lewandowski remained adamant that the American people still wanted ""a tough, brash, bold person"" in the White House.""Again, this private conversation obviously is troubling, but we want a leader who is going to lead America,"" Lewandowski said. ""And you know what, is that rough sometimes? It is. Is this defensible? Absolutely not. But what I do know is he's the person who's going to lead our country forward and we should think about what that true leadership looks like for the rest of the world.""Lewandowski denied that this latest furor would cause more Republicans to distance themselves from their party's standard-bearer because of the amount of money the businessman has raised for their campaign coffers.He also shrugged off concerns the controversy would hurt GOP candidates running in tough down-ballot races.""I think the American people know exactly who Donald Trump is,"" Lewandowski said. ""He is a person. And what has been such an attraction to Donald Trump is that he's not a career politician. He doesn't measure every word. He speaks from the heart. He speaks the way, you know many times people talk around their dining room table."""	Lewandowski on Trump: 'We're not electing a Sunday school teacher'	['Wolf', 'Trump']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/donald-trump-campaign-crisis/index.html	"Donald Trump's October Surprise is so explicit, shocking, offensive and vile that even he felt the need to apologize -- defiantly.In a video released after midnight Saturday, Trump expressed regret for stunning comments that surfaced Friday about women.""Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am,"" he said. ""I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize.""But that step -- unprecedented for a candidate loathe to ever admit a mistake -- may not be enough to rescue a campaign that is now in a full-fledged crisis. And Trump quickly attempted to pivot, criticizing Bill and Hillary Clinton in the video and suggesting he would take that argument to Sunday's debate.""Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims,"" Trump said. ""We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.""Trump's candidacy has revealed a long history of demeaning and shaming women. But the comments that emerged Friday go further than anything that has been attributed to him before as he seemed to bask in the power he felt his celebrity conferred to do whatever he wanted with women.The bombshell couldn't come at a worse time for Trump's campaign as he prepares for the next debate against Clinton. And Republicans must now decide whether to stand by him or cut him loose just 32 days before the election.The debate, co-moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper, is especially crucial because Trump botched his first match with Clinton â€” and then spent the next two weeks in a cycle of recrimination, denial and feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. The political uproar over the latest revelation was so momentous that it overtook coverage of a hurricane lashing Florida and a stunning US government accusation of a Russian hacking operation to disrupt the elections.It has been one of the cliches of the 2016 presidential race that Trump can get away with comments and outrages that would sink any normal politician. But the video tests the limits of that assumption in a way unlike any of Trump's many previous controversies.In a hot mic conversation first published by The Washington Post, Trump is seen and heard telling ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush in 2005 of how he tried to ""fuck"" a married woman.""I moved on her and I failed. I'll admit it,"" Trump said. ""I did try and fuck her. She was married.""""I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married,"" Trump adds, after saying he took the woman -- who is identified only by her first name -- out furniture shopping.""Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look,"" Trump says of the woman.Before Trump stepped off a bus, he and Bush appear to see a soap actress who greets them.""Whoa!"" Trump says. ""I've gotta use some tic tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.""""And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,"" Trump says.Huddling on a path forwardTrump advisers huddled in Trump Tower Friday night to plot a path forward. They clearly knew they had a problem on their hands when they moved quickly to release a statement that bizarrely blamed Bill Clinton after the Post published its story.""This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended,"" Trump said.There were signs that Trump's campaign was in disarray as some of his aides expressed exasperation in unusually blunt terms. ""It's appalling. It's just flat out appalling,"" a Trump adviser said.How the shocking hot mic tape of Donald Trump was exposedThe stunning developments are forcing a moment of reckoning for Republican Party leaders who have made a pact with a nominee many of them privately view as vulgar and unacceptable, and must now decide whether to cut him loose. Trump was due to appear alongside Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker â€” both pillars of the conservative movement â€” on Saturday. Ryan didn't withdraw his endorsement of Trump Friday but he did condemn the nominee and said Trump will no longer attend the event.""I am sickened by what I heard today,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests. In the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow's event in Wisconsin.""Every Republican office holder from GOP vice presidential pick Mike Pence â€” who often calls Trump ""this good man"" -- to vulnerable senators running for re-election will now face the same question: How can you stand with a nominee who would say such a thing?Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican running for re-election who stumbled this week over the question of whether Trump represented a good role model for children, quickly condemned Trump's statement.""His statements are totally inappropriate and offensive,"" Ayotte said.Sen. Pat Toomey, a vulnerable Pennsylvania Republican, tweeted that Trump's comments were ""outrageous and unacceptable.""Trump's possible implosion also appeared to validate the central theme of Clinton's campaign â€” that a man like Trump with a colorful personal past, a life lived in the tabloids and a runaway mouth is simply not fit to be president.Clinton and her top surrogates have been driving a narrative for months that the Republican nominee lacks the gravity, knowledge and character to sit in the Oval Office or to represent the United States overseas.Billy Bush under fire over vulgar Trump tapeIt was a case that appeared to be gaining traction given Trump's outspoken comments about Mexicans, women, Muslims and other sectors of society.Trump's most loyal supporters sought to shrug off the latest controversy.""We're not choosing a Sunday school teacher,"" Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager who is now a CNN contributor, told Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" ""We're electing a leader to the free world.""Crucial demographicsThe controversy is likely to hammer Trump's standing among crucial demographics who may decide the election on November 8.Trump had already busted established standards on rhetoric about women in this campaign, questioning last year after a tough debate whether moderator Megan Kelly was menstruating and having his words that some women were ""pigs"" and ""slobs"" thrown back at him by Clinton in the first debate.But the revelations in the hot mic moment will surely doom any hope the GOP nominee has of improving his standing among women voters, especially highly educated, suburban women in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania.Democrats seek to punish GOP Senate candidates over Trump audioDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, campaigning in Las Vegas, said Trump's comments ""makes me sick to my stomach.""Trump's aides across the country seemed to feel similarly.Asked about the reaction at a campaign field office, a Trump field staffer told CNN there were ""gasps. Collective gasps. We're trying to get our heads around it right now, but there's no way to spin this. There just isn't.""The staffer, who is also paying close attention to Senate efforts, also added, unsolicited: ""Just think of the down-ballot effect. Brutal.""A GOP operative in Ohio voiced similar sentiments.""This is bad. I think this thing is over,"" the staffer said."	Can Donald Trump recover from this?

That was no apology, that was an apology for getting caught.""Chaffetz, the House Oversight Committee chairman who led the Hill investigation into Clinton's email use while secretary of state, continued: ""So I'm not going to put my good name and reputation and my family behind Donald Trump when he acts like this, I just can't do it.""Trump bragged about trying to have sex with a married woman and being able to grope women in footage leaked from 2005 that surfaced on Friday.Among other lewd statements, Trump said, ""When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.""Trump later issued a brief apology, calling the conversation ""locker room banter.""Chaffetz disagreed.""This was not just locker talk -- this was offensive,"" he said. ""I can't tell the good people of Utah that I endorsed a person who acts like this.""Asked whether Trump could do anything to make it up to voters and the Republican Party, Chaffetz responded, ""I don't know.""Lemon repeatedly asked if Chaffetz thinks Trump should ""step aside.""""Well I do think (Trump's running mate) Mike Pence should be at the top of the ticket,"" he said. ""I really do ... he is a person of high moral fiber.""Chaffetz said he ""felt bad"" for the country, adding that ""everyone is going to have to figure this out"" for themselves."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/donald-trump-republicans-endorsement/index.html	"A day after the release of the lewd tape, House and Senate members rescinded their endorsement of Trump in increasing numbers -- and others were sure to follow. In the hours after The Washington Post published a vulgar video of Trump bragging about his ability to grope women as a benefit of his celebrity, Republicans were quick to condemn Trump, but slow to rescind their endorsement.That all changed Saturday morning as top Republicans in marquee Senate races, including New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Rep. Joe Heck of Nevada, said they could no longer support Trump.List: Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking by him?""I'm a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,"" Ayotte said in a statement, adding she would write Pence's name in on her ballot.""I believe our only option is to formally ask Mr. Trump to step down and allow Republicans the opportunity to elect someone who will provide us with the strong leadership so desperately needed and one that Americans deserve,"" Heck said, appearing with former GOP nominee Mitt Romney Saturday.Trump: 'Zero chance I'll quit'Arizona Sen. John McCain also withdrew his support for Trump. In addition to the vulgar comments that surfaced Friday, McCain also cited Trump's controversial remarks earlier in the week about the ""Central Park 5"" -- saying he believed they were still guilty in a 1989 rape despite being exonerated years ago -- in making his decision.""Donald Trump's behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy. Cindy, with her strong background in human rights and respect for women fully agrees with me in this,"" McCain said.""Cindy and I will not vote for Donald Trump,"" he continued. ""I have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate and we will not vote for Hillary Clinton. We will write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president."" Other key figures including Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ohio Gov. John Kasich also called for Trump to step aside.Nancy O'Dell, the woman who rebuffed TrumpIt was a sea change from Friday night, when only two Utah politicians pulled their support of Trump: Gov. Gary Herbert and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz. But other high-profile Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, haven't backed away from their endorsements of Trump even as they blasted his comments.The cascade of strong condemnations of Trump on Saturday however, could accelerate the GOP's move toward a tipping point with Trump. Not only are Democrats trying to pressure GOP to cut ties with their nominee, but some Republicans are exploring whether there is any way to keep Trump from remaining their standard bearer.Trump has survived so many shocking moments this year that most pundits have stopped predicting his downfall. But many Republican strategists said this weekend that the tape -- with Trump's casual suggestion that he could get away with sexual assault -- could be a death blow to his campaign.Trump made the first step toward recovery early Saturday by issuing a defiant apology. ""I said it, I was wrong and I apologize,"" Trump said in a video in which he also doubled down on his criticism of Bill and Hillary Clinton. He insisted in interviews Saturday with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal that he wouldn't step down and greeted supporters on the sidewalk outside Trump Tower.It was in many ways the final chapter of the uncomfortable waltz that Republicans have carried on all year with Trump. In key battleground states, candidates and their advisers have agonized over how to deal with Trump, straining to find language that shows they respect the will of the Republican voters, while trying to shield themselves from the stain of his more controversial comments.Republican leaders across the spectrum seemed mostly horrified by Trump's breezy descriptions of potentially criminal conduct in his conversation with Billy Bush on ""Access Hollywood,"" which was captured on a hot microphone in 2005 and released by The Washington Post.'Sickened'In the most telling sign that the GOP may be on the verge of a break with Trump, Ryan said in a statement that Trump would no longer be attending a Republican unity event with Ryan in Wisconsin Saturday, and that he is ""sickened by what I heard today.""""Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,"" Ryan said in his statement. ""In the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow's event in Wisconsin.""Ryan reiterated Saturday that Trump's comments were a ""troubling situation"" but didn't pull back his endorsement.Still, he's sending a clear signal to the many vulnerable House and Senate Republicans that it is fair game to criticize Trump in harsh terms. Before cutting ties with Trump Saturday, Ayotte was the first vulnerable Republican incumbent to weigh in Friday, calling Trump's comments ""totally inappropriate and offensive.""Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who has pledged to support the GOP nominee, said Trump's comments were ""offensive and wrong and he was right to apologize.""Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey called Trump's remarks ""outrageous and unacceptable."" Nevada Congressman Joe Heck, who is in a close race for Senate, said he condemned Trump's comments ""in the strongest possible terms"" and that the language he used was ""disgraceful.""  Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican who has been critical of Trump, called him a ""malignant clown -- unprepared and unfit to be president of the United States.""Dems blast GOPDemocrats were quick to charge that Republicans weren't going far enough. Democratic operatives made it clear that their strategy in the days ahead would be to force GOP candidates not just to say whether they condemned the comments, but whether they believed Trump should still be commander-in-chief.How the shocking hot mic tape of Donald Trump was exposedA number of strategists predicted Friday that the emergence of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape would make it much easier to sever ties with Trump over the coming days.How the shocking hot mic tape of Donald Trump was exposedJohn Weaver, a strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, urged Republicans in a tweet to ""Cut Trump loose. If u have endorsed, rescind. U work for campaign, can resign. #Two Paths."" ""Condemning Trump's comments while still endorsing, supporting him is outrageous,"" Weaver later tweeted. ""#TwoPaths are available. Choose the right one.""Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who advised 2008 presidential candidate John McCain, noted that the Trump campaign has been in a spiral since the last debate.""At a time when poll numbers are collapsing, this is a comportment and temperament issue. It's devastating,"" Schmidt said, noting that the new revelations come a week after Trump was ""hate tweeting"" at a former Miss Universe at 3 am.""Most every Republican has tried to accommodate the nominee of the party despite things they find deeply awkward. We're moving into a new phase here,"" Schmidt said.He noted that Trump has given little indication that he is preparing for the second debate, suggesting a strong possibility of another flubbed performance.""If the election were held tomorrow, Republicans are down seven Senate seats, so by Monday morning you're going to see Republicans all over saying Hillary Clinton is going to win the election and we need to have divided government to keep a check on her,"" Schmidt said. ""And people will be jumping off the boat like it's the end of the Titanic.""Shock at Trump's commentsBeyond the big names, many Republicans expressed shock at Trump's comments, particularly those who formerly worked for Ted Cruz, and did not appreciate the Texas senator's recent endorsement of Trump. Cruz strategist Jason Johnson tweeted Friday: ""Just another Friday in #2016. Can't even watch the news with my kids.""Cruz also criticized Trump, along with other former Trump primary rivals such as Jeb Bush.""As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump's reprehensible comments degrading women,"" Jeb Bush tweeted.Democrats seek to punish GOP Senate candidates over Trump audioWhile Trump had few defenders on Friday, some of his advisers said they believed he could ride out the controversy.Faith and Freedom Coalition Founder and Chairman Ralph Reed, who sits on Trump's religious advisory board, said that he believed people of faith would pay more attention to where they aligned with Trump on the issues like abortion, Planned Parenthood and the economy.""I think a 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with at TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,"" Reed said, adding that the tape did not change his opinion of Trump.  ""Everybody falls short of a standard of perfection, but Donald Trump's been married to Melania for 10,11, 12 years now. And he has a great family and has a tremendous relationship with his children... I think this case is ancient."""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/donald-trump-evangelical-leaders/index.html	"Ralph Reed, head of Trump's religious advisory board, shrugged off incendiary comments made by the GOP nominee in a newly unearthed video.""I've listened to the tape. My view is that people of faith are voting for president on issues like who will defend and protect unborn life, defund Planned Parenthood, grow the economy and create jobs, oppose the Iran nuclear deal,"" Ralph Reed told CNN. ""I think a 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns.""Reed, chairman and founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, called the 11-year-old recordings ""ancient"" and said they do not change his view of the businessman at all.""Everybody falls short of a standard of perfection but Donald Trump's been married to Melania for 10,11, 12 years now,"" he said. ""And he has a great family and has a tremendous relationship with his children.""Nearly 80% of white evangelical voters back Trump, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. That survey was taken before the tape was released, however.""I think it's already baked into the cake for most voters that Donald Trump is not a saint and Hillary Clinton is corrupt and not trustworthy,"" Reed said. ""Voters are voting based on that perception of the candidates.""Johnnie Moore, a member of Trump's evangelical advisory board, said many evangelicals are ""disgusted"" by Trump's comments, but will still vote for him.""Most conservative evangelicals who are voting for Trump have never been under the illusion that Trump has a puritan past. They are more concerned about the present and whether or not he is more likely than Hillary Clinton to protect their religious liberty, appoint conservative judges and protect the life of the unborn."" Moore distanced himself a bit from Trump, however, saying that his membership on the advisory board should not be construed as an endorsement. ""I wasn't on board with Donald Trump to begin with. None of us were asked to endorse him, we were only asked to provide advice and perspective on certain issues. I agreed to serve because of my concern for refugees and for persecuted Christians around the world.""James Dobson, an evangelical psychologist, radio host and religious right activist, said on Monday, ""The comments Mr. Trump made 11 years ago were deplorable and I condemn them entirely."" Dobson is a member of Trump's evangelical advisory board. However, Dobson continued, ""I also find Hillary Clinton's support of partial birth abortion criminal and her opinion of evangelicals to be bigoted. There really is only one difference between the two. Mr. Trump promises to support religious liberty and the dignity of the unborn. Mrs. Clinton promises she will not."" Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative policy organization, called Trump's behavior ""deeply offensive and degrading,"" but is standing behind his initial endorsement. ""As I have made clear, my support for Donald Trump in the general election was never based upon shared values rather it was built upon shared concerns.""Perkins said Christians are left to vote for the candidate that will do the most to protect religious liberty.""At this point in the political process, because of our lack of engagement and involvement as Christians, not just in this election but in the government and culture as a whole, we are left with a choice of voting for the one who will do the least damage to our freedoms,"" he said. Other public evangelicals offered mixed opinions.Christian conservative and ""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson, who has backed Trump, said evangelical leaders frustrated with Trump's controversies need to ""lighten up.""""I would say they need to lighten up, start going out and preaching the gospel to different people, including Donald Trump, and give him some time to think about spiritual matters, and work with him, and not condemn anybody,"" he told WABC radio host Rita Cosby.Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, called evangelical leaders' continued support for Trump a ""disgrace and a scandal."" ""The damage done to the gospel this year, by so-called evangelicals, will take longer to recover from than the '80s TV evangelist scandals,"" he tweeted on Saturday. Erick Erickson, a conservative pundit, criticized those Republicans defending Trump who once criticized former President Bill Clinton for his sexual indiscretions. ""Republicans who once wanted (Bill) Clinton impeached because the POTUS is supposed to be the office of a moral man are now defending Trump. New York Times bestselling author Rachel Held Evans, who often writes about women's issues, called on evangelical leaders to speak out against Trump's words.""Evangelicals, misogyny is wrong. Sexual assault is wrong. Adultery is wrong. Calling women ""bitches"" & ""pieces of ass"" is wrong. SAY SO,"" she tweeted.
