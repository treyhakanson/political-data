This is a liar. I am standing at my podium, I have got my chair and Crooked Hillary Clinton walks across the stage right in front of me,"" Trump said.Trump said that he had paid heed to Clinton's former Senate election rival Rick Lazio who got to close to the former first lady in a debate in 2000 and was heavily criticized.""Years ago, someone came in and talked to her, the poor guy Lazio, so I said, I am not getting near this woman at all, no interest, I have no interest,"" Trump quipped.The GOP nominee also said he was looked forward to his third and final debate clash with Clinton next week in Las Vegas. ""That will be fun,"" he said."	Trump denies getting in Clinton's space at debate	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Here's part of Conway's fiery exchange with Anderson Cooper on ""AC360.""Conway: ""The last time I didn't sexually harass someone, I didn't pay them $850,000."" Cooper: ""Your candidate has settled numerous lawsuits without admitting any guilt on a whole number of things. Are you implying that settling a lawsuit is implying guilt? If so, it means your candidate is guilty of an awful of lot of things, no?""Conway: ""For that, really, as governor of Arkansas, using state troopers to procure women for you?"" Cooper: ""You're saying settling a lawsuit is questionable and raising questions about guilt. Your client settles lawsuits all the time, even though he says he doesn't, right?""Conway: ""No, what I'm saying is, what was Hillary Clinton's conduct towards those women?""Cooper: ""No, you're implying that settling a lawsuit implies guilt. Donald trump has settled numerous lawsuits, including the racial discrimination lawsuit years ago without accepting any guilt. Are you saying there may be some guilt there?"" Conway: ""I'm saying that I believe Paula Jones.""Voters 'should know who Clinton is'Hillary Cinton's record includes ""naming and blaming women who came in contact with her husband,"" Conway said.""If others aren't going to hold her (to) account for her full record, then, yes, we will,""  Conway said.A CNN ""Reality Check"" found Donald Trump's claim that Hillary Clinton ""viciously"" attacked her husband's accusers to be an exaggeration.Cooper asked the veteran pollster if she believed their strategy would depress Democratic voter turnout. ""I believe that voters should know who Hillary Clinton is,"" Conway said.""I'll let them decide whether it's enough for them to stay home or come to the polls."""

""I think it was a little cruder, but I know many men that say several of the same things.""""Him thinking that men can brag about sexually assaulting a woman is disgusting. It's not locker-room banter, it's a serious matter and that's scary because I have friends who have been sexually assaulted,"" Kristina McNamara, a 21-year-old Independent from Manchester told CNN.The polarization among voters was almost identical to a year earlier, when CNN visited the same diner to gauge reaction to Trump's comments about whether Sen. John McCain was a war hero.Those who support Trump told CNN his comments were not out of bounds for any normal non-politician. While those who did not support Trump, felt strongly that he had crossed the line.""Saying something negative about a veteran, if you don't take a hit, there's something wrong,"" independent New Hampshire voter Laura Rotolo told CNN in 2015.""I think there's going to be a lot of different things he says, a lot of the different politicians are saying things about each other. Just because he said this it's not going to change what I say, what I think about him at all,"" Kim Walters, a 36-year-old Republican from Goffstown, said of her support for Trump in 2015. Back in summer 2015 public polls showed Trump rising, leaving behind a crowd of Republican candidates.Now, less then a month before the election, his situation is more dire thanks to a turbulent few weeks that have left Trump on defense.Champagne, who is almost certain she will vote for Trump, voted for Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire primary.She told CNN she didn't like Trump's comments, but felt she couldn't vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton because she doesn't trust her, while she felt Trump had at least ""fessed up"" to his mistakes.In choosing between two unpopular candidates, the character of both Clinton and Trump is being scrutinized.""I think she's not the one who should be throwing black marks against somebody else for making sexist remarks,"" Susan Champagne, sitting with her daughter, told CNN. ""Bill did a lot more than that and he did it in the presidency not in the campaign.""In 2015, voters predicted further controversy could hurt Trump but felt that attracting more attention was his aim. ""All of the other candidates seem to be cut from the same mold,"" Marc Vadeboncoeur, a Republican from Raymond, told CNN in 2015, who was still evaluating the candidates. ""Whether he stands out in a good way or a bad way because of this issue, issues like this, kind of remains to be seen.""Sixty-seven-year-old New Hampshire resident Janie, who didn't want to give her last name, told CNN it made her day to get the chance to defend Trump. ""What he says he doesn't mean, he jokes around a lot. He hasn't been in politics, and I think he would be a good president,"" she told CNN. ""You got to pick and choose your battles."""

""And that's why this could be a civil war because they look upon it as, 'Okay, Republicans are gonna go against Trump, okay, then we're gonna go against Republicans.' Both sides are wrong in doing that. It's like, you know, the old expression your mother said, biting off your nose to spite your face. But that's really is what this is about.""In the interview, King said Republicans ""have to be concerned"" about losing the House, but largely defended Ryan, who did not withdraw his endorsement of Trump after audiotape leaked on Friday of the GOP nominee describing how he forces himself on women. King called Ryan a ""good guy"" and that he understands ""where Paul is coming from."" He reserved his strongest criticism for Republicans who withdrew their support from Trump after they heard the audio, saying there was an element of hypocrisy in their criticism of the party nominee.""I think a lot of these guys who were complaining to Paul Ryan,"" King said. ""A lot of these guys who are nervous. I think they just hurt themselves. And again, listen, there's a certain amount of hypocrisy here, when I hear people on television, including reporters, you know, god, these guys can be real low lives. And they're on there, 'I never heard language like this, I never heard anyone talk like this.' Listen, the language is bad. It's indefensible. But you hear it. Whether it's an army barracks. Whether it's the back room of a TV studio. Whether it's congressmen sitting around a bar at night.""King, whose district is on Long Island, said Trump might be ""too New York"" for some Republicans.""There are people in the party who they resent the style, they resent the fact that even though he may have conservative positions, he doesn't act like the buttoned-down Republican businessman,"" he said. ""They would love to have guys come in who act very starchy and very aloof and very sophisticated. Trump is too much like, with all his money, he's still too much like the kid on the Queens street corner. He's too New York for them."" "	Rep.

Trump released a video statement after the tape surfaced, saying, ""I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.""Appearing on the Dan Caplis Show on 710 KNUS, the younger Trump said, ""That conversation, it was locker room banter, I mean, that's really what it was. It was two alpha guys in a thing, and by the way, it is totally unacceptable. He acknowledged that, and he apologized for it. It's two guys by themselves in private at some event going back and forth. My father is a man that has a heart of gold. He truly the greatest father in the world to us.""Earlier in the interview, Trump said his father wasn't perfect and attacked Hillary Clinton for, he said, getting people killed. ""By no means is my father perfect in terms of points. Hey, we all make mistakes, and we all apologize for certain things here and there,"" he said. ""It was two alpha guys in a room talking, and listen, it wasn't right. At the same time she's gotten people killed. She's cost our nation $6 trillion.

""I think the President has spoken now this entire week and he's expressed how profoundly degrading those remarks were and I think he speaks for everyone,"" she told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day.""Jarrett said any suggestion that the global challenges with ISIS are rooted in the US's premature withdrawal from Iraq are false.""I think the President has been clear that his number one objective is to keep America safe,"" she said. ""The challenges that we have around the world are complicated and they are not going to be solved overnight.""""His judgments are clear and singularly focused on what is good for our country and he stands behind the decisions he has made,"" Jarrett added. Criticism that Obama will leave the state of the country worse off than when he arrived are false, Jarrett said as she listed accomplishments ranging from job growth and decreasing poverty rates.""We are doing fantastic here and that does not mean there isn't room for improvement, but we are the envy of the world over,"" she said.

""I will never let (my) husband be my boss."" Holton, an attorney and judge, has political experience of her own.  Until her husband joined Hillary Clinton's presidential ticket this summer, she served as education secretary in Virginia. She said she resigned the post to devote her full energy to the campaign. Holton also saw the workings of government from the governor's mansion, where she lived for two stints when her father and husband held the executive role.  Gender dynamics is a topic her husband frequently touches on as he runs alongside Clinton, who of course would be the first woman elected to the presidency.  ""One of the exciting things about this race for him and me both, is that, as he says, he's had strong women, including myself thank you very much, supporting him throughout his many political roles, and now, it's a chance to do a turnaround,"" Holton said earlier this month. ""And he relishes the opportunity to be in the supportive role.""  As Trump gets 'unshackled,' Clinton's campaign sweats turnoutAt least 48 women have either been appointed or elected to their husbands' seats in the House and Senate, according to Kathy Kleeman of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.  Only one -- Rep. Debbie Dingell -- succeeded her husband -- Rep. John Dingell -- during his lifetime.  According to the center, the number of times a husband has assumed his wife's seat in Congress: Zero.

""Because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.""Earlier this week, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, a Republican who worked for President George W.

The top-dollar super PAC will continue to air ads in Colorado for two more weeks, but after looking at the polls, advisers decided recently that their money would be spent better elsewhere.Clinton's confidence was clear on Wednesday during her first visit to Colorado since early August.When a man yelled that he loved Clinton, the former first lady laughed and quipped, ""I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo, I think I'll come here anytime it gets hard in the White House, what do you say?""On taxes, Clinton said Trump's leaked 1990s return to The New York Times shows that the billionaire-turned-Republican nominee ""contributed zero, zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for education and health.She continued: ""And he has the gall to go around disrespecting out military.
