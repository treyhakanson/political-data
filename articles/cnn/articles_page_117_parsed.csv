You just have to be a decent human being to say that's not right,"" he said during a campaign event in North Carolina. ""And if it makes you mad ... you can do something about it North Carolina!"" Obama reiterated the reasons why he doesn't think Donald Trump is fit to be president of the United States.""It was true when we heard what he thought about minorities ... Muslims ... made fun of disabled persons or insulted gold star families,"" he said.Obama wrapped up his fiery stump speech for Clinton telling the crowd that the choice on the ballot was not just between Clinton and Trump but that ""civility,"" ""tolerance,"" ""justice"" and ""respect for women"" were also on the ballot. ""If you want to send a message in this election, make it a resounding message. Turn back the forces of racism and misogyny and send a message for progress. Send a message for facts ... send a message by voting for Hillary Clinton,"" he said. The President also marveled at Trump's debate claims -- including that he would jail Clinton if elected. ""When in the middle of a debate you threaten to put your political opponent in jail, that -- no trial, no indictment, no lawyers ... "" Obama said. ""When you welcome Russian meddling in our electoral process, then you're disregarding not just things like facts, or evidence, or a free press, but you're chipping away at basic values like tolerance, and due process and mutual respect.""Earlier Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Trump's sexually aggressive boasts a decade ago were ""repugnant."" The caught-on-tape remarks, which have thrown the Republican Party into tumult, amounted to an endorsement of criminal behavior, Earnest said.""The President found the tape as repugnant as most Americans did,"" Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to a campaign stop in North Carolina. ""I think there's been a pretty clear statement by people all along the ideological spectrum that those statements constituted sexual assault.""""That's an observation that we've heard from a wide variety of sources,"" he said. ""That's why many people have concluded those statements are worthy of sharp condemnation.""On Friday, audio of Trump discussing women in lewd and sexually aggressive terms during off-camera banter at a taping of a segment for ""Access Hollywood,"" was obtained and reported by The Washington Post. The fallout was fast and severe: several prominent Republicans dropped their endorsements of Trump, and many called on the candidate to withdraw from the race entirely.House Speaker Paul Ryan said he would no longer defend Trump going forward, and would instead devote his attention to maintaining Republican control of Congress in November.But other, more conservative lawmakers said Ryan was making a mistake, and essentially handing the White House to Clinton. And Trump himself has remained defiant, declaring he would proceed without the backing from the establishment and without the constraints of a traditional presidential nominee.The divide has caused deep consternation among Republican officials, but Earnest said Tuesday the current circumstances were predictable.""You reap what you sow, and for seven and a half years Republicans in Washington have been selling anti-Obama rhetoric to the exclusion of facts, to the exclusion of any sort of governing agenda, and even to the exclusion of conservative doctrine. And that's why Republican leaders in Washington find themselves in the situation they're in now,"" Earnest said.Obama, he continued, was resisting complacency, despite the GOP stumbles.  ""That would explain why the president's doing a campaign event in Greensboro tonight,"" he said. ""The president is energized by this campaign.""Obama is going to visually ramp up his campaign activity in the month left before Election Day, Earnest said."

""This is collusion and corruption of the highest order and is one more reason I will ask my attorney general ... to appoint a special prosecutor.""""We have to investigate Hillary Clinton and we have to investigate the investigation. This was a disgrace,"" Trump said, referring to the FBI probe into Clinton's private email server.The communication between Fallon and the DOJ, revealed by WikiLeaks, only concerned the FOIA lawsuit, and not the investigation into Clinton's email use. There is no evidence DOJ communicated with Fallon on other issues, including its email investigation.Trump hit Clinton right at the top of his speech, repeatedly citing information drawn from the emails hacked and given to Wikileaks, in a concentrated assault.""You see so much from the Wikileaks, there is so much,"" Trump said. The Republican nominee also seized on reports that State Department insiders gave priorities to friends of Bill Clinton when handling aid contracts following the deadly earthquake in Haiti in 2010.""We should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time out. To all our friends in Haiti and Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming and it arrives on November 8,"" Trump said.In an email on May 19, 2015, Fallon advised of upcoming action in a civil lawsuit by Vice News reporter Jason Leopold that resulted in the State Department releasing tens of thousands of Clinton's emails.""DOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge's thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today,"" Fallon, a former Justice Department spokesman, wrote.The hearing Fallon was referring to was publicly available information and covered extensively at the time by CNN, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, Politico, Vice, National Journal and The Hill, among others. The exchange is included in the third batch of emails that appear to be hacked from Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta and posted by WikiLeaks. The Clinton campaign has never formally verified the authenticity of the emails, the first of which were released Friday. WikiLeaks claims to have 50,000 emails hacked from Podesta and has thus far released roughly 5,300.In a tweet Tuesday afternoon, Trump wrote, ""I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks. She is unfit to run."" He did not mention any specific allegation or hacked email or allegation.The most significant news from the emails posted came Friday, when WikiLeaks posted what appeared to be excerpts from transcripts of speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street companies after leaving the State Department. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday that he would not comment directly on ""stolen emails of a private citizen"" when questioned about an email showing the Clinton campaign was in touch with the Justice Department.""I will say in general is both the attorney general and the FBI director have made clear the investigation of Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server was conducted without regard to partisan politics,"" Earnest said.The Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday on Fallon's email. But Fallon, in a string of tweets Monday night, accused WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange of coordinating the releases with the Russian government and the Trump campaign."".@wikileaks You are no media organization. You are a propaganda arm of the Russian govt, running interference for their pet candidate, Trump,"" Fallon wrote."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/white-house-response-russia-hacking/index.html	"The response will be ""proportional,"" press secretary Josh Earnest said, without elaborating. He said the actions would likely not be announced ahead of time and could never be made public. Speaking with reporters on Air Force One, Earnest said a ""range"" of responses were on the table.Last Friday's announcement was the first time the government has publicly blamed another country for hacking with the goal of influencing a US election. The joint statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security said not only were they confident the hacks of Democratic political groups and campaign officials originated from high levels of the Russian government, they said the posting of those hacked emails online was part of the effort. ""The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,"" the statement said.Trump seizes on hacked email, alleges collusionEarnest's discussion of a ""proportional"" response is the usual language the government uses when describing its cyber actions.National security adviser Lisa Monaco spoke in general about what the government might do last week at a Washington Post event, before the Russia statement had been released. ""We will respond in a time and place and manner of our choosing, and when we do so, we will consider a full range of tools, economic, diplomatic, criminal law enforcement, military, and some of those responses may be public, some of them may not be,"" Monaco said. Pressed by moderator Ellen Nakashima, Monaco said the range of options include private diplomatic channels, intelligence operations, prosecutions and sanctions -- all taking into account broader considerations on the world stage. ""We will act responsibly, proportionately, and do so in a time and place of our choosing,"" Monaco said. ""The primary guiding and overarching focus in those discussions is about what is in the national security interest of the United States. That is the North Star for those discussions.""President Barack Obama signed an executive order in April 2015 authorizing a new sanctions power that allows retribution for cyberattacks, but it has never been used. The promise of retaliation came the same day that a new tranche of emails stolen in a hack of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman was posted on WikiLeaks, the third such release from the hacked email of John Podesta.The campaign has not disputed the contents of the emails, but have noted that it would be difficult to determine if alterations were made or context was intentionally omitted.  Moscow's Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, asked about the US accusations, said Tuesday that ""it's not correct, and when it comes to the implication to the elections in the United States, it's something I'm not planning to discuss.""Kislyak, who was speaking at The Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, then tried to cast doubt on the allegations. ""We've seen a number (of allegations) by the colleagues in US intelligence that weren't exactly proven by the history,"" Kislyak said, and offered a recent example.Referring to the bombing of Syrian soldiers by US jets in September, an event US officials described as an unfortunate accident based on faulty information, Kislyak said ""we saw statements that the week ago bombardment of the Syrian troops."" He added that the strike ""was based on false information.""Democrats have accused Russia of coordinating the release of the emails to benefit Donald Trump's campaign.Russian media has covered the emails, with government-controlled Sputnik news misconstruing an email to make it seem that Clinton confidante Sidney Blumenthal had argued the Benghazi investigation was legitimate and the attack was preventable.""Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect US personnel at an American consulate in Libya. If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate,"" the email said -- with Sputnik attributing it to Blumenthal.The misinformation quickly appeared as a Trump talking point at a campaign rally later in the day, where he read the sentence aloud.But Newsweek author Kurt Eichenwald recognized the supposed Blumenthal sentences as part of a lengthy story he wrote. ""The Russians were quoting two sentences from a 10,000-word piece I wrote for Newsweek, which Blumenthal had emailed to Podesta,"" Eichenwald wrote in Newsweek. ""It is impossible to look at the Blumenthal email and not realize that this 10,000 words that follows are from Newsweek,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for explanation why he parroted misstatements published by Russian-controlled news.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/hillary-clinton-al-gore-climate-change-2016-election/index.html	"The event, which focused on climate change, looked toward a future Clinton administration as much as it looked back at what Gore has called his ""crushing"" defeat in the 2000 presidential election.Overlooking their past animosity, the pair campaigned together for the first time since 2000.Clinton's campaign enlisted Gore to campaign with the former first lady for two distinct purposes: Rally voters who are spurred by climate advocacy and to show Floridians that every vote counts by highlighting how only a few votes in Florida lost Gore the White House. And Gore did just that in Miami.""Your vote, really, really, really counts,"" Gore said. ""You can consider me as an exhibit A of that.""He continued: ""Now, for those of you who are younger than 25, you might not remember the election of 2000 and what happened here in Florida and across the country. For those of you older than 25, I heard you murmuring just now. But take it from me, it was a very close election.""Donald Trump: 'The shackles have been taken off me'The audience responded by an organic chant of ""you won"" and Clinton nodded along with them.Gore's Florida race against President George W. Bush was so close that it took a recount and a Supreme Court decision to decide that the Texas governor had won. Gore ultimately won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College and thus the presidency.Gore heralded Clinton's plan to combat climate change and said the former first lady ""will make solving the climate crisis a top national priority.""While Clinton and Gore appeared comfortable on the stage together Tuesday, their decades-long relationship, including eight years in the White House, has has been defined by ups and downs.Clinton and Gore's relationship dramatically soured after the former vice president decided to keep President Bill Clinton away from his 2000 White House bid because of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and the impeachment that followed. The two also clashed in the White House after Bill Clinton gave Hillary Clinton considerable policy responsibility, seemingly diminishing Gore's role.Clinton and Gore last saw each other in 2014, according to aides. Gore was also late to endorse Clinton in 2016, not backing the former secretary of state until July, well after Bernie Sanders had been dispatched. A Clinton aide said Tuesday that John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman and an aide who dates back to the first Clinton White House, asked Gore to campaign for Clinton.Clinton did not give her standard stump speech on Tuesday, instead choosing to focus almost entirely on climate change. The Democratic nominee detailed her vision for a White House that fights climate change and works with foreign countries to implement international climate agreements. She also leaned on Gore's expertise in the field.""I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am president of the United States,"" she said to close her speech.The sad irony of what could propel the first woman into the White HouseThe Democratic nominee cast Republican rival Donald Trump as dangerous on climate change, telling the audience that the United States ""cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House.""""He doesn't care what it does to the planet, he doesn't care how much that would damage American leadership, he doesn't care about the future we leave our kids and our grandkids,"" Clinton said on Trump's climate change plans. ""Well, he may not care, but we do and that is why this election is so critically important.""She also slammed Marco Rubio, who is running to reelection in Florida, for saying he was not a scientist when asked about climate change. ""Well, why doesn't he ask a scientist? Maybe then he would understand,"" she said.Gore echoed Clinton on climate change, but it was his references to 2000 that really fired up the audience.So much so that after a long speech filled with intricacies about carbon pollution and rising tides, the former vice president wrapped up by saying ""in conclusion"" before urging no one to sit on in 2016.""Please,"" he said, ""take it from me, every single vote counts. Every single vote counts."" "	Hillary Clinton and Al Gore reunite, campaigning on climate change	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/secrecy-trump-isis-fight/index.html	"In fact, US and Iraqi officials have repeatedly discussed the planning underway to retake the second-largest city in Iraq and the strongest ISIS base in the country -- a strategy that has been roundly and repeatedly criticized as loose talk by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying? How stupid is our country?"" Trump said during the second presidential debate on October 9, referring to the impending battle that got underway Monday.  Indeed, how much to disclose about military operations has long been a contentious issue among military planners. Some see it as part of a commitment to democratic transparency, while others see tactical drawbacks, including the loss of the element of surprise.Critics of President Barack Obama, for instance, panned him for announcing withdrawal timelines for troops in Afghanistan, saying that doing so encouraged the Taliban to wait out the US troop presence.Donald Trump: 'The shackles have been taken off me'In the case of ISIS and the effort to reclaim Mosul, however, military officials are making the case for the release of information -- even as they abstain from addressing Trump's comments directly. Asked generally about the publicity surrounding the Mosul offensive before it had begun, Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said last week that much of it was originating from Baghdad.""These are statements that the government of Iraq itself has made, and they have been very forthcoming about what the plan is, and they have done it largely in the name warning civilians in Mosul to be ready for it and try to get out if they can,"" Davis told reporters.Others see the efforts as helping to encourage resistance within Mosul as the Iraqis geared up to take back the city.But a spokesman for the US-led anti-ISIS coalition, Col. John Dorrian, told the Associated Press that such pronouncements encourage ISIS fighters to lay down their arms.Davis added that the encircled ISIS fighters remaining in Mosul ahead of the attack were experiencing ""a very large-scale loss of morale.""At the debate, Trump also charged that the public revelation of information was allowing the ISIS leadership to flee, saying, ""All of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.""7 takeaways from the second presidential debateBut Davis, who declined to get into intelligence specifics, said that movement of ISIS leadership can actually make them more vulnerable to targeted strikes.""We do see ISIL leadership moving a lot, they do move, but they do so again at their own peril. I think that they know as well as anybody that anytime they are moving, that's when they are at the greatest risk,"" Davis said, using the government's preferred acronym for the terror organization.But US officials also acknowledged that there are benefits to certain levels of operational secrecy, including for Special Operations Forces operations like raids against ISIS leaders.One such clandestine operation included the capture and interrogation of an ISIS chemical weapons expert. That mission was carried out by the so-called Expeditionary Targeting Forces, a group of some 200 Special Operations troops assembled in northern Iraq to gather intelligence and pursue ISIS operatives on the ground by either capturing or killing them.The operation was only disclosed after the US carried out a series of follow-on strikes against ISIS chemical weapons facilities.A US defense official also pointed out that many of the military operations by its Iraqi allies are also carried out in secret, noting that Iraqi troops moved on Qayyarah West and seized it from ISIS without any notice at the urging of US advisers.The official added that the military would continue such operations in secret when it is tactically advantageous.And some experts think that in the case of Mosul, at least, more secrecy would not have much impact.A defense official noted that it would be hard to mask the thousands of Iraqi troops encircling Mosul before they began their operation on Monday. Still, he said last week that many of the aspects of the final assault, including the exact timing and direction, would remain secret -- and they did.""The war has been unfolding at such a snail's pace, there wouldn't have been any serious value in not talking about it,"" Tomas Donnelly of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington told CNN.He said that ISIS fighters have been digging in and preparing for an eventual attack in Mosul for over a year and that the increased publicity had not changed their behavior.Donnelly, a defense and security policy analyst, added that locally publicizing military offensives to clear civilians and demoralize the enemy was ""pretty typical"" when going into a heavily populated areas, noting that the US military did something similar when clearing Fallujah back in 2004.But Donnelly said that the publicity in Western media was largely geared toward building support for the intervention among the American public.The former spokesman for the US-led coalition told reporters in May that informing the public is an important part of the fight.""We know that they are out there very actively messaging. They use this same medium to both recruit and to terrorize,"" US Army Col. Steve Warren said of ISIS.""It is a duty to fight that. This war is being fought on a lot of levels, as is every war in history. It's being fought with bombs, American and coalition bombs. It's being fought with Iraqi and Syrian bullets. But it's also being fought with words,"" he said.""We have a real duty to America who entrusts us with blood and treasure,"" Warren said.""I think I have a duty to hold this institution at least somewhat accountable; to explain how we are spending that money and to explain how we are bringing that blood, those sons and daughters into this fight, and how we're doing it."""

The fact that they may use their resources to also promote Democratic candidates in down-ballot races suggests how increasingly confident they are in a Clinton victory.According to a source familiar with the plans, Priorities USA is currently producing television ads to potentially air in Senate contests in North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania -- all competitive races that are also battleground states for the presidential race.Other Senate races could also be targeted, and potentially even some top-tier House seats that Democrats think they have a shot at taking from Republicans.Although plans are still being finalized, the push would likely start next week, and last three weeks until Election Day.Officials at Priorities USA have been polling in Senate and House races over the last month to see ""if an opportunity presented itself,"" according to the source familiar with the super PAC's plans.Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, is the former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which helps elect Democrats to the Senate.

ObamacareReality Check: Trump on Obamacare premiumsBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Trump cited Obamacare as one of the top problems he wants to address if he is elected president.""When I watch the deals being made and watch what's happening with horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care are going up by numbers that are astronomical. By 68%, 59% and 71%,"" Trump said.It's true that some insurers are raising some of their plans' premiums by that much, but that's not the typical increase.Insurers have requested a rate hike of 9%, on average, for the benchmark silver plan for 2017, up from 2% for this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.The vast majority of Obamacare enrollees, however, don't see those massive hikes. Some 85% of them receive federal subsidies that can lower their premium to less than 10% of their income.Verdict: True, but misleading.Reality Check: Clinton on 90% insured rateBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoneyClinton praised Obamacare as providing health insurance for 20 million people who didn't have it before. ""Right now, we are at 90% health insurance coverage. That's the highest we have ever been,"" she said.Clinton is right that the largest share of Americans now have health insurance. It's actually even more than 90%. The uninsured rate was 8.6% in the first three months of this year, according to the National Health Interview Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means a record 91.4% of Americans were insured.Verdict: True.Reality Check: Canadians traveling for health careBy Debra Goldschmidt, CNNIn response to a question on Obamacare, Trump said, ""If you ever noticed Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States, in many cases because their system is so slow it's catastrophic in certain ways.""According to a 2015 report by the conservative Canadian think tank Frasier Institute, ""In 2014, more than 52,000 Canadians received non-emergency medical treatment outside Canada.""  The 52,000 is an increase of about 10,000 from the previous year. The report last year said one reason for patients traveling abroad is the long wait times in Canada, which were reported to be nearly 10 weeks for treatments deemed medically necessary.The report itself says it does not have exact numbers but assumes it underestimates. That said, 52,000 Canadians is a miniscule percentage of the more than 35 million Canadians who receive benefits. While the report doesn't say how many patients travel to the US for medical treatment, we rate Trump's claim as true, but misleading.Reality Check: Clinton wants single-payer system?By Debra Goldschmidt, CNNTrump said Clinton ""wants to go to single-payer, which means the government basically rules everything."" He went on to say, ""Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step.""In July, Clinton said she supported a public option, which is a government health plan as a choice alongside private health insurance options. This is different than a single-payer system, which is a singular, government-run system without other options to chose from.The goal of adding a public option would be to stabilize Obamacare, which has seen several large insurers downsize their presence and premiums rise as insurers try to deal with sicker-than-expected enrollees. Obamacare had created non-profit cooperative insurers to give consumers more choice, but most of those carriers have failed.Last month, in response to a question posed by the New England Journal of Medicine on how she would improve on quality and access to care, Clinton said she wants to build on the progress of Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, something she has said before.Clinton wrote, ""We must work to expand Medicaid coverage in the 19 states that have left 3 million Americans without health insurance because their states refused to expand Medicaid and enroll people eligible for coverage. We need to improve and strengthen the ACA through enhanced tax credits to make coverage affordable, implementation of strong measures to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, increased competition between insurers, and an aggressive campaign to increase outreach and enrollment. And finally, we need to ensure the availability of a public option choice in every state, and let Americans over 55 buy in to Medicare.""The medical journal asked the same question to Trump but he has yet to respond. He has said Obamacare should be repealed. We rate Trump's claim that Clinton wants a single-payer system as false.'Birther' claimReality Check: Trump claims 2008 Clinton campaign source of Obama photo in Somali garbBy Theodore Schleifer, CNNTrump told Clinton that ""your campaign"" was responsible for circulating photos during the 2008 primaries depicting Barack Obama dressed in traditional Somali garb, a famous flare-up during the Democratic primary eight years ago.Well, sort of. The photo first appeared on Drudge Report, the conservative aggregator, and was attributed at the time to sources within the Clinton campaign, though no names were offered. The Obama campaign pounced on the report, blasting it as ""divisive politics"" and ""part of a disturbing pattern.""The Clinton campaign at the time did not immediately dispute that it was responsible -- its first statement did not address the substance of the allegation. ""This is nothing more than an obvious and transparent attempt to distract from the serious issues confronting our country today and to attempt to create the very divisions they claim to decry. We will not be distracted,"" her aides said at the time.The campaign said later that it had not been sanctioned by the campaign - but was not definitive about where it originated.""We have over 700 people on this campaign and I'm not in a position to know what each one of them may or may not have done,"" campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said at the time.Previous questions about the Clintons' race-based attacks on Obama have been blamed on volunteers, who might not have been ""sanctioned"" by the campaign. Clinton's campaign brass pointed the finger at a ""volunteer coordinator"" in Iowa who shared the photo, which was part of what Trump said was an effort to discredit Obama's heritage and legitimacy. The volunteer was clearly backing Clinton and organizing on her behalf in the first-in-the-nation primary state. But it's not certain whether the volunteer was drawing a paycheck from her campaign and therefore an official Clinton actor.""I don't recall whether they were an actual paid staffer,"" former Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle told CNN earlier this year. ""But they did forward an email that promoted the conspiracy.""Verdict: It's complicated.Clinton's emailsReality Check: Trump on Clinton emailsBy Ryan Browne, CNN National Security ProducerTrump returned to a common theme, slamming Clinton for her use of personal email during her tenure as secretary of state.""You think it was fine to delete 35,000 emails? I don't think so. She said that 33,000 emails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.""He added, ""for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 emails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.""Clinton handed 30,000 emails over to the State Department and said she deleted another 32,000 personal messages.So the number was actually 32,000, not 39,000, 35,000 or 33,000, as Trump charged.Of the 32,000 emails the FBI was able to find, more than 17,000 of them and determined that a ""substantial number"" were duplicates of emails that had already been turned over to the State Department.The State Department has reviewed about 15,000 of the emails and determined that more than 9,400 were purely personal and will not be released and that another 5,600 are probably work-related and will be made public in the weeks before the election.But he is partially right about the description Hillary gave for the emails that were deleted, thousands of which have been found to be work related. Back in March 2015, when the server's existence was first revealed, Clinton downplayed the email as being ""about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.""Trump's three numbers are all inaccurate and the State Department confirmed that the majority were personal. Therefore, we rate Trump's claims about the numbers as false. But true that Clinton downplayed emails that turned out to be work-related.Reality Check: Can Trump appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton?By Jamie Crawford, CNN National Security Producer""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception,"" Trump told Clinton. ""There has never been anything like it, and we are going to have a special prosecutor. I go out and speak and the people of this country are furious.""But would Trump be constitutionally empowered to take such an action if he were elected the 45th president of the United States?Under Title 6 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the attorney general does have the authority to appoint a special prosecutor, according to Stephen Vladeck, a law professor with the University of Texas School of Law. Such action can be taken when the attorney general determines that a criminal investigation is warranted and that an investigation by the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest or ""other extraordinary circumstance"" and that ""under the circumstances it would be in the public interest to appoint and outside special counsel.""But the prosecutor would need to bring charges and that might a difficult proposition in the current climate, in the face of the comments by FBI Director James Comey earlier this year at the conclusion of the FBI investigation into whether or not Clinton broke the law in her use of a private email server.In July, Comey said that Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in her use of a private email server in which classified material was was sent over in small amounts. But Comey also said ""our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case"" when he announced that the FBI would not recommend the Justice Department bring criminal charges against Clinton over the matter.""I just don't see a scenario where, if the director of the FBI doesn't believe criminal charges can or should be brought, a subsequent Justice Department would bring them anyway,"" Vladeck said of the political situation after Comey's comments. But in practical terms regarding the legality of Trump's promise, the only constraints are the ones set out in the federal regulations.And would Trump be able to ""instruct"" his attorney general to undertake such an investigation?Vladeck points out that the attorney general is supposed to be at least somewhat independent, but at the end of the day, the President can fire him or her for no reason. So in reality, the President could demand that the AG appoint a special prosecutor or else be fired. That is essentially what led to the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" during the Nixon administration when President Richard Nixon dismissed Archibald Cox during the investigation of Watergate. But that incident ended up being a significant factor in turning the public tide against Nixon in the scandal that eventually brought down his presidency.Verdict: True.Reality Check: Clinton on Russia and hackingBy Justin Gamble and Kate Grise, CNNClinton said Russia was behind the hacking of systems related to the Democratic Party and then releasing thousands of emails in an attempt to influence the presidential election to favor Trump.""Our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election and WikiLeaks is part of that as are other sites where the Russians hack information,"" she said.""We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,"" Clinton continued. ""And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected. They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump""Trump was not so convinced that the Russians were behind the hacks.""Anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians. She doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking,"" he said. ""Maybe there is no hacking, but they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia is because they think they are trying to tarnish me with Russia.""The intelligence community had been debating whether they should ""name and shame"" the Russians for the cyberattacks because of some concerns about the strength of the evidence and fears that it would be seen as a political statement to help Clinton's election.However, on Friday, the Obama administration said it was ""confident"" Russia was behind recent hackings of the Democratic National Committee emails and the sites of other Democratic Party-linked organizations over the summer.""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement.The statement went on to say that the hackings and then publishing of these emails are ""intended to interfere with the US election process.""Russia has denied all involvement in hacking attacks on US servers and organizations, saying the accusations are ""nonsense.""While there has been speculation that the hacking benefits Trump as it has targeted Democrats and Clinton, the intelligence community has not reached that conclusion.So on Trump's claim that it is not known if there is any hacking, we rate the claim false. On Clinton's opinion that the hack is meant to benefit Trump may be her hunch, but not the conclusion of investigators. We rate that false as well.Bill ClintonReality Check: Bill Clinton's law license, Paula Jones settlementBy Sonam Vashi, CNNTrump went after Clinton's husband tonight. ""But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law, he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women -- Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.""The day before he left the Oval Office in 2001, Bill Clinton agreed to a suspension of his Arkansas license to practice law for five years, after giving misleading testimony during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The suspensions, and his payment of a $25,000 fine to the Arkansas bar association, was in exchange for the end of the seven-year Whitewater probe. The suspension of Clinton's license closed the disbarment proceedings in Arkansas. Clinton is still listed as suspended on the Arkansas judiciary government website, although it's been 10 years since the end of his suspension.That same year, after the suspension of his Arkansas license, the Supreme Court disbarred Clinton from practicing law before it, a routine decision that happens if lawyers have been suspended or disbarred elsewhere. The action was mainly a symbolic one, since Clinton had never argued in a Supreme Court case, and Clinton was given 40 days to fight against the disbarment. Instead, Clinton resigned from the bar of the Supreme Court -- again, a symbolic gesture.Trump is also correct on the $850,000 figure. Paula Jones is a former Arkansas state employee who accused Clinton of making ""persistent and continuous"" sexual advances toward her while he was governor. She filed a federal lawsuit in 1994, and Clinton settled the lawsuit in 1998, paying out $850,000 to Jones and her lawyers.Clinton wasn't disbarred in Arkansas, but he did lose his license for a time. Trump's claims are true.Reality Check: Clinton on African-Americans' incomes rising under Bill ClintonBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoneyHillary Clinton praised the prosperity America enjoyed during the administration of her husband, Bill. In addition to saying millions of jobs were created and everyone's income rose, she specifically cited how African-Americans benefited.""African-American incomes went up 33%,"" she said.The typical African-American household's income rose to $40,830 in 2000, up 31.5% from 1992, just before Clinton took office, according to Census Bureau data.That's an even more robust increase than Americans as a whole. Overall, the typical American household saw its income climb to $57,790, up 13.9% from 1992.While Clinton was slightly off on the numbers, our verdict: True.IraqReality Check: Trump would not have had US in IraqBy Eve Bower, CNNTrump again claimed that he would not have supported the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Specifically, he said, had he been president, he ""would not have had our people in Iraq,"" and Captain Humayun Khan would still be alive.Khan was killed in combat in Iraq in 2004, and was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star.Khan's parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, gained national prominence after speaking critically of Trump at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.In reality, Trump was on the record as being supportive of the Iraq War as early as a month before Congress voted to authorize military force in Iraq in 2002, as well as soon after the invasion. He didn't express his outright opposition to the war until more than a year later, in an August 2004 interview.We rate Trump's continued insistence that he would not have led America into war in Iraq as false.TaxesReality check: Trump says Clinton would raise taxes on everyoneBy Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoneyTrump claimed Clinton would be ""raising everybody's taxes massively.""Clinton has proposed raising taxes on the highest-earning Americans, but not anyone making less than $250,000.Independent analyses of her plan find that her proposed tax hikes would squarely hit the most well off.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center noted that ""nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes."" The Tax Policy Center will soon publish an updated analysis of her tax plan to incorporate new tax proposals she made over the summer.Verdict: False.Reality Check: Clinton says Trump would raise taxes on middle-class familiesBy Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoneyClinton said that despite claims that he would cut taxes for everyone, Trump actually ""would end up raising taxes on ... millions of middle-class families.""Clinton was referring to a study that estimated his proposals would raise the tax burden on millions of low- and middle-income parents.A leading Democratic tax policy expert conducted the study, but the conservative Tax Foundation said it replicated many of her numbers and found her conclusions ""reasonable.""The study estimated that roughly 20% of households with minor children and more than half of single parents could end up paying more in taxes than they do today. These groups include about 25 million adults and 15 million children.What explains the tax impact? While Trump would increase the standard deduction and add new child care tax breaks, he would also raise the lowest tax bracket to 12% from 10%, eliminate the head of household status and repeal some personal exemptions.Many single parents could find that tradeoff leaves them with a higher tax bill, the study found.Verdict: True.TerrorismReality Check: Trump says Assad, Russia and Iran are 'killing ISIS'By Jamie Crawford, CNN National Security ProducerTrump said the following about the fight against ISIS.""I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy""But is Trump right that those three countries are ""killing"" ISIS amid the bloody civil war convulsing the country?Backed up by Russian military power, the Assad regime has targeted what it commonly refers to as ""terrorists"" but that has primarily meant various groups who are specifically acting to depose the Assad government. Some of those groups include groups the United States also sees as being capable to assist the primary aim of the US-led coalition which is to dislodge ISIS from its base in Syria and Iraq.Russia insists it has been targeting ISIS forces since it entered into military action inside Syria in support of the efforts of the Assad regime, but US officials have said the majority of Russian airstrikes have been against US-backed rebels battling Assad's forces, as opposed to ISIS. That was one of the reasons US efforts to establish a mechanism where Russia and the United States might cooperate to increase the pressure on ISIS fell part.Earlier this year, Secretary of State John Kerry said Iran had been ""helpful"" in targeting ISIS on their own inside portions of Iraq, but there has been little evidence of Iranian forces targeting ISIS inside Syria in support of the Assad regime. Iranian forces in Iraq did play a key role in some of the critical battles that dislodged ISIS from Tikrit and Baiji, and other portions of northern Anbar province where ISIS had a large presence.Syrian forces backed up by the Russian military have also been accused of targeting civilians inside Syria and launching attacks that have indiscriminately killed thousands of Syrian civilians throughout the course of Syria's civil war -- most recently in Syria's largest city, Aleppo.Because there has been no visible effort by Assad regime forces to go after ISIS, and with the Russian military not using overwhelming force to go after ISIS in Syria, but to focus on going after groups that opposes Assad, we rate Trump's claim false.In Iraq especially, US officials and others have noted Iran's role in targeting ISIS as one of the reasons the group has lost ground there, but the picture of Iran's role against ISIS in Syria is not as clear. We would rate his comment as true, but misleading.Reality Check: Trump suggests Muslim-Americans don't cooperate with law enforcementBy Amy Gallagher and Emma Lacey-Bordeaux, CNNA voter asked what the candidates would do to help Muslim-Americans who are being ""labeled as a threat"" and are targets of Islamophobia.  Trump side-stepped her question by calling on the Muslim community to do more to report terrorism. ""We have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on,"" said Trump. ""As an example in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed and wounded many, many people. ... Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.""We have checked the claim about witnesses to the bombs in the San Bernardino shooters' apartment before and have found that there is no evidence that anyone saw the bombs and did not report them.  There is also no evidence that Muslims in the terrorists' community had information and withheld it.On Trump's larger point,the Muslim community has actually been more effective than law enforcement at uncovering potential terror attacks in America since 9/11. Charles Kurzman, professor at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill conducted a study in 2013 to examine the relationship between Muslim-Americans and terrorism on American soil. He found that ""Since 9/11, 54 Muslim-American terrorism suspects and perpetrators were brought to the attention of law enforcement by members of the Muslim-American community out of 188 individuals where the initial tip was made public. Another 52 individuals were discovered through US government investigations.""  We rate Trump's suggestion that Muslim-Americans don't cooperate with law enforcement false.Reality Check: Trump on radical Islamic terrorismBy Travis Caldwell, CNNIn a response to rising Islamophobia in America, Trump suggested that the terrorist attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino, as well as the events of 9/11, were a direct result of ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and stated Clinton and President Barack Obama won't use the phrase.First, a breakdown of the events Trump mentions.The attacks on September 11, 2001, were coordinated and carried out by al Qaeda, an Islamic extremist terror network. According to law enforcement officials, the San Bernardino shooters may have been self-radicalized, following a warped and extremist version of Islam. The terror group ISIS claimed credit for the San Bernardino shootings, but it has yet to be determined if the shooters and members of ISIS made contact or received instruction. The Orlando shooter cited himself as an ""Islamic soldier"" during his talks with police negotiators, but like the San Bernardino attacks, officials believe the shooter acted as a ""lone wolf"" and was radicalized by online sources. At face value, the attackers noted by Trump were indeed beholden to a radicalized ideology.Verdict: True.Trump also criticized Clinton and Obama for their failure to use the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism.""Clinton, however, told CNN's ""New Day"" in June that she did not object to the phrase when used properly, saying, ""From my perspective, it matters what we do more than what we say. ... And it mattered we got (Osama) bin Laden, not what name we called him. I have clearly said we -- whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I'm happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing.""Obama spoke with CNN's Jake Tapper last month on his particular reluctance to use the phrase, saying, ""The truth of the matter is that this is an issue that has been sort of manufactured, because there is no doubt, and I've said repeatedly, that where we see terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL, they have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse, for basically barbarism and death."" Clinton doesn't object to the phrase so we rate Trump's claim as false. Obama may call the issue a distraction, but he refuses to use the term. That claim is true.Clinton's fortuneReality Check: No, Hillary Clinton did not use her office to make $250 millionBy Theodore Schleifer, CNNTrump was curious why Clinton had not devoted any of her personal fortune to his campaign, like he has to his. But his charge included a curious datapoint.""She made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money,"" Trump claimed.The main way the Clintons made money: private speeches. The speaking fees -- and what Clinton said to financial audiences behind closed doors -- emerged as a major campaign issue during the Democratic primary, with her rival Bernie Sanders repeatedly calling for the release of the transcripts. And the money she made was another sign of what critics said was a disconnect between the life of the secretary of state and the life of the average American.But that number's not right. Clinton delivered 92 paid speeches between April 2013, when she was a private citizen, through March 2015, right before she launched her presidential campaign. But those remarks only yielded $21.6 million -- an average speaking fee of $235,000, according to a CNN analysis of her payments.Trump may have been misspeaking and meaning to reference a different number: $150 million, which is the amount that both Clintons collected during their time after office. When you include Bill Clinton's 637 paid speaking engagements from February 2001 to May 2015, the total Clinton fees rises to $154 million split over 729 speeches.And if you throw in other sources of income, the two Clintons' intake does indeed arrive to the $250 million ballpark. Forbes reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton earned $230 million between 2001 and 2014 through advising and consulting gigs, book deals and speaking fees.But a majority of that money came from Bill Clinton, who has had a much lengthier tenure outside of public office.As for how much she has contributed to her campaign, Clinton has made $1.2 million in in-kind contributions to her campaign.So we rate the $250 million total, ascribed purely to Hillary Clinton, to be false.JobsReality Check: Trump says Clinton 'failed' to bring jobs to upstate N.Y.By Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoneyTrump criticized Clinton's record as a senator representing New York, saying: ""Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.""As a senator, Clinton promised to bring 200,000 jobs to upstate New York. She did not.Upstate New York consists of 49 counties, according to the New York Federal Reserve. It does not include New York City and its surrounding suburban counties.Clinton became a senator in January 2001 and her last full month in office was December 2008.During that time, employment in the metro area of Syracuse increased by 5,029 workers. However, the unemployment rate in Syracuse was 4.8% at the start of 2001 and, like much of the nation, rose in 2008 to 6.7%, Labor Department figures show.Ithaca also had jobs gains but a rise in the unemployment rate.In Binghamton's metro area, employment declined by 3,600 workers during Clinton's term. In Rochester, employment declined by 5,600 workers.In a December 2007 report, the New York Federal Reserve found private sector job growth in upstate New York declined 0.2% on average per year between 2000 and 2005. Job growth did pick up in 2006 and 2007.The region did lose 85,000 manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2006. However, that was in line with the national trend. While Clinton was a senator, the US economy lost about 4.2 million manufacturing jobs due to improved technology and trade. The New York Fed noted in its report that the manufacturing job losses in upstate New York ""appear unlikely to be reversed.""The manufacturing job losses also weren't entirely offset by job gains in lower-paying industries such as health care, education and hospitality, the report found.Verdict: Mostly true.TradeReality Check: Trump on $800 billion trade deficitBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoneyTrump once again blasted America's trade deals and once again gave the wrong figure for the nation's trade gap.""Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It's hard to believe. Inconceivable,"" Trump said.The nation had a nearly $763 billion deficit in the trading of goods in 2015, according to Census Bureau figures.But America is shifting to a service economy and exports $262 billion more in services than we import.That brings our overall trade deficit down to $500 billion for 2015.Verdict: False.Trump's insultsReality Check: Clinton on the people Trump has insultedBy Kate Grise, CNNClinton said Trump has insulted many different groups.""We have seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to 10. We've seen him embarrass women on TV and Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe on the harshest most personal terms. So, yes. This is who Donald Trump is. It's not only women and this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president. Because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims and so many others,"" Clinton said.Let's break down some of Clinton's points.""We have seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to 10,"" Clinton began.In a 2005 interview with Howard Stern, Trump said, ""I view a person who's flat-chested as very hard to be a 10.""He then proceeded to rank a list of celebrity women on a scale from one to 10 as Stern provides him with their names.Stern suggested Trump should start a ""Donald Trump evaluation show"" to give weekly ratings on women.""You know that would be a very good show for Sirius I think,"" Trump agrees. ""You do that for hours and hours. It would get tremendous ratings.""We rate Clinton's claim as true.""We saw him after the debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe on the harshest most personal terms,"" Clinton said.In the days after the first presidential debate last month, Trump repeatedly defended his statements about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.""She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem, we had a real problem, not only with that but her attitude, and we had a real problem with her,"" Trump said on Fox News.Trump went after Machado on Twitter as well -- ""Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?"" We rate Clinton's claim as true.""He has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilites, POWs, and Muslims and so many others,"" Clinton said.Trump on immigrants: ""But you have people coming in and I'm not just saying Mexicans. I'm talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and they're coming into this country,"" Trump said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" last year.During the first presidential debate, Trump said, ""We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants, and they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.""Trump on African-Americans: ""You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?""Trump on Latinos: ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,"" Trump said in his presidential announcement speech in June last year.Trump on people with disabilities: At a rally last November, Trump mocked a disabled reporter by impersonating him.Trump said that he did not know the reporter, so therefore he could not have been mocking him.Trump on POWs: ""He's not a war hero,"" Trump said of Sen. John McCain who was a prisoner of war during the Vietman War. ""He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.""Trump on Muslims: Trump has called for surveillance of mosques, religious tests for immigrants that would prevent Muslims from entering the country and compiling a national database of Muslims living in the United States.We rate Clinton's litany of claims as true."

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/10/politics/second-presidential-debate-international-issues/index.html	"It's perhaps the first time the extremist group that has waged terror across the globe has been evoked to answer a question about a hot mic sex tape. But ISIS wasn't the only global threat the presidential candidates tackled in their vitriolic back and forth that had both US audiences and non-Americans captivated.Here's the key moments in a debate that laid bare the candidates' stark foreign policy differences.Because ISISTrump answered a question from Anderson Cooper about the vulgar language he was caught on tape using a decade ago with a rant about ISIS, mentioning the group at least five times. ""Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We're going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.""He went on: ""We have a world where we have ISIS  chopping off heads and where you have frankly.. drowning people in steel cages. Where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over. When you have so many bad things happening. It's like medieval times."" ""They look and they see it. Can you imagine the people frankly doing so well against us with ISIS and then look at our country and see where it's going."" ""Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it but it was locker room talk and one of those things.""'I know nothing about Russia'Clinton slammed Trump over his alleged ties to Russia amid reports that the Kremlin was behind the hack of Democratic National Committee emails. ""We have never in the history of our country been in a situation that an adversary has been working to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they are not doing to get me elected, they're doing it to try and influence the election for Donald Trump,"" Clinton said. Trump responded: ""She doesn't know if it's Russian's doing the hacking; maybe there is no hacking.""""They think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.  I know nothing about Russia.""""I know about Russia but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there, I have no businesses there, I have no loans from Russia,' he continued. CNN fact checkers say while there's evidence that Russia is behind the hack, Clinton's assertion that it was done to support Trump was just a hunch. What to do about SyriaTrump's split with his running mate Gov. Mike Pence over the possible use of military force in Syria shocked many.In Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Pence said he felt the US ought to establish safe zones and meet Russian ""provocations"" with strength, backing the use of military force if necessary.""He and I haven't spoken, and he and I disagree,"" Trump said at Sunday's debate. Clinton also categorically said she wouldn't put US troops on the ground in Syria. Instead, she favors arming the Kurds and targeting ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Bagdhadi. Russia, Iran 'killing ISIS'US policy toward Syria generated one of the most heated and substantive exchanges on foreign policy. Clinton said that Russia ""isn't interested in ISIS"" and its assault on Aleppo was aimed at destroying Syrian rebels opposed the regime led by Bashar al-Assad. It was an assessment Trump fiercely disagreed with:""I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy,"" Trump said.CNN fact checkers rated Trump's claim as false. How stupid is our country?Trump slammed US military strategy in Iraq in a response to questions about his plan for Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo. He zoned in on the plan for an upcoming assault on Mosul, a key ISIS stronghold. ""They think a lot of ISIS leaders are in Mosul,"" he said. ""So we have announcements coming out of Washington, coming out of Iraq; we will be attacking Mosul in three or four weeks while all of the bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. ""Why can't we do it quietly? Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack.""""How stupid is our country?""ChinaChina has been a favorite campaign trail punching bag of Trump but the country was little mentioned, save for one late exchange over the effects of cheap Chinese steel imports.""It's killing our steel workers and our steel companies,"" said Trump.
