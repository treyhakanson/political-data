All of sudden, two, three weeks before election, someone comes out — it's not like he hasn't been in the public eye for 30 years,"" Trump Jr. said on Charlotte Morning News on WBT radio. ""I think it's probably a typical New York Times smear campaign. ""Trump's son added his father might sue The New York Times over their reporting.""They keep libeling and doing these kind of things I imagine that would be the intention. It's one thing to report the news, it's another to try to smear someone's name time and time again for political motives and political gain,"" he said. ""So I imagine that would certainly be on his mind.""Trump also defended his father for his 2005 comments made on a hot mic, first reported by The Washington Post  Friday, where his father bragged about force himself on women and grabbing them by the genitals. Trump Jr. said he's had similar conversations with many people. ""There's sort of the reality of the situation and then there's how the media portrays it again. So I mean, listen I know plenty of people,"" Trump Jr. said. ""I've had conversations like that with plenty of people where people use language off color. They're talking, two guys, amongst themselves. I've seen it time and time again. I think it makes him a human. I think it makes him a normal person not a political robot. He hasn't spent his whole life waiting for this moment to run for the presidency.""""I think most American people just say, you know what, I've probably said those kind of things myself,"" he added. ""So, we're not happy that he said, that's for sure, I get that but I think it means that he's a human being that he's a regular person like everyone else. I think that's what endeared him to the American public.""Trump Jr. added he thought Friday's revelations were ""nonsense"" and that it was ""disgusting"" the press was talking about it instead of the contents of Wikileaks. ""Over the last 10 days since the Wikileaks stuff broke, each channel has covered essentially nonsense from my father, rumor, innuendo, bad language — they covered that one of the channels I think it said 276 minutes, Wikileaks 8 minutes,"" Trump Jr. said. ""It's ridiculous. You're really suppressing what's really going on in this country with Hillary Clinton and the fact that she sold America out.""'Several women came forward on Wednesday and alleged that Trump had groped them in the past. The allegations came after Trump denied to CNN's Anderson Cooper during the second presidential that he had every kissed or goped women without their consent. CNN has not independently confirmed the allegations. A Trump campaign spokesperson called The New York Times report featuring two women who accused Trump of groping them ""fiction.""""This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,"" said Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller.Trump defends himself against allegations of groping womenMiller added, ""for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all.""A Trump attorney demanded an immediate retraction and apology from the Times in an open letter. Sources tell CNN Trump is drafting a lawsuit against the Times as well as the Palm Beach Post, which also reported on a women who alleged Trump groped her 13 years ago. Separately on Wednesday, People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff said Trump physically attacked her in December 2005 at Mar-A-Lago when she was writing a profile on Trump's one-year wedding anniversary to his wife, Melania. Stoynoff said she regretted not speaking out at the time, but was compelled to come forward after a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape surfaced wherein Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals. A Trump spokesperson did not respond to CNN for comment on Stoynoff's story, but told People, ""This never happened. There is no merit or veracity to this fabricated story.""

1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/liberty-university-jerry-falwell-jr-donald-trump/index.html	"Some student body members of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, posted a detailed letter taking a stand against their university president ,Jerry Falwell, Jr., an early Trump supporter who has invited political candidates like Trump, Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders and Mike Pence to speak at before his students.A student group called Liberty United Against Trump published their grievances online.""We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell's endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history,"" according to a tweet from the group's social media coordinator Tyler McNally.Another member of the group, Dustin Wahl, told CNN in an email that since publishing the letter at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, they had more than 200 signatures from fellow students by Wednesday evening. The students took action so that ""the world understands how many Liberty students do not support President Falwell in his endorsement of Donald Trump.""The letter said that if any Liberty University faculty or staff member had made the comments Trump made on the tape, they would have been terminated.""Because our president has lead the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support,"" the letter states.Falwell Jr. appeared on CNN's ""Erin Burnett Out Front"" on Wednesday evening and was asked about the breaking allegations of groping against Trump from The New York Times. The Trump campaign has denied the claims and asked The New York Times for a retraction.  Falwell Jr. said that he did not know anything about the reports, and reiterated that the Trump campaign is denying the claims.""I take him at his word. I think he's a good man. I know the Donald Trump of today,"" he told Erin Burnett. ""I know that he was -- his first major hire was to bring Mike Pence on as his vice presidential candidate. And he spoke at Liberty University today and he had 10,000 Evangelical Christian young people cheering for him, gave him five standing ovations, and that is the Donald Trump I know.""Burnett pressed him on whether he could forgive Trump if he had lied about grabbing women's breasts and genitals.Falwell said: ""It is not up to me to forgive anybody. I'm not Jesus Christ. It is only Jesus who can forgive. And he can forgive anybody. All of us, we're all redeemable. And like I said, it's -- Jesus was accused of being a friend of sinners and when he was here on earth and it is not up to us to forgive. ""He defended Trump for taking ""all the right positions on all the issues."" Burnett played a video clip of Trump at the Fox primary debate last year when Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly asked him about comments he'd made about women in the past.""I'm a college president. I'm an attorney. He has his own style. He has his own way of saying things. He's a New York businessman. He grew up in a different culture than I did,"" Falwell told CNN. ""What sounds raunchy to me might not sound raunchy to him. But the point is, I think he's a changed man. I think he has seen the pain of the American people. I think the reason that he's come so far in this campaign, in this election is because he is not for the elitist. He's for the average American.""Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence spoke at Liberty University's weekly convocation on Wednesday morning, addressing thousands of students and sharing his personal journey of finding faith and garnering a standing ovation for comments like ""I'm pro-life and I don't apologize for it."" Pence even addressed the tapes of Trump making lewd and sexually explicit comments about women that came out on Friday night.""As a believer we're called to aspire to live godly lives but also we recognize that we all fall short. It's not about condoning what is said and done, it's about believing in graces and forgiveness. As Christians we're called to forgive even as we've been forgiven,"" he said to students sitting in sweatshirts in the chilling morning.Wahl said the student group drafted the letter two days ago. ""We had been planning to make this statement public regardless of Mike Pence, but we timed the launch to fit with the height of conversation about Pence's convocation,"" he said."

Mike Pence, highlighted the email Wednesday during remarks at Liberty University.""If only on behalf of her catholic running mate, Hillary Clinton should denounce those bigoted anti-Catholic, anti-evangelical remarks and her campaign staff should apologize to people of faith and do it now,"" Pence said.Palmieri told reporters on Wednesday that she ""didn't recognize (the email) but moreover ... we are not going to fact check each of the emails that were stolen, hacked by Russian lead efforts in an effort to hurt our campaign."""

Yemen: The 'forgotten war' in the shadow of SyriaThe same warship was targeted Sunday, when two missiles were launched within 60 minutes of each other, but in both incidents they missed the ship and landed in the water. The guided-missile destroyer was not damaged in either incident, officials said.The US warship was conducting routine operations in international waters off the Yemen coast when it was targeted Wednesday, the Pentagon said.  The Houthis have denied carrying out the attacks. 'We will respond to this threat'The Pentagon said its destroyer USS Nitze launched Tomahawk cruise missiles targeting the coastal radar sites controlled by the Houthi group in ""self defense.""Another official said initial assessments indicated all three targets were destroyed, and that the strikes were in remote areas with little risk of civilian casualties or collateral damage. ""USS Mason will continue its operations. Those who threaten our forces should know that US commanders retain the right to defend their ships, and we will respond to this threat at the appropriate time and in the appropriate manner,"" Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement.""USS Mason will continue its operations.""Houthis: Accusations a 'distraction'A Houthi military official said ""there is no truth to these allegations"" in response to Wednesday's incident. Houthi militias had ""nothing to do with this act,"" the Houthi-affiliated SABA news agency reported. After Sunday's reported missile attack, the military had said that the accusations were aimed at covering up a ""heinous"" Saudi-led coalition airstrike on a funeral service Saturday in Sanaa that killed at least 155 people.The US has come under increased pressure over its support of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, as the coalition continues to bombard schools and hospitals.  The US had backed the formally recognized government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whose government has been essentially forced from Sanaa to Aden. Hadi himself is believed to be in exile in Saudi Arabia, as are several senior members of his administration. The Houthis support the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh.Calls for world to suspend Saudi arms salesLast week, the US said it was re-evaluating its support after the deadly funeral airstrike blamed on the Saudi-led coalition. ""The United States, United Kingdom, and other governments should immediately suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia."" Some are calling on the United States to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia.""The United States, United Kingdom, and other governments should immediately suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia,"" Human Rights Watch said, calling the attack an ""apparent war crime."" ""The funeral strike underscores the urgent need for credible international investigations into alleged laws-of-war violations in Yemen,"" it said. The US Senate last month rejected a bipartisan proposal to block a pending $1.15 billion arms sale to Riyadh.Critics of the military deal, which was approved by the Obama administration, complained it could further drag the US into the war in Yemen and contribute to the worsening humanitarian crisis.Humanitarian catastropheThe coalition, which involves several Arab countries, started a military campaign in Yemen last year after Houthis took over Sanaa. The crisis quickly escalated into a war that allowed al Qaeda and ISIS -- other enemies of the Houthis -- to thrive amid the chaos.The conflict has killed about 10,000 Yemenis and left millions in need of aid, according to the United Nations, which has called it  a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""Since peace talks in Kuwait failed in August, the coalition has intensified airstrikes despite criticism from rights groups that the attacks often hit civilian targets with devastating results."

""The corrupt establishment knows that we are a great threat to their criminal enterprise,"" the Republican presidential nominee told supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it."" Michelle Obama denounces Trump for 'bragging about sexually assaulting women'The billionaire savaged his accusers, saying their claims are ""totally and absolutely false."" ""These claims are all fabricated. They are pure fiction, and they're outright lies. These events never, ever happened,"" Trump said. Trump's moment of reckoningTrump's insistence that the women raising new allegations are wrong contrasts with the spotlight he put on Bill Clinton's accusers before Sunday's debate, insisting their stories should be heard. And the sense of paranoia that rang through Trump's remarks -- scattershot, bitterly personal, and devoid of policy talk -- is the type of language that long worried Republicans.Trump's remarks stood in stark contrast to the scathing attack first lady Michelle Obama delivered minutes earlier, saying Trump's words had left her ""shaken.""""It's frightening,"" she said. ""And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts.""Trump's campaign rockedTrump has been rocked in recent days by reports on his treatment of women. The Washington Post on Friday released a 2005 hot mic conversation for ""Access Hollywood"" in which Trump was recorded boasting about how his celebrity gave him license to grope women. During Sunday night's debate, Trump apologized for his comments but dismissed the remarks as ""locker room talk"" and insisted he never actually did such things. However, on Wednesday, The New York Times published the account of two women who described unwanted sexual advances by Trump. It was followed by a third account published in People Magazine.CNN has not yet independently confirmed either The New York Times or People Magazine accounts. The Trump campaign described the entire Times article as a ""fiction"" that amounted to ""character assassination."" The Trump campaign told People magazine: ""This never happened. There is no merit or veracity to this fabricated story.""In West Palm Beach, Trump threatened legal action against The New York Times, saying the newspaper's reports about his conduct with women ""will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them.""""We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time,"" Trump said, without detailing when that time would come. Trump has previously also promised to release his tax returns but has yet to do so. David McCraw, the Times' general counsel, told Trump's lawyer Thursday it will not retract its story.""The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one's reputation,"" McCraw wrote. ""Mr. Trump has bragged about his non-consensual sexual touching of women. He has bragged about intruding on beauty pageant contestants in their dressing rooms. He acquiesced to a radio host's request to discuss Mr. Trump's own daughter as a 'piece of ass.' Multiple women not mentioned in our article have publicly come forward to report on Mr. Trump's unwanted advances. Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.""New York Times to Donald Trump: We won't retractTrump also attacked the People Magazine writer who accused him of making an unwanted advance, telling his supporters: ""Look at her. Look at her words. You tell me. I don't think so."" Trump cast himself as a messiah-like figure backed by a committed movement, and willing to suffer to defeat ""these horrible people."" ""I never knew it would be this vile, this bad, this viscous. Nevertheless, I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you,"" Trump said.Michelle Obama's personal speechObama, who is becoming one of Clinton's most effective surrogates, spoke in deeply personal terms as she criticized Trump at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. She said his alleged behavior is an affront to ""basic human decency.""""I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted,"" Obama said. ""This is a time for all of us to stand up and say, 'Enough is enough. This has got to stop right now.'"" She also rejected Trump's insistence that the 2005 video was ""locker room talk."" ""To dismiss this as everyday locker room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere,"" she said. ""This is not how adults behave. This is not how decent human beings behave.""With 100 days left, Obama looks to check some boxesShe cast Trump as a poor role model for boys and said that strong men ""don't need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful.""Speaking at a field office in San Francisco, Clinton said Obama's speech ""not only made a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election, but about who we are as Americans.""""We already know who Donald Trump is,"" Clinton said. ""What we have to prove in this election is who we are and what we stand for.""DefianceBut in West Palm Beach, the theme at Trump's rally was defiance. Shortly before Trump spoke, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani embarked on a prolonged tirade against the media, singling out the Times in particular.Without directly mentioning the stories about Trump's treatment of women, Giuliani complained about stories based on the claims that he said had ""no support and no evidence.""He charged that reporters are liars and slammed the ""unbelievable, unrelenting and awful way in which the press treats our candidate.""""They don't like Republicans they don't like conservatives,"" Giuliani said. Former Florida lieutenant governor Jennifer Carroll told the crowd that Clinton had chosen to go on a ""bully attack"" by launching a ""gutter campaign,"" prompting the crowd to break out in chants of ""Lock her up, Lock her up.""Swing-state polls show Trump path to WH narrowing""I know that God has used sinners to do his great works. All 12 disciples were sinners,"" Carroll said, accusing Democrats of being ""spineless.""""Why are they spineless? Because they want to take on a soft target, but Donald Trump is going to fight back and fight back hard.""In the crowd, Trump's supporters rejected the new allegations of sexual misconduct by Trump -- saying the Clintons deserve more scrutiny. ""Remember when Bill Clinton had his peccadillos? 'Oh his personal stuff doesn't count, only what he's going to do as president.' Well that should apply to everybody then,"" said Barbara Susco, a 77-year-old semi-retired realtor from Lake Worth, Florida. She suggested -- without evidence -- that women who involved in the new allegations came forward for money. ""How much were they paid? Things happen, you know, in the world of entertainment. Things go on all the time,"" Susco said. Wendy MacArthur, a 61-year-old retiree from Port St. Lucie, Florida, also rejected the veracity of the allegations. ""Well, isn't it strange that all of the sudden they come out three weeks before the election when they've had 20 years with racism and sexism and sexual assault or whatever they were charging him with,"" she said. ""I just think the timing is very strange and it doesn't hold any credibility whatsoever."""	Trump fights for survival as allegations

""I think his statement will be very strong in a few minutes when he comes out (to speak).""In a New York Times story published Wednesday, Jessica Leeds claims Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt while the two were on an airplane more than three decades ago. Leeds said she had never met Trump before.In a separate allegation, Rachel Crooks says that while working in Trump Tower 11 years ago at a company that he did not own, he kissed her outside an elevator after she introduced herself. Trump told The New York Times of both incidents: ""None of this ever took place.""Falwell said he spoke with Trump Wednesday night after appearing on CNN's ""OutFront with Erin Burnett."" Falwell did not elaborate on what specific evidence Trump had against his accusers, besides saying that they were ""emails"" where the women in the story had asked Trump for jobs.""He told me about emails he had from these accusers who wanted to work for him after the supposed event had occurred. And he told me about other email evidence that supports the fact that it didn't happen,"" said Falwell, whose father, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founded Liberty University in the 1970s and was a driving force in the ""religious right"" of that era. The college president said if the alleged acts had occurred, he believes the women would have sued the wealthy businessman. ""Donald Trump's a billionaire. If this had happened, I have no doubt in my mind that the accusers would have brought suits many years ago,"" Falwell said. Trump said Thursday that he will soon release evidence showing that the most recent accusations are false.  ""We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time very soon,"" he said at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""These lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited.""""These people are horrible people. They're horrible, horrible liars,"" Trump added.The nominee accused the Times of ignoring proof Trump's team presented showing holes in Leeds' story. ""This weekend The New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the many many emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years looking for work,"" he said. Trump said the emails show Leeds wanting to attend his rallies and calling the businessman ""great.""""But The New York Times refused to use the evidence that we presented,"" he said. ""If they used it, they would have looked, they would have said 'There's no story here.'""Early Thursday morning, a lawyer representing Trump, Marc E. Kasowitz, sent a letter to the Times saying ""your article is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se.""""We hereby demand that you immediately cease any further publication of this article, remove it from your website and issue a full and immediate retraction and apology. Failure to do so will leave my client with no option but to purse all available actions and remedies,"" he wrote.Late Wednesday night, People Magazine also published a story where Natasha Stoynoff, a writer for the magazine, alleges that she had been physically attacked by Trump at Mar-a-Lago while. She was at the Florida mansion to write a profile on Trump's one-year wedding anniversary to his wife Melania.The Trump campaign did not respond to request for comment regarding that story, but a Trump spokesperson told People, ""This never happened.

One of the alleged incidents occurred in 2005, the other more than 30 years ago.People Magazine published a report later Wednesday night by one of its writers, Natasha Stoynoff, in which she alleged that she had been physically attacked by Trump at Mar-A-Lago while she was on assignment in December 2005 writing a profile of his first anniversary with his wife, Melania.The Trump campaign issued a statement denying the allegations in The Times, saying the reports were politically motivated and threatening to sue the paper.""It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all,"" said Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman.The campaign did not respond to a CNN request for comment regarding the People Magazine story, but a Trump spokesperson told People, ""This never happened.

""It is apparent from, among other things, the timing of the article, that it is nothing more than a politically-motivated effort to defeat Mr. Trump's candidacy.""Trump is also threatening to sue The Palm Beach Post over the publication of another incident of alleged groping.Jennifer Palmieri, Hillary Clinton's campaign communications director, issued a statement in the wake of the report, saying, ""This disturbing story sadly fits everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women. These reports suggest that he lied on the debate stage and that the disgusting behavior he bragged about in the tape is more than just words.""The Times report comes in the wake of an ""Access Hollywood"" videotape, obtained Friday by The Washington Post, in which Trump is heard making sexually aggressive comments about women. He recounts how he tried to ""fuck"" an unidentified married woman before bragging that he is ""automatically attracted to beautiful (women)"" and just starts ""kissing them.""According to The Times, Jessica Leeds, who was 38 at the time but is now 74, said that she was on the same flight as Trump, sitting next to him in first class.She told The Times about 45 minutes after takeoff, Trump lifted the armrest, moved toward her and then began to grope her. The Times wrote, Trump ""grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt,"" according to Leeds' account.""He was like an octopus,"" she told The Times. ""His hands were everywhere.""Conway avoids commenting on Trump's beauty pageant braggingCrooks told the Times she was kissed by Trump when she was a 22-year-old receptionist at Bayrock Group, a real estate investment and development company in Trump Tower in Manhattan.

""I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.""Neither of the women pursued legal action, but both told friends and family, who also spoke to The Times. The newspaper said Cooks described her experience immediately after it occurred while Leeds did so more recently.Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager who is now a CNN contributor, told Don Lemon Wednesday he doubted the events occurred.""I don't think it happened,"" he said on ""CNN Tonight.""

He then leaned in, catching me off guard, and kissed me almost on the lips. I was really freaked out. ... After (the meeting), Trump asked me to come into his office alone. Was really unsure what to do. ... Figured I could handle myself. Anyway, once in his office he kept telling me how special I am and gave me his cell, asked me to call him. I ran the hell out of there.""Since Trump's recorded remarks leaked, he has lost the support from members of his own Republican Party and faced criticism about his past treatment of women.He argued at the second presidential debate that his comments were only ""locker room talk"" and that he never has sexually assaulted a woman."

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/russia-us-election/index.html	"As WikiLeaks continues to publish emails belonging to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, US officials told CNN that there is growing evidence that Russia is using the organization as a delivery vehicle for the messages and other stolen information.The methods of the disclosures ""suggest Moscow is at least providing the information or is possibly directly responsible for the leaks,"" one US official said.US intelligence officials are still investigating the degree of connection between Russia and WikiLeaks but they remain confident that Russia is behind the leaks themselves. CNN attempted to reach WikiLeaks for comment but received no response. WikiLeaks's founder, Julian Assange, has previously denied any connection to or cooperation with Russia. On Friday, former Acting CIA Director Mike Morrell said on a conference call organized by the Clinton campaign that it was ""absolutely clear ... WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2 are working with the Russians on this."" Russia's highest officials are dismissing accusations that Moscow is trying to sway the US presidential election with cyber attacks, speaking out before the latest accusation concerning WikiLeaks was shared with CNN on Thursday.President Vladimir Putin ridiculed such talk Wednesday as ""hysteria.""""Let them prove it,"" Sergei Lavrov told CNN's Christiane Amanpour, waving off a US vow to retaliate with a ""proportional response."" ""If they decided to do something, let them do it,"" Lavrov told Amanpour. ""But to say that Russia is interfering in the United States domestic matters is ridiculous.""  The Director of National Intelligence -- representing 19 US intelligence agencies -- and the Department of Homeland Security leveled unambiguous charges against Russia on Friday. And the comments from  Moscow did little to quell the growing criticism of Russia Wednesday from the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton's campaign.""The kinds of disclosures that we've seen, including at WikiLeaks, of stolen e-mails from people who play an important role in our political process is consistent with Russian- directed efforts,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday.Podesta, whose emails are being published by WikiLeaks, also pointed the finger at Russia.'Work of the Russian government'""It is now clear that the illegal hack of my personal email account was -- just like the other recent, election-related hacks -- the work of the Russian government,"" Podesta said in a statement. ""This level of meddling by a foreign power can only be aimed at boosting Donald Trump and should send chills down the spine of all Americans, regardless of political party."" Trump: Clinton 'has to go to jail'Podesta earlier accused Roger Stone, a long-time adviser to Republican nominee Donald Trump, of having advance knowledge of the recent hack and publication of his emails on the website WikiLeaks, founded by Julian Assange. Stone had penned a tweet in August saying, ""Trust me, it will soon (be) the Podesta's time in the barrel.""I think it's a reasonable assumption to -- or at least a reasonable conclusion -- that Mr. Stone had advanced warning and the Trump campaign had advanced warning about what Assange was going to do,"" Podesta told reporters Tuesday.But Stone rejected Podesta's assertion, telling CNN he ""had no foreknowledge"" of the WikiLeaks publication of Podesta's emails.The accusations and denials are just the latest and perhaps most extraordinary way that Russia has become a factor in the wildly unpredictable 2016 presidential campaign. Ongoing questions about Trump's ties to Russia are now interspersed with Democratic accusations that Russia is actively trying to help the New York real-estate mogul reach the White House.  ""We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,"" Clinton said at the second presidential debate on Sunday. ""And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected. They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.""Trump batted back the accusations at a rally in Ocala, Florida, Wednesday. ""Anything that goes wrong they blame Russia,"" Trump told the crowd. ""We are being hacked because we have people who don't know what they are doing. They always blame Russia."" ""They say Donald Trump is friends with Putin. I don't know Putin, folks,"" Trump added. ""What the hell do I have to do with Putin?""Trump and PutinAt a time when US-Russia relations are the worst they've been in decades, that question -- what does Trump have to do with Putin? -- still lingers.  Trump has called on Moscow to hack into Clinton's computers, downplayed criticism of Putin's authoritarian tendencies, tried to suggest that Russia hasn't hacked US systems and promoted foreign policy positions that jibe more closely with Moscow's than Washington's. He's relied on aides with ties to Russia and most recently, quoted an incorrect Russian news report to raise questions about Clinton. Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable confrontationFor its part, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations formally complained last month about a top UN official's criticism of Trump and right-wing European politicians. Trump actively called on Russia to help him against Clinton in July, when he called on Moscow to find missing Clinton emails from her tenure as secretary of state. ""Russia, are you listening?"" Trump said from the stage of a rally, calling for a foreign country to interfere in an election, an unprecedented moment in presidential politics. And yet at Sunday's debate, the Republican candidate floated the possibility that Russia isn't behind the hacking at all, saying that Clinton ""doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking."" In an interview Wednesday with CNN's Brianna Keilar, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the campaign has no knowledge about the hack. But she said Trump is ""of course"" concerned about the potential of meddling in US politics. ""Are we going to put this back on Donald Trump?"" Conway said. ""Is he the hacker?""After Trump threatened at Sunday's debate to jail Clinton if he wins the White House, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, a fierce Putin critic, took to Twitter to note that Trump seemed to be emulating Putin's style. Kasparov noted that crackdowns on media and political opponents are ""also Putin's checklist.""  Trump's foreign policy positionsTrump has taken foreign policy positions that analysts say would please Russia, declaring in March that he would consider pulling the US out of NATO because it's ""obsolete"" and ""is costing us a fortune."" The 28-member organization, founded in 1949 to defend against the Soviet Union, is the core US-Atlantic security mechanism. In August, Trump said Russia wouldn't enter Ukraine, despite Moscow's annexation of Crimea in early 2014. He later clarified to say he meant that Russia wouldn't enter Ukraine if he were president.  At Sunday's debate, Trump insisted that Russia is targeting ISIS in Syria, despite repeated assessments by US security officials that Russian troops are spending more time focused on moderate opposition groups, including those backed by the US.John Podesta emails: Latest Wikileaks releaseTrump campaign advisers have had ties to Russia. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lobbied on behalf of Russian-backed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich. Carter Page, described at one point by the campaign as an informal policy advisor, reportedly had investments in Russian gas company Gazprom and has publicly criticized the US in a speech in Moscow. Trump campaign manager Conway told CNN's Jake Tapper in September that Page is no longer part of the campaign.  A Trump security adviser, Lt. General Mike Flynn, the retired head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, attended a December gala for the the state-backed Russia Today television network, placed two seats away from Putin, according to Politico. Trump's refusal to release his tax returns makes it impossible to get a full sense of his investments and whether he has any in Russia, but he does have business ties to Russians. Trump has also written about trying to build a Trump property in Moscow since 1987 in his book ""The Art of the Deal,"" signing his most recent deal to build in Moscow in 2013, according to the Washington Post.The Republican candidate worked with Russian oligarchs to stage the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013. And his son Trump Jr told a real estate investment conference in 2008 that ""Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,"" adding that they ""see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."" More recently, the group Democratic Coalition Against Trump posted to YouTube a 2012 interview with Donald Trump Jr. that shows the candidate's son listing various Russian projects the family is interested in, including golf courses and hotels. ""I've been there many times, I've spent quite a bit of time in Moscow looking at deals,"" Trump Jr. said. "	US sees more signs Russia feeding emails to WikiLeaks

Over the course of 13 days in October 1962 he watched and counseled his brother, the president, as John F. Kennedy wrestled with what to do about the fact that the Soviets had placed nuclear-tipped missiles on Cuba, minutes away from American population centers.Could we and the Soviets have really fallen into that yawning abyss? As RFK understand, although the placement of these missiles actually did not eliminate US nuclear superiority in the Cold War the stakes were very high because Cuba had become an issue in the midterm election of 1962. As happens so often in American history, domestic politics drove foreign policy. To show strength, and fend off Republican charges of weakness, JFK had issued statements in September vowing never to permit the Soviets to put ""offensive weapons"" 90 miles from Florida. Kennedy had drawn that red line because he was convinced that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, for all of his characteristic bluster, would never be so foolhardy as to do it. And the Kennedy White House was not alone in assuming that it: The top analysts at the CIA agreed; the Russian experts in the State Department and key members of the National Security Council thought drawing a red line did not involve much of risk.But then the Soviets did it. In fact, as the US government was mulling over the possibility of a Soviet missile installation in Cuba, Soviet ships were carrying 41,000 troops, 42 medium range ballistic missiles, each capable of carrying a one megaton nuclear warhead, 12 tactical nuclear weapons, 80 nuclear-armed cruise missiles and a force of Il-28 bombers with nuclear bombs. When Kennedy found out, thanks to pictures taken by a U-2 spy plane, he realized, that he had no choice but to act tough. ""I would have been impeached,"" Kennedy admitted to his brother, if he didn't do something.The US military gave Kennedy three options:a) a limited air strike;b) a big air strike;c) an invasion of Cuba.Initially, Kennedy was more of a hawk than a dove. He had drawn a red line; Khrushchev had crossed it, and he wanted the Soviet leader to pay. Until October 20, five days after he learned of the missiles and started meeting secretly with his top national security advisors to figure out what to do, Kennedy wavered between launching an air strike or proceeding with the blockade. His brother Bobby was the most effective advocate of not using force, arguing that it would make the United States no better than Imperial Japan, which had notoriously launched a surprise air strike on Pearl Harbor 20 years earlier. But President Kennedy was not convinced. He believed the American people would not understood if he didn't remove the missiles. The turning point came at a special briefing prepared at his request on what an air strike would look like.The US government assumed that 16 of the medium range missiles were operational. When the US Air Force could not assure him that that was all the Soviets had on the island and that even what they had might not be taken out in an air strike, Kennedy realized that the cost of miscalculation -- a sudden Soviet decision to launch whatever nuclear missiles they had left -- was to high to consider an air strike as the opening move in this game of Cold War chess.Reluctantly, Kennedy endorsed a fourth option designed by his advisors, a group known to history and later Hollywood as ""the ExCom."" Kennedy would institute a naval blockade -- called a quarantine -- and insist that Khrushchev remove all of the offensive weapons already on the island. Some in the ExCom saw the blockade as a first step to negotiations with Moscow; others as the initial move before an attack, if Khrushchev refused to back down. On October 22, when Kennedy revealed what he knew of Khrushchev's plan in an ominous speech to the world, no one, including Kennedy knew which road he would take.As we would learn only a little over a decade ago, Khrushchev was ready to give up within a few days into the crisis; but he did not know how. Even in the days when both sides were looking for a way out, there were so many moving pieces that despite the most peaceful intentions, unintended war might have broken out. Not only had the Soviets sent more nuclear-capable missiles to Cuba than US planners had found but they had armed their submarines with nuclear-tipped torpedoes. Just implementing the blockade, an act that was to delay the approach of war, actually involved the possibility of nuclear confrontation because the US Navy had no idea it was playing a cat and mouse game with Soviet sub captains who had nuclear weapons.On Friday, October 26, fears of a US invasion were so great that Cuban leader Fidel Castro ordered US reconnaissance planes to be shot down. Although lacking authorization from the Kremlin, Soviet commanders on the island, who controlled the powerful surface-to-air defensive missiles ringing the island agreed to do the same. The stage was set for the shootdown of an American U-2 spy plane the next day. That coupled with the inadvertent violation of Soviet airspace by another US spy plane put pressure on both Khrushchev and Kennedy to find a quick way to end this crisis before it barreled completely out of control.The end game came in the form of a public US promise the next day not to invade Cuba and a private -- long denied -- promise to remove US missiles from Turkey in return for a Soviet promise to pull out their nuclear missiles from Cuba. Unknown to the United States, the Soviets had intended to leave tactical nuclear missiles in Cuba; but when Fidel Castro so misbehaved toward the Soviets after they backed down, Moscow decided it could not trust the Cuban regime with weapons as powerful as these. By December 1962, they were all gone."	Counterfactual files:
