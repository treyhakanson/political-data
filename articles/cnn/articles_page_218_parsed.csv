""Whether you are a doctor or not, that degree of hyperbole and these words being used is very unusual. People don't write like that. ... 'Strength and stamina are extraordinary' -- what does that mean, exactly?""Even Trump surrogate Dr. Ben Carson said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Wednesday that Trump should disclose his current medical history, as he referred to both Trump and Clinton as ""elderly.""""I think that somebody who is running for president of the United States, particularly if they're elderly, and that would include both major candidates, should disclose their medical history. And I'm not talking about from a year ago or two years ago. I'm talking about currently,"" Carson said. ""Anybody who is elderly should expose their records and we, the people, should know what they are. It's a very stressful job. It's not an eight hour a day job. it's 24/7 and we need to make sure it's taken care of.""Neither the Trump campaign nor Dr. Harold Bornstein, his physician, responded to requests for comment.Trump, at age 70, would be the oldest man to assume the presidency if elected in November, about eight months senior to Ronald Reagan when he was first sworn-in more than 35 years ago. But both he and Clinton, according to a federal life expectancy model from 2013, are statistically likely to live comfortably through and beyond potential second terms in the White House, well into their 80s.There is little in Trump's personal medical history or lifestyle to suggest he is disproportionately disposed to future risks.His status as a teetotaler has been well-documented, going back decades. Dr. Bornstein in his letter wrote that Trump had never used alcohol or tobacco, an assertion backed by the candidate's own statements and independent reporting.Biographer Michael D'Antonio wrote in his book, ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success,"" that the young mogul during his time as an undergrad at Fordham had set himself apart ""by his refusal to drink or smoke cigarettes, let alone experiment with the drugs that were increasingly evident on American campuses.""More recently, the candidate has openly professed and displayed his affection for fast food -- though in moderation. At a CNN town hall in February, he spoke glowingly of McDonald's (""great stuff"") and KFC (""not the worst thing in the world""), while assuring viewers his burger diet was ""very carefully"" calibrated. He has posted images to social media showing him eating both while aboard his private jet.In a December Q&A with People Magazine, Trump said that, unlike what so many others have experienced, he had actually ""lost 15 lbs. on the campaign trail."" ""One of the reasons,"" he explained, ""is that I have big crowds"" and that entertaining them ""is almost a form of exercise."" ""I could see how it could go the other way for some people,"" he added. ""(But) that's only because their events are boring.""But a New York Times story published Monday suggested that his luck had not extended into 2016, saying it was the ""the opinion of some friends of Mr. Trump that he has gained weight recently.""In the past, Trump has cited golf as his main avenue for keeping fit. ""I used to play all sports. I was always a good athlete. I was always the captain of my teams,"" he told Men's Health in 2013, adding that as he's aged, there have been more long walks and golf outings. ""When I play a few rounds on the weekend, I'll come in Monday morning and I'll have lost three or four pounds,"" he said. ""That's very pleasurable exercise, and it keeps you away from the refrigerator because you're out on the course.""Clinton, who says she tries to keep up a yoga routine on the trail, has struck a relaxed pose when questioned about Trump and the conspiracy theories surrounding her own health.""As far as I can tell,"" she deadpanned to Jimmy Kimmel on Monday, ""he is as healthy as a horse."""	Clinton's health is fine, but what about Trump?	['Carson', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Many individuals on the list of visitors are longtime Clinton friends or allies.""It is now clear that the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history,"" Trump said in a statement, reiterating a claim he made earlier in the week. ""We've now learned that a majority of the non-government people she met with as secretary of state gave money to the corrupt Clinton Foundation. ... It was wrong then, and it is wrong now -- and the foundation must be shut down immediately.""Trump kept up the attack while speaking at a rally in Austin, Texas, Tuesday night.""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins,"" he said, adding, ""The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech.""Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, reiterated Trump's call for a special prosecutor to investigate possible corruption.""The fact Hillary Clinton's official schedule was full of meetings with Clinton Foundation donors is further evidence of the pay-to-play politics at her State Department. No one is above the law,"" Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump's running mate, said in a statement.The Republican National Committee also cited the report to hit Clinton.""This is among the strongest and most unmistakable pieces of evidence of what we've long suspected: at Hillary Clinton's State Department, access to the most sensitive policy makers in U.S. diplomacy was for sale to the highest bidder,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.A Clinton spokesman, however, said the AP's report relies on ""utterly flawed data"" and ""cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary's Clinton's schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation.""The spokesman, Brian Fallon, also said the report does not account for more than half her tenure leading the State Department and ""omits more than 1700 meetings she took with world leaders, let alone countless others she took with other US government officials, while serving as secretary of state.""Fallon added: ""Just taking the subset of meetings arbitrarily selected by the AP, it is outrageous to misrepresent Secretary Clinton's basis for meeting with these individuals.""State Department spokesman Mark Toner said a ""wide range"" of outside individuals and organizations contact the State Department through both formal and informal channels.""Individuals, including those who have donated to political campaigns, non-profits, or foundations -- including the Clinton Foundation -- may contact or have meetings with officials in the administration,"" Toner said.Clinton critics have not proven that Clinton or the State Department materially granted any favors to possible donors, but the report and other emerging information is reigniting the firestorm over the foundation. Trump's campaign and Republicans have sought to cast suspicion over Clinton's tenure as secretary of state and argued that foreign donors' contributions to the foundation created inevitable conflict-of-interest questions."

Joseph L. Votel said the CENTCOM ""family"" had been deeply affected by Thompson's death.""I extend our sincere condolences to the family, friends and Sgt. Thompson's fellow service members, as well as gratitude for his selfless and honorable service to our Nation,"" Votel said in a statement put out Wednesday.One other US service member and six Afghan soldiers were injured in the blast on Tuesday. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said he was ""deeply saddened"" by Thompson's death, adding that his thoughts and prayers were also with those injured in the incident.""This tragic event in Helmand province reminds us that Afghanistan remains a dangerous place,"" Carter said in a statement Tuesday.""We will continue to work closely with the government of Afghanistan and our NATO partners to bolster the capabilities"" of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, he continued, ""so they can provide the people of Afghanistan the peace they deserve."""

I cannot say that Mr. Comey has not completed a full investigation but it seems like he has not,"" he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""And I think there is a cloud over this and just because he might conclude there is not a chargeable offense does not indicate that there is no wrongdoing."" ""This is not healthy. You do not use the Secretary of State position to benefit your private foundation,"" the Trump supporter added. A federal judge Monday gave the State Department until September 23 to develop a plan on how to release nearly 15,000 emails and documents the FBI had obtained as part of its investigation into Clinton's private email server. The decision could possibly create a timeline where thousands of emails and documents could be made public shortly before Election Day on November 8.Sessions wants an investigation because he suggested Clinton used her position to possibly ""extort"" money from international governments for her family's foundation.""The fundamental thing is you cannot be Secretary of State of the United States of America and use that position to extort or seek contributions to your private foundation,"" the Republican senator said. ""That is a fundamental violation of law and that does appear to have happened.""Session's comments come the day after Trump called for a special prosecutor to be named to investigate the Clinton Foundation. CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment.FBI Director James Comey recommended against criminal charges last month for Clinton over her use of a private email server, though he did characterize her behavior as ""extremely careless"" with classified material.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/condoleezza-rice-colin-powell-email/index.html	"An aide to Rice told CNN that Rice has ""no recollection"" of a conversation between Hillary Clinton and Colin Powell that reportedly took place at a 2009 dinner party of former Secretaries of State, during which Powell allegedly recommended that Clinton use a private email account. The Daily Caller was first to report that Rice had commented on the issue. Georgia Godfrey, Rice's chief of Staff at Stanford University where she teaches, also told the conservative news outlet that ""Dr. Rice isn't doing any media right now. I can tell you, though, that she has no recollection of that conversation either."" It's unclear whether Rice was present specifically when Powell reportedly offered his advice,  although it was reported she attended the dinner party. The conversation between Clinton and Powell was first reported by The New York Times, based on an excerpt from an upcoming book about Bill Clinton's post-presidential years by Joe Conason. According to the Times, Madeleine Albright hosted the dinner party with other former Secretaries of State -- including Powell and Rice and Henry Kissinger -- to celebrate Clinton's appointment to the top diplomatic post. Each former Secretary offered Clinton advice, and Powell's advice was reportedly to use a personal email account.Powell, for his part, has also said he has ""no recollection"" of the reported dinner party conversation. He pushed back  on the story over the weekend, saying that Clinton's ""people are trying to pin it on me."" Neither Rice nor Powell has made a public presidential endorsement in the 2016 election cycle. Following an investigation into the issue, FBI director James Comey recommended against any criminal charges to the Justice Department last month for Clinton over her use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State -- but Comey did characterize Clinton's behavior ""extremely careless"" in the handling of classified information."

They denied committing torture.Jessen and Mitchell wrote that they ""used facial slaps, abdominal slaps and facial grabs"" on Zubaydah in connection with asking him for information about terrorist operations planned against the United States.Zubaydah's review board representative said Tuesday that the detainee ""expressed a desire to be reunited with his family and begin the process of recovering from injuries he sustained during his capture.""Zubaydah is one of 61 detainees remaining at the detention facility in Cuba. There were 242 inmates housed there when Obama took office.Last week, the United States announced that 15 detainees have been transferred out of the detention facility, the single-largest transfer under Obama, according to Lee Wolosky, the US special envoy for Guantanamo closure."

I think on the one hand, it is part of the wacky strategy, just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you.""Clinton continued, ""On the other hand, it just absolutely makes no sense. I don't go around questioning Donald Trump's health. As far as I can tell, he is a healthy as a horse.""Making light of the questions, Clinton asked Kimmel to take her pulse to show she's in good health -- ""Oh my god, there is nothing there,"" the host joked -- and Kimmel asked Clinton to open a can of pickles to prove her strength, which the former secretary of state did.RELATED: The new birthers: Debunking the Clinton health conspiracyClinton went on to dismiss the false claims by saying that Republicans are taking the campaign ""into an alternative universe.""""I am out here talking about [issues] and then I have to step into the alternative reality and answer questions about am I alive, how much longer I will be alive and the like,"" Clinton said to laughs.On Thursday during a speech in Reno, Nevada, Clinton will ""address Donald Trump and his advisors' embrace of the disturbing 'alt-right' political philosophy,"" an aide said Tuesday.""This alt-right brand is embracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of America which should concern all Americans, regardless of party,"" the aide said.

""Look who came over for lunch,"" the actress wrote.The event at Timberlake's home was a star-studded affair. In addition to the hosts, actress Jennifer Aniston, singer Jamie Foxx and actor Tobey Maguire were all there. Scooter Braun, the talent scout and agent who discovered Justin Bieber, co-hosted the event.Leonardo DiCaprio, the Academy Award-winning actor, was supposed to host the fundraiser, but had to ask Timberlake, a friend, to step in for him when work on a movie in New York got in the way of his event with Clinton.Clinton also headlined two other fundraisers in Laguna Beach Tuesday afternoon, raising about $1.8 million and bringing her total California haul so far to $11.4 million.On Monday, Clinton headlined two more events in California, headlining a 500-person reception at Hall of Fame NBA player Magic Johnson's home and then a dinner at the home of Haim Saban, the owner of Univision.Actors Denzel Washington and Samuel L. Jackson co-hosted the event with Johnson and Bob Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation, co-hosted with Saban.Meg Whitman, the former HP CEO and Republican California gubernatorial candidate, attended the event at Saban's house as well, a source who attended the event told CNN.Whitman, a longtime Republican, endorsed Clinton earlier this month, saying in a statement that she would vote for and donate to Clinton. She paid $50,000 to attend Monday night's event, the source said.The two Monday night fundraisers raised at least $6.3 million, according to ticket prices and attendance figures.Getting celebrities to help with the fundraising process has been an advantage Clinton has had over her Republican rival Donald Trump. Cher spoke at a fundraiser for Clinton over the weekend, and Max Weinberg, of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band fame, is performing at a Clinton fundraiser next week in Washington.

The hit by songwriter Rachel Platten has become an inescapable feature of Clinton's campaign rallies, regularly pumped through loud speakers at each stop. An a cappella version of the song, featuring cameos by celebrities and singers, was even premiered at the Democratic National Convention.
