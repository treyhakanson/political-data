On US soil, those include the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, an attack on a military recruiting center in Tennessee and a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by a couple who had self-radicalized. In Europe, terrorists have struck an airport in Brussels, several sites around Paris and a Bastille Day celebration in Nice in the last year alone.Read the poll resultsThe increased concern about new attacks comes as Americans say they experience more anger and fear when they think about what happened 15 years ago on 9/11. About three-quarters say they feel anger when they look back, about on par with the share who felt angry on the fifth anniversary but significantly above the 62% who said so at the 10th anniversary. A smaller share, 40%, say they feel fear when they think about 9/11, but that too is up from five years ago. Then, just 30% said they felt fearful when considering the terrorist attacks, a figure that stood at 44% in 2006.The percentage of Americans who think about 9/11 frequently or have visited the site where the twin towers once stood in New York City has stabilized since the last major anniversary: 22% say they've been to Ground Zero, about the same as the 21% who said they had visited in 2011. Just about 1 in 6 Americans say they think about the events of 9/11 weekly or more often, on par with the 17% who said so in 2011.The anniversary comes amid a presidential campaign where questions about which candidate would do a better job keeping the US safe have been a central focus. According to results from the same poll released earlier in the week, about 11% of voters name an issue related to terrorism, national security or military policy as their top concern when choosing a presidential candidate, and more voters trust Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism if elected (51% of registered voters say they trust Trump, 45% Clinton).Worries about new attacks around the 9/11 anniversary this year are sharper among Republicans than Democrats, and increased worry among Republicans and independents is largely responsible for the shift in overall worry compared with 2011. Now, 65% of Republicans and 50% of independents say attacks are very or somewhat likely around the anniversary, just 36% of Democrats say the same. In 2011, 47% of Republicans, 41% of independents and 33% of Democrats were that worried.The CNN/ORC poll was conducted by telephone September 1-4 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. For results among the full sample of adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.	Looking back at 9/11, Americans feel fear, anger, worry

The company asked more than 500 people in an online panel to watch and rate ads on a number of criteria -- such as whether they believe the ad's claims and whether it impacts who they'll vote for -- as the company has for each ad released in this year's presidential campaign.  Survey-takers at the center of the political spectrum rated Stein's minute-long ad, titled ""Terrible,"" the most effective political ad released in August, according to the Ace Metrix data.  The spot lays out a central plank of her platform: ""A green new deal will create 20 million jobs, halt climate change and make wars for oil obsolete.""Several of the spots draw contrasts with front-runner candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. For example, Johnson's running mate, Bill Weld, says in one ad:  ""I think of him as Honest Johnson and he would never ever ever tell something to the voters that he didn't think was true.""  Stein begins one of her ads speaking into the camera:  ""Donald Trump says despicable things. But Hillary Clinton has a terrifying track record.""  While the data shows the ads capture the attention of independent voters, they have limited releases. Stein spent only $189,000 to air her ad for a few days in early August. Johnson's campaign only began airing television advertisements this week, and has reserved around $464,000 of ad time this month.  For comparison, Clinton's campaign has spent an average of $7.5 million per week on general election television advertising, according to ad spending data from Kantar Media/CMAG.  The Ace Metrix survey shows the second-most effective spot among participants who are independents and those only loosely tied to a political party in August was produced by the pro-Johnson group Purple PAC.  ""One candidate offends everyone,"" the narrator begins, referring to Trump, and ""the other will say anything to get elected.""In contrast, ""Gary Johnson supports social tolerance, free enterprise, and a sane foreign policy.""  Centrist reviewers said the ad broke through by grabbing their attention, for its relevance and because it drove them to learn more about the candidate.  An ad released this week by Johnson's campaign also scored above-average marks in an Ace Metrix panel.  ""Been There"" -- the ad with the ""Honest Johnson"" line -- centers around Johnson's running mate describing his trust and respect for the man at the top of the ticket, even calling him ""almost painfully honest.""  Survey takers noted the ad provides them with credible information about the candidate.  Ace Metrix asks survey participants to classify themselves as either independent, leaning towards a party, mostly voting for a party, or always voting for a particular political party. The data used in this piece includes voters who self-identified as independents, leaning Republican, or leaning Democratic.  "	Poll: Independents like third-party ads better than Clinton, Trump ads

Christie identified four areas for special focus, the sources said: financial and economic regulations, Obamacare, environmental and energy regulations and labor. The goal will be to have a series of rules Trump can roll back, executive actions he can overturn and other policies he can put in place, either through his executive power or Congress, for his first 200 days in office. Details of the meeting were first reported by Politico.The overview of transition efforts was introductory, largely briefing interested parties on top-level plans. While the operation will resemble the transition effort run for former candidate Mitt Romney, Christie made clear the Trump campaign wanted a ""leaner"" operation with less staff, per the individuals in the room.The meeting also included an ask for fundraising help for the transition, though it was characterized as a ""gentle"" ask. Transitions, which run separately from the campaigns, get some federal funding by law, and the rest is up to the operation to raise. Fundraising is not affiliated with campaign coffers, and is much lower budget. Individuals and corporations may give up to $5,000. Christie told the meeting that the goal is to raise roughly $2 million, with the effort almost halfway there already. A source familiar with the transition effort confirmed those benchmarks, and said the transition did not seem to be having any trouble raising money.While cabinet officials were not discussed, Christie did say the administration would hope to have a few hundred names ready to go on inauguration day to fill key positions. The remaining slots of nearly 4,000 federal positions would be prioritized and filled from there.He was also asked what the administration would look like, in terms of drawing from the private sector and government.Christie emphasized that Trump wants to bring change to Washington, so the breakdown would skew toward the private sector. But he said it was likely to be only 60%-70% private sector, noting that Trump will want people with experience in Washington.  The transition team is also vetting roughly 400 people for its operation at this point, Christie told the room.In what one source described as classic Christie ""candor,"" he also addressed enthusiasm, saying that in the past week, the campaign and transition has seen much more interest and more returned phone calls. He noted that Washington tends to ride with the political tides, meaning enthusiasm ebbs and flows with polling. But Christie expressed confidence that the transition would have a strong team of people to do its work. The meeting was mostly attended by government affairs professionals for financial services companies and trade associations. Christie was introduced by Financial Services Roundtable President Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota.

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/donald-trump-birther/index.html	"""President Barack Obama was born in the United States,"" Trump said brusquely at the end of a campaign event in his new Washington hotel. ""Period.""About 12 hours earlier, senior adviser Jason Miller said in a statement Trump had compelled Obama to release his birth certificate in 2011 to dispel questions about the fact he was born in Hawaii in 1961.""Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States,"" the campaign conceded, a gesture meant to end questions -- which have bubbled up again in the past weeks -- surrounding Republican nominee's role in advancing a fiction meant to delegitimize the first African-American commander in chief. Trump himself, however, had not until Friday publicly said he believes Obama was born in the US. And asked recently about his role in promoting the racially charged smear, Trump went uncharacteristically mum.""I don't talk about it because if I talk about that, your whole thing will be about that,"" he told reporters last week. ""So I don't talk about it.""Here's a laundry list of birther declarations Trump made before he tried to put the controversy to rest:1. ""Why doesn't he show his birth certificate? There's something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like.""- March 23, 2011, on ""The View""2. ""He's spent millions of dollars trying to get away from this issue. Millions of dollars in legal fees trying to get away from this issue. And I'll tell you what, I brought it up, just routinely, and all of a sudden a lot facts are emerging and I'm starting to wonder myself whether or not he was born in this country.""- March 28, 2011, on Fox News3. ""He doesn't have a birth certificate, or if he does, there's something on that certificate that is very bad for him. Now, somebody told me -- and I have no idea if this is bad for him or not, but perhaps it would be -- that where it says 'religion,' it might have 'Muslim.' And if you're a Muslim, you don't change your religion, by the way.""- March 30, 2011, on The Laura Ingraham Show 4. ""I have people that have been studying [Obama's birth certificate] and they cannot believe what they're finding ... I would like to have him show his birth certificate, and can I be honest with you, I hope he can. Because if he can't, if he can't, if he wasn't born in this country, which is a real possibility ... then he has pulled one of the great cons in the history of politics.""- April 7, 2011, on NBC's ""Today"" show 5. ""His grandmother in Kenya said, 'Oh, no, he was born in Kenya and I was there and I witnessed the birth.' She's on tape. I think that tape's going to be produced fairly soon. Somebody is coming out with a book in two weeks, it will be very interesting.""- April 7, 2011, on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe""Note: On April 27, 2011, President Obama made public his long form birth certificate. The Trump campaign in his statement portrayed this as the event that resolved the situation. ""Having successfully obtained President Obama's birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States,"" Miller said.But as the following comments demonstrate, whatever he thought personally, Trump continued to gin up birther issues for years after.6. ""He didn't know he was running for president, so he told the truth. The literary agent wrote down what he said ... He said he was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia ... Now they're saying it was a mistake. Just like his Kenyan grandmother said he was born in Kenya, and she pointed down the road to the hospital, and after people started screaming at her, she said, 'Oh, I mean Hawaii.' Give me a break.""- May 24, 2012, interview with The Daily Beast's Lloyd Grove, responding to an erroneous report about Obama7. ""A lot of people do not think it was an authentic certificate. ... Many people do not think it was authentic. His mother was not in the hospital. There are many other things that came out. And frankly if you would report it accurately I think you'd probably get better ratings than you're getting.""- May 29, 2012, to CNN's Wolf Blitzer 8. ""An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud.""- August 6, 2012, in a tweet more than a year after Obama released his longform birth certificate9. ""Was it a birth certificate? You tell me. Some people say that was not his birth certificate. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. I'm saying I don't know. Nobody knows.""- August 2013, to ABC News  10. ""How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's 'birth certificate' died in plane crash today. All others lived.""- December 12, 2013, in tweet about the death of Loretta Fuddy. 11. ""Well, I don't know -- did he do it? ... Well, a lot of people don't agree with you and a lot of people feel it wasn't a proper certificate.""-May 2014, in an interview with TV3's Colette Fitzpatrick in Ireland, Trump first contested whether Obama had released his birth certificate, then questioned whether its legitimacy.12. ""There are three things that could happen. And one of them did happen. He was perhaps born in Kenya. Very simple, OK? He was perhaps born in this country. But said he was born in Kenya because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid and you got into colleges. People were doing that. So perhaps he was born in this country, and that has a very big chance. Or, you know, who knows?""- May 27, 2014, in remarks at the National Press Club13. ""Who knows about Obama? ... Who knows, who knows? Who cares right now?... I have my own theory on Obama. Someday I will write a book, I will do another book, and it will do very successfully.""- January 6, 2016, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. 14. ""I'll answer that question at the right time. I just don't want to answer it yet ... I don't talk about it anymore. The reason I don't is because then everyone is going to be talking about it as opposed to jobs, the military, the vets, security.""- September 15, 2016, in an interview with The Washington Post."	14 of Donald Trump's most outrageous 'birther' claims

Giuliani spoke for Trump, saying he now accepts the legitimacy of Obama's presidency. 11 of Trump's most outrageous 'birther' claims""Donald Trump believes now that (Obama) was born in the United States,"" Giuliani said. ""I believe it. He believes it. We all believe it. It took a long time to get out.""Giuliani was pressed by the host on whether he had actually spoken to Trump about the issue. ""As per Donald Trump,"" he told Matthews. ""He has told me that he is proud of the fact that he finally got Obama to produce his birth certificate.""Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, echoed Giuliani in an interview Friday on ""New Day"" on CNN. ""He believes President Obama was born here,"" she said. ""There's no question to me he was born in the United States, but he's not been a particularly effective president, and that's what this campaign is about.""CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for confirmation of Giuliani's comments. Giuliani also continued to argue that it was Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign -- and not Trump -- that had initiated questions about Obama's citizenship, though when he was asked for evidence of that claim, Giuliani demurred. ""I believe (Trump) picked up on what Hillary Clinton's campaign said. He pushed Obama. Obama finally produced the birth certificate and it showed he was born in Hawaii. Therefore he's an American citizen.""As both CNN and FactCheck.org have reported before, there's no proof Clinton had anything to do with the claims that Obama wasn't born in the United States and thus was ineligible to be president. The mainstreaming of conspiracy theories about Obama's birthplace was significantly driven by Trump himself, who eagerly embraced rumors in various media appearances throughout the 2012 election.  The issue of Trump questioning Obama's citizenship was resurfaced this week as a result of an interview Trump did with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday. The Fox host had asked Trump if he thought his association with the ""birther"" movement, and the suggestion that the first black president may be illegitimate, contributed to his low poll numbers among black voters. ""I don't know, I have no idea,"" Trump replied. ""I just don't bother talking about it but I don't know. I guess with maybe some, I don't know why, I really don't know why. You're the first one that's brought that up in a while."""	Giuliani says Trump dropped birther theory

After Trump touted 88 retired military figures backing his campaign earlier this week, Clinton's campaign has sought to keep the upper hand, noting her growing list of endorsements.Clinton joked with reporters this week that she has more flag officers backing her campaign, adding, ""but who is counting?""""Here is what is important, I now have more endorsements from retired flag officers than any Democrat other than an incumbent president has ever had,"" Clinton said.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/joe-heck-nevada-senate-race/index.html	"Less than 24 hours later, that response became the centerpiece of a major new ad against his candidacy for the hotly-contested open Senate seat in Nevada, the one Democratic seat Republicans have a reasonable chance of winning this November. It's another example of the risks Republicans in close contests take when they align themselves with Trump.Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former state attorney general, believes she can capitalize on Heck's unflinching trust in the controversial GOP presidential candidate to shake up the race, which appears to be a dead heat.The two are running to replace Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid who has held the seat for 30 years. With control of the Senate up for grabs, the outcome of the race could determine which party controls the Senate.Republicans currently have a 54-46 advantage in the Senate. While there are several GOP seats in play, Reid's is the only Democratic seat Republicans have a serious chance to take over. Several Democratic campaigns have worked in key battleground states even before Trump became the nominee to tie every GOP candidate to the billionaire and some of his most provocative statements.   Unlike Heck, not all those Senate candidates have backed Trump.""At this time, I feel that when you look at the options, the individual who probably has the best ability to rebuild our national defense and change our economy is our current nominee,"" Heck told the Reno Gazette Journal last month.The new ad uses clips from two Nevada Republicans elected statewide -- Gov. Brian Sandoval and Sen. Dean Heller -- each expressing concerns about Trump.  ""Let's be very, very clear, I do not support Trump,"" Heller is shown saying.It then turns to a clip from a TV story from CNN's Manu Raju interviewing Heck as they walk through a basement hallway in the Capitol on Wednesday.""You trust him to have his finger on the nuclear button?"" Raju asks.""I do,"" Heck responds. ""Why do you say that?"" Raju pressed. ""Why wouldn't I?"" Heck answered. Cortez Masto's campaign said it will spend several hundred thousand dollars on the ads, which will air in Reno and Las Vegas.It remains to be seen if the ad -- which implies Trump could be a reckless commander in chief -- will be effective against Heck, who has a long military background. Heck is a brigadier general in the Army Reserves who served twice in Iraq. He is also a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Brian Baluta, a spokesman for Heck, cited the congressman's military experience in dismissing the ad.""This is an ad from a candidate who supports putting Iran on the path to a nuclear bomb, and has no problem with her mentor, Harry Reid, blocking funding for our troops in the US Senate,"" Baluta said. ""If Ms. Cortez Masto wants to make this race about which candidate has the knowledge and experience to keep us safe, then we are confident Nevadans will choose Iraq veteran and Brigadier General Joe Heck.""Also, Heck's trust in Trump may pay political dividends for the Nevadan because the GOP presidential candidate is essentially tied with Democrat Hillary Clinton in a state that President Barack Obama won twice.In the story that aired on CNN that included the Heck interview, several other Republican members of the House and Senate -- including party leaders -- also said they trusted Trump with the nuclear codes.

The collected samples can be analyzed to determine exactly what occurred. Japan's Air Self Defense Force also said it was sending four jets to collect airborne dust for radiation samples.The US Air Force's four-engine Boeing jets are equipped with external devices that collect radioactive material from the atmosphere on filter paper. The planes also have ""a compressor system for whole air samples collected in holding spheres,"" according to an Air Force fact sheet.The Air Force has two of the WC-135 jets that operate out of Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.The United States also has ground stations in the area that will also be taking samples.The Constant Phoenix program originated with Gen.
