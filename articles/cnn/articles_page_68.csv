Now some off them might tune into Tuesday's election night coverage. There are 60 detainees left at the facility and those in good standing have access to over 200 TV channels in various languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Farsi and Russian, according to Lt. Col. John Parks, a military spokesman for Guantanamo Bay. ""They have access to the television 24 hours a day,"" he told CNN. ""Even when on lockdown for maintenance, the televisions are on.""He added, ""The detainees keep up to date on US politics and several of the detainees did watch portions of the presidential debates."" Parks also noted at least one detainee's favorite program is the US television series ""Desperate Housewives.""The detainees could well be interested in the outcome of the election. Hillary Clinton has long supported closing the facility, while Donald Trump has talked about his interest in holding trials of US citizens there, which the law doesn't currently permit."

This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign,"" the Trump campaign said in a statement to CNN.Pastor Thomas Robb, who wrote the article, told The Washington Post that the paper wasn't officially endorsing Trump, but was instead expressing its support for his candidacy.""Make America Great Again!' It is a slogan that has been repeatedly used by Donald Trump in his campaign for the presidency,"" Robb wrote. ""You can see it on the shirts, buttons, posters and ball caps such as the one being worn here by Trump speaking at a recent rally ... But can it happen? Can America really be great again? This is what we will soon find out!""Top GOP official: McMullin's response to white nationalist-sponsored robocall is 'almost as reprehensible'He continued: ""While Trump wants to make America great again, we have to ask ourselves, 'What made America great in the first place?' The short answer to that is simple: America was great not because of what our forefathers did -- but because of who our forefathers were. America was founded as a White Christian Republic. And as a White Christian Republic it became great.""The Trump campaign recently distanced itself from a white nationalist supporter pushing an automated call in Utah slandering a third-party threat in the state, Evan McMullin. But the Trump campaign condemnations in recent days have come far more quickly than in the past, including when Trump repeatedly demurred to CNN's Jake Tapper about David Duke's support, before finally condemning him."

Clinton is also putting money on the airwaves in blue states, seeking to deny her rival inroads into her so-called blue wall of defense.  At the same time, the Republican National Committee has made its first ad buy in support of Trump, putting up $2.9 million in five states -- Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Iowa -- and a new ad referencing news of a Clinton-related FBI probe. ""Now, the FBI has launched a new investigation. After decades of lies and scandal, her corruption is closing in,"" the narrator says, explaining how ""pay-to-play politics"" made her ""filthy rich.""  Clinton's new reservations follow Trump's pledge to spend $25 million on advertising this week, although he is about $5 million short of that target. He would need to increase his spending by about $15 million to honor his pledge to spend $100 million on TV from late September through Election Day.Future45, a GOP super PAC funded by the Adelson and Ricketts families, also plans to spend $10 million on a television campaign in the closing days.All told, the candidates' campaigns and outside groups supporting their bids will spend nearly $75 million on TV ads this week.Clinton's additional funds grow her reach in several key battlegrounds, such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  But she is also buying time in blue states in what her campaign described as an effort to block any Trump efforts to expand the electoral map.  For example, Clinton's campaign is going up in Colorado, where it last advertised in late July, and Virginia, where it last ran ads in early August. She is also running her first ads of the general election in Michigan and New Mexico.  Both campaigns have announced plans to run ads during Game 7 of the World Series Wednesday night."

But he criticized any action that might allow intimations or suggestions -- rather than facts -- to pervade the public's view of the case.""I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don't operate on innuendo and we don't operate on incomplete information and we don't operate on leaks,"" Obama said in the interview, which was taped Tuesday. ""We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.""READ: Turmoil in the FBIObama did not mention FBI Director James Comey by name, although he was asked a question specifically about Comey's decision to make the information public days before the presidential election. And he wasn't outwardly critical of any specific move made by the department, noting that he didn't want to be seen as influencing the investigation.But he did downplay the implications of the Clinton email investigation, saying the matter had been resolved.""Obviously, it's become a political controversy,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is that Hillary Clinton, having been in the arena for 30 years, oftentimes gets knocked around and people say crazy stuff about her and when she makes a mistake, an honest mistake, it ends up getting blown up as if it's some crazy thing.""""I trust her. I know her,"" Obama continued. ""And I wouldn't be supporting her if I didn't have absolute confidence in her integrity and making sure that young people have a better future.""READ: Path to victory is in this mapComey sent a letter to members of Congress on Friday saying his bureau was looking into recently discovered emails that could ""pertinent"" to the investigation into Clinton's use of a private server. The move sent Democrats scrambling in the campaign's final stretch. Many Clinton supporters have accused the FBI director -- formerly a registered Republican -- of inserting himself into the race to affect its outcome, though the White House has said those suggestions are unfounded.Earlier this week, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he would neither ""defend nor criticize"" Comey's decision, and said Obama maintained his confidence in the director's ability to carry out his job.Poll: Neck and neck in FloridaObama, in his interview, avoided wading specifically into the email matter. He said the FBI's previous investigations into the server had concluded Clinton hadn't acted criminally.""When this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable,"" Obama said."

""This is entertainment value -- like bad reality shows,"" Garcia said after he voted for Clinton on Saturday.  In Nevada, the political world faces two separate realities. Polls are finding Donald Trump tied or even leading Clinton. Yet the state's early voting data shows Clinton with a clear lead. The path to victory is right here in this mapAhead of Tuesday's election, Clinton's campaign is aiming to put this battleground state on ice by ramping up such a lead that Trump can't catch her on Election Day. The campaign hopes Nevada will prove its heavy investment in field organizing was worthwhile -- and serve as a harbinger for higher-than-expected Latino turnout that could carry the Democratic nominee to victory in key states such as Florida, Colorado and Arizona.Clark CountyThe key to this strategy: Clark County, the home of Las Vegas and more than two-thirds of Nevada's active registered voters. Trump can afford to lose Clark County by about 6 percentage points -- as long as he bests Clinton in Washoe County, home of Reno, and, as expected, runs up a huge margin in rural counties -- according to a Republican official who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss internal modeling. Hillary Clinton's challenge: Shift focus back to TrumpTo date, Trump is missing that target.Early vote data based on party affiliation and published by the Nevada secretary of state's office shows that as of Tuesday morning, Democrats in Clark County are besting Republicans in early voting by 13.6 points -- or 48,000 votes. (Not all of those Democrats necessarily voted for Clinton, nor all Republicans for Trump.) That Democratic lead is in large part due to an increasingly diverse electorate. Though the state doesn't provide ethnic breakdowns, party officials and liberal groups are bullish -- almost risking overconfidence -- that Latino, Asian-American and Pacific Islander turnout will soar past  2012 levels. That would help make up for the decline in African-American turnout that Democrats are seeing across the nation. ""We've been very focused on making sure we're turning out diverse communities, and I think you can see that,"" Jorge Neri, Clinton's Nevada state director, said in an interview. 2016 vs. 2012Thanks to the state's rules, Nevada offers a rare window into campaigns' ground games in the final days of the election. Every day, Nevada officials offer online updates of the numbers of registered Democrats and Republicans who have cast their ballots. Unlike states such as North Carolina and Ohio, Nevada has not significantly changed its early voting rules in recent election cycles. And early voting is popular in the state, with about 7 in 10 Nevada voters casting their ballots (mostly in person, though some by absentee ballots) before Election Day in 2012. That offers an opportunity to make apples-to-apples, day-by-day comparisons to previous years. What that comparison shows: Democrats are on track to match the results in Nevada of 2012 -- when President Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney by nearly 7 percentage points. Can Trump turn Iowa red?Already, as of Tuesday morning, 511,000 Nevadans had voted -- more than one-third of the state's nearly 1.5 million active voters, and potentially as much as half those who will actually participate in 2016.Of those, 43% are Democrats and 37% are Republicans. That means 31,000 more registered Democrats have voted than Republicans -- a 6-point edge that tracks with early vote numbers at the same point in the 2012 race. It has Democrats talking openly about putting Nevada far enough out of reach ahead of November 8.  ""I would wager in Nevada turnout is so strong among Democrats there Hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Clinton's Culinary helpA key ally for Democrats is the Culinary Union Local 226.Representing Las Vegas casino workers -- dealers, housekeepers, cooks and more -- it is perhaps the nation's most politically influential labor union in its region. Its hundreds of thousands of members are intensely engaged in years-long voter registration and turnout efforts. And in part because of Trump's vague stance on health reform, the union is backing Clinton -- and seeking to turn its diverse membership against Trump. On Saturday morning, a raucous band with a djembe player and dancers fired up more than 150 Culinary Union volunteers ahead of a massive door-to-door effort concentrated largely on the heavily Latino northern portion of the city. The red t-shirts union members wore were unambiguous, saying in large letters across the front: ""DEFEAT TRUMP."" Clinton camp insists it can't be thrown off courseVictor Juarez, a 54-year-old cook at Circus Circus casino who volunteers regularly and knocks on 60 to 70 doors per day, said he's seen race-fueled fights on the Las Vegas streets. ""The anger, the hate -- the people that argue and say, 'Get out of here. Don't speak another language,' because they see you're a different color,"" he said, are fueled by ""what Trump says on TV."" Antonia Guadarrama, a 28-year-old housekeeper at Planet Hollywood, knocked Trump for refusing to negotiate with protesting laborers at his Trump Hotel in Las Vegas -- a beaming golden fixture along the Strip. ""He doesn't want to come to the negotiating table and help out people like me, my mother and my family,"" she said. Guadarrama raised concerns about Trump's business record across the country, saying he is ""a candidate who's running for office who has business here in Las Vegas -- and there are many other states where they're going through the same struggle, with a person who's their boss running for president.""Republicans remain optimisticTrump and Republicans aren't buying it that the Silver State is out of reach. The RNC has nine offices with 67 paid staffers in the state -- fewer than the Clinton campaign's 16 field offices, but a competitive presence. Republicans have also had outside help -- though much of it focused on the state's competitive Senate race -- from the Koch brothers-funded Americans For Prosperity and the Libre Initiative, which courts Latino voters. Chris Carr, the Republican National Committee's political director, said increases in Nevada's early votes are ""pretty much a wash"" compared to 2012.""We both have seen a big leap in terms of raw votes,"" he said. Last-minute pushClinton and Labor Secretary Tom Perez are set to kick off a canvassing effort at the Plumbers & Pipefitters Training Center in Las Vegas on Wednesday afternoon. Libertarian VP nominee: 'I'm here vouching for Mrs. Clinton'Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, will be in Carson City and Reno campaigning for Clinton on Wednesday. And on Thursday, Bill Clinton will join musician Steve Aoki at UNLV. The visits are carefully targeted around a key goal: Driving up early vote turnout in the final three days, since Nevada's polls close for the weekend before Election Day. The Trump campaign has sent Trump himself, running mate Mike Pence, son Eric Trump and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to Nevada in recent days. But no high-profile surrogate visits have been announced for the campaign's final week.  There is some anecdotal evidence that Trump's get-out-the-vote efforts are missing the mark. On Tuesday, Chris Miller -- the chairman of the Clark County Democrats -- said he got a call from a Trump campaign volunteer. It was an ominous sign for the GOP's list of targets for two reasons: Miller is obviously not going to support the party's candidates. And, he said, he's already voted.

""Trump doesn't have much margin for error at all in this race.""While the race is tightening here, recent FBI revelations about a review of additional emails potentially tied to Clinton's private server don't appear to be changing voters' minds -- at least not yet. Smith said it usually takes three to five days before any big campaign issue is realized in polling data.  The latest UNH poll has Clinton up by 7 points in a poll taken October 26-30, capturing opinions of only some likely voters who had heard about the email issue. In a previous UNH poll from mid-October Clinton's lead was 15 points. Smith says such tightening is typical in most races. Republicans, sensing an opportunity to turn the tide, are hammering away at the email issue.  ""There's a culture of corruption that she's brought to the Democratic Party"" says former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who backs Trump. ""It oozes into our elections even here in New Hampshire.""Hillary Clinton's challenge: Shift focus back to TrumpSome Democrats, perhaps hopefully, say the email disclosure may be only hardening support for Clinton. Campaign workers report an increase in volunteers over the weekend -- after news of the email issue was made public. Trump, whose campaign was revived when he decisively won the New Hampshire primary, has visited the state nine times since clinching the nomination. His running mate, Mike Pence, has been here four times.  In recent days, the Clinton campaign has deployed some of its most powerful surrogates. Bernie Sanders -- who handily beat Clinton in the New Hampshire Democratic primary -- is launching his cross country tour for Clinton with two rallies in New Hampshire. And last week, Elizabeth Warren campaigned here with the Democratic nominee in a powerful bid for female voters. New Hampshire, with more female than male voters, has for several years trended Democratic and tends to elect more women. The state's current governor, senators and one of its two representatives are female. Clinton is pushing her advantage over Trump directly with women but also looking to cut into his lead among men by targeting New Hampshire fathers who have daughters. Clinton campaign workers say they are digging through voter notes and records back to July trying to identify fathers who have daughters. Campaign aides say they are looking at that ""persuasion universe"" of men who may be predisposed to support Clinton.  ""There are an awful lot of men out there, particularly those that have daughters,"" said Clinton adviser Terei Norelli and former speaker of the state House. They ""understand women being able to live to their full potential.""For Republican campaign worker Paula Tarta, Trump's lewd behavior and disparaging remarks about women are just ""men talking."" She believes Trump is the right candidate to ""drain the swamp"" -- short-hand for bringing widespread change to current politics. ""I think it's gonna take a tough personality to get in there"" she says, ""he's a strong guy.""Clinton camp insists it can't be thrown off courseBoth campaigns are showing a high degree of enthusiasm and support. Republicans say they've knocked on 1.4 million doors and made 1.3 million phone calls.  Democrats counter their 12,500 active volunteers have knocked on nearly 600,000 individual doors and made over 2 million phone calls. New Hampshire's entire population is only 1.3 million.Television campaign ad spending has been heavy and will get heavier in the final few days.  Kantar Media, which tracks ad spending, shows Clinton and her super PAC collectively spent around $11.9 million so far in the general election and have reserved time for another $1.8 million in ads through Election Day.  Trump and his super PAC have spent $3.9 million and have reserved $1.7 million in ad time for a blitz in the closing days. Smith, the pollster, said Trump has to do better with women here and increase his support even among Republicans, where he's running with only 80% support. ""He needs to have 90% plus the Republicans voting for him"" says Smith.Sununu puts it more bluntly.  ""The Electoral College map is in a mess,"" says the former governor with his trademark grin. ""You have Hillary going to red states. You have Trump going to blue states. Unless (Trump) gets another surprise state to fill the gap, New Hampshire may be the difference."""

The political opportunities available to women when centenarians were born were so limited that some of them, like Estelle Liebow Schultz, never considered that a woman would one day serve in the White House.""I never thought much about a woman being president, or about any women who might have been good presidents. There were no role models for that,"" the 98-year-old wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Tuesday. ""When Hillary Clinton was in the White House as first lady, I never imagined her running for president. But I also never thought much about whether we would have a black president before I voted for Barack Obama in 2008.""And while the supporters are quick to acknowledge Clinton's 30 years of public service as a motivation for their support, they aren't shy about acknowledging that gender influenced their decision.""I think women do bring something different to office, a sensitivity that most men don't have,"" said Schultz, an educator. ""I saw the election of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May. Merkel, May and Hillary would be a wonderful triad to rule the world."" ""Maybe they'd be able to bring about some peace and quality growth that hasn't happened yet,"" she added. At 103, Ruline Steininger became one of the first people in Iowa to vote in person for Clinton during early voting in September, a day she didn't take for granted that she was able to see. ""I'm going to help all the way. I'm voting today,"" she told CNN in September. ""I'm not taking any chances and leaving it 'til the election. When you're 103, you make every minute count.""Steininger, a former school teacher, wrote Clinton earlier this year to share what it was like witnessing the first African-American president -- Obama -- and the first Catholic president -- John F. Kennedy -- move into the Oval Office.""In my second century, I look forward to seeing a woman president,"" she wrote. Jerry Emmett remembers going to the polls with her mother to cast her first vote. The retired educator was born in 1914 and has spent a century watching opportunities open up to women that were previously closed because of their gender.""We all walked out in the middle of the street and cheered, like they're cheering here — because my mother was going to get to have a say! That was something,"" Emmett told the Arizona Republic newspaper. Emmett, honorary chairwoman of the Arizona delegation to the Democratic National Convention, is known by many for her impassioned follow-up to Arizona Rep.

The study adds that Latinos will cast about 20% of the votes in that state on November 8, and that some 500,000 of those votes will come from the I-4 corridor.The number of evangelical Latinos is rising. A report by Pew Research Center found in 2013 that 16% of Latinos identify as evangelicals an increase from 2010 when only 13% did according to the CUNY study.That growth would be good news for the GOP who generally speaking enjoys the backing of the religious right. In 2006, the Republican Party enjoyed a lead among Latino voters in Florida. Back then 37% of the Latino electorate was registered as Republican. This year Republican affiliation has dropped to 26% compared to almost 39% registered as Democrats and 33% registered as independent.RELATED: Political Prediction Market: Clinton's chances for the White House dipBut the conservative values championed by the Republican Party that appeal to evangelicals could be lost this year by the party's nominee for president.
