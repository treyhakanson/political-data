He also criticized Trump for giving a more moderate immigration message to the Mexican leader, before delivering a fiery speech hours later to an American audience.""Donald Trump did a kind of photo op fly-by, where he didn't even have the nerve at the last minute to bring up this issue about the wall,"" Kaine told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""This is the central piece of his campaign -- immigration and deportation, and we're going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. But when he looked President Peña Nieto in the eye, he couldn't even bring that up.""Trump said Wednesday that the payment for the proposed border wall didn't come up during his meeting with Peña Nieto, but the Mexican president disputed that assertion. ""That was a choke, and I think it shows that diplomacy is not for amateurs. Donald Trump's an amateur,"" he added.""But isn't diplomacy about the soft sell?"" Cuomo asked.Kaine saId: ""I think diplomacy is primarily about honesty and candor, and standing up for the values that you believe in. So Donald Trump's been saying for months, we're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for it -- if he really believed that, when he was sitting down with President Peña Nieto, why not even bring that up? Then he goes back, and then to the hometown audience, he gives this fiery speech, language of division, you know?""Kaine also said that Clinton would pursue immigration reform ""in the first 100 days of the administration,"" modeled after the ""pillars"" of the Senate's 2013 attempt at immigration reform with the ""Gang of Eight"" bill. The Virginia senator also hit Trump for his plan to target sanctuary cities. ""When Donald Trump kind of goes after these phantom sanctuary cities and talks about how bad they are, basically what he's going after is police chiefs,"" he said. Citing his experience with the issue as a former mayor and governor in Virginia, Kaine said that local law enforcement explained to him that ""if the immigrant community starts to see us as immigration officials, they won't call and complain about crimes in their neighborhood, they won't be witnesses in cases."" Kaine argued that ""instead what you need to do is work with the community to protect and serve them, and let (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) do their job.""Kaine also responded to criticism that the Clinton campaign has been inaccessible to the press -- symbolized by the campaigns ongoing refusal to hold a press conference, a trend that has continued for 271 straight days. The Virginia senator pointed to Clinton's appearance at a press event with the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists as an example of a press conference, and argued that the campaign ""talks to the press every day."""

We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths,"" Trump said in Phoenix. ""Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.""Sanctuary cities have previously come under fire for not cooperating with federal immigration authorities. They have existed since the 1980s, and returned to the spotlight last year after a 32-year-old San Francisco woman was allegedly killed by an undocumented immigrant with a felony record who was deported five times. Her family has filed a federal lawsuit that names San Francisco, a sanctuary city, for ""their failures to perform mandatory duties.""Read: San Francisco death: Kate Steinle's family files lawsuitTrump has made Kate Steinle's death a rallying cry for his immigration policies. He said Wednesday that on his first day in office, he would ask Congress to pass ""Kate's Law ... to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences.""He also had parents whose children were killed in sanctuary cities join him on the stage.'Going after police chiefs'Sen. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate, countered Trump's argument on Thursday morning, saying the U.S. should prioritize the deportation of violent criminals. He told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" that he trusts police chiefs to keep their communities safe.""When Donald Trump kind of goes after these phantom sanctuary cities and talks about how bad they are, basically what he's going after is police chiefs,"" Kaine said.Sanctuary policies increase the public's safety, said the former Virginia governor. He told Cuomo of how he was advised not to let cities work more closely with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. ""My law enforcement officials, who are tough law enforcement people, came to me and said do not do this, because if the immigrant community starts to sees us as immigration officials, they won't call and complain about crimes in their neighborhood,"" Kaine said.  ""They won't be witnesses in cases. Instead, what you need to do is work with the community to protect and serve them and let (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) do their job."" So what is a sanctuary city?Sanctuary cities -- a controversial term that supporters don't like -- generally have policies or laws that limit how much local law enforcement and government agencies can work with federal authorities on immigration matters. Some states and counties have similar policies. There's no legal or unified definition for these places.More than 200 state and local jurisdictions have policies that call for not honoring ICE detention requests, the agency's director, Sarah Saldana, told Congress last year.Read: CNN exclusive ride along with ICE team arresting undocumented immigrantsThey are mainly located on the West Coast, in the Northeast, as well as in Florida, Iowa, New Mexico and Colorado, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates curbing immigration. These jurisdictions rejected more than 17,000 ICE requests to gain custody of immigrants in the 19 months ending September, 2015.The sanctuary movement is said to have grown out of efforts by churches in the 1980s to provide sanctuary to Central Americans fleeing violence at home amid reluctance by the federal government to grant them refugee status. They became popular in more diverse locales to counter what officials there saw as overzealous federal immigration policies, particularly against those arrested for minor, non-violent crimes.Critics, however, say that sanctuary cities endanger public safety by serving as a haven for criminals, who know they are less likely to be deported in these places. ICE officials say thousands of undocumented convicted criminals are released onto the streets every year."	Donald Trump condemns sanctuary cities, but what are they?

""I expressed that we deserve respect, that we are honest, hardworking people, that we value our families and the culture of effort.""Peña Nieto and Trump met in Mexico City Wednesday on a whirlwind visit ahead of Trump's major immigration speech in Arizona. In public, Trump and Peña Nieto mostly struck a friendly tone, though acrimony later broke out over whether the pair had discussed Mexican payment for a US-Mexico border wall, a trademark Trump policy.""I was also very clear in my conversation with Trump on the border: Mexico will not pay for any wall,"" Peña Nieto wrote.Trump has disputed Peña Nieto's account, and in his speech on Wednesday he declared, ""Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%.

I look forward to our next meeting. #TrumpTrain #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpPence16"" Trump wrote in the post.A Mexican government official and a source close to the Mexican government both tell CNN that the idea for the invitations for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto came from the Finance Ministry.According to the source close to the government, Mexico wants to show it can work with Trump if he wins. Finance Ministry officials hope that having Trump in Mexico will calm down investors who have been fleeing. The Mexican Central Bank registered more than $11 billion in capital outflows in the first half of 2016. The visit was seen as an attempt to prevent the peso from falling. Up to now, when Clinton leads in the polls, the peso strengthens; the opposite happens when the polls tighten.According to the Mexican government official, the Foreign Ministry was not aware of the invitations to Trump and Clinton. In fact, Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz and the undersecretary for North America, Paulo Carreño, were in Milwaukee on Tuesday opening the new Mexican Consulate, and she flew back Tuesday night when Trump posted his tweets.

Republican nominee Mitt Romney won the state in 2012 after President Barack Obama won it in 2008.NextGen's plan is to invest over $500,000 to turnout the 200,000 college-aged voters on 10 campuses in North Carolina with the hope of taking back the United States Senate from Republicans and ""electing a pro-climate majority.""Steyer, through NextGen and direct donations, has put himself among the most prolific Democratic donors and activists. Steyer spent over $70 million in the 2014 midterms and tells CNN he expects to spend more this year.""We will end up spending more than that much money this year. I don't now how much,"" Steyer said. ""You have to be willing to do what it takes and it is still August and there is a lot of water to go under the bridge. I am sure we will spend more than 2014.""One goal that Steyer hopes NextGen organizers will accomplish is convincing people who used to support Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign that they vote counts and that they should get engaged in the 2016 race, even if their top choice suspended his campaign.""I think there are some Sanders voters who feel ... like they don't want to vote because if they are not going to get what they want, they would rather it turn out badly,"" Steyer said, calling that view a ""naive belief that four really bad years would bring us to a better political outcome"" in the future.Efforts aimed at college campusesThe key to winning the Tar Heel State, Steyer said, is young people.""The whole reason we are doing this is we believe that this is an incredibly important group of people and that we can facilitate a field operation, facilitate conversations that will make them aware of how important their voice is,"" Steyer said.NextGen will begin organizing at Appalachian State University, East Carolina University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the coming weeks.

Clinton currently has two offices in Arizona.Clinton's investment states like Arizona and Georgia -- another state the campaign pledged to spend more on organizing -- is less about a sure-fire belief that Clinton will win them, but rather to expand the battleground map and make Trump fight hard for those two red states. The hope within Clinton's inner circle is that their talk of putting the states in plan will force the Trump campaign to consume valuable time and money it could be devoting in more solidly swing states like Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. And if Clinton is within striking distance in Arizona, Trump already has a narrow path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win.While Clinton world is making this foray into the two states, Priorities USA, her top dollar super PAC, maintains that it has no plans to spend in Arizona.The group announced on Wednesday a plan to work with three Latino organizing groups to air $3 million worth of ads in Florida and Nevada aimed at turning out Latino voters.

The GOP candidates are also leading their Democratic opponents.  Trump's abysmal poll numbers among Hispanic voters are a factor House Republicans fear could be a drag in several races around the country. But in Nevada's third congressional district, a seat Democrats targeted and where Hispanic voters make up roughly 15% of the vote, the GOP candidate, businessman Danny Tarkanian, currently leads Democratic opponent Jacky Rosen by 12 points in a poll that also includes third party candidates. The same poll, done by the Tarrance Group and the NRCC, has Clinton ahead of Trump in this district by 3 points.Trump on immigration: No amnesty, no pivotCalifornia, a reliably blue state where Democrats are hoping to make some key gains, is an area where House Republicans -- at least for now -- appear to be holding their own in some districts with sizable Latino voting blocs. Recent polling by Public Opinion Strategies and the GOP campaign committee shows that in the 7th congressional district in the Sacramento area -- one that political handicappers view as an evenly split race -- the Republican challenger, Scott Jones, is essentially tied with Democratic Rep. Ami Bera. The same polls show Clinton leading Trump narrowly there.   Iowa GOP Rep. Rod Blum is one of his party's most endangered incumbents. Earlier this year, he tweeted out comments in which he essentially rooted for an economic recession in Washington, and Democrats often point to his membership in the conservative House Freedom Caucus as being out of step with his middle of the road district. The many versions of a Donald Trump meetingDespite Democrats efforts to link Blum to Trump with digital advertising earlier this summer, Blum currently leads Monica Vernon in polling done earlier this month by 7 points according to his campaign's internal polling. The same poll shows Trump trailing Clinton in the district by 8 points.House Speaker Paul Ryan's home state of Wisconsin is home to another race where the GOP candidate is doing far better in the polls than Trump. In an open seat in Wisconsin's eighth district, where GOP Rep. Reid Ribble is retiring, GOP candidate Mike Gallagher holds a 52%-36% lead over the Democratic candidate, Tom Nelson, according to internal polling by Gallagher's campaign by Public Opinion strategies and the NRCC. Trump has a much slimmer 3 point lead over Clinton in the district.   House Republican candidates in these races and others are working to put more distance between themselves and Trump, and even walk back earlier expressions of support. In Jones' case, he pledged earlier this year he would back Trump, but eased off that in a radio interview in August after the fallout this summer from Trump's attacks on a Gold Star family.  Speaking with KFBK AM/93.1 FM, Jones said about his vote in November for president, ""I don't know what I am going to do, to be honest with you.""Democrats have continually pressed for Arizona GOP Rep. Martha McSally to publicly say whether she supports Trump, but she has managed to avoid questions. Two years ago, McSally won her Tucson-area seat by just 167 votes following a recount. But recent polling by McSally's campaign and the NRCC, conducted before this week's primary to determine whom her Democratic opponent would be, shows her leading either Democratic challenger by nearly 20 points, while Trump is losing to Clinton in the district by 2 points.Prominent Latino withdraws support from Donald TrumpTicket splitting in a presidential year is rare, but some Republicans believe in this odd election cycle  voters view Trump in a completely different category than congressional candidates.""House Democrats' and the DCCC's strategy of running a single note, one-size-fits-all campaign is failing, and is just another example of how out of touch they are and why they will continue to flounder in the minority,"" Katie Martin, spokeswoman for the NRCC told CNN.She added: ""Voters have seen firsthand that their Republican member of Congress has their back, and they will reward that hard work this fall."" With a large roughly 60 Republican majority in the House, the math is tough for House Democrats to retake the chamber -- they need to pick up 30 seats. But party strategists downplay GOP polls at this point in the race, arguing they don't account for ""informed voter"" input -- surveys in which pollsters give more information about the candidates and their stances on issues before assessing match-ups between candidates.   One senior House Democratic strategist familiar with Democratic polling conceded to CNN that while many incumbents and GOP candidates in open seat races are currently leading, they believe GOP support is ""soft"" and polls will shift in the fall when more voters tune into races below the presidential level.Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is holding up the Trump's candidacy as the reason more people are keeping their eyes on the battle for the House. In a recent presentation to Democratic donors at a retreat hosted in Napa Valley by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Lujan outlined 50 to 60 GOP seats he believes are in play now, according to a senior House Democratic source familiar with the discussion. He stressed that 10 of these districts -- in places like Minnesota, Michigan and wealthy northern New Jersey suburbs -- are places Democrats have some traction because of Trump's negative approval ratings.In a statement to CNN, Lujan rejected the notion that House Republicans can separate themselves from the top of the ticket, saying, ""it's undeniable that this is a nationalized election dictated by Donald Trump, and House races are shifting based on forces larger than the individual districts themselves.""The New Mexico Democrat pointed out the seats he views as competitive ""just so happens to be where Donald Trump is doing the worst.""  Without predicting the House could turn blue, Lujan said, ""House Democrats have great reason for optimism this fall.""There is still another 68 days until the election, and Republicans concede that Trump's erratic and unpredictable campaign could still shift the political map. Democrats pulled in more than $12 million in July, after a successful national convention nominating Clinton, with the GOP raising just $4.6 million. There is no evidence right now that skittish GOP donors who aren't funding Trump's presidential race are actually writing big checks to House Republicans.And despite the polling, post Labor Day television advertising in many of these races could affect the matchups. While Democrats raised more money during the summer, both House campaign committees have roughly the same amount of cash on hand heading into the fall. The NRCC has $64 million, and the DCCC has about $62 million. Outside groups are also starting to ramp up their campaigns on the airwaves.The biggest question in November will be turnout. If Clinton's supporters are more motivated and GOP voters who now say they are prefer Republican House candidates decide to stay home instead of pulling the lever for Trump, the leads the GOP now holds in swing districts across the country could be wiped away."

He was given 52 months in prison Thursday by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia. Guccifer was famous for hacking into an email account of a member of the Bush family, revealing family photos of former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, including the younger Bush's penchant for painting. He also hacked into the email account of Clinton friend and adviser Sidney Blumenthal, publishing correspondence between the two and revealing Clinton's private email server that she used as secretary of state. The DNC hack: What you need to knowHe later bragged in an interview that he had hacked Clinton's emails directly, but FBI Director James Comey told Congress this summer that Lazar later admitted to officials that was a lie. According to the Justice Department, Lazar admitted to hacking about 100 American victims, including the Bush family, Blumenthal, as well as former secretary of state and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell. Lazar was extradited to the US from Romania in April. While the original Guccifer has been awaiting sentencing in jail, a second hacker has adopted his moniker to release sensitive documents online.Under the name ""Guccifer 2.0,"" someone has been releasing documents obtained by hacking Democratic groups, including the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Those releases are suspected to be the work of hackers connected to the Russian government, who have invented this persona in order to cast doubt on their culpability and influence the US presidential election, according to a nearly unanimous consensus among cybersecurity researchers in the private sector. The US has not made any official accusations toward Russia for the hack. "	Bush family hacker 'Guccifer' gets 4 years in prison
9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/politics/donald-trump-immigration-top-lines/index.html	"But amid the hardline bluster, Trump didn't repeat his previous commitment to round up and deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the United States -- focusing instead on a narrower subset who have committed crimes within the country, and pointedly insisting those already here will have no path to citizenship. In his highly anticipated speech in Phoenix, Trump embraced a hardline conservative position -- painting a bleak picture of the impact of immigration, rallying the Republican base and defending his signature proposal: a wall on the US-Mexico border. But the speech might have done little to appeal to the broader electorate -- especially suburban white voters who could be crucial on Election Day.Trump: 'There will be no amnesty'Here are the seven quotes that defined Trump's speech, and why they mattered: ""Anyone who is in the United States illegally is subject to deportation.""Trump repeatedly emphasized that his first focus would be deporting undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes in the United States. But the big question entering Wednesday night's speech was whether he'd stand by his calls for mass deportations -- including families that hadn't violated additional laws. This was Trump's way of blurring the lines and shifting to a conventional hardline stance more consistent with his party's leaders on Capitol Hill. He suggested that undocumented immigrants who are caught will be deported -- with no exceptions -- but didn't directly call for actions that would lead to the mass deportations of all 11 million in the country. Instead, he made clear that their legal status would not change under his presidency. Clinton: In Mexico 'Trump just failed his first foreign test'""For those here illegally today who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined today,"" the Republican presidential nominee said.""Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall."" Trump traveled to Mexico City and met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto earlier Wednesday -- but the two wound up telling different stories about their meeting. Trump told reporters they didn't discuss who would pay for the border wall he's proposing; Nieto tweeted that he told Trump Mexico wouldn't foot the bill. It was clear Trump was trying to avoid attacking Mexicans generally, and keep his focus on undocumented immigrants. But he wasn't backing away from the proposal that has animated his campaign. ""They're great people, and great leaders,"" he said of Mexicans during his Phoenix speech, ""but they're going to pay for the wall.""""Maybe they'll be able to deport her."" Trump's rhetoric would have fit right into the Republican primary. His speech was red meat for the GOP base -- exemplified by this joking suggestion that immigration officials boot Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from the country. ""It's our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us."" By asserting authority to pick and choose immigrants, Trump was defending some of his most controversial campaign proposals -- including a ban on Muslims, which he called for and has not yet disavowed, and a more targeted restriction on immigrants from countries that don't satisfy his vetting requirements.""Within ICE I'm going to create a new special deportation task force.""Trump had previously called for a ""deportation force."" He wasn't backing away from that terminology on Wednesday night. However, again, Trump shifted his emphasis -- saying those officers would work with local and state law enforcement officials to round up criminals immediately, rather than suggesting they'd boot all undocumented immigrants, regardless of their actions within the United States. ""If we can save American lives, American jobs and American futures, together we can save America itself."" Immigration has long been Trump's signature issue -- and he used the speech to pitch it as the most important one in 2016's presidential election, too. He brought the parents of Americans slain by undocumented immigrants onto the stage, asking them to briefly tell their stories. And he cast immigrants as a primary reason workers -- including African-Americans and Latinos -- have struggled to find jobs. ""Anyone who tells you the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.""Trump's calculation is that he needs the blue-collar worker in Ohio or Pennsylvania much more than the new Latino voter in Colorado or Arizona. He made clear that he isn't concerned about the human impact of deporting undocumented immigrants -- including so-called ""Dreamers,"" or those who were brought into the United States as children. Trump insisted he'd revoke President Barack Obama's executive actions allowing those immigrants to remain in the country. "	7 lines that defined Trump's immigration speech
