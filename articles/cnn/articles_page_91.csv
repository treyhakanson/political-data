A day after the assault on Iraq's second-largest city began, US forces are visibly providing a supporting role to the local troops. Approximately 100 to 200 US Special Operations Forces in northern Iraq are working as advisers to Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga units. A small number of US forces will serve as forward air controllers to call in the locations of ISIS targets for airstrikes. There are also US artillery units at locations both north and south of Mosul that are striking targets.US Special Forces have the authority to go further into the field than they have in the past to accompany relatively small Iraqi units, but it is not clear that has yet happened in the Mosul battle. US troops are required to stay in positions on the battlefield that provide the least chance of coming under attack.But despite those restrictions, three US service members have been killed over the past year in operations targeting ISIS in Iraq, and the danger for US troops is likely to grow as the Mosul offensive goes forward.""They may be as far forward as 500 meters outside the range of small arms, but that does expose them to mortar fire. It does expose them to artillery fire,"" noted retired US Army Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt. ISIS are believed to have an elaborate network of booby-traps throughout the city to greet Iraqi forces, as well as a network of tunnels -- some big enough to ride a motorcycle through.Iraqi forces have come a long way from their loss of Ramadi in western Anbar province in May 2015, when Defense Secretary Ash Carter told CNN that Iraqi forces showed ""no will to fight"" in Ramadi. Following a later offensive that dislodged ISIS from Ramadi, Iraqi forces also took back the key cities of Fallujah, Baiji and others on the march closer to Mosul -- ISIS' largest remaining Iraqi stronghold and home to over a million people.But even if ISIS loses its grip on Mosul, analysts who follow the situation say there likely will not be many celebrations in the immediate aftermath.""There is a lot of fighting left to do,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a CNN military analyst. ""ISIS will still be present, and it will take a generation to get rid of these ideologues.""And Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander of US forces in Iraq and Syria, also signaled Monday that what lay ahead for Iraqi forces in Mosul would not be easy.""This may prove to be a long, a tough battle, but the Iraqis have prepared for it and we will stand by them,"" he said."

""It's very diverse and the population and the demographics are changing.""But Ellmers, who in June became the first GOP congressional incumbent to lose a seat in 2016 to a primary opponent, believes the state's voters will eventually get behind Donald Trump.

""And these are the things that we see and most of those individuals are Democrats.""Reality Check: Trump's claims of 'large scale voter fraud'Cuomo pushed back saying that neither Ellmers nor Trump has given an example of proof that the electoral system is rigged against him.Ellmers conceded that point but argued Trump's comments were more philosophical.""We're even finding out that the FBI and the State Department was asking for quid pro quo,"" she said, referring to hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman put out by WikiLeaks.

""But I think a more policy-driven answer has to be talking about the issues that they care about, which I think No. 1 would be student loans."" Bozek's organization aims at keeping as many US Senate seats in Republican hands as possible. The NRSC has its work cut out for them this fall: Democrats need to pick up four Senate seats this election cycle to regain control of the chamber (by splitting it 50-50) if Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton claims the White House, five if Republican Donald Trump wins the general election. Analysts point to as many as eight seats in varying degrees of contention -- most held now by Republicans -- putting the GOP on the defensive. RELATED - CNN's Senate rankings: Chamber could be split evenlyBozek cited Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is up for re-election this year, as a politician whose style in using social media resonates with his younger constituents. ""Even our older members can adopt some of these new technologies and reach those younger voters and make a connection to them,"" Bozek said, saying Grassley's voice on Twitter and elsewhere is ""authentic"" and offers followers a behind-the-scenes look at senator's daily life. Grassley, 83, is perhaps best known for tweeting his experience hitting a deer with his campaign vehicle in 2012. While focusing on issues is a key recommendation from Bozek, she also said the platform for the Republican message is important. Bozek said the NRSC encourages their campaigns to spend at least 30-40% of their paid advertising budget on digital -- citing on-demand video advertising, Pandora, Hulu and Snapchat as platforms beyond traditional broadcast advertising worth targeting. ""You really need a healthy mix of it all,"" Bozek said. ""Gone are the days where you can just put up a thousand points on broadcast and think that your message is going to saturate.""To hear Bozek's thoughts on the Republican presidential nominee, ticket-splitting and the most inspiring thing she's seen this election cycle, listen to ""Party People,"" a new podcast where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservative politics and the Republican party.Get CNN's ""Party People"" podcast at CNN, Stitcher, TuneInRadio or iTunes."

""I think when we appeal to the better angels of Americans, we've always succeeded.""Biden also commented on the recording of Trump talking about sexually assaulting women on ""Access Hollywood"" in 2005, which Trump and his allies have dismissed as ""locker room talk.""""What Donald Trump did, I hope, is not a reflection of American public opinion, and the conduct of the vast majority of men,"" Biden said. ""I was a pretty good athlete. I spent a lot of time in a lot of locker rooms in high school and college.

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/marco-rubio-trump-rigged-election-senate-debate/index.html	"""This election is not being rigged,"" Rubio said Monday during a debate with his Democratic senatorial challenger Rep. Patrick Murphy. ""There is no evidence behind any of this, so this should not continue to be said.""""We have 67 counties in this state, each of which conduct their own elections. I promise you there is not a 67-county conspiracy to rig this election,"" Rubio added. With the comments, Rubio joined a growing chorus of Republican lawmakers and officials who have rejected Trump's ""rigged"" claims, even as the nominee himself has continued to make the charge of large-scale vote fraud, without any evidence to back up his claims. Rubio, a former 2016 presidential candidate, has been an uneven critic of Trump throughout the general election, maintaining his support for his party's nominee by emphasizing his opposition to Democrat Hillary Clinton, while also rebuking Trump during some of his more controversial episodes, such as the release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape from 2005. List: Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking by him?The Senate debate ended up focusing as much on the candidates running for president as it did on the candidates onstage. Both Rubio and Murphy repeatedly attacked each other's judgment, pointing to their support for their respective party's nominee.""I don't understand how Sen. Rubio can look himself in the mirror and still stand by Donald Trump's side after everything that's come out about him,"" Murphy charged. Rubio fired back, ""When (Clinton's) been caught doing all these things, he has not once condemned her, not once pointed a finger at her, and has not once broken with her on any of her behaviors or quite frankly on any of her major policies."" Rubio defended his support for Trump by arguing that ""the problem is the other party has nominated someone who has violated federal law,"" a reference to Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The FBI investigated Clinton's email use, and while agency director James Comey characterized her actions as ""extremely careless,"" the agency did not recommend criminal charges for Clinton.Murphy argued that Clinton ""has already apologized for what she did,"" adding that ""she will hit the ground running on Day One."" After being asked if he'd serve out a full six-year senate term -- which would mean he wouldn't run for the White House in 2020 -- Rubio said, ""I will serve a full six-year term in the Senate, God willing.""

But it was the former president who reflected on feelings Trump supporters were having, comparing them with groups of people who have felt left out in the past.""They now feel like outsiders in a country they once felt like home,"" Bill Clinton said, noting that those feelings were once shared with ""gays immigrants, African-Americans, women, people with disabilities.""""We don't want to leave everyone behind,"" said the former president. ""We just want to tear down the social totem pole so we can rise together.""Hillary Clinton did not appear in person, but taped a video for the 1,700 person event.""We are in the final stretch of this campaign and we need your help to reach as many people as possible between now and Election Day,"" Clinton said.The former secretary of state joked that she auditioned for the star-studded show -- which was produced by Harvey Weinstein and Jordan Roth -- but that the producers said she ""didn't make the cut.""Individual tickets for the event started at $45 and go to $2,700, but premium packages of seats went for as much as $100,000.

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/obama-dangerous-patriotism/index.html	" An awkward silence followed his question and then he added: ""I never asked why.  I thought you had some feelings about America. I figured you had your reasons."" He was right. Long before NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem, I started remaining seated when it was played. I didn't do it for attention or to protest. As a person of color, I just couldn't relate to the America that the anthem rhapsodized. How do I love a country that doesn't love my people back? Patriotism, I thought, was the language of white America; it didn't speak to me. But something has shifted within me during the last eight years, and it goes beyond witnessing the election of the nation's first black president. President Barack Obama and others have redefined what it means to ""love America."" I'm seeing the birth of a new brand of patriotism that finally speaks to me and other nonwhite Americans. I bring up Obama and patriotism now because so many people are reflecting on his legacy. The Obama era is being described as a prelude to the ""browning of America"" when racial minorities become the majority in the future.  Yet I think it's the prelude to something even more. The definition of what it means to love America will expand. The browning of America won't just change how the country looks in the future; it will change how Americans express patriotism, because racial minorities bring different histories to this notion of America as the ""land of the free."" I know I do. I've long felt ambivalent when people tell me I should love America. I wonder what America are they talking about. Should I just be happy, as one white man once told me, that my ancestors were rescued from the jungles of Africa and brought to the greatest country in the world? That man embodied the ""love it or leave"" attitude that I associate with flag wavers. It's a pugnacious patriotism that one can hear in country singer Merle Haggard's song, ""The Fighting Side of Me."" Haggard released the song as anti-war protests surged during the Vietnam War. I hear people talkin' bad,About the way we have to live here in this country,Harpin' on the wars we fight,An' gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be.An' I don't mind 'em switchin' sides,An' standin' up for things they believe in.When they're runnin' down my country, man,They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me.  That's the type of kick-butt patriotism I believed in when I was growing up. My childhood heroes were soldiers like Audie Murphy, the most decorated American soldier in World War II. I read his biography, ""To Hell and Back,"" three times in junior high school. I almost cried when Davy Crockett died near the end of the movie ""The Alamo."" I plastered US Marine memorabilia on the walls of my boyhood bedroom.   I didn't think about it at the time, but all my childhood heroes were white men carrying guns, typically with American flags waving in the background. I vaguely knew about people like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., but they didn't excite me. Singing ""We Shall Overcome"" didn't compare to storming the sands of Iwo Jima. I thought there was no greater courage than to go to war for your country. Then I came across a group of college students who taught me about another type of courage.When patriotism becomes dangerous I was channel surfing one day when I stumbled upon a PBS documentary on the Freedom Riders. They were an interracial group of college students who decided to sit next to one another on bus rides through the Deep South in the early 1960s. They were trying to desegregate interstate bus travel. Sitting next to a person of another race on a bus doesn't sound dangerous. But you risked death if you did that in the segregated South. Many Freedom Riders actually signed last wills and testaments before the trips because they didn't expect to return. Their fears were not unfounded. They were attacked by mobs wielding baseball bats and chains. Several were almost beaten to death. Many would carry physical and psychological scars for the rest of their lives. All were unarmed. Their only weapon: faith that their country could be better. This was a dangerous type of patriotism, not a polite demonstration or mild civil disobedience. It was the kind that could get you fired from your job, shunned by your community, beaten or killed.  Yet it was the kind of patriotism that made progress possible in America, said Ralph Young, author of ""Dissent: The History of an American Idea."" He said people often forget the United States was founded by political and religious dissenters fleeing Europe. They put the right to dissent in the Constitution, he said.  ""Dissent is the fuel for the engine of progress,"" said Young, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""Inertia is built into institutions. Things don't change unless people push for change.""How Obama legitimized another brand of patriotism Most of us were taught in school that dissent is patriotic.  Dissenters are venerated, but usually only after they're dead and neutered by time.  During war, economic uncertainty or massive social change, the ""love it or leave it"" form of patriotism rules. Yet something different has happened during the Obama era. He has helped legitimize the dangerous type of patriotism. He's done this through words and deeds.  No other president has talked about patriotism the way Obama has. It's a type of patriotism  many nonwhite Americans can finally see themselves in.   Consider Obama's speech in Selma, Alabama, last year. Some consider it his own ""Gettysburg Address."" He gave it at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, commemorating the epic civil rights campaign that spawned the Voting Rights Act. In that speech, Obama declared that America is great not just because of what it was, but because of what it is becoming.  He said ""America is not some fragile thing"" that can't tolerate citizens demanding change.  ""What greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical?"" he asked. He called members of disparaged groups -- gays and lesbians, Mexican immigrants -- American heroes. He praised the ""hopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande"" and ""the gay Americans whose blood ran on the streets of San Francisco and New York."" He also put women, not white men in powdered wigs, at the center of the America story. He cited a 19th century former slave who became an abolitionist and champion of women's rights, and another civil rights activist from the 1960s whose fiery eloquence forced America to face the brutality of segregation in the Deep South. ""Look at our history,"" he said. ""We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer, women who could do as much as men and then some.""  The Selma speech was Obama's answer to critics who said he didn't believe in American exceptionalism. He just redefined it, and as the country gets browner, I suspect this form of patriotism will become more accepted. The Selma speech was hailed as a classic. In an Atlantic article entitled, ""Finally I Hear a Politician Explain My Country Just the Way I Understand It,"" the author James Fallows said  Obama ""expressed the essence of our American creed."" Greg Jaffe, another commentator, compared the speech to Lincoln's ""Gettysburg Address."" He said it ""rewrote American history, putting America's rebels, protest leaders, misfits, artists and immigrants at the center of the story."" The speech spoke to America's future -- a time when the nation is expected to become ""majority minority,"" Jaffe wrote in the Washington Post. ""Selma is the first great presidential address to speak to that America and a speech only our first black president could give,"" he wrote. Obama expressed the same sentiments at another patriotic milestone: The dedication last month of a new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.  Again, the same concept -- troublemakers past and present -- are true patriots, he said. ""This is the place to understand how protests and love of country don't merely coexist, but inform each other,"" Obama said. ""How men can probably win the gold for their country, but still insist on raising a black-gloved fist. How we can wear an I Can't Breathe T-shirt, and still grieve for fallen police officers."" This form of patriotism isn't new. It's the kind that people of color have had to develop because white America's narrow definition of patriotism didn't fit. It is the type of patriotism that the black poet Langston Hughes expressed in his 1935 poem ""Let America Be America Again."" In it, he gives his own variation of the call to make America great again.O, let America be America again-The land that never has been yet-And yet must be- Patriotism in unlikely places Never has this type of patriotism been expressed so forcefully from the highest office in the land. Yet I've watched it spread to ordinary American life in so many different ways. It is a patriotism that insists on seeing the good, bad and ugly of America's past. One reason I didn't stand for the anthem is because I didn't feel this country had ever officially acknowledged its original sin, slavery. There was a museum that commemorated the European holocaust but there was none to acknowledge the African-American slave trade.   But the African-American museum in Washington has changed that fact. Slavery is dealt with head-on. On display is an actual slave cabin, a receipt for a teenage girl slave, and an iron neck-ring forged for another slave.  There are other signs that the nation is more willing to recognize its other ""original sin,"" the virtual genocide of Native Americans. There's a burgeoning movement to replace Columbus Day celebrations with ""Indigenous Peoples' Day"" honoring Native Americans. At least 26 cities are replacing Columbus Day with the new holiday.  And at a White House conference last month hosted by Obama, the federal government agreed to pay $492 million to 17 Native American tribes for mismanaging their funds and natural resources. The Obama administration has now settled at least 100 tribal claims, some over a century old. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker said Obama ""is the best president for Indian Country in the history of the United States.""  Beyond Washington, there are signs that Americans are thinking differently about patriotism. When Muhammad Ali died earlier this year, he was treated like an American hero. Yet he was once one of the country's most hated dissidents because he refused to fight for his country. Most of the tributes that followed his death pinned his greatness not on his boxing ability, but on his willingness to defy the government for his religious beliefs.  Today another black athlete is provoking fury for being ""un-American"":  Colin Kaepernick, with his refusal to stand for the national anthem. But compare the response Kaepernick has received  to the scorn and professional exile that Ali endured.  Two weeks after Kaepernick's protest, his jersey became the top seller in NFL sales. Other professional athletes followed his example. So have high school football teams throughout the nation. A professional soccer player, Megan Rapinoe, also took a knee while the anthem was played, later explaining that ""being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties."" Kaepernick even got an impassioned defense from an unlikely source: a former Navy SEAL. Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura posted a video online in which he said he fully and completely supported Kaepernick. He literally saluted Kaepernick for having the courage of his convictions and said ""whether I agree with him or not is irrelevant."" Ventura recalled that he vetoed a bill when he was governor that would have required the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in every Minnesota public school.  ""You know why?"" he said in the video. ""Because governments should not mandate patriotism. ... Who mandated patriotism? The Germans in the 1930s."" Americans are accustomed to public figures taking public stands on controversial issues. But for change to really take root, it has to occur away from the spotlight -- and come from someone you'd never expect to see it in. Which America do you believe in?That's what recently happened in Charlotte, North Carolina, a week after a black police officer killed a black man in front of his wife. The shooting sparked protests that turned violent and a man was shot to death during a demonstration. With the city still on edge, a pastor decided to deliver a sermon. His name is Loran Livingston, and he is a white, conservative evangelical. He grew up during segregation in a rural area of North Carolina that was dominated by the Ku Klux Klan. He believes in the inerrancy of the Bible and is a military buff who collects guns and knives. The police officer who allegedly killed the man, sparking the protest, is a member of his church.  One could have expected Livingston to give a hellfire sermon condemning the protesters in Charlotte, but the pastor said something different. He condemned the violence and praised the police officers who took an oath to protect citizens. He also defended the officer in his congregation who was at the center of the protests, saying he did his sworn duty and ""you will not find a finer young man."" But he also said that many of the protesters had ""genuine grievances,"" and that many Americans don't want to admit that there is a ""caste system in the nation.""  As several members of his Central Church of God congregation stirred nervously in their seats, Livingston condemned ""country club"" Christian churches where all the members look alike and send their kids to private schools. He asked his congregation to consider the perspective of poor blacks living in Charlotte who see billion-dollar sports complexes sprout up while they struggle to make ends meet.""And with all that, they turn on the TV and they watch someone who has no clue say make America great again,"" Livingston thundered, ""and these people are saying, 'When was it ever great for me?'""  But maybe it could be one day. That's the hope that has helped so many Americans in the past who felt like outsiders. How does society accommodate this new form of patriotism that incorporates the good, bad and ugly of America, but still looks forward to something better in the future?  Maybe I'll never stand for the anthem. But for the first time as an adult, I can find the words and examples to explain why I think America is exceptional. You may prefer the ""love it or leave it"" America. But I, and I suspect many others, believe in another America -- ""the one that never was and yet must be.""Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described an officer-involved shooting. It was a black officer who shot a black man in the Charlotte incident."	How the Obama era gave us a dangerous patriotism

Reid described the women as often physically ""trapped"" and said ""that's a crime,"" before backing off that term when pressed.""I don't know about a crime. But it is a kind of sickness,"" he said Tuesday, dismissing Trump's denials. ""How could you buy it?""In the wake of the publication of a 2005 tape in which Trump describes sexually aggressive behavior toward women, about 10 women have come forward with allegations of sexual assault or unwanted sexual contact. Before the women came forward, Trump had said he had never acted the way he bragged about doing in the tape. CNN has not independently verified any of the women's claims.Reid also pushed back on Trump's insistence in recent days that the November elections are ""rigged"" against him and his supporters. He admonished Trump for pushing what he called a ""make-believe"" narrative about widespread election fraud.""I've always felt that everything we can get people to do to vote, we should do it,"" Reid said. ""He is obviously in a different school than I am. He wants people not to vote.""Reid voiced displeasure with his Republican counterparts for not more vociferously defending the American election system from Trump's attacks. He said he was ""not happy"" with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who issued a statement implicitly criticizing Trump for his language, but reserved his more extensive criticism for the Senate GOP leader.""(Ryan) has at least spoken out. He's been not really forceful but he has at least said something,"" Reid said. ""Mitch McConnell has not done anything. I'm really fairly disappointed and that's an understatement.""Reid also said he was ""terribly disappointed"" in John McCain, and said Senate Democrats would spend ""any money that we can"" in Florida's Senate race, where party leadership has cut much of its planned advertising for Democratic Rep.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/reality-check-voter-fraud-donald-trump/index.html	"""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,"" Trump tweeted Monday. ""Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!""Trump's claim that he is about to be cheated out of a victory at the ballot box is not new. In August he railed against federal court decisions that struck down ballot restrictions, including that voters present specific forms of identification, in several states. ""We may have people vote 10 times,"" he told the Washington Post. ""it's inconceivable that you don't have to show identification in order to vote or that the identification doesn't have to be somewhat foolproof.""In recent days Trump's argument has picked up in intensity. When asked for proof of his allegations of potential vote stealing Trump's campaign provided the following data points:A study by the Pew Center on the States entitled ""Inaccurate, Costly and Inefficient: Evidence that American Voter Registration Systems Needs an Upgrade.""The 2012 study presented a number of disquieting findings, including:About 24 million voter registrations are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.More than 1.8 million dead people are listed as voters.Approximately 2.75 million people are registered in more than one state.The Pew report certainly underscores deficiencies in the voter registration system. But the Trump campaign doesn't say how these deficiencies disadvantage his candidacy. For example, there is no evidence in the Pew report that people who have registrations in two states are voting twice for Democrats or for Republicans. And while Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani has said, ""dead people generally vote for Democrats rather than Republicans,"" he has not proffered any evidence to back up that statement.RELATED: Why Trump's talk of a rigged vote is so dangerousPennsylvania voting experienceThe Trump campaign noted media reports that indicated that, in 2012, more than 700 people might have voted twice in Pennsylvania and that Philadelphia elections officials have indicated they have referred a number of voting irregularity cases for prosecution.But those reports he cites do not indicate who these individuals voted for -- if they even voted twice at all. (The report only said they ""may"" have voted twice.) Furthermore, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State told local media that potential voter fraud may have occurred among members of both parties.In addition, Philadelphia officials say only nine cases have been referred for prosecution. Most of these involve local election boards adding votes to machine tallies to ensure the totals that are recorded on machines match the number of voters on sign-in sheets. ""This indicates that voting fraud does occur,"" says Al Schmidt, a Republican and one of three City Commissioners who oversee elections in Philadelphia. ""But if voter fraud was occurring in a widespread conspiracy to sway a presidential election it would have been the easiest thing to see.""Non-US citizens votingThe Trump campaign claims that ""illegal immigrants"" are voting, citing research conducted by Jesse Richman and David Earnest, two professors at Old Dominion University. Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, the two men estimate that 6.4% of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2% of them cast ballots in 2010. Studies by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative voting watchdog group, also estimated more than 1,000 non-citizens registered to vote in eight Virginia counties since 2011 and that 86 non-citizens were registered to vote in Philadelphia in between 2013 and 2015 -- 40 of them voted in at least one election.Neither the report by the researchers nor the conservative watchdogs say if these non-citizens who voted were, in fact, undocumented immigrants, though, no matter their immigration status, it is against the law for non-citizens to vote in state and national elections. The Old Dominion researchers stressed that the non-citizen vote tends to favor Democrats with President Barack Obama getting more than 80% of the 339 votes they studied in 2008.But in some cases, there are too few of these voters to make any difference in a presidential election. For example, the watchdog group tallied what they believe were 40 votes cast by non-citizens in Philadelphia elections in 2013, 2014 and 2015. That's out of a total of more than 1.3 million votes who voted in those years -- hardly enough for a rounding error.Given the evidence Trump has supplied, we rate his claim that large scale voter fraud exists as FALSE."

""So when I see the hate that Donald Trump has brought to his campaign for president, it terrifies me.""The ad features what have now become Trump's greatest hits for the Democratic super PAC: When Trump said that he'd like to ""punch (a protester) in the face"" in February and when he mocked a disabled reporter in July.Tight races remain in three battlegrounds: Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio""Words have an influence, violence causes pain, hate can rip us apart,"" Shepard says looking into the camera. ""I know what can happen as the result of hate, and Donald Trump should never be our president.""Speaking on behalf of the Trump campaign, Chris Barron, the co-founder of the LGBT conservative group GOProud, said that he has ""nothing but respect for Judy Shepard"" but that the ad is ""unbelievably disingenuous and absolutely incorrect"" in its implication that Trump is biased against the LGBT community.""This is an attempt to scare gay voters into not even considering Donald Trump,"" Barron said. ""This ad is absolutely false and it is completely and totally flies in the face of what we have seen in this entire campaign.""Barron added that it is ""unfortunate"" that Judy Shepard ""decided to do this.""Shepard was found tied to a fence, beaten, burned and left in a comatose state with a fractured skull in Laramie, Wyoming, in 1998. Witnesses said the two men who were later charged with his death lured Shepard to their truck by pretending to be gay.Matthew Shepard's death was a seminal moment in the gay rights movement and led Congress to pass the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act.The Clintons rally with Broadway legends for multimillion-dollar fundraiserPriorities USA plans to spend close to $8 million on the new ad, a spokesman said.With three weeks to go until Election Day, Clinton and her allied groups have so far dominated the airwaves, making up 75% of total ad spending for the 2016 presidential race.Priorities USA, according to media tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG, has spent $84 million on ads. That is 25% of all ad spending for the 2016 race."	Super PAC ad compares Trump's rhetoric with 'hate' that led to Matthew Shepard's 1998 death
