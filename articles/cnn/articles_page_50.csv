""I'm glad nobody was hurt, but it does remind you that in these closing days -- especially as the polls tighten -- many of us are getting more death threats, getting more angry messages on social media and elsewhere, and it's a pretty fraught environment there,"" she said.But she deflected questions about why Donald Trump Jr. and Trump social media director Dan Scavino retweeted comments describing what occurred as an assassination attempt, when no such attempt took place. Trump supporters had incorrectly thought the protester had a gun.   ""If you're Don Jr. and you're on a live TV set while you're watching this unfold, it's pretty rattling to think of what may have happened to your father, so I'll excuse him that,"" Conway said. Tapper pushed back: ""We're very happy that this was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was?"" Conway responded: ""Well, how do you -- first of all, that's really remarkable, I have to say, that that's what the story line is here."" Conway also addressed a local GOP official's claims that polls in Clark County, home of Las Vegas, were kept open late so a ""certain group"" could vote -- a thinly veiled reference to Latino voters. ""We just always want the laws followed and the rules followed, and I do predict that you're going to see really long lines -- serpentine-like lines of Tuesday -- of folks there for Donald Trump on Tuesday,"" Conway said. She said it's concerning that Clinton benefits from ""special favors and perhaps special rules"" -- as Tapper pointed out that it's not uncommon to keep polls open so that those already in line can vote."

Clinton will headline events in Pittsburgh, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Philadelphia and Raleigh, North Carolina.The Democratic nominee's campaign has leaned heavily on its ground game to turn out voters early in key swing states, trying to ""bank"" votes before Election Day. The campaign has particularly seen early voting gains in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. Some aides are quietly confident that, given the turnout figures in Nevada so far, the state could already be in Clinton's column.But states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, early voting is primarily limited to special circumstances, meaning turning out voters on Election Day is key.Clinton's top aides hope late visits to these states -- by both Clinton and her top surrogates -- will help spur that turnout.In addition to Clinton's visit, President Barack Obama will campaign in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Monday.""We have tried to calibrate our schedule to be in states at the peak time for voting,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said Saturday. ""So, Michigan, almost all voting happens on Election Day, same with Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and even Ohio, and so our schedule is calibrated around that.""Clinton's campaign is also keeping a close eye on internal polling in Midwestern states, where aides said Saturday they had seen some tightening.This is especially true in Michigan, where Clinton's internal polls are currently in low single digits.""The numbers there have tightened,"" Mook said. ""We're taking that seriously.""In New Hampshire on Sunday, Clinton will look to avoid the issue former vice president Al Gore ran into in 2000: Ignoring the state.Gore lost New Hampshire by a mere 7,211 votes in 2000, a fraction that infuriated Democrats in the state given how little he campaigned there during the race.Gore, according to those Democrats, held one event in New Hampshire as the nominee, canoeing with Jeanne Shaheen on the Connecticut River in July.A Clinton aide said this weekend that one of the reasons Clinton was visiting the state less than 48 hours before Election Day was the lessons learned from Gore."

If the proposition passes, people 21 and older would be legally allowed to have and consume marijuana. The state already has approved medical usage of marijuana.Pelosi had not previously weighed in on the measure, and her support for it makes her the highest-ranking, sitting elected official in either the Republican or Democratic parties to back the legalization of a drug the federal government currently considers a Schedule 1 narcotic -- a classification that puts pot alongside heroin.Pelosi's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Pelosi's counterpart in the Senate, outgoing Senator Harry Reid, seemed unenthusiastic when asked about a similar measure in his home state of Nevada in August.President Barack Obama's administration also ""steadfastly opposes legalization of marijuana.""Pelosi represents California's 12th district, a Democratic stronghold within the city of San Francisco. The minority leader also backed a measure that would repeal the death penalty in California, another position at odds with some of her party, including Hillary Clinton, who supports the death penalty."

And this time, many of them are built into the teleprompter.As his narrow path to victory has begun to widen, Trump in his final week on the campaign trail has leaned heavily on the FBI's review of new emails that may be linked to Hillary Clinton's private email server, highlighted the stark contrast between his policies and those of his Democratic rivals, and criticized the strategy underpinning the US's fight against ISIS.While those arguments might be enough, Trump has also mixed in doses of innuendo, fear-mongering and outright inaccuracies to create a potent cocktail he hopes will drive his supporters to the polls and convince late-breaking independents to side with him.The real estate mogul quickly pounced on the FBI's announcement late last week that it had discovered new emails that might be tied to its investigation into Clinton's email server, which ended last summer with the FBI recommending against filing any charges. But Trump has both exaggerated the scope of the FBI's review and suggested Clinton is facing a separate investigation altogether.Trump has repeatedly called the FBI's review of new emails -- found on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner that he shared with his estranged wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin -- a ""criminal investigation,"" going beyond the FBI's characterization of the review. He has also argued that emails with classified information were discovered on Weiner's computer, even before the FBI had secured a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails -- meaning there's no way of knowing if any emails contain any classified information.And then Trump dropped what appeared to be a bombshell based on a false Fox News report. ""They're also conducting a second criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's pay for play corruption at the State Department,"" he said Friday night in Hershey, Pennsylvania, even though law enforcement officials have told CNN the Clinton Foundation probe hasn't advanced in months.Even after that report was debunked and Fox News anchor Bret Baier retracted the report, Trump continued to tell his supporters that Clinton was ""likely"" to be indicted in the case.""The FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment,"" Trump incorrectly told his supporters Friday in New Hampshire.A 'rigged system'Trump has blended those mischaracterizations with his charges that there is a ""rigged system"" at work, stating his theories that the Justice Department is ""protecting"" Clinton as though they were fact -- theories that took on added meaning as reports surfaced in the last week of disagreements between the FBI and Justice Department over whether to publicly announce the review of new emails.Though the Republican nominee has frequently jumped ahead of law enforcement's conclusions about investigations and terrorist attacks, his words have gained new weight as the election draws nearer.Trump has also inserted his penchant for misleading and flat-out false statements into his efforts to pitch his hardline immigration and terrorism policies, as well as his efforts to paint current US government leadership as inept and in dire need of the change agent he purports to be.Embarking on his final campaign swing, Trump has sought to play to voters' fears of terrorism and illegal immigration, wildly mischaracterizing Clinton's policies to suggest that she would erase the US' borders, allow hundreds of millions of people to flow in and falsely blamed her for undocumented immigrant criminals being released from US prisons.""You could have 650 million people pour in and we'd do nothing about it. Think of it. That's what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week. Once you lose control of your borders, you just have no country folks, you have no country,"" Trump said last Sunday during a rally in the border state of New Mexico. There is no basis for the number.He has also repeatedly suggested in the last week that the US government is the highest-taxed country in the world -- it isn't -- and warned that Clinton would burden the middle class with ""massive"" tax increases even though Clinton's plan only calls for tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans.Through it all, Trump has continued to decry a ""rigged system"" and argued the media is colluding with the Clinton campaign as he's stressed his campaign offers voters a change from the status quo.Questioning Mosul offensiveHis criticism of the political status quo has also extended to denouncing the US-backed military offensive to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from ISIS.Once again, his arguments here have been rife with inaccuracies and baseless statements as he's suggested the offensive has been ""disastrous"" even though US and Iraq military officials -- as well as impartial observers on the ground -- have said forces are making significant gains.And while the offensive is aimed at unclenching ISIS' grip of a key Iraqi city, Trump has questioned the merits of the offensive -- which, if successful, would undoubtedly serve to further US strategic goals -- from arguing the US is ""not going to benefit"" from successfully ousting ISIS from the city on Friday to arguing the offensive was conducted for ""political reasons"" on Saturday.Trump has also spun misleading tales about Obamacare, his position in the polls and even the pace of Clinton's campaign schedule.Early on in his improbable run for the Republican nomination, Trump leaned on his penchant for hyperbole -- from his wealth to the size of his crowds -- and unapologetically misled voters about his own past positions on certain issues as well as his opponents', all while painting a gloomy picture of a country headed for doom unless voters elected him to set the country on the right track. His wild disregard for the truth quickly surpassed that of any presidential candidate in modern history, prompting news outlets to begin calling Trump's statements out very simply as ""lies.""Since the dawn of his campaign, Trump has become more polished, and in the final months of his bid, has used a teleprompter at each of his rallies -- an attempt by his new guard of campaign advisers to erect bumpers that would keep him on message -- although Trump often gets sidetracked by off-script tangents.Sensing the critical importance of this last week to convince voters he should be the next president, the Republican nominee has fastidiously followed the remarks his aides prepared for him to read at nearly every rally."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/florida-early-voting/index.html	The milestone is a boon to Hillary Clinton's chances of carrying the Sunshine State and its 29 electoral votes -- a prize so large that it would help her close off most of Donald Trump's paths to victory.But it's not all good news for Democrats: Their current lead is significantly smaller than the turnout advantage they had over registered Republicans at this point in 2008. Clinton and her vice presidential running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, were in Florida this weekend. Even though Clinton's rally in Pembroke Pines was cut short Saturday due to heavy rain, she visited two early voting locations near Miami, and her effort to churn out early voters might be working.More than 5.7 million Floridians have already hit the polls after about two weeks of in-person early voting. So far, 2,268,663 Democrats have cast their ballots and 2,261,383 Republicans have already voted.These are not results -- ballots aren't tallied until Election Day. But the numbers provide clues on who is voting and which party is turning out to vote. And while the numbers track voters' party affiliations, not all Democrats are voting for Clinton, and not all Republicans are supporting Trump.Early voting data in 3 key states show spike in Latino turnoutThe GOP lead was carried by strong numbers in absentee voting, and their overall edge stood at about 16,500 earlier this week. But Democratic turnout picked up steam, and they're now ahead by a little more than 7,200 votes, according to the latest numbers from the Florida Department of State.Democrats slowly chipped away at the Republican advantage, largely thanks to strong turnout from Hispanic voters. While they are more split in Florida than in other states, Hispanic voters disproportionately favor Democrats. And this year, turnout among Hispanics is up about 103% from where it was at this point in 2008, according to a CNN analysis of early voting data from Catalist.CNN has partnered with Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates and advocacy groups, academics and think tanks, to receive detailed early vote return information this year. Catalist's voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote in the election.The huge growth among Hispanics is notable because they are the fastest growing ethnic group in the Florida electorate right now.Turnout is up across the board, compared to early voting in 2008. But it only increased by about 41% among white voters and only about 13% among black voters.The relatively small growth in African-American turnout helps explain why Democrats are behind their early voting pace from 2008, a year when then-Sen. Barack Obama carried the state by only 3%.Right now, registered Democrats are ahead by about 7,200 votes. That pales in comparison to the roughly 146,000-voter edge they saw at this point in 2008. African-Americans were 16% of the early voting electorate that year, but they're only about 13% of the electorate so far in 2016. An overwhelming majority of black voters in Florida are registered with the Democratic Party.Doing well in the early vote is absolutely critical in Florida, because a majority of voters cast early ballots in the past two presidential elections. This means the candidate behind in the early vote must make up ground on Election Day to stand a chance at winning Florida's electoral votes. 	Democrats take the lead in Florida early voting
6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/trump-rushed-off-stage-at-campaign-rally/index.html	"A Secret Service spokesperson said in a statement there was a commotion in the crowd and an ""unidentified individual"" shouted ""gun,"" though no weapon was found after a ""thorough search.""A man, who later identified himself to reporters as Austyn Crites, was then immediately detained and led out by a throng of police officers, Secret Service agents and SWAT officers armed with assault rifles to a side room.A law enforcement official later told CNN no charges were filed against Crites.After he was released from custody, Crites told reporters the incident started off when he raised a ""Republicans Against Trump"" sign.Crites said he was then assaulted by a group of people around him before anyone shouted anything about a gun.""All of a sudden, because they couldn't grab the sign, or whatever happened, bam, I get tackled by all these people who were just, like, kicking me and grabbing me in the crotch and just, just beating the crap out of me,"" Crites said, according to KTNV. ""And somebody yells something about a gun, and so that's when things really got out of hand.""Crites told ABC News Sunday he ""just wanted to voice my displeasure,"" and said he has no association with the Clinton campaign, other than personally supporting the Democratic nominee.""I was a Republican supporter through the primaries, and I have donated money to the Hillary Clinton campaign recently because I think that Trump is a disaster for the country,"" he said, adding he has already voted for Clinton.The alleged assault against Crites is just the latest such incident to occur at a Trump rally, where other protesters have previously been roughed up.Trump was unharmed and returned to the stage minutes later to finish his speech.""Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped. We will never be stopped. I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic,"" Trump said, before returning to his stump speech.Trump was in the middle of his stump speech when the commotion occurred. He was looking into the crowd, his hand over his eyes to block the glare from the stage lights, when Secret Service agents grabbed him and escorted him off the stage. Trump ducked his head as he left the stage.The crowd surged backward, some supporters with frightened looks on their faces, as the Secret Service and police tactical units rushed in to detain a man.Several attendees told CNN they initially heard a person yell there was someone with a gun. ""We were all very interested in what Mr. Trump had to say and a guy in a red shirt just rushed right next to me, screaming, 'There is a guy with a gun,'"" Shimon Cohen told CNN. But asked if he saw a gun, he said, ""No, I did not."" A second person, Milton Zerman, said he ""was watching Trump speak and I heard someone scream, 'This guy has a gun,' so I looked toward the guy he was talking about. It didn't look to me that he had a gun -- or at least I didn't see a gun -- but people were screaming that he did have a gun and immediately after that Trump was taken off stage. ""Everyone starts dispersing, I hear people saying, 'Let's get out of here, it's not going to be good,' but I just took that opportunity to get closer to the front because it seemed like the police officers had it under control.""Trump held a last rally Saturday night in Denver, where he did not address the incident.Before his last rally, Trump issued a statement about the commotion in Reno.""I would like to thank the United States Secret Service and the law enforcement resources in Reno and the state of Nevada for their fast and professional response,"" he said. ""I also want to thank the many thousands of people present for their unwavering and unbelievable support. Nothing will stop us -- we will make America great again!""Less than an hour after the incident -- and before it was clear what happened -- Trump's campaign sought to highlight the moment to suggest he was tougher than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who had to cut short a Florida rally due to heavy rain.Dan Scavino Jr., Trump's social media director, and Donald Trump Jr., the nominee's oldest son, retweeted Jack Posobiec, a supporter who wrote: ""Hillary (Clinton) ran away from rain today. Trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attempt.""But the Secret Service statement made clear no weapon had been found. Neither has deleted the retweet.Secret Service agents rushed to shield Trump onstage in March after a man tried to rush the stage during a rally in Dayton, Ohio, but the GOP nominee wasn't escorted off stage.And a man was arrested at a rally in Las Vegas in June after he tried to grab a police officer's gun, which he said he planned to use to shoot Trump."

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/presidential-polls-iowa-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/index.html	The poll found Trump with 46% to Clinton's 39%, while Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein caught 6% and 1% of likely voters, respectively.About 5% of respondents said they did not want to disclose their choice; 2% said they would vote for someone else or not at all, and the remaining 1% said they weren't sure or didn't remember.Sixty eight percent of respondents said they were unhappy with their choices in this election.Trump's 7-point lead exceeds the poll's margin of error, suggesting a comfortable position for the Republican leading into the closing days of the election. However, two of the most recent Iowa polls showed a near-even race.President Barack Obama won Iowa in 2008 and 2012, but Trump has performed strongly there in polls throughout much of the campaign relative to the Democratic victories in the most recent presidential cycles.The Hawkeye State has six electoral votes, and many of Trump's most likely paths to victory include him notching a win there.The Des Moines Register poll was taken from November 1 to 4 of 800 likely voters with a margin of error plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

""I think when this election ends and people stop for a minute and people actually reflect, they will realize how insane and horrible and unprecedented it really was.""Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college mapElection obsession syndrome is taking hold of the country. Its main symptoms are soaring ratings for cable news shows and frequent refreshing of polling and election forecasting websites. With Clinton's lead over Trump in battleground states shrinking in the final stretch, the next two days promise to be even more nerve-wracking as both sides angle for victory.The cover of next week's New Yorker sums up the brittle national mood -- especially among fretful liberals -- picturing a man on a train reading a newspaper with the headlines ""Oh Sweet Jesus, Please God No,"" and ""Anything But That.""Even ""Saturday Night Live"" has had enough. During the opening sketch Saturday, Alec Baldwin broke out of his Trump impression and turned to Kate McKinnon, who plays Clinton, and said: ""I'm sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling this stuff at you like this.""""Yes, I know, right?"" she answered. ""This whole election has been so mean.""""I just feel gross all the time. Don't you guys feel gross all the time about this?"" Baldwin asked the audience.The pair then ran outside the studio. Baldwin hugged an African-American man and McKinnon embraced a man with a ""Make America Great Again"" hat who gave her a piggy-back ride while she ate cotton candy. It was a cathartic moment meant to celebrate the diversity of American life.Anxiety among Democrats Among Democrats, there is a palpable sense of intense anxiety about Clinton's prospects. Her campaign was rocked when FBI Director James Comey revived her email controversy, triggering growing concern that Trump could win. ""Every Democrat I know right now is checking the validity of their passports,"" CNN commentator Van Jones said Friday on ""Erin Burnett OutFront.""For his part, Trump has shown remarkable discipline over the past week, further unnerving Democrats who are used to baiting him into a meltdown.Conservative talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh crowed this week that ""we have panic starting to set in in the Democrat Party and in the Drive-By Media.""On Friday, CNN modified its projected electoral map, for the first time putting Clinton's current total of electoral votes below the magic number of 270.The Twitter account of David Plouffe, the former Obama election guru, has become a source of free therapy for nervous Democrats.Early voting update: Battlegrounds tight with 30 million ballots cast""Clinton path to 300+ rock solid. Structure of race not affected by Comey's reckless irresponsibility. Vote and volunteer, don't fret or wet,"" Plouffe tweeted on October 30.One Democrat who is not panicking is Clinton herself.""Here she is, the biggest event in the history of this country potentially and she's calm and collected. She's focused,"" billionaire and Clinton supporter Mark Cuban told reporters Friday. ""I've been around situations when people are anxious. You see people choke. Look, she's confident. She's good.""Despite the tightening race, Clinton's campaign remains convinced that her advantage on the electoral map will hold and she will prevail on Tuesday. But that's unlikely to calm everybody down.""Both Democrats and Republicans are really worked up,"" said Sam Wang, who runs the Princeton Election Consortium and questions whether the emotions whipped up by the race are justified by the facts of the election. 'Separate the drama from the data'""In my own mind, I try to separate the drama from the data. Early this season, I noticed that no matter what happened, opinion didn't move that much,"" Wang said in an e-chat on CNN.com this week. ""The race has shown less variation than ever in the history of presidential polling. It made me realize that the race probably wasn't going anywhere. But when was the last time a presidential race was this emotional?""Vietor agrees that the level of emotional involvement is out of whack with what has been an unusually stable race that has not been permanently shaken by even stunning events like Clinton's fainting spell in September or the release of an ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump is heard making sexually aggressive remarks.""It does feel like every day something is said or done that in another election would be a blockbuster or game changing story,"" Vietor said. But in this race, ""it feels like the half life of any major story is five days.""The election was always going to be an emotional roller coaster, given the candidates.In Clinton and Trump, their parties nominated the two candidates most guaranteed to cause the maximum amount of alienation on the other side.The faithful who will never leave herTrump is so far outside the normal parameters of what is accepted behavior for a potential president, firing off conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods in his stump speeches, it is not surprising he rouses fierce emotions. The Republican nominee has deliberately stoked anger, grievances and grass roots fury, using demagogic techniques to power his anti-establishment campaign.His presidency would in many ways be a leap into the unknown for America and the world -- so heightened concern is inevitable.But Trump is not the only candidate who evokes strong feelings.Polarizing personalitiesFor more than a quarter of a century, Clinton has been one of the most polarizing personalities in American politics. While Trump has gone further than most of her other critics in openly branding her a crook, the intensity of feeling towards her among conservatives is visceral.The candidates are doing nothing to calm things down -- seeing raging emotions as a tool to get their base voters to the polls.""I think this will be the last election if I don't win. I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning,"" Trump told David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network in September, warning Democrats would naturalize millions of illegal immigrants to swamp the voting rolls.Clinton warns Trump could incite Armageddon.""Think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone. with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him,"" she said in Pittsburgh on Friday. ""Imagine how easily it could be that Donald Trump would feel insulted and start a real war -- not just a Twitter war -- at three in the morning.""Obama went even further this week warning during a campaign trip, ""the fate of the world is teetering and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.""Given the intensity of the feelings, it's unlikely that the fury stoked by this election will quickly dissipate after Tuesday. It will likely be a powerful force in shaping the presidency of whoever wins.But one longtime Washington sage, Charlie Cook, has a message for a divided nation in his latest National Journal column: Take a breath.""My advice is for folks to ease off the caffeine, maybe watch less television news, take in a movie, play a round of golf, or do whatever lowers their blood pressure and preserves their sanity,"" Cook wrote. ""This country has survived a lot, and it will still stand tall whatever happens on Tuesday."""	Presidential election: Emotions run high in final days of the campaign
