It's not a thing. Stop sharing it. While Donald Trump has said some questionable things, he never said anything even resembling this quote:""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific."" The post says The Donald made the statement in a People Magazine interview in 1998. Except he didn't.Snopes, that mythbusting site, looked into this when it first started doing the rounds in October. That's October 2015! Trump appeared pretty regularly in People Magazine in those days. But Snopes combed through their voluminous archives and couldn't find a single interview where he said that.So when you see this meme, know that it won't be a helpful counterpoint during the Thanksgiving political debates you'll have with your family. "	That Donald Trump quote calling Republicans dumb? Fake!

From the Senate and the House to statehouses across the country, female challengers won office. The US Senate will welcome four new female members.""I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now,"" Clinton said in her concession speech Wednesday.And for some women who were running, the words rang true. Cracked but not shattered: 20 women on Clinton's runFirstsSomali-American Ilhan Omar was elected to the Minnesota House, making history by becoming the first Somali-American legislator in the United States. The mother of three, a member of Minnesota's Democratic--Farmer--Labor Party, is a former Somali refugee who lived at the camps for the displaced in Kenya. ""My neighbors, everyone here in this room, represent what we as a nation want to be: united in our diversity,"" she said in her victory speech. ""Longtime residents, East African immigrants and students -- we came together and engaged in the political progress. We talked about the issues that concern us and we connected on the future we want to create.""Zena Stephens also made history by being the first African-American woman to be elected to the office of sheriff in Texas. The Democrat defeated Ray Beck in Jefferson County, Texas. The SenateThe Senate will see the first female biracial senators, the first Latina senator and the first Thai-born senator. The incoming Democratic senator for Illinois, Tammy Duckworth, unseated incumbent Mark Kirk, who had wrongly mocked her assertion that the half-Thai politician's family's military legacy could be traced back to the Revolutionary War. He later apologized but the damage was done, and the Iraq war veteran, who lost both her legs when the Black Hawk helicopter she was co-piloting crashed, won her race with 54.4% of the vote. Former California Attorney General Kamala Harris becomes the state's first senator of Indian descent  -- and the country's first black female senator since 1999. She succeeds Barbara Boxer. The Democrat, along with Duckworth, is biracial, another first for the national legislature. Her mother is Indian, and her father is from Jamaica.Democrat and former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto replaces Senate minority leader Harry Reid, who leaves office after serving the state of Nevada for 30 years. She holds the distinction of being the first Latina to serve in the Senate. Maggie Hassan, another Democrat, unseated her Republican rival Kelly Ayotte in the New Hampshire Senate race. Closing gender gap in Washington is slow work The HouseEight female challengers were elected to the House on Tuesday. Former Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney won in Wyoming. The Republican joins Nannette Barragan, D-California, Lisa Blunt, D-Delaware, Stephanie Murphy, D-Florida, Val Demmings, D-Florida, Carol Shea-Porter, D-New Hampshire, Claudia Tenney, R-New York, and Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, as freshmen representatives.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported the state where Sen.

Keith Ellison, made formal his candidacy for the chairmanship on Monday, saying the party must ""begin the rebuilding process now.""In what might be perceived as a jab at the broader Democratic strategy in 2016, he said the party ""did not motivate enough people to the ballot box"" in the past election and, given the Democrats' struggles up and down the ballot, that he would seek to ""build a bench not just for federal candidates, but for state and local candidates across the nation.""Ellison, the first black Muslim elected to Congress, enters the contest with the backing from across the left. He's won endorsements from Sen. Bernie Sanders, the fiery independent and former Democratic primary candidate, along with outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is set to replace Reid in 2017, all pledging their support.But other politicos have expressed interest in the position. Howard Dean, who ran the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009, and announced last week he would again seek its top role, and is expected to be among Ellison's most formidable challengers. Another former presidential candidate, Martin O'Malley, has also announced that he is throwing his hat in the ring.""Since the election, I have been approached by many Democrats who believe our party needs new leadership,"" said the former Maryland Governor. ""I'm taking a hard look at DNC Chair because I know how badly we need to reform our nominating process, articulate a bold progressive vision, recommit ourselves to higher wages and a stronger middle class, and return to our roots as a nationwide, grassroots party.""New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman and DNC Vice Chair Ray Buckley is exploring a run, according to the Boston Globe."".@ChairmanBuckley on DNC chair, not officially running yet, but ""I am definitely being strongly encouraged to consider it by DNC members,"" reporter James Pindell tweeted.In an interview with CNN affiliate NH1, Buckley said he had received a number of calls and emails from people ""all over the country"" encouraging him to run. ""In the last few days there have been a lot of people calling in from all over the country, either emailing me or picking up the phone, that have expressed great interest in being able to essentially flip the DNC upside down and restructure how it operates, how it works making it much more grassroots friendly organization and less of a top to bottom organization,"" Buckley said. And Labor Secretary Tom Perez, an outspoken surrogate of Hillary Clinton, is eyeing a run, according to Democrats with knowledge of his plans. A number of Democrats -- especially those interested in someone who can rally the party together after Tuesday's crushing loss -- are floating his name and Perez is said to be receptive, according to people close to him. One upside to Perez, according to people close to him, is that he has limited experience in elected office, something a number of DNC members have raised as red flags for other contenders.Sanders backing EllisonBut Sanders -- a registered independent who caucuses with Democrats and fought a lengthy primary battle for the party's nomination this year -- and top allies are touting Ellison for the job. The Minnesota congressman currently co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus.In an email to supporters late Thursday, the Vermont senator said Ellison was uniquely qualified to take on ""the political establishment and billionaire class,"" and that ""his experience and perspective would be key to leading the fight against Trump.""Sanders also made the case for the institutional value of the DNC, an organization he and his backers clashed with repeatedly during the primaries.""I'm sure a lot of you have some feelings about the Democratic National Committee,"" he said. ""The truth is that it is an important entity to build, support, and maintain if we are to have the chance to organize and win in the coming elections while Trump is president.""Ellison supported Sanders in the primary, but emerged as a vocal Clinton supporter after she clinched the nomination. Sanders named Ellison to the Democratic convention's platform drafting committee this summer, filling an influential slot given to the Vermont senator as a concession from the party after an unexpectedly tense nominating contest. On Sunday Ellison also won the backing from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who is retiring from Congress after the turn of the year. ""My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done,"" Reid said in a statement. ""Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith.""Ellison's office refused to comment to CNN on the record, but he said on a Democracy For America call late Thursday that he would make an announcement about his intentions on Monday. Dean eyes returnA former governor of Vermont, Dean served as head of the DNC following his own insurgent, though ultimately unsuccessful bid for the party's 2004 nomination. As part of his leadership, Dean championed a ""50-state strategy,"" a plan intended to broaden the electoral map for Democrats.""The dems need organization and focus on the young,"" Dean tweeted on Thursday, proposing to renew the strategy. ""Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.""On Friday, Dean stepped down from his special adviser role at Democracy for America, a progressive political action committee he founded in 2004.But Dean, despite his considerable ties to the more liberal wing of the party, looks to be in for a struggle against a progressive left emboldened by Sanders' primary bid.On Thursday night, People for Bernie, a tech-savvy progressive group with ties to Sanders, told CNN it was backing Ellison as a first step in displacing Clinton loyalists with ""a leadership untainted by cozy relationships to Wall St. moneymen, corporate behemoths, dictators, or monarchs.""In a jab at Dean, People for Bernie co-founder Charles Lenchner added, ""Any 50-state strategy must begin with a 50-state accountability project; we reject any effort to unite the party behind the agents of a failed leadership.""The current head of the DNC is Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative and former CNN contributor, who is leading in an interim capacity after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on the eve of the convention. Hacked emails appeared to show Wasserman Schultz and other since-departed DNC officials discussing ways to undermine Sanders' effort to oust Clinton in the primary.Brazile has come under increasing scrutiny after another trove of hacked emails showed her forwarding questions from a town hall jointly hosted by CNN to the Clinton campaign.

Only a month later the team's home base, the Quicken Loans Arena, played host to the Republican National Convention and another champion: President-elect Donald Trump. Something is clearly in the water in Believeland. 🏀 is always life in the Obama White House. President Barack Obama plays the game recreationally and even had the White House tennis court adapted into a basketball court. First Lady Michelle Obama's brother is a college basketball coach. President Barack Obama has made a habit of inviting sports champions to the White House. The Cavs could very well be the last professional sports team to get the star treatment at the White House during Obama's presidency. What's the best way to make sure basketball players (known for their height) won't upstage you? Basically make them stand in a ditch. Look at the bottom level of this riser -- it's like, 6 inches lower than the platform. Well played, POTUS.Another way to make yourself look taller? Enter the event with a short friend. In this case, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. Obama is over six feet tall, but it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to optics.LeBron James was the only player who showed up for Turtleneck Thursday and decided to take a selfie to mark the occasion. Only King James could make turtlenecks look good.Related: 8 times ball was life during the 2016 campaignAmerica's dad, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, was there. Because Ohio is the place where 🏀 is most life. Vice President Joe Biden thought it was hilarious when Obama called the 1996 Chicago Bulls the greatest team of all time. Joe knows that the greatest team of all time was the Tune Squad in Space Jam.A baby in the audience laughed and gave Obama and Biden the chance to execute their signature play: the point and gesture. Kevin Love undid all of Obama's efforts to look tall when he had to lean down to speak into the microphone. Love's NBA page says he's 6'10. How very cavalier of him. Obama asked if he could rip the sleeves off of his jersey like the cool kids do. It's hard to do a decent layup in sleeves (or so I have read). This is one jersey he might actually wear.I know someone who was living his best life today.	The Cavaliers bring d to the White House

French President Francois Hollande delivered an unusually bald response -- at a level of government where concerns are usually cloaked in diplomatic bon mots -- laying bare the risks international counterparts see in the wild card that is the US President-elect.""These American elections open a period of uncertainty,"" Holland said. ""I have to say this clearly and frankly.""Laying out the various issues France and the US collaborate on, including terrorism and climate change, Hollande went on to say that ""what's at risk is peace, the fight against terrorism, the situation in the Middle East, economic ties and the preservation of our planet.""RELATED: Why the country can be vulnerable during presidential transitions Over the months of the 2016 campaign, the real estate mogul offered foreign policy positions that would rewrite bedrock alliances in Asia, Europe and the Middle East and re-work established international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement to stem climate change. He's emphasized isolationist, protectionist themes and adopted a slogan that echoes the ""America First"" group that advocated for the US to stay out of World War II.Trump might apply those principles from the Oval Office in targeting two of President Barack Obama's most high-profile foreign policy achievements.He has pledged to reopen the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated over years with a slew of international partners, including the UN. He has also said he would consider reversing recently thawed diplomatic relations with Cuba. At the White House, Spokesman Josh Earnest was asked about the possibility that Trump could undo the president's legacy. ""It's far too early to tell what decisions President-elect Trump will make and what impact they'll have on policies President Obama has worked so hard to achieve,"" Earnest said.In statement after statement Wednesday, world leaders sought reassurance about their ties to the US. And after a bitter and divisive election campaign in which Trump was seen to marginalize and insult large groups of people, many looked for a reaffirmation of the values they associate with the world's most powerful country.German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered her country's cooperation, but with strings.""Germany and the United States (are) joined by common values -- democracy, freedom, respect for the law and human dignity -- regardless of skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political beliefs,"" Merkel said. ""Based on these values, I offer close cooperation to the future president."" European Council President Donald Tusk, who is wrestling with a migrant crisis driven by Syria's civil war and with Russian aggression along the Baltic states and in Ukraine, said that, ""While respecting the democratic choice of the American people, we are at the same time aware of the new challenges that these results bring. One of them is this moment of uncertainty over the future of our transatlantic relations.""If Trump is to be taken at his word, there will be many question marks about the future of US relations across the Atlantic and Pacific.In Europe, Trump has questioned whether NATO is still relevant and demanded that member states pay more for defense spending. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, despite Russia's military incursion into US ally Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, which triggered Western sanctions.That act violated a central tenet of modern international relations -- that national borders are inviolate. But Trump has suggested that he and Putin will work well together and that Russia ""is not going to go into Ukraine.""Putin congratulated Trump in a statement, saying, ""Russia is ready and wants to restore the full-fledged relations with the US."" He added that it would ""serve the well-being of both Russia and American peoples.""Russian parliament member Vyacheslav Nikonov told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Moscow thinks Trump ""understands some realities"" about Russia and Ukraine, as well as sanctions.""Being a businessman, he understands too well that these sanctions are harmful -- not just for the Russian economy, they are also harmful for the European economy and for the American economy,"" said Nikonov. ""Sanctions depend on the United States,"" he added. ""If America has a will to lift sanctions, they will be lifted by the European Union the next day.""In another move that would counter international consensus, Trump has said he'd like to move the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, to Jerusalem. Previous US administrations and other countries have avoided such a shift because the disputed city isn't internationally recognized as the capital of the Jewish state. In a video address to Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him that he's ""a great friend of Israel, over the years you've expressed your support consistently, and I deeply appreciate it. I look forward to working with you to advance security, prosperity and peace.""Trump has also said America's Arab allies will have to do ""the fighting"" in conflicts in Syria and Iraq, blasting Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar for ""not doing much"" at an August rally in Virginia. ""The Gulf states have nothing but money,"" Trump said. ""I'm going to get them to pay.""In Asia, Trump has suggested he'd make serious changes. He is open to a major departure from current policy by talking to North Korea to push them to halt their nuclear program, a possibility that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said wouldn't succeed.Pyongyang wants to be recognized as an equal to the US and seeks talks to demonstrate that. The Obama administration won't consider engaging with the government of Kim Jong Un until North Korea starts denuclearizing.""I would speak to him,"" Trump told Reuters in May. ""I would have no problem speaking to him.""Trump has also voiced frustration about post-World War II alliances with South Korea and Japan, saying that the two don't contribute enough to their collective security agreement. In March, he suggested that the US could pull back and more seriously arm the two countries so they could better defend themselves.""Right now, we're protecting, we're basically protecting Japan,"" Trump told the New York Times. ""And there'll be a point at which we're just not going to be able to do it anymore."""	World resigned, but wary of unpredictable Donald Trump

""There is this recognition that there isn't necessarily a political solution to all of these issues.""Trump won 72% of white men without a college degree and 62% of white women without a college degree, according to exit polling.Vance, who grew up poor in the Rust Belt, said many Trump voters do not support his offensive campaign trail rhetoric about Latinos, African-Americans and other groups.""I definitely think there's an element of racial anxiety to Trump's support, but I think it would be a real mistake to chalk it all up to that or mostly to that,"" said Vance, a Yale Law School graduate. ""The people I know that are voting for Donald Trump, a lot of times, they don't like the rhetoric he's using but they say, 'We don't like his rhetoric, but he's the only guy that's come along in a very long while who's actually talked to those issues,' "" he said.Trump was backed by the KKK's official newspaper and praised by white nationalists, such as former KKK leader David Duke.

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/muslims-trump-reaction/index.html	"Not when Donald Trump proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States, a plan his own running mate called ""offensive and unconstitutional."" Not when Trump suggested monitoring mosques and said he thinks ""Islam hates us,"" attributing anti-American enmity to a faith of 1.6 billion people. Not even when Islamophobic incidents spiked to their highest levels since the 9/11 attacks. In some ways, Ali, a 40-year-old mother of three, had been buffered from the long and brutal 2016 presidential campaign.  She trods familiar ground in her Virginia home. She drops her children off at school, where the teachers know her and she knows them. She shops at the same grocery store, where the people smile at her and she smiles back, her face framed by a hijab. At her polling station on Tuesday, she was greeted warmly by neighbors, even the ones whose cars bore pro-Trump stickers.As the editor of the Muslim section of Patheos, a website specializing in spirituality, Ali had edited plenty of stories about other Muslims' distress. She knew their fears intimately. But she had never herself felt the stomach-churning anxiety. Until Wednesday morning.  ""I woke up today and I finally felt it. It felt personal, like the election was a vote against me.""As a tumultuous Tuesday ticked toward a worry-producing Wednesday, scores of Muslim imams and activists, soccer moms and scholars, commiserated over their concern and uncertainty, even as they pledged to hold fast to their faith and build stronger coalitions with fellow minorities. More than 7 in 10 Muslims had said they would vote for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, according to an October survey by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Just 4% had said they would vote for Trump, and perhaps as few expected him to win. Some said his election felt like a betrayal, as if half the country had turned on them. ""Our worst nightmare materialized last night,"" said Wardah Khalid, a writer and foreign policy analyst. ""A man that built his platform on bigotry, misogyny, and the vilification of Muslims and minorities won the highest office in the land.""'Open season' on Muslims ""Shock. Complete and utter shock,"" said Yasir Qadhi, a well-known Muslim scholar in Memphis, Tennessee. He, like many others, said he had expected Clinton to win the presidency. ""And all of us are genuinely worried. I fear for the safety of my wife in hijab; of my children in the streets; of minorities everywhere struggling to understand what happened."" Sahar Aziz, a professor at the Texas A&M University School of Law, said Trump's election represents a regression to a less tolerant and inclusive America. ""The general mood I am seeing among Muslims is concern that a Trump presidency will be open season on them. Some Muslims worry their children may experience bullying at school because Trump's victory validated the mainstreaming of Islamophobia. Some women are afraid to wear their headscarves in public in case this invites physical or verbal assault."" Amirah Waite, a 19-year-old American-Indonesian college student who lives in Hawaii, said Wednesday  she was ""so terrified that I can't stop shaking ... stuck in a country that hates me.""The secret costs of Islamophobia Other Muslims said they fear Trump will install anti-Muslim activists, whose work he has promoted, in powerful roles at the Justice Department and other agencies.""We could go back to that post-9/11, witch hunt-type environment,"" said Sheikh Hamza Yusuf, a scholar and co-founder of Zaytuna College, the country's first accredited Muslim college. In California, Abdullah bin Hamid Ali said he and other African-American Muslims are somewhat less unsettled than their immigrant co-religionists. They have seen enough of American history to sense that elections often hinge on turning out white voters, sometimes through fear and demonization of ""others.""   ""While I can't say I'm 'happy' with the results (I wasn't rooting for Clinton, either) I am somewhat hopeful that Trump's election will force people to come closer and be much nicer to one another,"" said Abdullah, a professor at Zaytuna.Omid Safi, director of Duke University's Islamic Center, likewise said he hopes Trump's election will foster a sense of solidarity among the marginalized, including Muslims and Hispanics, African-Americans and Native Americans, poor people and gays and lesbians. ""If we want to see an America that we are proud of, we have to build that America. It is not in our present, and was not part of our past, it can only be in our shared future.""Determined not to changeDalia Mogahed, a researcher and pollster, said she is in shock, unable to believe that more than 50.5 million Americans voted to elect Donald Trump as president. ""I'm scared of what this means for my family, especially my kids. What kind of an America will they inherit?""But Mogahed said she is determined not to change a ""single plan."" She will continue to advocate on behalf of this country's estimated 3.3 million Muslims and to wear her hijab in public, proudly announcing her identity as a Muslim.Many Muslims expressed similar thoughts on Wednesday, resolving to continue to fight for their civil rights, and to remain vigilant against any encroachments on their claim to an American identity. ""I'm assuming that the next four years will be hard, but we must use a Trump victory to renew our connection to God and communities so we can organize around important issues that concern us all,"" said Imam Suhaib Webb, a popular cleric based in Washington. ""Regardless of the situation, God commands us to stay dedicated to good and to each other. Nothing changes. My passion is greater than it was yesterday."" 'God's got us' On Wednesday morning in Texas, Sheikh Omar Suleiman had one of the toughest conversations he can recall with his young daughter. ""She couldn't understand why America would elect a bigoted bully. And neither can I. But I reminded her what we do with bullies: We stand up to them."" Hundreds of miles away, Ali had a similar conversation with her 13-year-old daughter. The middle-school student had become deeply invested in the presidential campaign. Her class  held mock elections and watched the debates for extra credit. She knew that Trump had mocked a disabled reporter. She heard what he said about Muslims and women. As her daughter sobbed on her shoulder, Ali tried to comfort her. But her bluff was called. ""You're right, it's not OK,"" Ali said. ""None of this is OK. But eventually, it will be OK. We are a practicing Muslim family and presidents and elections and nationalism and culture are one thing, but God is above all of us. And God has his reasons for doing things that we don't understand, but I fully believe that he's got us."" Later on Wednesday, after Ali's husband dropped their daughter off at school, Ali called the school counselor. She asked the counselor to check on her daughter, quietly, and not let her know that Ali was worried."	For American Muslims: Shock, fear and resolve
