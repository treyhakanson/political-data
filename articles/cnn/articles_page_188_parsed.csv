I don't know what's going on. I'm like you. I just see what I see -- the coughing fit was a week ago, so I assume that was pneumonia also,"" Trump said Monday on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends."" ""So something is going on, but i just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail, and we'll be seeing her at the debate.""Trump said during the interview that he'll soon make public the results of a doctor's physical he had last week.Clinton was pulled off the trail Sunday after ""overheating"" at a remembrance of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York. The subsequent revelation that she was diagnosed with pneumonia Friday has renewed questions about her transparency. In a CNBC interview later Monday, Trump was slightly more pointed when he appeared to question the timing of the diagnosis.""It was interesting because they say pneumonia on Friday, but she was coughing very, very badly a week ago, and even before that, if you remember. This wasn't the first time. So, it's very interesting to see what is going on. I want her to get better,"" Trump said.Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn told CNN's Alisyn Camerota that he hopes she's doing alright, but quickly moved to praising Trump's energy in contrast.""I've always felt like I've stayed, you know, in good shape myself. This is a guy that has enormous stamina. I watch him move from city to city, event to event, engage robustly with a lot of people, and -- and he's a pretty amazing guy,"" Flynn said Monday on ""New Day.""Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway opened her thoughts Monday with sympathy for Clinton, before quickly turning it into an attack on the candidate's chief weakness: perceptions of honesty and transparency.""I would echo Mr. Trump's statement that I just hope she's feeling better and gets back on the trail soon,"" Conway said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" before pivoting to a condemnation of how she handled the revelation she had pneumonia. ""She's still not transparent, she still won't open herself up to the press, this nonsense that she respects what all of you do by having this phony press availability on the plane last week and then the moment that you really need to be with her, 90 minutes of radio silence. It took the entire day to get public the diagnosis that apparently she had received days earlier.""The approach that did not fully embrace questioning the status of Clinton's health and stamina stands in sharp contrast to comments the campaign made just weeks earlier. Trump re-tooled his primary attack on Jeb Bush for being ""low energy"" to use against Clinton this summer, saying she needs lots of sleep, making it a regular line in his rallies. He then challenged her, last month, to release her medical records.Trump's physician faced scrutiny from media reports -- including CNN -- which highlighted a 2015 letter he wrote vouching for Trump's health which included what other doctors described as strange wording, medically incorrect terms and an unprofessional conclusion."

Trump's outrage Monday was a significant political statement for a candidate who has repeatedly offended millions of Americans throughout his controversial campaign.""The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed toward millions of Americans disqualifies her from public service. You cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter,"" Trump said. ""You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.""Trump, who has not apologized for any of his political attacks or offensive statements throughout his presidential campaign, appeared shocked that Clinton had not yet apologized for her comments and called on her to do so.""Hillary Clinton has not apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all,"" Trump said. ""If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don't see how she can credibly campaign any further.""Clinton expressed ""regret"" Saturday for saying that half of Trump's supporters were deplorable -- including calling them racists, xenophobes and Islamophobes -- remarks she made at a fundraiser Friday night as well as in an interview earlier in the week.""Last night I was 'grossly generalistic,' and that's never a good idea. I regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong,"" Clinton said in a statement in which she vowed to continue to call out the ""bigotry"" in Trump's campaign.Clinton's national press secretary Brian Fallon responded to Trump's statement Monday, saying ""the larger point of what she said on Friday remains true and it's something we're not going to apologize for.""""That Donald Trump continues to not just condone but welcome, promote and lift up, divisive, hate-filled elements in this country that he's giving a platform with his campaign,"" Fallon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""The idea that somebody is running a campaign that is engaging in this kind of hate-filled demagoguery in 2016 is deplorable.""Vice President Joe Biden defended Clinton on the campaign trail in North Carolina, saying she gets a bum rap and that if Trump were held to her standard, then ""He'd be in trouble.""Trump's condemnation of Clinton's comments come less than a month after he expressed regret for sometimes saying ""the wrong thing"" over the course of his campaign, during which he has offended Hispanics, Muslims, disabled Americans and veterans.Earlier on Monday, Trump argued on Fox News that Clinton's comment about his supporters was the ""biggest mistake of the political season."" And in an ad backed by a $2 million ad buy in the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, Trump's campaign blasts Clinton for ""viciously demonizing hard-working people.""Trump, in his most extensive repudiation of Clinton's comments, attacked Clinton on several fronts, arguing that her comments reinforced her status as an ""insider"" and displayed her ""sense of arrogance and entitlement"" and said Clinton's comments showed she ""divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.""""She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over,"" Trump said.The Republican nominee also told ""Fox and Friends"" earlier Monday that he couldn't believe the ""basket of deplorables"" remark when he first heard it. ""At first I thought it wasn't within the realm of possible that she said it,"" he said. ""She doubled up, because it was said with such anger, such unbelievable anger, and I think this is the biggest mistake of the political season. I really do. When I saw this in its full form, and I saw the anger with which she said it, the way she spoke, I think it's the single biggest mistake of the political season.""At about the same time, the campaign released a new ad blasting Clinton for the comments.In the ad, a narrator hits Clinton for making the comment while ""speaking to wealthy donors"" before playing video of Clinton's remarks. ""People like you...you...and you...'Deplorable,'"" the narrator says over video of Trump supporters. ""You know what's deplorable? Hillary Clinton viciously demonizing hard-working people like you,"" the ad closes. RELATED: Hillary Clinton stumbles -- will her campaign follow?Trump kicked off his campaign by calling undocumented Mexican immigrants criminals and ""rapists"" and then soon thereafter dismissed Sen. John McCain's years of imprisonment as a prisoner of war, saying he liked ""people who weren't captured.""Trump later called for a ban on all Muslims and said ""Islam hates us"" and has since said a US federal judge was inherently biased against him because of his Mexican heritage, which the Republican speaker of the House called the ""textbook definition of a racist comment."""

Sources told CNN afterward that Clinton fainted and her doctor issued a statement on Sunday afternoon saying that the Democratic nominee was diagnosed with pneumonia during a check up on Friday. ""As you may have heard today, Secretary Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia and her doctor has advised her to rest,"" donors were told via email.

Those followed mechanical failures in the USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) and USS Milwaukee (LCS 5), all since December.The new deployment plan for the LCS fleet isn't a response to the breakdown issues, Navy spokesman Lt. Kara Yingling told CNN. ""The review was a comprehensive look at maintenance, training, and manning across the class -- not limited to one ship or one incident. As with any new ship class, the Navy constantly looks for ways to improve employment and deployment of its ships,"" she said.The plan kicks off next year with the conversion of the first four littoral combat ships, Freedom, Fort Worth, Coronado and USS Independence (LCS 2) -- into testing ships.The review was ordered by Navy leaders in late February, shortly after the problems with the Fort Worth and the Milwaukee. The results were announced Thursday by Vice Adm. Tom Rowden, commander of Naval Surface Forces.The new plan for the LCS, the first of which was commissioned in 2008, backs away from what the Navy had touted as ""a bold departure from traditional Navy shipbuilding programs based on its use of innovative acquisition, construction, manning, training and operational concepts"" and also includes some proven Navy concepts.For instance, the original plans had three crews rotating through two ships, the goal being to keep the ships deployed for longer periods with fresh crews. The new plan has two crews assigned to each ship, with one deployed and one undergoing training ashore like the Navy does with its ""blue"" and ""gold"" submarine crews.The Navy also said the new plan would have those crews focusing during a deployment on only one mission of the ships' three missions -- anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and mine countermeasures. Previously, the LCS were designed to be able to switch among those missions.The plan means the Navy will have to add personnel, about 420 sailors, when it is fully implemented in 2023, Rowden told reporters. By that time, the Navy plans to have 28 littoral combat ships in the fleet, up from the six currently in service.The exceptions to the blue-gold crew plans will be the four testing ships, which will be ""manned with seasoned, experienced LCS sailors,"" the Navy said. ""... their main focus will be on system testing.""  Lastly, the Navy said an LCS' homeport would be based on its variant, with the single-hulled Freedom variants (odd number designations) based in Mayport, Florida, and the tri-hulled Independence variants (even numbered designations) based in San Diego. Three divisions of four ships each will operate out of each port, it said."	US Navy overhauls troubled littoral combat ship program	[]	[]

""The reality is if South Sudan is a failed state, we've seen what influences take over in a failed state, and it's never good,"" Clooney said. ""And that's something we'll have to deal with for generations, if we don't deal with it now. Now, it's easy. It'll be a lot harder in the years to come.""On Monday the organization Clooney co-founded, The Sentry, published a two-year investigation following the finances of South Sudan's top leaders, a report which Clooney called ""explosive"".""We have these guys nailed,"" Clooney told Tapper. ""We realized that if you can't really shame the bad guys then what you can do is follow the money and perhaps shame the people who are hiding it.""The report found that despite a civil war which claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions, the top leaders of South Sudan, including President Salva Kiir, his former vice president Riek Machar, and other top leaders have benefited off of the instability and violence.According to the investigation, leaders have amassed huge fortunes, with high-end foreign real estate, luxury cars, and lucrative commercial ventures, often with the assistance of international banks, lawyers, and arms brokers. ""The president, the deposed vice president, all the major generals in the army have suctioned that economy dry. They have stolen the resources of the country,"" John Prendergast, co-founder of The Sentry. "" And they have been able to divert that money for private use or to fund these deadly wars.""The world's youngest nation, South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan in 2011, but within a few years had slid into a civil war between President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his then-Vice President Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer.A peace agreement signed in 2015 between the two leaders calmed the violence. However clashes resumed on July 8 of this year, with around 300 people killed.  Nearly 122,000 refugees have fled South Sudan since this latest fighting, adding to the more than 2.5 million people who have been displaced since  2013, according to the UN's refugee agency UNHCR. Both sides of the conflict have been accused atrocities, which include the use of rape as a weapon of war, attacks on civilians, and the recruitment of child soldiers. South Sudan's government agreed to the deployment of an additional 4,000 peacekeepers on behalf of the United Nations Security Council in August, adding to the 12,000 peacekeepers already stationed in the country.Clooney said that wasn't enough by itself.""It's not just that the peacekeepers are allowed in, though listen, every bit helps,"" Clooney said. ""It's also the mandate that they're given. And, that's going to be a big deal.""The report suggests targeted sanctions, asset freezes, and increased monitoring from international financial institutions.'Divided country'The movie star, a Hillary Clinton supporter, also weighed in on the Democrat's campaign, dismissing a question about whether she should be running away with the race. ""It's been a long time since races weren't close ... we're a very divided country,"" he said. ""That's too bad, I think. We're not a divided people. We all want the same things in life which is our families to be happy and healthy and to be proud of our country, and so I hope somewhere along the way we stop being so divided.""And he said if Donald Trump is elected it wouldn't affect his work around the globe.""No, I don't have concerns with that,"" Clooney said, ticking off his international efforts. ""That work continues no matter who's in charge.""The report suggests targeted sanctions, asset freezes, and increased monitoring from international financial institutions."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/amanpour-hillary-clinton-health-2016-election/index.html	"CNN's Christiane Amanpour posed that very question after Hillary Clinton's health was thrust into the spotlight after her wobbling departure Sunday at ground zero. Video of Clinton showed the Democratic presidential nominee leaving a 9/11 ceremony early, wobbling and slumping as she entered her vehicle. Several hours after the incident, the Clinton campaign revealed that she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.Clinton stumbles -- will her campaign follow?Amanpour on Monday addressed criticism lodged at the Clinton campaign for waiting two days to inform the public about her pneumonia diagnosis by pointing out what she said is a history of the media shielding health problems of American presidents. ""Surely this can't be a case of a human being having an off day,"" Amanpour said sarcastically. ""No, like so many things Hillary the media are having a field day. Off to the races with another debilitating case of indignant outrage. This must be another typical Clinton conspiracy to fool them with a total transparency breakdown.""On the issue of a 'transparency breakdown,' Amanpour points out the fact that Republican nominee Donald Trump has yet to release his tax returns. Donald Trump says he took physical last week, will release 'when the numbers come in'""When it comes to overqualified women having to try 100 times harder than underqualified men to get a break, or even a level playing field -- well, we know that story."" Amanpour said.Amanpour went on to highlight past U.S. presidents with health incidents or problems.

Kennedy saved the world from possible nuclear Armageddon during the Cuban Missile Crisis, called for a new frontier in space and generally inspired whole generations around the globe,"" Amanpour said.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/11/politics/hillary-clinton-health-2016-election/index.html	"Her wobbly exit Sunday at muggy Ground Zero -- captured on damaging video of Clinton lurching into the arms of her security detail -- followed by a belated announcement that she has pneumonia dramatically turned the state of her health from conservative conspiracy theory into a genuine campaign issue.But Sunday's drama was merely a capstone on Clinton's rough 48 hours.Clinton aides spent Saturday cleaning up her remark that ""half"" of Trump's supporters were ""deplorables,"" meaning racists, sexists and homophobes. The remark, for which she later expressed ""regret,"" suddenly united a Republican Party that has struggled to get behind its divisive nominee.Aides were scrambling to repair the damage Monday with Clinton's expected absence from the campaign trail for several days threatening to provide an opening for Trump to capture the initiative at a moment when he is closing in the polls.While pneumonia is a relatively common complaint, the Democratic nominee, 68, now faces increasing political pressure to demonstrate she is fit for the considerable physical demands of the presidency. Her campaign is also confronting new questions over transparency after it kept details of her condition quiet for two days.Trump expressed sympathy Monday when asked what he knew about Clinton's health in television interviews -- apparently seeking to avoid characteristically inflammatory remarks which would have made the story about him, rather than his rival.""I really just don't know. I hope she gets well soon,"" Trump told Fox News, adding later, ""Something is going on but I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail, and we'll be seeing her at the debate.""But Trump, 70, who has made public fewer details about his health than Clinton has, could not resist raising veiled doubts about Clinton's true condition.""They say pneumonia on Friday, but she was coughing very, very badly a week ago, and even before that, if you remember. This wasn't the first time. So, it's very interesting to see what is going on,"" Trump said on CNBC.The billionaire also said during his Fox interview that he had a doctor's physical last week and would release ""the numbers"" when he has them.Advisers to Clinton are discussing how to move beyond arguably the worst weekend of the campaign. Any attempt at turning the corner on transparency -- after taking reporters' questions for four-straight days last week -- ""has obviously been erased,"" one aide said.Health issues are always difficult territory for presidential candidates, who are forced to cede privacy that regular people take for granted. But there will still be questions asked why Clinton, after days of speculation about her health, was not more forthcoming with her diagnosis.The health of a potential President is considered of vital public knowledge given the intense pressures of the job and concentration of powers over life and death that flow through the Oval Office.CNN contributor and former Barack Obama strategist David Axelrod encapsulated the campaign's problem when he tweeted, ""Antibiotics can take care of pneumonia. What's the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems?""Clinton campaign communications director acknowledged on Twitter that the campaign ""could have done better,"" she used a pair of tweets Monday to put the focus back on their opponent.""In contrast to HRC, Trump has been less transparent than any nominee in modern history,"" she tweeted.Clinton campaign officials pushed back on the suggestion that their delay in announcing the candidate had pneumonia amounted to intentionally misleading the public, but acknowledged that Clinton herself didn't fully convey how she felt.Many people inside the Clinton campaign did not know about the pneumonia diagnosis on Friday. An aide told CNN that Clinton ""thought she could push through this ... she was feeling better"" -- until Sunday morning, when she went to a September 11 memorial event in Manhattan but was forced to leave early.Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, told CNN that the campaign will release more medical information on the candidate later this week.""The reality is, the pneumonia is the extent of what she has been diagnosed with. There are no other undisclosed conditions,"" Fallon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. He added later, ""We continue to want to be as transparent as possible on this, but at some point, people have to ask the same questions of Donald Trump""The double weekend blows came at just the wrong time for Clinton, as Trump closes in the polls and pressure builds ahead of the first presidential debate in two weeks -- an event shaping up to be a potentially pivotal moment of the campaign.Whether Clinton's rocky weekend will turn out to be just another unexpected twist in an election season that has had everything, or exert a lasting political impact will only become clear in the coming days.She canceled a trip to California scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, though Clinton is expected to call in to Monday's evening fundraiser. The speed of her recovery and the way her enemies handle the episode will do much to shape how voters respond to her health issue.Both Clinton and her husband former President Bill Clinton are known for punishing public schedules, despite health issues they have both had in the past, so it would not be a surprise to see the former secretary of state seek to get back on the campaign trail as soon as possible. Hillary Clinton isn't the only member of her campaign who has been sick with respiratory issues. Some of Clinton's top aides -- including those who travel with her -- have been felled with respiratory issues in the last month, sources tell CNN. At least three senior aides have been ill, including at least one of whom was hospitalized and treated for dehydration.Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill said she was feeling better on Monday but was following her doctor's recommendation to stay home and rest. Aides said the Democratic nominee would work on debate prep for her debate clash with Trump -- and event that takes on even more significance in the light of Clinton's health episode.Weekend on defenseBut a weekend on defense and a possibly reduced schedule going forward threatens to slow Clinton's campaign at an unwelcome moment and will do little to calm increasingly jittery Democrats who only weeks ago were speculating about the possibility of an electoral landslide.Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, released a reassuring statement late Sunday wishing Clinton a ""speedy recovery.""""I look forward to seeing her back out on the campaign trail and continuing on the path to victory,"" she said.It was bad enough for Clinton that she had to leave the ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attacks early -- setting off alarm bells among her traveling press pool. But the later emergence of video showing her wobbly, staggering and stumbling before being helped into her black van conjured up the kind of image, played over and over on television, that campaign strategists dread.The footage was more than a blow to her dignity. It will be used by opponents to validate a months-long campaign of rumors and innuendo about the true state of Clinton's health.9/11 cuts deep in Trump, Clinton campaignsTrump has frequently cast doubt on Clinton's physical fitness, saying she lacks ""stamina"" and takes naps in the afternoon and runs on an easy schedule -- a claim debunked by reporters who follow her campaign.Aware of potential impactThe Clinton campaign was clearly aware of the potential impact of the video. After resting at her daughter Chelsea's apartment, the Democratic nominee emerged smiling, and under her own power in front of the cameras, taking a picture with a young girl before climbing into her motorcade.She told reporters she was ""feeling great"" and parried further questions by commenting that it was a ""beautiful day in New York.""The campaign also tried to foster an air of normality by saying that Clinton spent time playing with her grandchildren while at her daughter's home.But hours of speculation and uncertainty about what happened to Clinton and a lack of information about her status triggered an air of crisis.When details about her condition finally emerged -- in the form of a statement issued through the campaign by Clinton's physician Lisa Bardack -- they only added to impressions that the campaign abhors transparency.Hillary Clinton's stumble highlights campaign transparency problemsAdvisers to Clinton are also discussing Monday how to move beyond arguably the worst weekend of the campaign. Any attempt at turning the corner on transparency -- after taking reporters' questions for four-straight days last week -- ""has obviously been erased,"" one aide said. Clinton campaign officials pushed back on the suggestion that they were intentionally misleading the public, but acknowledged that Clinton herself didn't fully convey how she felt.Given that Trump is 70 and would be the oldest person to take the oath of office as President for a first term, and Clinton would be the second oldest, both candidates are certain to face pressure for a more comprehensive accounting of their health.Bardack issued a letter late last year saying Clinton was in good health and fit to serve as President. Trump has offered only a bizarre report from New York physician Harold Bornstein, saying that he would be the ""healthiest individual ever elected President.""Clinton is likely to resume campaigning Wednesday, but will almost certainly not fly to Nevada. She is more likely to give her economic-themed speech in a battleground state far closer to New York: Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Ohio are possibilities.Difficult territory for candidatesEver since Clinton sustained a blood clot and a concussion after a fainting episode near the end of her tenure as secretary of state in 2012, she has faced a swirl of conspiracy theories about her health.She joked about the criticism on ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" last month.""Back in October, the National Enquirer said I would be dead in six months. So with every breath I take, I feel like I have a new lease on life,"" Clinton said.If Clinton is forced to take time off, it will fall to her high-profile surrogates to pick up the slack. The President, for instance, is due to campaign for his former rival and secretary of state Tuesday in Philadelphia. His wife, Michelle Obama, will hit the campaign trail as well next week.New Clinton ad highlights Republicans criticizing TrumpClinton had hoped for better headlines after the first frenzied post-Labor Day week on the trail.After months of dodging the press, she invited reporters to travel on her new campaign jet last week and took questions. On Friday, she gathered a group of high ranking former national security officials and military brass and delivered a presidential-style statement to stress her suitability to lead national security policy in the Oval Office.Polls, however, show that Clinton's lead has dramatically narrowed in recent weeks, amid unflattering coverage of the controversy over her email server and the Clinton Foundation.A CNN/ORC poll last week had behind Trump by 2% among likely voters and there are also signs of tightening in swing state polls -- despite Clinton still having many more routes to 270 electoral votes than TrumpBut in one ray of sunshine for Clinton on Sunday, an ABC News/Washington Post poll showed her up 5% on Trump among likely voters."

""Mr. Trump understands the magnitude of the threats we face and is holding his cards close to the vest.""Woolsey told CNN's ""At This Hour"" that he met with Trump on Friday and has agreed to advise the campaign ""principally if not exclusively on national security matters such as defense, intelligence, maybe some aspects of energy ... whatever he needs.""One reason Woolsey said he supports Trump is that the Republican presidential nominee ""seems willing to keep a secret and not to blab everything to the public and our opponents.""His hire comes a week after Trump vowed to end the sequester on defense spending and boost military spending, including increasing troop levels and boosting the number of US military ships and planes.Woolsey, who chairs the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a neoconservative group, most recently advised Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump's chief rival for the Republican nomination.Woolsey also served as a top US arms control negotiator in the 1980s.The former CIA director in his campaign statement slammed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's leadership at the State Department under the Obama administration as he explained his decision to join Trump's campaign.Woolsey argued Clinton ""demonstrated a complete lack of understanding and an inability to lead the agency she headed in such a way as to maintain its mission and security."" ""Based on the emails thus far released we know that Secretary Clinton also lacks the ability to lead her senior managers while complying with and maintaining the basic protocols designed to protect our government's sensitive and classified information,"" Woolsey said.

The Republican nominee pointed to critics who said NBC host Matt Lauer was too soft on Trump during a national security town hall last week and argued that the next moderator will try to be overly tough on Trump to avoid similar criticism. ""I can see it happening right now,"" Trump said. ""The new person is going to try to be really hard on Trump just to show, you know, the establishment what he can do. So I think it's very unfair what they're doing.""Trump in fact argued that Lauer wasn't easy on him, but that Trump simply answered questions better than Hillary Clinton. ""I thought he was very professional, I have to be honest. I think he's been treated very unfairly.""His comments come a week after Trump told reporters on his plane that he respected the chosen moderators. ""I like them. I respect the moderators.
