A campaign source told CNN he would make a stop after his visit to Ground Zero but did not provide details.Despite the one-day reprieve, both Clinton and Trump have made 9/11 major themes of their campaigns, each speaking vividly about the aftermath of the attacks and the United States' actions since.  In January, when GOP primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz attacked ""New York values,"" Trump recalled 9/11 vividly in a debate. ""It was with us for months, the smell,"" Trump said. ""And everybody in the world loved New York, loved New Yorkers -- and I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement.""RELATED: Looking back at 9/11, Americans feel fear, anger, worryClinton was at Ground Zero on the day after the attacks and worked in the Senate to bring billions of dollars in aid for first responders and rebuilding efforts to New York City -- a role she has touted on the campaign trail. ""I was a senator from New York,"" Clinton said Tuesday in Tampa. ""I knew people who were killed. I worked with families and the few survivors. I worked to get the health care needed by our first responders and emergency workers who ran toward danger. I worked to make our country safer and to rebuild New York and the Pentagon.""They also have used the aftermath of the history-changing attacks to push their case for why they should be the next commander in chief.Trump claimed Thursday at a charter school in Cleveland that he would have caught Osama bin Laden prior to the 9/11 attacks he masterminded. ""I would have been tougher on terrorism,"" Trump said. ""Bin Laden would've been caught a long time ago, before he was ultimately caught, prior to the downing of the World Trade Center."" Clinton, meanwhile, often recalls being in the White House Situation Room with President Barack Obama the day he green-lit the mission that led to the killing of bin Laden, saying the moment underscores her experience with tough security decisions and shows why she's ready to be in the Oval Office.""When it came time to go around the table, with extremely experienced, thoughtful experts, we all gave our opinions. I was one who said I thought it was worth the risk,"" Clinton said Thursday in Tampa. It's long been a prominent portion of Clinton's stump speech. She told an Iowa crowd in January it was ""one of the most tense days of my life."" And they also use the policies that 9/11 spawned to take the each other down.At an event Thursday, Clinton described Navy SEALs removing women and children from bin Laden's compound. ""That, Donald Trump, is what American honor looks like,"" she said. Trump, meanwhile, has made his opposition to the Iraq War, launched under President George W. Bush in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a core foreign policy talking point. Trump has repeatedly claimed he opposed the Iraq war from the beginning, even though he supported it in a 2002 interview with Howard Stern and didn't make any public comments opposing the war before it began. He's cited Clinton's vote in favor of it as evidence of her poor decision-making ability. ""Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition,"" he said Thursday in Cleveland.But both candidates plan to pause those efforts to persuade voters on the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The tradition of presidential candidates shutting their campaigns down for the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks began in 2004, with President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry. In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain held a joint event at Ground Zero. And in 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney suspended their negative advertisements and held separate events focused on 9/11 and military service. This election, the day has even more resonance for the candidates, since both parties' nominees are New Yorkers. At the same time, their personal ties to the sensitive historical event haven't kept Trump and Clinton free from controversy on the subject.RELATED: 5 years ago the U.S. killed Osama bin Laden. Did it matter?In a November debate against Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders, Clinton invoked the 9/11 attacks and her tenure as a New York senator, from 2001 to 2009, to fend off charges from the Vermont senator that she was too close to Wall Street. The comment -- connecting 9/11 with campaign finance -- infuriated liberals, with Sanders saying the next day that he had ""no idea what the connection is"" and another candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, calling it ""a pretty disgraceful moment."" One week later, Trump set off a bigger controversy with a claim he made at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama. ""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,"" he said. ""And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering."" Local police said Trump's claim was wrong, fact-checkers disputed it and Trump's campaign never produced any evidence to support it. Still, Trump stood by it the next day in an interview with ABC ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos, saying, ""It was on television. I saw it."" ""There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down,"" Trump said. Trump was pilloried by his rivals for the comment. Former New York Gov. George Pataki, at that time a primary rival, tweeted that he wasn't sure ""what luxury spider-hole"" Trump hid in on 9/11, ""but I saw Americans come together that day."" "	9/11 cuts deep in Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton campaigns	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Romney', 'McCain', 'Cruz', 'Obama']	[]

The order allows him to live full time with his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, but still under certain restrictions.John Hinckley Jr. revealed""The very carefully considered decision by the court to release Mr. Hinckley based on the copious evidence by medical professionals and government expert witnesses should give great comfort to a concerned citizenry that the mental health system and the judicial system worked and worked well,""   Hinckley's longtime lawyer Barry William Levine said in a statement.""People of good will should feel good about Mr. Hinckley's recovery and wish him well.""Doctors said Hinckley had recovered from the mental illness that drove him to shoot Reagan and three others outside the Washington Hilton in March 1981.James Brady, the White House press secretary hit in the shooting, died in 2014 due to injuries from the assassination attempt.Hinckley has slowly gained some freedoms since he was incarcerated. In 2003, he was allowed day visits with his family, and since then has been granted longer visits and now has been spending about 17 days a month with his mother.He is not allowed to go near any member of the Reagan or Brady families, along with relatives of the Secret Service officer and the D.C. police officer wounded in the 1981 attempt, according to the court order.

So when she makes a mistake -- particularly a highly public one, as she did Friday night -- it's magnified.Friday's comments came at the end of Clinton's most media accessible week of the campaign, one in which she answered questions from reporters four separate times. When she took the stage to introduce Barbra Streisand at the New York event, it was only the sixth time her pool of traveling reporters had been allowed into one of her over 330 finance events.It may very well be her last.Clinton's remark was similar to one she's made recently on a topic she is eager to discuss, only this time, she added the word ""half"" -- labeling millions of Americans as bigots. Almost immediately after the remarks were widely reported, #BasketofDeplorables began trending on Twitter, with Trump and his supporters stoking the flames online.On Saturday morning, the clip was played countless times on television and online. By early afternoon, Clinton walked back her comments.""Last night I was 'grossly generalistic,' and that's never a good idea,"" Clinton said in her statement. ""I regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong.""Hitting Trump on racismClinton's campaign is happy to have a debate about its belief that Trump's movement is animated by racism, Democrats close to the campaign said Saturday. But the fact that she condemned half of Trump's supporters is what worried Clinton's senior aides, who said Saturday they couldn't have a conversation around racism before Clinton backed away from that part of the comment.The decision to release a statement came after video of the comment was played repeatedly on cable and broadcast news Saturday morning. The Clinton campaign's initial response to the comment was to hunker down and hope it blew over, while her aides defiantly took to Twitter, noting some of Trump's most vitriolic statements.But the comments, aided by Trump's campaign, continued to reverberate. ""Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!"" Trump tweeted Saturday morning.It quickly became clear Clinton had to do something.But when walking back the remarks, Clinton also vowed to continue ""calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign"" while emphasizing that she still wanted to be seen as a candidate of unity.""I'm determined to bring our country together and make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. Because we really are 'stronger together,'"" Clinton wrote.And while Clinton did say she regretted the comment, she did not apologize to people she may have offended.Going forward, Clinton aides plan to force Trump to talk about racist elements behind his campaign -- like she did last month with a speech claiming far-right groups are having an outsized influence -- while framing Clinton's admission of a mistake as something that Trump would never do.'Can you imagine'Clinton and her aides have long said there has been double standard in the way Trump can make outrageous statements that, they adamantly believe, would imperil her campaign.""A lot of this behavior coming from him seems to be expected somehow,"" Clinton said. ""And that is fine if you are a reality TV star or you are a real estate developer. I don't think it is fine if you want to be president of the United States.""On Thursday, she called it ""frustrating.""""But it is just part of the landscape that we live in and we just keep forging ahead,"" Clinton said.Her aides have been even more blunt, watching in disbelief since the start of Trump's campaign as he has surged in the polls despite making one salacious comment after another.""Can you imagine if she did anything like that?"" one aide said after Trump mocked a reporter's physical disability by mimicking him at an event. ""Can you imagine"" has become a common refrain among Clinton aides, especially after Trump said Republican Sen. John McCain -- who was held and tortured in Vietnam for more than five years -- was not a war hero because he was captured and when he boasted that he could ""stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody"" and not lose voters.Democrats furiousSo Democrats close to Clinton were furious Saturday that her comments were seen as controversial.""I think it's ridiculous that there's a debate about whether Donald Trump has a sizable bloc of supporters who are racists,"" said one Democratic operative close to the Clinton campaign who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly. ""Hillary's detractors in the GOP and the press rip her for not telling the truth, and then when she does, they rip her for doing that. It's absurd.""Bakari Sellers, a Clinton surrogate and CNN contributor, was defiant when asked about the remark, suggesting that it didn't matter if Clinton referred to half or merely some of Trump's supporters as ""deplorables.""""This election is about beating back bigotry and hate,"" Sellers said in an interview. ""Whether it's 10% or 50%, Donald Trump and his supporters have elevated it. If you're not a bigot, her comments shouldn't offend you.""Tim Kaine, Clinton's running mate, even argued to The Washington Post that she didn't need to apologize.Just over an hour after the Post's story published, Clinton issued her statement of regret."

Minnesota is a reliably Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican when Richard Nixon won re-election in 1972.Electors submitted to the state's secretary of state are the people who will officially cast Minnesota's votes for president. Trump only made the ballot at the last minute thanks to a late scramble by state Republicans who discovered that their nominee was not yet on the ballot. Minnesota's Republican Party last week called the lawsuit ""frivolous"" and said their elector selection complied with state and party rules.""Donald Trump got on our ballot fair and square, and it is outrageous that the Democrat Party would actually try to rig the election this way,"" GOP chair Keith Downey said in a statement. ""It sure smells bad when the Democrat Party petitions the Democrat Secretary of State to remove the Republican candidate from the presidential ballot."""

The comments, even given Trump's penchant for tough language, are unusual for a presidential candidate.Trump appeared to be referring to a series of close encounters between the US and Iran in international waters in the Persian Gulf.An Iranian ship came within 100 yards of a US Navy patrol ship earlier this week in what the US Navy described as an ""unsafe and unprofessional"" action involving ""harassing maneuvering.""And late last month, a US Navy patrol craft fired three warning shots at an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps boat after US officials said it had harassed two US ships. Another US patrol craft and a Kuwaiti Navy ship were also harassed in the northern end of the Persian Gulf.Iran has also flown drones over US ships and in one of the most intense confrontations between the US and Iran, Iranian troops took US sailors into custody in January after the US naval ship accidentally strayed into Iranian territorial waters.The US has condemned Iran's actions but hasn't responded militarily to the provocations.Those actions come against the backdrop of renewed US diplomatic contacts with Iran, which has triggered a political backlash among Iranian hardliners.But Trump, the Republican nominee, has repeatedly argued that Obama has been too ""weak"" on the world stage and vowed a more aggressive posture, including threatening more serious military action.Trump has vowed to ""bomb the s--- out of ISIS"" and has left open the possibility of using nuclear weapons as president.He also has suggested that he would bomb ISIS targets in Libya, expanding the US fight against the terrorist group."

I regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong,"" Clinton said in a statement in which she also vowed to call out ""bigotry"" in Trump's campaign.The Democratic presidential nominee sparked an uproar late Friday when she described Trump's supporters at a fundraiser.""To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" Clinton said. ""Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it."" She added: ""And unfortunately, there are people like that and he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people, now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric.""Clinton then said some of these people were ""irredeemable"" and ""not America.""She described the rest of his supporters as people who are looking for change in any form because of economic anxiety and urged her supporters to empathize with them.The Democratic presidential nominee made similar comments in an interview Thursday with an Israeli television station. But when they were widely reported Friday night, Trump and Republicans quickly pounced on the remarks, which drew comparisons to President Barack Obama's comments about clinging to ""guns and religion"" at a 2008 campaign fundraiser and Mitt Romney's ""47 percent"" remark in 2012.""Isn't it disgraceful that Hillary Clinton makes the worst mistake of the political season and instead of owning up to this grotesque attack on American voters, she tries to turn it around with a pathetic rehash of the words and insults used in her failing campaign?"" Trump said in a statement. ""For the first time in a long while, her true feelings came out, showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans.""Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, forcefully condemned Clinton ""in the strongest possible terms"" Saturday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington.""The truth of the matter is that the men and women who support Donald Trump's campaign are hard-working Americans, farmers, coal miners, teachers, veterans, members of our law enforcement community, members of every class of this country, who know that we can make America great again,"" Pence said.""Let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, Hillary, they are not a basket of anything,"" Pence continued. ""They are Americans and they deserve your respect.""Clinton had earlier divided Trump's supporters into ""two big baskets,"" what she called ""the deplorables,"" in an interview with Channel 2 News Israel that aired Thursday.""If I were to be grossly generalistic, I would say you can take Trump supporters and put them in two big baskets,"" Clinton said. ""There are what I call the deplorables -- the racists, you know, the haters, and the people who are drawn because they think somehow he's going to restore an America that no longer exists. So just eliminate them from your thinking, because we've always had an annoying prejudicial element within our politics.""Clinton made the comments before introducing Barbra Streisand at an LGBT fundraiser in downtown New York. According to average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the campaign, Clinton raised around $6 million at the fundraiser, at which some attendees paid $50,000.In seizing upon the comments, Trump used the opportunity to do some fundraising as well.""Now is the time to show Hillary the consequences of her words,"" Trump's campaign wrote in an appeal to supporters. ""I'm asking you and the millions of hard-working, patriotic Americans whom she just insulted, to fight back with a contribution of $100, $65, $50, $35, $25, $15, or even $5 to elect Donald Trump to the White House.""Clinton expresses regretIn her statement Saturday, Clinton was emphatic in condemning what she said was Trump's racially insensitive campaign.She listed a series of controversial moments from Trump's campaign, including his fight with a Muslim Gold Star family, criticism of a federal US judge of Mexican heritage and his insinuation that Obama wasn't born in the US.""I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign,"" Clinton said.She also noted her comments about empathizing with other Trump supporters.""As I said, many of Trump's supporters are hard-working Americans who just don't feel like the economy or our political system are working for them,"" Clinton said. ""I'm determined to bring our country together and make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. Because we really are 'stronger together.'""Around the same time Clinton issued her statement, Trump also made a case for unity.""While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!"" Trump said on Twitter.A senior Democrat close to the campaign told CNN it wants to have a conversation about what it sees as the racism in Trump's campaign, but could not have that part of the conversation until Clinton backed away from the ""half"" comment.The Democrat added that Clinton's concession drew a contrast with Trump.""She can admit when she is wrong -- Trump never does,"" the Democrat said.'Prejudice and paranoia'Clinton's comments amounted to startlingly blunt talk for a candidate who is usually measured in her assessment of the Republican nominee.Although Clinton has accused Trump of racism before, she has never explicitly called him a racist. Last month, she delivered a major speech in which she accused Trump of aligning himself with far-right extremists and saying he ""built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia.""""He's taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party,"" Clinton said in Reno, Nevada. ""His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.""Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, cited the speech in attempting to clarify the Democratic nominee's comments Friday night.""Obviously not everyone supporting Trump is part of the alt right, but alt right leaders are with Trump,"" Merrill tweeted, adding, ""And their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events.""Clinton's campaign was continuing to dig in Saturday morning as outrage swirled over the comment, though surrogates were emphasizing that Clinton was talking about Trump's supporters -- people who attend his rallies -- and not Trump voters, a larger group, in the eyes of the campaign, that includes more moderate Republicans.Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine told The Washington Post that Clinton's statement didn't require an apology.""She said, 'Look, I'm generalizing here, but a lot of his support is coming from this odd place, that he's given a platform to the alt-right and white nationalists,'"" Kaine told the newspaper. ""But then she went on to say, 'Look, there's also a number of his supporters that have economic anxieties, and we've got to speak to those.'""Added Kaine: ""There are supporters we're not going to get.""Tyrone Gale, a Clinton spokesman, rejected Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway's call on Twitter for an apology by tweeting a New York Times video depicting vulgar and obscene comments made by some Trump supporters at his rallies.And Bakari Sellers, a Clinton surrogate and CNN contributor, was defiant when asked about the remark.""This election is about beating back bigotry and hate,"" Sellers said in an interview. ""Whether it's 10% or 50%, Donald Trump and his supporters have elevated it. If you're not a bigot, her comments shouldn't offend you.""The Clinton campaign directed surrogates on Saturday night to push the press if asked about the ""basket of deplorables"" comment, according to a talking points obtained by CNN.""I think we can all agree that if Donald Trump said something controversial about Clinton supporters, it wouldn't have been in his top 10 list of offensive statements in a day. It's well past time the press stopped grading Trump on a curve,"" the talking points said. ""So is the press going to cover this story in the right contact, or are they going to hold Hillary to a different standard again?"" #BasketofDeplorablesThe controversy recalled rhetorical stumbles in previous campaigns. In 2008, Obama told an audience at a closed fundraiser that decades of lost jobs and unfulfilled promises from Washington had left some Pennsylvanians ""bitter"" and clinging ""to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.""He later acknowledged that the comment was ""boneheaded.""And late in the 2012 campaign, Romney, the GOP nominee, was memorably caught in a secretly recorded video telling donors that ""there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the President no matter what,"" saying they ""believe they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.""Romney later told reporters the comments were ""not elegantly stated.""Trump himself invoked the gaffe to slam Clinton Saturday night, also retweeting Obama's remark four years ago that ""We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.""What separates Obama and Romney's comments from Clinton's, however, is that they believed their remarks were private. Clinton's event on Friday was only the sixth out of the more than 330 fundraisers she's attended as a candidate that was open to the press.Almost immediately, ""#BasketofDeplorables"" began trending on Twitter, and conservatives and Trump supporters were predictably outraged.""The truly deplorable thing in this race is the shameful level of condescension & disrespect @HillaryClinton's showing to her fellow citizens,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on Twitter.Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt suggested Trump open each speech by asking his crowds, ""So, which half of you are in the #basketofdeplorables?""Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, a notable Trump critic, tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton's creed: 'All men are created equal' -- except for those I've consigned to the basket of deplorables, who are irredeemable.""Even some Democrats noted the political opportunity Clinton had given Republicans.""'Basket of deplorables' reminds me of 'binders full of women.' Equally tone deaf statements divorced from reality,"" tweeted Lis Smith, Obama's director of rapid response during his 2012 campaign. David Axelrod, a former chief strategist to Obama who is now a CNN commentator, referenced the controversy over Obama's ""guns and religion"" line at a 2008 fundraiser, tweeting, ""Fundraiser remarks are treacherous things.""Speaking to CNN's Michael Smerconish Saturday morning, Bob Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign, offered no defense of Clinton.""It's the wrong thing to say,"" Beckel said."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/10/politics/9-11-politics-trump-clinton-obama-bush/index.html	"As the 15th anniversary of the horrific attacks approaches Sunday, the political world is bitterly divided on how to address terrorism and national security.Donald Trump dominated the GOP primaries after breaking with key elements of his party's post-9/11 ethos. He blamed former President George W. Bush, whose original response to the attacks sent his approval ratings to historic highs, for the terrorist strike. And Trump has proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States. Though he's softened the proposal somewhat in gearing up for the general election, his stance still represents a dramatic departure from Bush's visit to the Islamic Center of Washington, DC, six days after the attacks to proclaim ""Islam is peace.""Today's political climate is a far cry from the days when Hillary Clinton, a freshman senator from New York, and then-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani came together to console grieving New Yorkers in the days after 9/11. Now Giuliani is one of Trump's top supporters, who repeatedly trashes Clinton.For her part, Clinton, now the Democratic nominee, is still reckoning with decisions she made in the charged climate after the attacks, facing questions this week about her 2002 vote in favor of authorizing the Iraq War.Meanwhile, Americans are more likely than five years ago to feel fear and anger when they think about what happened on September 11, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Friday.RELATED: Looking back at 9/11, Americans feel fear, anger, worryEven talking about terrorism in the current atmosphere can spark political controversy, with the nation's leaders squabbling over whether to label the threat ""radical Islamic terrorism.""The current commander in chief regularly faces media and political blowback in his attempts to argue that though terrorism is perilous, it does not represent an existential threat to the nation.Meanwhile, Guantanamo Bay -- opened in the aftermath of September 11 to house foreign enemy combatants -- is still open, as President Barack Obama's vows to close it have been stymied by Congress.Clinton and Trump spent the last few days feuding over the Iraq War --with both trying to outdo the other in their stated opposition to it.Clinton voted for the war but now admits it was a mistake, while Trump says he was always against it even though he was on record backing it at the time. In both cases, the sea change shows the unraveling of unified public opinion on how to prosecute the war on terror.And the fact that these issues remain such a core part of American political life as the nation pauses to observe the 15th anniversary of 9/11 reflects the enduring potential of terrorism to dominate the political conversation -- and explains why it is seen as such a potent tool by America's enemies.With Syria in tatters, yet another new administration in Washington risks getting pulled into the morass of violence in the Middle East, a region US policies helped to splinter.Judging by the plans so far unveiled by Clinton and Trump -- longer on tough talk than detailed new strategies -- of how to swiftly crush ISIS, terrorism is likely to be reverberating through US politics for years to come. And recent ISIS attacks have only heightened its impact on the current political environment.Trump's decision to base his campaign around a vision of a nation under siege from foreign extremism may have contributed to the mood.""It has made the 15th anniversary more charged than some of the recent ones,"" said Matthew Dallek, a George Washington University professor who has published a new book about the origins of Homeland Security in the 1940s.""His message is we are losing this war, we are incredibly vulnerable, we are being overrun by Syrian terrorists,"" Dallek said. ""He has contributed to that. A lot of people feel that.""Trump, seeking to undercut Clinton's claim that her experience as secretary of state uniquely equips her for the presidency, accuses his rival of botching a chance to make America safer.""She refused to take accountability for failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed horror of radical Islamic terrorism all over, and made us less safe than ever before,"" Trump said of his rival in Ohio on Thursday.Clinton is effectively accusing Trump of being ISIS' candidate over his calls for a ban on Muslim immigration and promises to reinstate waterboarding for terror suspects.""They are saying, 'Please Allah, make Trump president of America,' ""Clinton said this week on Israeli television, arguing that her opponent's positions alienate Muslims to the benefit of ISIS.""I'm not interested in giving aid and comfort to their evil ambitions,"" she said. ""I want to defeat them. I want to end their reign of terror.""Whichever one wins the election will find out that the bitter politics of terrorism are often a distraction from the primary presidential function of keeping America safe.RELATED: 5 years ago the U.S. killed Osama bin Laden. Did it matter?In fact, despite fierce political differences between Bush and Obama and the hot rhetoric of the current campaign, there has been continuity in how America has fought the war on terrorism in the years since 9/11.Obama streamlined his predecessor's approach and increased the lethality and frequency of drone strikes after taking office and can claim credit for having crushed the core leadership of al Qaeda. There is also broad agreement across the political spectrum on measures to protect the homeland and even for National Security Agency surveillance programs started under Bush and modified by Obama.It is likely that for all the political back-and-forth in the campaign, a President Trump or a President Clinton would choose to keep many of the current administration's approaches in place.The next president will have to deal with the long-term consequences of both Bush's decision to invade Iraq and Obama's decision to pull all US troops out. America's longest war, in Afghanistan, is still raging. ISIS is attracting adherents around the globe, while a host of other terrorist groups arm themselves.Given public antipathy to sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Syria and Iraq, plans by Clinton and Trump to fight ISIS stress intensified air strikes, increased intelligence resources and an ideological challenge to the Islamic extremists. They also, however, mirror strategies Obama is already pursuing and don't seem likely to end the war quickly.That's why Scott Mann, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former Green Beret and Special Forces operative who conducted pioneering counterterrorism and counterinsurgency programs while serving combat tours in Iraq, Afghanistan and South America, said the next president must transform the politics of the fight against terrorism by steeling Americans for a fight that could last many more years.He warns that launching air strikes and taking terror leaders off the battlefield may be effective in the short term but do not treat the underlying cause of terrorism.Instead, Mann said, the US should send in troops to partner with clans and tribes in areas occupied by extremists in places like Syria and Iraq to empower local people to crush radicalism from the bottom up.Mann's son was 3 when 9/11 happened; now he's in the military himself.""There is no end in sight,"" Mann said. ""He is now on his path to become an Army lieutenant. That is quite a span of war -- for your kid to go to fight the war you didn't finish."""

""She's being so protected. She could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching,"" Trump said mimicking a gun with his hand, ""right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn't be prosecuted, OK?""Trump held his rally Friday in an arena with a listed capacity of 10,000 people. The ""shoot somebody"" line wasn't in Trump's prepared remarks.The FBI recommended against any charges after concluding a lengthy investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state and the Justice Department heeded that recommendation.A message left with the Clinton campaign was not immediately returned.Friday's remark was reminiscent of Trump's comment earlier this year when he said that he could shoot somebody in the middle of New York's busy 5th Avenue and not lose any support.""I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,"" Trump said during a campaign rally in January in Iowa. Trump took the stage Friday before a fiery crowd of supporters who had just heard a blistering and vitriolic critique of Clinton's email use from Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and federal prosecutor who loudly argued that Clinton had committed ""crimes"" and should have been prosecuted.After zealously greeting Trump's arrival on stage with raucous chants, shrieks and cries, the supporters cheered as he accused Clinton of being a corrupt criminal who could shoot someone with impunity.Trump's comments Friday night follow his repeated criticism of Clinton as a ""corrupt"" politician and came moments after his crowd of supporters erupted in chants of ""Lock her up! Lock her up!""""The only thing she's done well -- and she'll go down in history for it, I have to admit -- is getting out of trouble with the emails. That's the single greatest achievement of Hillary Clinton,"" said Trump, who has never held elected office.He also labeled her as ""unstable"" and ""trigger-happy.""""She is the corrupt establishment,"" Trump said.

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/poll-economy-obama-approval-rating/index.html	In a reflection of rising optimism, 53% of Americans say economic conditions in the US are good, up from the 45% who felt that way in June. It's the highest number since September 2007, before the 2008 economic collapse. Full results of the CNN/ORC pollThe poll also showed that President Barack Obama continues to have majority approval ratings, at 51%. His approval rating has been at or above 50% since February, the longest stretch of his presidency since his first year in office. The 51% is down 3 points since the Democratic National Convention. Obama has a 50% approval rating on the economy, but only 44% approve of his handling of terrorism and 37% of his handling of ISIS. The numbers come as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are locked in a tight race to succeed Obama, with Trump largely running on a populist, heavily anti-trade platform. While traditionally a positive view of the economy and high presidential rating would bode well for the President's party in November, the 2016 cycle has defied tradition time and again. Democrats and independents are more likely to say the economy is in good shape, rising to a 78% mark among Democrats from 69% in June. Among independents, the view went from 41% in June to 49% this month. Among Republicans, only 28% felt the economy was in good shape, slightly up from 24% in June.  Nationally, Republicans have a negligible edge in House seats on a generic ballot, with likely voters saying they would vote for a Republican over Democrat in their district 49% to 47%.  There is a gender gap, with men favoring Republicans 56% to 40% and women favoring Democrats 53% to 43%, but that gap pales in comparison to the presidential race. Independents lean toward supporting Republicans, at 55%. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 1-4 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. For results among the full sample of adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.	CNN/ORC poll: Economic outlook best in 9 years	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
