""But on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there's an army of support out there right now for our candidates.""The comments resemble similar ones made by Donald Trump in August when the GOP nominee said ""Second Amendment people"" could take matters into their own hands if Clinton became president.But unlike Trump, Burr is saying sorry.""The comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,"" Burr, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, said in a Monday statement to CNN.A Clinton spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, but one of her allies, the pro-gun control Brady Campaign, called on Burr to resign because of the comments.Evan Bayh's private schedule details ties with donors, lobbyistsA Burr campaign official said that the senator's remark about feeling ""better"" was in reference to other GOP candidates winning support from gun-rights groups -- not from Clinton potentially being shot.Burr, now in a heated contest against Democrat Deborah Ross in a race that could swing the Senate majority, threw red meat throughout the 45-minute talk, in an effort to fire up his supporters. He even said he would work to keep the ninth seat on the Supreme Court vacant if Clinton becomes president. He also boasted that he's the one who helped initiate the Clinton email investigation and claimed that the FBI's review of more Clinton emails would help down-ticket Republicans.Burr added that he believes the new FBI inquiry would show that someone on Clinton's team, or potentially Clinton, was lying under oath.Comey in harsh spotlight of 2016 campaign""Could she pardon herself? And the answer is yes,"" Burr said on the prospects of Clinton getting indicted after winning the election, though that's legally off-limits once in the White House.But he also bluntly said that if Clinton is elected, he will do everything in his power to deny her the right to fill the vacant Supreme Court slot, aligning himself with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's position on the issue.""Well, my answer to you would be it isn't going to happen -- period,"" Burr said when asked about the prospects of President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, being confirmed in the lame-duck session of Congress.Burr added: ""And if Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court."" Burr boasted that he is responsible for the ""longest judicial vacancy in history"" by denying the confirmation of an Obama judge to serve in the eastern district of North Carolina.In his remarks, Burr reiterated his criticism of Trump's vulgar remarks about women that were caught on a hot mic. But he rationalized his support for Trump by saying that the GOP nominee ""aligns perfectly with where the Republican Party is"" on the issues. And he said that Trump deserves some flexibility to make mistakes.""So I think it's really, really important that when you get somebody that aligns with you politically, that you give them the freedom to determine how they change as an individual,"" Burr said.His continued support of Trump was not unnoticed.""I want to thank him for being a strong supporter of Mr. Trump,"" someone in the room said of Burr, according to the audio. ""I appreciate his loyalty."""	Richard Burr quips about gun owners shooting Hillary Clinton

What's next: FBI unlikely to conclude Clinton email review prior to election""I think unquestionably if [Clinton] takes office she is going to be under criminal investigation, unquestionably this is going to be the nation's agenda for the entire time she is office and it may well end up in impeachment,"" Johnson said on ""The Craig Silverman Show."" ""This is Watergate kind of stuff,"" he continued. ""This is really, really deep, real stuff and all you have to say, all you have to recognize is the FBI would not have done this -- this is not political, this is anything but political, because of the fact they dropped this investigation in July, saying, to clear the decks for the election. That was also clearly, I don't even want to call it a political move, as much as a move that would clear up the election, that people would feel like this was not overhanging. Well, now it's overhanging, and it's overhanging for a reason. There's so much smoke in the room that it will never, ever get ventilated over the next four years. Never.""Earlier in the interview Johnson said the FBI's late announcement of the discovery showed the gravity of the situation.""Let me just point out the obvious: the FBI is not doing this lightly, they recognize just what a bombshell this is, especially having exonerated her in July,"" Johnson said. ""To come back and say this with 11 days to go, knowing that there will be no resolution prior to election, but knowing if they don't release this, knowing how damnable all of this is, this is the horrible situation that the FBI has placed itself in it just points to the gravity of the situation.""On Monday morning, Johnson's running mate, Bill Weld, took a different position on the matter, telling CNN that Comey's decision was ""disgraceful"" and and that the agency was ""off the reservation.""Reached for comment, Johnson spokesperson Joe Hunter said, ""When he stated in the interview, 'it may well end up in impeachment,' Gov. Johnson was not advocating for impeachment. He was merely stating that it is possible that an investigation of a President Hillary Clinton may end up in impeachment."""

The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin's emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop could be done in the next few days, US law enforcement officials told CNN. But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely coordinating with other federal agencies to determine what -- if any -- classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election.Ex-AGs Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder, Michael Mukasey rip FBI director""From the beginning, Ms. Abedin has complied fully and voluntarily with State Department and law enforcement requests, including sitting for hours-long interviews and providing her work-related and potentially work-related documents,"" said Abedin's lawyer, Karen Dunn of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, LLP, in statement to CNN.""Ms. Abedin's willing cooperation has been praised by members of Congress and law enforcement officials alike. She only learned for the first time on Friday, from press reports, of the possibility that a laptop belonging to Mr. Weiner could contain emails of hers. While the FBI has not contacted us about this, Ms. Abedin will continue to be, as she always has been, forthcoming and cooperative,"" Dunn said.FBI Director James Comey's decision to notify lawmakers of the review Friday is rocking the final days of the presidential race. Clinton's surrogates along with three former attorneys general have blasted Comey for violating FBI protocol designed to keep the bureau away from election-year politics.The investigators are using software comparable to a specialized search engine at FBI facilities in Quantico, Virginia, to try to isolate emails on Weiner's computer that could be pertinent to the Clinton email-server investigation, the law enforcement officials said. Some of that work was done earlier this month when agents conducting the Weiner investigation stumbled on the Abedin emails. After that work is done, investigators will examine the emails they believe are relevant to the Clinton investigation to see if they contain classified information and, if so, whether the individuals who sent or received the emails knew the information was classified. FBI officials also believe it's possible that investigators might have to conduct another interview with Abedin and others.  Officials say they are providing all the necessary resources to streamline the process given the sense of urgency so close to the election. ""We are very aware of the pressure on us,"" one law enforcement official told CNN. ""This is not a resource problem."" In a letter to congressional Democrats Monday, Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik wrote Monday that the Justice Department is moving as quickly as possible. ""We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,"" Kadzik wrote. Officials say it's unlikely the public will hear from FBI Director James Comey until it is more clear about the substance of the pertinent emails, the officials said.Comey is under fire from Democrats in the wake of his Friday disclosure to lawmakers that the FBI is once again looking into emails potentially tied to its Clinton investigation. FBI discovered Clinton-related emails weeks agoClinton's campaign, sensing political danger, is calling on Comey to immediately release more information about the emails.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that Comey had meant to transparently disclose information by sending the letter -- but ""clearly it had the opposite of the intended effect."" Comey's revelation left many unanswered questions about the content of the emails and how they could be related to Clinton, at a particularly politically sensitive time for the Democratic nominee eight days out from the election.Former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, a Republican, on Monday slammed Comey, saying his letter was an ""error in judgment."" ""You don't comment on investigations because commenting on the investigation may jeopardize the investigation. And that's the box that he's put himself in, because people are now calling for more information -- for release of the emails,"" Gonzales told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan on ""At This Hour.""Gonzales, who served in the George W. Bush administration, said Comey wouldn't have been misleading voters by withholding the news until after November 8.""If you delay the announcement, hopefully it's not going to jeopardize an investigation, it's not going to jeopardize the pursuit of justice, and voters will have the opportunity to vote on Election Day without information that may in fact be incomplete or untrue,"" he said.Eric Holder, the attorney general during much of President Barack Obama's administration, called Comey's action ""incorrect"" in The Washington Post on Monday. ""I served with Jim Comey, and I know him well. This is a very difficult piece for me to write. He is a man of integrity and honor. I respect him. But good men make mistakes. In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications,"" Holder wrote.""It is incumbent upon him -- or the leadership of the department -- to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day. It is up to the director to correct his mistake -- not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people.""Donald Trump: 'Thank you, Huma. Good job, Huma'Despite the backlash, Comey stands by his decision and believes he did the right thing, according to a source familiar with Comey's thinking. In Comey's view, he was faced with two bad options: Not be upfront with Congress and risk the news leaking out or violating DOJ protocol and living up to his word to Congress to provide any updates related to the investigation.He chose the lesser of the two bad choices in his mind.""He's doing okay,"" the source said.

Kasich ran against Trump for the Republican nomination, and has been a prominent holdout ever since dropping out of the race in May. He has long promised not to support Trump in November, but he had not previously said who he planned to support instead.Kasich's vote was first reported by the Cleveland Plain Dealer. The popular Ohio governor has spent the fall campaigning for down-ballot Republican candidates, and Schrimpf said he had given the maximum contributions to a handful of Senate candidate. He added that Kasich voted the straight Republican ticket, excluding Trump.Trump has lashed out at Kasich for declining to endorse him after the Republican primary ended. Kasich, like other GOP rivals for the nomination, signed a pledge promising to back the Republican nominee at the primary's conclusion.""I'm very disappointed in the governor.

""Thank you, Anthony Weiner.""The FBI discovered the emails on a device seized from Abedin's estranged husband Anthony Weiner, who is being investigated for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit messages with an underage girl.Trump said emails -- the contents of which are unknown -- will be ""absolutely devastating"" to Clinton. The FBI is still working to determine if any of them are pertinent to the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Trump also thanked Weiner during a rally Sunday in Las Vegas, saying ""we never thought we were going to say thank you to Anthony Weiner,"" whom Trump has long derided as a ""sleaze"" and a ""perv.""""Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating,"" Trump said without citing any evidence. ""I think we hit the mother lode, as they say.""Trump also praised FBI Director James Comey for publicly disclosing last Friday that the FBI was reviewing newly discovered emails for links to the Clinton server investigation, a decision some Democrats have slammed as a political decision that could influence the results of the election.""I have to give the FBI credit, that was so bad what happened and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move he made. It took a lot of guts,"" Trump said. ""I was not his fan, but I'll tell you what, what he did, he brought back his reputation.""""He's gotta hang tough,"" Trump said of the FBI director, whom he had repeatedly and relentlessly assailed since Comey recommended during the summer that no criminal charges be filed against Clinton.Trump was joined in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by Bobby Knight, the famous former Indiana University basketball coach who took the stage twice Monday -- including in the middle of Trump's speech -- to talk up Trump's candidacy.After calling Trump a ""tough son of a bitch"" in his introductory remarks, Knight waltzed back on stage in the middle of Trump's speech.""In a Donald Trump administration, there will be no bullshit,"" Knight added."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/eric-holder-op-ed-rips-comey-letter/index.html	"He called Comey's actions an ""error in judgment"" and said he is ""somewhat perplexed about what the director was trying to accomplish here."" Gonzales said Comey's letter Friday informing lawmakers that the FBI is reviewing new emails potentially related to its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state breaks from long-standing Justice Department practice. The protocol is not to comment on investigations and to stay silent on politically sensitive matters less than 60 days from an election. ""You don't comment on investigations because commenting on the investigation may jeopardize the investigation. And that's the box that he's put himself in, because people are now calling for more information -- for release of the emails,"" Gonzales told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan on ""At This Hour."" He was the third former attorney general to recently and publicly criticize Comey. Gonzales, who served in the George W. Bush administration, said Comey wouldn't have been misleading voters by withholding the news until after November 8. ""If you delay the announcement, hopefully it's not going to jeopardize an investigation, it's not going to jeopardize the pursuit of justice, and voters will have the opportunity to vote on Election Day without information that may in fact be incomplete or untrue,"" he said. Comey was the deputy attorney general under Gonzales -- making him the second-highest ranking figure in the Justice Department during the latter half of Bush's presidency. Gonzales cast Comey as someone who won't budge once he's made a decision.  ""He is a person that, you know, he does what he thinks is right and then he doesn't deviate from that position despite the pressure. And he may be wrong,"" Gonzales said. ""My experience is, is that once he takes a position, he digs in, and he's just not going to move from it, whether he's wrong or not, and whatever political pressure may be put to bear on him. He's just not going to move from it. And you know, there is virtue in that, but there is also some danger in that.""Eric HolderFormer Attorney General Eric Holder also criticized Comey's decision Monday. Writing in The Washington Post on Monday, Holder called Comey's decision ""incorrect."" Obama's first attorney general said Comey's letter to Congress announcing a review of the new emails was ""a stunning breach"" of law enforcement protocol and one that carried ""potentially severe implications"" during a presidential campaign.""I served with Jim Comey, and I know him well. This is a very difficult piece for me to write. He is a man of integrity and honor. I respect him. But good men make mistakes. In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications,"" Holder wrote. ""It is incumbent upon him -- or the leadership of the department -- to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day. It is up to the director to correct his mistake -- not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people.""The former Attorney General wrote that Comey's letter ""violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition"" not to comment publicly about politically sensitive investigations within 60 days of an election. ""It ran counter to guidance that I put in place four years ago laying out the proper way to conduct investigations during an election season. That guidance, which reinforced established policy, is still in effect and applies to the entire Justice Department -- including the FBI,"" he wrote.Holder argued Comey ""broke with these fundamental principles"" with the announcement of the review.""I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI,"" Holder wrote. ""And he has allowed -- again, without improper motive -- misinformation to be spread by partisans with less than pure intentions.""Holder acknowledged the charged political environment surrounding the Clinton email investigation, writing that he was ""mindful"" of the perception created by former President Bill Clinton's tarmac meeting with current Attorney General Loretta Lynch over the summer during the FBI's probe of the case. But he added that ""the solution was not for the FBI director to announce the department's decision about whether to proceed"" with additional investigation or review of the newly discovered emails. Michael MukaseyFormer US attorney general Michael Mukasey slammed Comey Monday for the way he handled the situation, saying he should not ""have been in this fix.""""This wasn't Comey's call. It is not his function as director of the FBI to decide who gets charges and doesn't. It's his function to gather evidence. And he didn't fulfill that function very well,"" Mukasey told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""But it's certainly not his function to get up and pronounce on whether charges should be brought or whether a reasonable prosecutor would ever bring them.""He added: ""I don't think he should have been this fix. I don't think he should have put either himself or the bureau or the Justice Department in this fix.""Trump transition team fundraises with Christie emailBut Mukasey, who served under George W. Bush after Gonzalez, said that Democrats calling Comey's actions a violation of the Hatch Act, which bars political activity by federal employees, ""baloney.""""That's baloney,"" he said. ""I mean, you know, it's sort of an amusing talking point for three and a half seconds, but it's not serious.""He also slammed Comey's decision in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, calling omey's original decision in July not to indict the Democratic presidential candidate ""unworthy."" He described the decision as one to ""accede to the apparent wish of Obama that no charges be brought against Clinton.""As such, he claimed this earlier move makes Comey's letter to Congress irrelevant. ""Regardless of what is in the newly discovered emails, the current Justice Department will not permit a grand jury to hear evidence in this case. And because only a grand jury can constitutionally bring charges, that means no charges will be brought,"" Mukasey wrote. ""Which is to say, we know enough to conclude that what we don't know is of little immediate relevance to our current dismal situation."""

His internal 2009 schedule -- obtained by CNN -- shows how he maneuvered behind the scenes during one of the most consequential periods of legislating on Capitol Hill.The schedule provides a rare account of how Bayh privately engaged with fundraisers, lobbyists and donors who had a keen interest on the issues dominating Capitol Hill. At times, his own campaign fundraiser was sitting in on his meetings with donors in his official Senate office, the schedule says, raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns.The schedule lays bare a reality of Washington: Well-connected donors often get a private audience with a powerful member of Congress, a luxury most Americans can't afford.""At a minimum, the meetings raise questions about buying access, and they raise questions about selling influence,"" said Brendan Fischer, associate counsel at the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center, a group that calls for stricter campaign finance rules.NRA calls for check on Hillary Clinton by defeating Evan BayhAides to Bayh told CNN there was nothing untoward. They said the then-senator's office had created strict firewalls between official and political action. And the campaign cast doubt on the accuracy of the schedule, but did not dispute its authenticity or deny that any of the meetings took place.According to the schedule, it appeared that lines were potentially blurred.In his office in the Senate Russell Building in 2009, Bayh repeatedly met with donors for the health insurance and pharmaceutical sectors who were trying to shape the health care bill that was steamrolling through Congress at the time, according to the schedule. He met with donors of the medical device industry just as he was championing a reduction in the tax on that sector. Those meetings at times occurred shortly after the donor held a fundraiser for the senator or contributed to Bayh's campaign account.Of course, donors often get special access to lawmakers. But what's less common in this instance is that Bayh held donor meetings on the Capitol grounds with his own fundraiser in attendance in his Senate office, the schedule says. Senate rules strictly forbid any fundraising in the Capitol complex, so lawmakers tend to avoid having such meetings in their official offices.Bayh officials denied that there was any favor trading or that any fundraising occurred in the meetings.  Charles Salem, who served as Bayh's chief of staff at the time, said in a statement that the senator's office ""strived to maintain the highest ethical standard. As a component of that, we kept a strict separation between the official office and all fundraising activity.""Bayh campaign spokesman Ben Ray accused political foes of leaking the documents to the press ""in the final days before an election,"" arguing that the schedule is ""at best incomplete and frequently containing errors.""""Nearly 60 percent of all votes Evan took in 2009 are absent from this document,"" Ray said in a statement. ""And it is clearly not a reliable source of information on how his time was spent.""But Bayh's campaign did not deny that the meetings occurred.Schedule lists meetings on Capitol groundsIn 2009, as Bayh was still considering running for reelection, his top fundraiser, Nancy Jacobson, attended a number of meetings with donors in Bayh's office, even though she was not part of his official staff. She even made recommendations for Bayh to call donors who were pushing issues on the Hill, the schedule says.A day before Bayh cast a deciding vote on Obamacare in late December, Jacobson recommended that he place a call to a UCLA doctors group and Bill Powers, a man who donated $10,000 to his campaign in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The call, according to the schedule, was supposed to take place at his office or his residence.Powers, who also hosted a fundraiser in the tony Los Angeles neighborhood of Manhattan Beach in April 2009, declined to comment to CNN. Bayh and Powers were friends from their school days, according to the campaign.In May 2009, private equity consultant Ralph Isham met with Bayh in his Russell office. Isham had donated $20,000 to Bayh between 2005 and 2008, and had attended an October fundraiser dinner for the senator. Jacobson was listed as staff for the May meeting and the fundraiser. Isham did not respond to a phone call seeking comment, but the campaign said the senator and donor were long-time friends.Congress may flip -- but dysfunction is here to stayIn a statement provided by the campaign, Jacobson didn't deny sitting in on the meetings but said that as ""an adviser to Sen. Bayh"" and other individuals and groups, she ""frequently attended meetings to build networks and exchange ideas."" Jacobson added: ""But we never conducted fundraising activity in Sen. Bayh's office -- not with these meetings in question or any other meetings that I was a part of.""But Fischer, the attorney with the Campaign Legal Center, said that the fact that a senator's top fundraiser attended such meetings may have implicitly pressured donors to consider opening up their pocket books.""It's reasonable to question whether there was at least implicit fundraising solicitations by virtue of his fundraiser being present at these meetings,"" Fischer said.There were other scheduled meetings as well.Jacobson, Bayh's top fundraiser, attended a Senate meeting on December 10, 2009, with Bob Beizer, who worked at Gray Television, which owns a local television station in South Bend, Indiana. (Beizer contributed $12,500 to Bayh's campaign accounts between 2005 and 2009, while the schedule noted that he attended a January fundraiser for Bayh that year.)Beizer had a long time personal relationship with Bayh, according to the campaign, but couldn't could be reached for comment.A managing partner at a New York investment firm, Glenn Fuhrman, also attended an October 2009 meeting with Bayh after joining a fundraiser for the Democrat that year. Jacobson attended both events, the schedule said, while Fuhrman did not return a phone call seeking comment.And Jacobson also was listed as a guest for a meeting on U.S.-Chinese relations in Bayh's office with Donald Tang, a former Bear Stearns who cut the senator a check for $1,000 in 2005. Reached for comment, Tang recalled meeting with Bayh but not the specifics.Health care donors scheduled to meet with Bayh as Obamacare heats upBayh also met privately in his office with donors to his campaign who also were deeply invested in the actions on Capitol Hill -- namely on Obamacare -- without Jacobson in attendance.Some of those sessions occurred soon after the lobbyists held fundraising events for his campaign, with the lobbyists bringing their CEOs to meet with Bayh in his office. While common, lawmakers rarely discuss such meetings to avoid the appearances of impropriety.In February 2009, Michael Mussallem, CEO of the company AdvaMed, which donated $2,000 to the senator's campaign and whose lobbyists attended an April fundraiser for Bayh, met with the Democrat in his office, to discuss the medical device tax. A source with AdvaMed confirmed the meeting occurred.On a drive back from Washington Dulles airport, Bayh was scheduled to speak by phone with the CEO of Zimmer, David Dvorak, to discuss medical device issues, following up on a private meeting the men had in the senator's office.Dvorak's company gave Bayh $1,000 to his campaign, while officials for the company attended a fundraiser for the Indiana Democrat that year. A representative from Zimmer didn't respond to a request for comment but a source confirmed the meetings took place. (Bayh's office later pointed out that Zimmer was headquartered in Warsaw, Indiana.)Bayh had private discussions in his office with executives with the company Boston Scientific, just six months after representatives for the company attended a fundraiser and donated to his campaign. He also met in his Senate hideaway with the CEO of Roche Diagnostics to discuss health care reform, a company that gave another $5,000 to his campaign in March of that year. The two companies also had headquarters in Indianapolis, the campaign noted.The chief executive and lobbyists for the United Health group met with Bayh, after the lobbyists attended fundraisers for him that year and gave $5,000 to his campaign. He did the same with lobbyists from CIGNA and its CEO, along with the top executive of Eli Lilly and officials with the American Council of Life Insurers, all donors to his campaign. (Eli Lilly employed 11,000 people in Indiana, the campaign said.)Representatives with these companies either declined to comment or didn't respond to requests for comment.AstraZeneca executive David Brennan met Bayh in his office that year, the schedule says, after lobbyists donated $5,000 to his campaign and attended a June fundraiser. (A representative for the company did not respond to requests for comment.)Bayh announced his support for the Affordable Care Act on December 21 of that year before voting for its enactment.UPDATE: This story has been updated to include additional information about the headquarters of companies Bayh met with."

""I never voted for him, Donald.""""You're good, then. I didn't either, by the way,"" Trump said, ""You're good. I just thought that guy was a dimwit.

You didn't vote for Bush, did you?,"" O'Reilly asked Trump. ""Actually, I did,"" said Trump.""Did you really? You were bad-mouthing him,"" interjected O'Reilly. ""No, I wasn't,"" Trump responded. ""I was bad-mouthing the war in Iraq. I'm not a big fan of the war in Iraq.""So you voted for Bush,"" O'Reilly said.""I voted for Bush because I think he's got certain things that are excellent, including a tax policy that's excellent and going to prove to be excellent,"" Trump said. ""But I am not a big fan of the war in Iraq, and I've let a lot of people know about it, and perhaps that's being proven to be correct.""In a January 2016 interview, also with O'Reilly, Trump was asked if he voted for Bush twice.""I did vote for Bush twice, yes,"" Trump said. ""I don't think he did a particularly good job. I think he got us into Iraq which was a disaster. But I voted for Bush, yes.""

That's unchanged from the most recent Poll of Polls on Saturday.At-risk Republicans revel in FBI's Clinton email announcementThe ABC/Washington Post poll found that more than 6 in 10 voters say the news that the FBI is investigating newly discovered emails that could be related to Hillary Clinton's private server will make no difference in their vote, while 3 in 10 say it makes them less likely to back Clinton. Sunday morning also brought a new set of battleground state polls. In North Carolina -- a must-win state for Trump -- an NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist University poll found Clinton ahead, 47% to Trump's 41%. The same poll found Clinton ahead 48% to 43% in early October.In Florida, an NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist University survey shows a dead heat -- with Clinton at 45% and Trump at 44%, a one-point drop for Clinton since the same poll's last results in early October, when Clinton led 46% to 44%.Meanwhile, a New York Times Upshot/Siena poll found Trump ahead -- 46% to 42% -- in Florida. The same poll had found the candidates even at 43% apiece in September.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reflected The New York Times/Siena poll results in Florida.

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/30/politics/clinton-faith-private/index.html	"Editor's note: After trading jokes with her Republican rival, Donald Trump, at the Al Smith dinner in New York, Clinton got serious, praising her Catholic hosts and Pope Francis' fights against climate change and inequality. ""I'm not Catholic. I'm a Methodist,"" Clinton said. ""But one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works.""That's only half-true. Neither the United Methodist Church nor the Catholic Church teach that believers can work their way into heaven. Good deeds are important, both churches agree, but God's grace is freely given -- and the only means of salvation.  Clinton likely knows this. She's correctly stated the doctrine before, including at a church service in Washington last year.  Maybe her salvation stumble was the work of a sloppy speechwriter -- or perhaps, with apologies to Freud, it was a Pelagian slip. (Pelagius was a monk accused of teaching the heresy that humans could earn their own salvation.) Either way, Clinton's remark revealed a deep strain in her religious thought: There are no freeloaders in heaven. ""She didn't believe it was how high you jumped for joy in church,"" said the Rev. Ed Matthews, Clinton's pastor when she lived in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the 1990s, ""but what you did when you came down."" The conventional Washington wisdom holds that Clinton is reluctant to talk about her faith, which is partly true. She doesn't often divulge details about her private piety, even while hinting that prayer and pastoral counseling have led her to consequential decisions, such as remaining with her husband, Bill, after the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998. But during her three decades in politics, Clinton has been quite willing to talk about how her work has been inspired by her Methodist faith. She traces some of her political positions, particularly concerning children and the poor, directly to Christ's commandment to care for ""the least of these.""  Speaking to an assembly of Methodist women in 2014, Clinton cited the Gospel story of Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes to feed a hungry crowd. ""He was teaching about the responsibility we all share, to step up and serve the community, especially to help those with the greatest need and the fewest resources,"" Clinton said. Since then, the Democratic nominee has adopted a Methodist mantra as her unofficial campaign slogan: ""Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as you ever can.""  (The Clinton campaign did not respond to requests to interview the candidate.) Despite these public testimonies, less than 50% of Americans say Clinton is ""very"" or even ""somewhat"" religious, according to the Pew Research Center. A separate survey, by the Public Religion Research Institute, reveals stark religious and partisan divides in how Americans view the presidential nominees' faith. Nearly 80% of black Protestants, a traditional Democratic constituency, say Clinton has stronger religious beliefs than Trump; just 28% of white evangelicals, who lean heavily Republican, agree. Evangelicals' antipathy toward Clinton runs long and deep, said Ed Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center for Evangelism at Wheaton College in Illinois. Clinton's decades-long embrace of feminism and abortion rights clash with many conservative Christians' core beliefs. ""Evangelicals see her as the personification of secular, progressive values, and that overshadows any of her self-identified religious practices.""But many conservative Methodists, even those who disagree with Clinton politically, say her faith appears to be authentic. ""Too often conservatives have been too dismissive of her religious beliefs, which are sincere,"" said Mark Tooley, a Methodist and president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a conservative think tank in Washington.  ""She was shaped by the church and is still committed to it, and you can't understand her political framework without understanding her Methodist background.""   The 'University of Life' Clinton's father, Hugh Rodham, wasn't a churchgoer, but he was a praying man. ""I still remember my late father -- a gruff former Navy man -- on his knees praying by his bed every night,"" Clinton has said. ""That made a big impression on me as a young girl, seeing him humble himself before God.""If Clinton's father provided the model for private prayer, her mother demonstrated how to put that piety into public action. Dorothy Rodham was active at First United Methodist Church in Park Ridge, Illinois, a large congregation in a Chicago suburb. She taught Sunday school and regularly raised money for charity, inspiring her daughter's interest in social justice In 1961, when Clinton was a teenager, a youth pastor came blazing into Park Ridge behind the wheel of a red Chevy convertible. The Rev. Don Jones would inspire Clinton to see the world as her parish. Fresh from seminary after a stint in the Navy, Jones gathered the sheltered Methodist youth of Park Ridge and gave them crash courses in the ""University of Life."" He read them poems by e.e. cummings, introduced them to Christian intellectuals such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Paul Tillich, and asked them to interpret modernist paintings such as Picasso's ""Guernica."" ""I think it's fair to say,"" Clinton said in 2009 while delivering a eulogy at Jones' funeral, ""that next to my parents ... no adult had more influence on my life."" His challenges were more than intellectual. Jones took his Christian charges into inner-city Chicago churches, where they mingled with black and Latino teens, creating connections with people they might not otherwise have met. Jones encouraged his youth group to babysit for the children of Latino migrant workers and to visit the elderly in nursing homes. Christians aren't supposed to sit quietly in church, hoping to get into heaven, Jones taught; they're supposed to build the kingdom of God on earth. That idea lies deep in the DNA of the Methodist movement, historians say. The early Methodists in 17th-century England earned their name because they were methodical and disciplined about their duties toward God and to their fellow man. John Wesley, founder of Methodism, preached that Christians should practice not only personal holiness but also a ""social holiness."" ""Methodists have always had a strong sense of social purpose,"" said David Hempton, dean of Harvard Divinity School and an expert in early Methodist history. They advocated against slavery, corruption, public drinking, animal abuse, popular sports and ostentatious displays of wealth. They visited prisoners and the sick, educated children and gave their extra earnings to charity.  Clinton has said that she spent a lot of time as a young person trying to ""work out the balance between personal salvation and the social gospel.""In 1962, Jones took Clinton and her youth group to hear the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speak in Chicago, where the civil rights leader delivered his famous sermon ""Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution.""  King's challenge struck Clinton like St. Paul on his horse. She left the room that night a changed person, she would later recall.""His words, the power of his example, affected me deeply and added to the lessons of my minister to face the world as it is, not as we might want it to be,"" Clinton told a group of Baptists in September, ""but to commit ourselves to turning it into what it should be.""Bill Clinton credits King's speech with changing the trajectory of his wife's moral and political life. ""It took my breath away when I realized 45 years ago that is really what motivates her,"" he said in Iowa this year. At the time, though, Clinton remained a ""Goldwater girl,"" a rock-ribbed Republican like her father. At Wellesley College, she headed the college's Young Republicans Club. But a Methodist magazine, motive, flooded Clinton with progressive opinions -- rooted in liberal Christian theology -- on the Vietnam War and civil rights movement. ""I wonder if it's possible to be a mental conservative and a heart liberal,"" she wrote in a letter to Jones, who'd become a lifelong mentor and confidant. By her senior year, Clinton appeared to have completed her political conversion to liberalism, writing her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky, the leftist community organizer.  After college, Clinton says her Christian faith inspired her decision to do public service, rather than apply to white-shoe law firms. At the Children's Defense Fund, she says, she went undercover to expose systemic racism in the deep South and the plight of children with disabilities in New England. Around the same time, she met Bill Clinton at Yale Law School, and eventually followed him to Arkansas, where they married in 1975. Several years later, while raising their daughter, Chelsea, Hillary Clinton joined First United Methodist Church in Little Rock.While Bill attended a Baptist church down the road, Hillary became an active and ""vital part"" of the Methodist congregation, the local bishop later recalled. She volunteered to be the church's chancellor and taught adult Sunday school on the lawn of the Governor's Mansion. The Rev. Ed Matthews, former pastor of First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, recalls one of Clinton's lessons keenly. It was about forgiveness, and how it is not a human quality but rather a gift from God. When Clinton was first lady and facing her own crisis, Matthews said he went to the White House and reminded her of that lesson. The lion's den Soon after the Clintons arrived in Washington, they had dinner at the White House with a few pastors and their families, recalls the Rev. Tony Campolo. Hillary Clinton told the gathering that she reads Scripture daily, so the evangelical pastor asked what passages, in particular, interested her. ""She said, the 'Book of Daniel,' which seemed strange to me,"" Campolo recalled recently. He asked her why. ""She said because the Book of Daniel describes with care how political leaders handle situations under great pressure.""In the Old Testament, the Book of Daniel is about a Jew exiled to Babylon, where he is tossed into the lion's den after his quick political ascent inspires jealousy. If the modern-day parallels aren't immediately obvious to others, they were evidently clear enough to the fresh-from-Arkansas Clintons. Clinton read more than Scripture while in the White House, according to friends and colleagues. She continued to subscribe to motive magazine, which is now out of print, as well as Christianity Today, the flagship magazine for evangelicals. She said she kept a copy of the Methodist ""Book of Resolutions,"" the church's policy statements, in her private quarters of the White House, and regularly read books by Christian authors. She occasionally carried a small book filled with spiritual quotations and another of the Bible's Book of Psalms.""She has always loved the Psalms,"" said Matthews, the Arkansas pastor. ""I think she relates to their search for meaning, and how the psalmist can change moods, from lamenting how evil the world is, and how everyone is mistreating us, to showing gratitude to God for the beauty of the world.""  In Washington, the Clintons found a new church home on a snowy Sunday in January 1993. The family was feeling ""stir crazy,"" Clinton recalls, so they trudged several blocks through the blizzard to Foundry United Methodist Church, where they surprised a pastor who had almost canceled services that morning. The Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, Foundry's former pastor, recalls the Clintons attending his church regularly for the next eight years, some 100 or so Sunday services in all. They sat three rows back on the right center aisle, he said, directly in his line of sight from the pulpit. Wogaman, a dignified man and Methodist scholar, said he tried not to preach politics overtly, though he thought carefully about the messages his sermons would send to the first family. He recalls only one overt political statement he made from the pulpit, asking Bill Clinton to carry the congregation's good wishes to the family of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. Chelsea became a part of Foundry's youth group, as her mother had in Park Ridge, and Wogaman recalls the Clintons attending parents' meetings and helping to plan for mission trips to Appalachia. When a member of the congregation fell ill, the Clintons would call the hospital to check up on them, the pastor recalled. At a service marking Foundry's 200th anniversary last year, Hillary Clinton said the church was a place where ""we were, not 'the First Family' -- we were just our family."" ""This community -- because indeed that's what it is -- was a place where we could worship, study, contemplate, be of service, get some good pastoral advice, and step outside all the commotion of life in the White House and Washington. That was very, very precious to us.""But as the pressures -- and the scandals -- mounted, the first lady also looked elsewhere for spiritual sustenance. Close friends say she keeps her own counsel. She is far more comfortable assuaging a friend's grief or regret than she is asking others for help. But in 1994, after her high-profile health-care reforms foundered and scandal swirled around the White House, the first family decided they needed help from outside Washington. They invited a number of New Age gurus and motivational speakers to Camp David in Maryland. One woman, Jean Houston, particularly intrigued Clinton. Houston describes herself as a ""scholar, philosopher and researcher in Human Capacities."" One of those capacities, apparently, was the ability to converse with the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt. In the Solarium of the White House, according to Washington journalist Bob Woodward, Houston encouraged Clinton to have brief ""conversations"" with Roosevelt and Gandhi, two revered figures for the first lady. Houston then asked Clinton to address Jesus, according to Woodward's account. That was too personal, Clinton said.Clinton was annoyed when the sessions -- media sensationalists called them ""séances -- were revealed. Her friends and former colleagues say the incident was overblown; it was only an ""imaginative exercise.""  ""No doubt she admired Eleanor Roosevelt's courage and commitments, but to say that Hillary was having séances or communing with her is just crazy,"" said Melanne Verveer, Clinton's former chief of staff as first lady. The media reaction was reminiscent, Verveer said, of the brutal criticism of Clinton's ""Politics of Meaning"" speech in 1993. In the somewhat rambling address, Clinton did what she so rarely does in public: let her guard down and show her true feelings. Economic prosperity and political freedom aren't enough, Clinton said in the now-infamous speech. She encouraged Americans to dig deeper, to find the ""core level meaning in our individual lives,"" to awaken from their ""sleeping sickness of the soul."" The press tore her apart. ""Saint Hillary,"" The New York Times mocked. ""Psychobabble,"" another newspaper said. Lissa Muscatine, Clinton's friend and former speechwriter, said the first lady felt blindsided and misunderstood. Her family had just taken Hugh Rodham, Clinton's father, off life support, a moment that stirred big questions in Clinton. ""She was trying to be reflective and thoughtful in a personal way, and she got completely ridiculed. It was painful because she was really trying to say something. Her father was dying; if people are not allowed to be introspective in those moments, then we have no empathy whatsoever.""Several months later, at a National Prayer Luncheon, Clinton said she was somewhat afraid to address religion again. ""The last time I spoke in public about spirituality, around the time of my father's death, I was astonished to realize that there were many people for whom spirituality should be confined to events like this, and not brought out into the public arena."" But whatever embarrassment Clinton felt, it would hardly compare with the public humiliation she would soon endure. Forgiveness At a White House prayer breakfast in 1998, President Bill Clinton apologized to the nation and to his family for conducting an affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky. Couching his confession in Christian terms, the president said, ""I don't think there's a fancy way to say that I have sinned.""Hillary Clinton sat stoically through her husband's speech, recalled Matthews, the Arkansas pastor, who was sitting a few feet away. When the speech ended, he knelt beside her. ""Are you all right, Hillary?"" he asked. ""I don't know what I'm going to do,"" Clinton whispered to him, Matthews said.""Do you remember what you taught me about forgiveness and grace?"" the pastor asked, reminding Clinton of her Sunday school lesson from years ago.Matthews says he doesn't even know if Clinton heard his question, she seemed so distraught and distracted. In her memoir ""Living History,"" Clinton calls the Lewinsky scandal ""the most devastating, shocking and hurtful experience of my life."" ""I would have to go deep inside myself and my faith to discover any remaining belief in our marriage,"" Clinton writes, ""to find some path of understanding."" During the scandal, three ministers, including Foundry's Wogaman and Campolo, the evangelical pastor, very publicly ministered to Bill Clinton.  But Hillary took a more private tact.""Where some people might go to a shrink, she goes to a minister,"" said a friend and former staffer of Clinton's. Clinton turned for counsel, as she often did, to her former youth pastor, Don Jones. Just as he had during the Park Ridge days, Jones pointed Clinton to classic liberal Christian theology, including a sermon by Paul Tillich that they had read together decades earlier. In ""You Are Accepted,"" Clinton writes, Tillich teaches that ""sin and grace exist in life in constant interplay; neither is possible without the other."" The mystery -- and paradox -- of grace is that you cannot find it on your own; it finds you, often when you are most pained and restless. ""Grace happens,"" Clinton wrote. Another spiritual classic offered lessons on forgiveness. Clinton says she first read ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"" by Henri Nouwen, a Dutch Catholic priest, in 1994. Separately, two friends gave it to her, she writes in ""Living History."" The book became a ""lifeline,"" she would later say. Nouwen, a well-known spiritual writer, analyzes Jesus' story about the prodigal son from several perspectives: the father who forgives his wayward son, the son who returns home after squandering his family fortune, and the dutiful other son who had remained home. Clinton has said the book's emphasis on the ""daily discipline of gratitude"" struck her with the force of epiphany. Even amid Washington's craziness and pitched partisan battles, she had much to be grateful for, said the former first lady. Nouwen was also eloquent on the theme of forgiveness: ""Do I want to be not just the one who is being forgiven, but also the one who forgives; not just the one who is being welcomed home, but also the one who welcomes home ...?""Clinton has said she might not have made it through the Lewinsky scandal without her faith; Matthews said that without her faith she likely would not have forgiven her husband. ""People say that it was because of money or power or political prestige, and maybe that was a part of it,"" the pastor said. ""But it's her faith that makes her tick."" DevotionsClinton is still a member of First United Methodist Church in Little Rock, Matthews says, but hasn't been back in years. Though she sometimes attends services at a Methodist church near her home in Chappaqua, New York, her duties as secretary of state and now the Democratic presidential nomination have kept her on the road, and away from regular Sunday worship.But the Rev. Bill Shillady, a Methodist minister in New York, said he has found a way to pastor to the peripatetic Clinton. Shillady met Clinton at a memorial for 9/11 victims in New York in 2002, when she was a senator. He invited her to his former church in Manhattan, and over time the families became close, sharing Easter breakfasts and meals at Christmastime. Shillady conducted Chelsea's wedding and a memorial service for Dorothy Rodham, Clinton's mother.Around Easter in 2015, Shillady offered to send Clinton daily email devotions, which he wakes early each morning to compose. The devotions, which arrive in Clinton's inbox by 5 a.m., include a snippet of Scripture, a brief commentary on the passage and a prayer. In recent months, Shillady has enlisted a team, including a group of young women pastors, to help write the devotions. (Burns Strider, Clinton's friend and faith adviser to her 2008 presidential campaign, also emails spiritual thoughts to the candidate.) Clinton has said she appreciates the efforts, especially during the pressure cooker of a presidential campaign. ""It just gets me grounded,"" she told a town hall in February.Occasionally, Shillady says, Clinton will respond to the devotions. She particularly liked the introduction to ""Lady Wisdom,"" a figure from the poetry in the Old Testament. In the Book of Proverbs, Chapter 8, wisdom is personified as a woman who raises her voice at the crossroads and before the gates to the city. In Eugene Peterson's colloquial translation of the Bible, Lady Wisdom stands at the busiest intersections, the ""corner of First and Main.""""So, my sister, use your wisdom that God has given you, to help others to know of God's grace, truth and light,"" Shillady wrote, ""For if anyone is at the corner of First and Main, it is you.""Loving thy enemiesThroughout her time in Washington, Clinton has surprised conservatives and her liberal allies by crossing the political aisle to participate in bipartisan prayer groups. As first lady, Clinton says, she became close to several members of The Fellowship, a secretive Christian network of Washington power brokers. While in Congress, she shocked some Republicans by joining the Senate Prayer Breakfast. On matters of Christian doctrine, Clinton shares core beliefs with conservatives. She has said she believes in the Holy Trinity, that Jesus' death atoned for human sins and that Christ's resurrection was a historical event. She prays regularly and is well-versed in Scripture, citing biblical passages accurately and with ease. And yet, many conservative Christians refuse to recognize Clinton as a fellow believer. Ben Carson has connected Clinton to Lucifer, and a new documentary asks whether she is ""an illuminati or the anti-Christ.""Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a historian at Calvin College in Michigan, said she was drawn to study Clinton's faith in part to understand why conservative Christians so vehemently deny it. ""Among conservative Christians -- those who most care about bringing their faith to bear on politics -- there's such a long history of if not demonizing Hillary Clinton, then at the very least setting her against everything they hold dear."" From the moment Clinton stepped on the political stage, she seemed to represent a rejection of conservative Christian values. She dismissed women who ""stay home and bake cookies,"" insulting Christians who hold to ""biblical"" views of submissive women. She was shaped by a church that sees government as a partner -- sometimes to be criticized, but rarely feared as a threat to religious freedom. She participated in the anti-war movement and has affirmed liberal orthodoxies on abortion and other social issues.  Last year, she said that ""deep-seated"" religious beliefs on abortion ""have to be changed,"" a pledge that angered Christians who consider abortion the killing of innocent lives.  Meanwhile, many conservative Christians have created their own subculture, said Du Mez, publishing anti-Clinton books, hosting anti-Clinton radio shows, writing anti-Clinton articles and consuming anti-Clinton TV reports. ""They aren't often confronted with different ways to be Christian in America today. Thus, they assume Clinton must be lying about her faith. Or pandering,"" the historian said.  Of course, Clinton is no mere figurehead. She has been a protagonist in some of the most protracted political scandals in recent history, from her husband's sexual infidelities to her own dissembling about the use of a private email server while secretary of state. According to surveys, many Americans do not think Clinton is trustworthy.Still, as Clinton has acknowledged, politics is a ""rough and tumble"" business, and it's hard to imagine any politician who hasn't found foes along the way. But at a Baptist convention in Kansas City, Missouri, Clinton said that she has been trying to follow Christ's commandment to love her enemies. It's a lesson she remembers well from teaching Sunday school in Arkansas, she said, but some days it's ""really hard"" to put the lesson into practice. It is just as hard, it seems, for Clinton's enemies to love her. "	The public and private faith of Hillary Clinton
