No selfies | Some selfies | All selfies 
Not down with your selfie desires Put away your phones, because these states don't allow photographs in polling places or voting booths  -- or both. Granted the laws aren't often enforced. (It's more of a ""someone gently asks you to stop"" kind of thing.)  But that doesn't mean you should test the rules. Alabama: No photos at polling places. That being said, no one's been prosecuted and any violators will simply be asked to stop. Arizona: You can't take photos inside or within 75 feet of a polling place. You CAN take a photo of a ballot that was mailed to you. California: Ballot selfies WILL be legal in California ...in January 2017. As of now, they're against the law ... that isn't really enforced. Colorado: There are two pending cases that may overturn the law, but for now it's illegal to take pics AND to share or show your completed ballot to another person. Florida: No go in voting places. Yes to pics of mail-in ballots. Georgia: Can't take pics at a polling place, or of any ballots or voting equipment. The Secretary of State's office says it ""strongly discourage[s] ballot selfies.""Illinois: It's a felony to take pictures that show how you voted, and it's also illegal to take pictures inside polling places. If you do get popped for a violation, the state Election Board says the case would be decided on the county level. Iowa: No photos are allowed in the voting booths, but the law's unclear on whether that also means polling places. Maryland: Maryland goes a level beyond, and actually bans the use of any electronic communication devices. That, obviously, means you can't take pics of ballots either. Michigan: There's a legal back-and-forth going on, but for now, no cameras in polling places. Nevada: Can't take pictures in polling places, because it's considered photographing ""the conduct of voting."" North Carolina: The only way you can take pictures is if you have the permission of the voter (you) -- and the permission of the chief judge of the precinct (not you). So, it's probably a pass. Tennessee: Tennessee's laws are kinda unclear, because they state ""no phones"" but also have a mobile app to help with voting. However, the law also says you can't take pictures or talk on the phone. Take a lesson from Justin Timberlake: It's not worth the hassle. Texas: No photos inside the booths or within 100 feet of the polling place. If you do get caught, you won't be arrested, per se, but you will be asked to stop. And why would you want to inconvenience people with all of that? West Virginia: Here's the law: ""No person may enter a voting booth with any recording or electronic device in order to record or interfere with the voting process."" So, basically, no selfies. However, once you're outside the precinct, snap away. Back to topExercise selfie restraintLots of state laws don't specifically cover voting booth pictures, but are pretty clear on marked ballots. There's plenty of reasons why this is totally understandable, but the most important one has to do with vote buying. There's no way anyone can know who you voted for unless you provide them with photo evidence. Alaska: There's a statute in the books prohibiting selfies with your ballot, but no one's been prosecuted. The state says it's considered creating a PSA reminding voters of ballot secrecy. Massachusetts: No selfies with your ballot, people. But here again, there's little the state can do to enforce the law, says Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Minnesota: Two statues say showing others your marked ballot is a no-no. And that's what taking a pic or a video does. Mississippi: Just don't in Mississippi. In 2008 & 2012, some teens who were voting for the 1st time broke the law. The Attorney General fined them $25.  Your fine could be higher -- up to $100, says Holly Robertson of the State Board of Elections.Missouri: The law here, like the others in this list, deals with showing your ballot. So, Stephanie Fleming of the Secretary of State's Office says, check with your polling place just to be sure before you start snapping.New Jersey: There are moves to change the law, but for now you can't show your completed ballot to others, which means no pictures of it. New Mexico: The law says no showing your completed ballot to anyone. Ken Ortiz of the Secretary of State's Office says the law's hard to enforce and nobody's been prosecuted under it.New York: Don't take a picture of your ballot. Simple. South Carolina: Selfies of your ballot = Against the law. But Chris Whitmire with the state Election Office didn't know if anyone's ever been prosecuted for it.South Dakota: Don't take a picture of your ballot. Mark it, fold it, refold it and cast your vote.Wisconsin: The state would rather you not take a pic with your marked ballot. Reid Magney of the Election Commission says he's not aware of any prosecutions, but why open yourself up to a complaint?Back to topSelfie expression is fineHere's the bottom line: Voting is a serious affair, and states would like to protect the sanctity of this American right. If you still simply must selfie, go ahead. Just consider the inimitable words of Ian Malcom from Jurassic Park: You may be so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you may not stop to think if you should. Arkansas: The only law here is that you are allowed to cast your vote in private, says Daniel Schultz with the Board of Elections. Connecticut:  Snap away. Delaware: There's no specific law against any of this, but officials do encourage people not to use their cellphones in polling places. Hawaii: Okay, so, you can take a selfie in the voting booth, and you can share photos of your marked ballot. However, according to Nedielyn Bueno of the Office of Elections, you can't take selfies OUTSIDE the voting booth because polling places don't allow the use of electronic devices. Idaho: There are now laws against it, but photography is discouraged. Indiana: The state enacted a law that banned ballot selfies. But a federal judge barred it from going into effect. So, you're good to go ... for now.Kansas: Election Director Brian Caskey with the Board of Elections says there's a law about ballot disclosure, but ballot selfies don't fall under it. Kentucky: Good to go. Louisiana: Selfies are allowed because your vote is private until YOU make it public!Maine: Snap away.Montana: Snap away.Nebraska: Snap away.New Hampshire: A federal appeals court ruled a statewide ballot selfie ban unconstitutional. So you're good to go.North Dakota: No issues here.Ohio: ""The Secretary does not believe posting a photo of your vote on social media is a problem,"" says Joshua Eck, the spokesman for the Secrety of State's Office. Oklahoma: They advise voters not to take selfies, but there is no current penalty, and no history of prosecution.Oregon: There are no laws prohibiting pictures of your ballot.Pennsylvania: The state has sent guidance to polling places that it is within people's 1st Amendment rights to take selfies.Rhode Island: Once you're in the booth, you can take pictures. No can do outside the booth.Utah: Go for it.Vermont: No laws regarding selfies or photos at all.Virginia: Take a pic and make it good.Washington: It's not recommended, but you're fine.Wyoming: Nothing says you can't, but don't be disruptive.Back to top"	Don't even THINK about taking a selfie when you vote in these states

In 2012, President Barack Obama went on to win Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida as well as a lot of other states for a grand total 332 electoral college votes, far above the votes needed to defeat Romney and win re-election. Walsh said the party has learned lessons from that loss eschewing a reliance on polling for a more predictive modeling program called ""voter scores,"" which gives each would-be voter in the 190-million member voter file a numerical value, 1-100, on how likely they are to vote and how likely they are to vote Republican. ""The beauty of predictive modeling is you're watching an electorate voter-by-voter over a long period of time,"" Walsh said. ""You're watching their movement, you're watching what they care about, you're watching what they respond to to and there are a lot of upsides to this."" RELATED: Gallup explains what went wrong with its 2012 pollsWalsh highlighted success of their efforts in the 2014 midterms -- particularly the North Carolina Senate race where Thom Tillis defeated incumbent Democrat Kay Hagan, despite polls showing the opposite result. As for this year's race, Walsh said the RNC's goal is to focus on being the voter turnout infrastructure for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which Walsh described as originally comprising of ""10 guys and a Twitter account."" Walsh said her takeaway from the RNC's data, which is not publicly shared, is how much voters don't want to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Voters are looking for any reason to vote for someone else, she said. ""I think another thing that we've seen is that when Mr. Trump stays on message, people come home real quick,"" Walsh said.""That's usually only for about five minutes,"" Madden responded.""Let's give him 45 minutes,"" Ham added.

'Death to America' means death to a system which has nothing to do with humanitarian values."" On Twitter, Khamenei said Clinton and Trump underscored America's ""collapse of humanitarian values"" and described the US as a racist country where 1% of the population has access to 90% of the wealth.According to Iranian state media, Khamenei also dismissed negotiations with the United States, saying such talks ""will not resolve our problems."" He added, ""We should resolve the problems ourselves and with reliance on our capabilities and the young forces inside the country.""Despite allowing Iran to sign an agreement with the United States, the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany limiting Tehran's nuclear program, Khamenei has continued to criticize negotiations with the United States.Clinton has indicated her support of the deal, and Trump has made his opposition to the Iran deal a regular feature of his campaign.The Iran Hostage Crisis began 37 years ago when Iranian revolutionaries seized the US Embassy and held 52 US citizens captive for 444 days.

Some of their criticisms of President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement were accurate, especially with regard to rising deductibles and insurance companies opting out of the government-run exchanges. But there also were a number of times when their statements were either untrue or wildly misleading. For example:""The truth is, premiums for employer plans have gone up by almost $5,000 since Obama took office,"" Pence said.Pence's figures are correct. Premiums for employee-based health insurance plans went up by nearly $4,800 since Obama took office in 2009, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But the ACA wasn't passed until 2010 and really didn't start having an impact on the market until the following year. In that timeframe, Kaiser estimated that employer-based premiums increased by 20%. That compares to an increase of 31% in the previous five-year period.So Pence's figure is true. Premiums for employer-based plans have increased under Obama. But, as a criticism of the ACA, the figure is misleading since premiums have gone up at a slower rate since the law was implemented.""It is also true that Obamacare is killing jobs and it's destroying small business job growth all across this country,"" Pence added.So what did job growth look like starting from 2011, once the ACA's impact was clear? By 2016, the US economy had created about 10 million jobs in those five years. During a comparable five-year period (2003-2007) during the presidency of George W. Bush, 8 million jobs were created. However, it is difficult to blame Obamacare for sluggish job growth in small business since companies with fewer than 50 employees are exempt from the law's mandate to provide insurance for their employees. ""Workers' hours are being cut; hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed,"" Trump claimed. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that workers' hours have remained fairly constant since the ACA was implemented. According to BLS, annual public and private sector hiring rose by about 11.4% from 2011 to 2015, compared to an 8.7% rise during a comparable period in the George W. Bush Administration. Not much of a hiring freeze there. And, of course, the Census Bureau recently reported that wages saw their biggest recorded jump ever in 2015.So these claims are false."

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/james-comey-fbi-reputation/index.html	"Behind the scenes over the past 15 months, infighting among some agents and officials has exposed some parts of the storied bureau to be buffeted by some of the same bitter divisions as the rest of American society.This account is based on interviews with more than a dozen officials close to the matter who spoke anonymously because they've been ordered not to speak to the news media.Tensions have built in particular over the handling of matters related to Hillary Clinton. Some of the sharpest divides have emerged between some agents in the FBI's New York field office, the bureau's largest and highest-profile, and officials at FBI headquarters in Washington and at the Justice Department.Some rank-and-file agents interpreted cautious steps taken by the Justice Department and FBI headquarters as being done for political reasons or to protect a powerful political figure. At headquarters, some have viewed the actions and complaints of some agents in the field as driven by the common desire of investigators to get a big case or, perhaps worst, because of partisan views.The tensions have multiplied since FBI Director James Comey made an unprecedented public announcement in July that there should be no charges against Clinton or her aides following a year-long probe.That announcement -- without prior notice to his bosses at the Justice Department and, according to his critics, usurping the traditional role of prosecutors to review FBI recommendations in secret -- opened up sharp divides between Justice and FBI officials, and even within the Justice Department itself, where some officials have pushed for Attorney General Loretta Lynch to more forcefully assert her power over the FBI.President Barack Obama in an interview published Wednesday noted the efforts to not appear to interfere with the work of the FBI. ""I've made a very deliberate effort to make sure that I don't look like I am meddling in what are supposed to be independent processes for making these assessments,"" he told NowThisNews. An independent agencySome of the tensions are built-in because of the FBI's unique position as part of the Justice Department but also projecting a large measure of independence. The FBI director's job has a 10-year tenure, spanning presidential administrations, while his bosses at the Justice Department are politically appointed and they leave when the administration ends. Comey, in public speeches, often mentions reminders of abuses in the FBI's past under J. Edgar Hoover, who secretly kept files on lawmakers and presidents.One official said the FBI is ""resolute and confident that what we're doing -- though not palatable -- is the right thing and we are maintaining independence.""Much of the turmoil centers not only on the handling of the probe into Clinton's use of a private server while secretary of state, but also another case some FBI agents wanted to pursue into the Clinton Foundation and whether there was any impropriety in dealings with donors.In both cases, some FBI investigators felt stymied by headquarters and Justice Department officials and they interpreted roadblocks as politically partisan.It's in that tense environment that the latest developments emerged as agents were conducting the unrelated investigation of Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Clinton's close adviser Huma Abedin.The surprise discovery of thousands of emails belonging to Abedin on a computer belonging to Weiner brought matters to a boil.The longer it took for officials at FBI headquarters and at the Justice Department to decide how to proceed with the matter, the more conspiracies spread among some agents that perhaps senior FBI officials were trying to cover up the matter.Comey on Friday sent a letter to committee leaders in Congress with oversight of the FBI alerting them of the recently discovered documents and resulting investigation.He acted in part, people close to him say, because he believed the news would eventually leak and the bureau would face an even bigger public backlash.""It's the times we are living in,"" one senior law enforcement official said. ""No one has emerged from this election unscathed.""The election may soon be over, but the impact on the FBI will take some time to assess.'Politics is running rampant'Veterans of the bureau think the controversy is a symptom of the bitter election year.""Politics is running rampant,"" says former FBI Boston chief Rick DesLauriers, who oversaw the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings. ""Passions are high.""DesLauriers believes Comey has tried to ensure decisions are based on principle, not politics.""He made a decision that angered Republicans in July and one that angered Democrats in October,"" said DesLauriers, who retired three years ago. ""That's a pretty good indication he's nonpartisan.""To be sure, differences of opinion between FBI field offices and headquarters are a common occurrence on any number of cases. The hard-charging New York field office is often tussling with headquarters over management of cases, officials say.But the Clinton probes are no ordinary cases.""The FBI is an organization not comfortable operating in a political environment,"" another official said. ""The intent was not to enter the political fray.""Soon after the FBI opened its investigation into the Clinton server in the summer of 2015, Comey decided it would be run from headquarters instead of New York, which is the jurisdiction where the Clinton server had been located.That decision angered some in New York who thought it was headquarters' interference into their case.Given the sensitivity of the case, Comey brought in a team of agents mostly from the Washington, D.C., field office, to pore through the thousands of emails.He assigned the case to the counterintelligence section, which investigates cases of alleged mishandling of classified information. It gave the added advantage of being a section with a reputation for few media leaks and being close enough for Comey to get personal almost-daily updates.""We're in the middle of one of the most vitriolic campaigns in American history, and we're investigating one of the candidates for president,"" the senior law enforcement official said. ""We had to get this right.""That didn't quiet all of the complaints, particularly now that the behind-the-scenes tussles are spilling out into the public.During the Clinton email server investigation, investigators and prosecutors debated whether to issue subpoenas to Clinton's aides, officials say. Leaders at the FBI and at the Justice Department thought it would be faster to come to voluntary agreements with aides. Subpoenas could cause delays, particularly if litigation is necessary, officials said. And the FBI and Justice Department wanted to try to complete the probe and get out of the way of the 2016 election.Clinton Foundation in focusThe tensions built after agents in several field offices began looking into allegations of corruption related to the Clinton Foundation, the charity of Bill and Hillary Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. The FBI, under long-standing policy, hasn't publicly acknowledged the existence of the investigation.Some of the allegations made headlines with the May 2015 publication of the book ""Clinton Cash"" by conservative writer Peter Schweizer, alleging corrupt ties between the Clinton Foundation and big-money foreign donors.It's not uncommon for FBI probes to begin as a result of or be fueled by published news articles or books.Similar probes have been underway for well over a year into people associated with Donald Trump's campaign. These include a probe of Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his ties to pro-Russian figures in Ukraine. The Trump-related probes, none of which have been officially acknowledged by the FBI, also were slowed in recent months because of Justice Department rules not to conduct overt steps that could affect the election. But officials say the cases were ongoing for well over a year before the election concerns became an issue.In the Clinton Foundation probe, at least one FBI field office also received notification of a possible suspicious bank transaction. The transaction involving a Clinton Foundation donor was flagged in what is known as a suspicious activity report, routine notices sent through the Treasury Department's financial enforcement arm. By early this year, FBI agents from four field offices -- Los Angeles, Little Rock, Arkansas, Washington, D.C., and New York -- had open files on the Clinton Foundation and were seeking to get permission to formally conduct investigations of the Clinton Foundation.In February, as CNN first reported, FBI criminal division leaders and lawyers met with the lawyers from the Justice Department's public integrity section to present what was known so far and to seek permission to conduct full-blown investigations, including the ability to subpoena records.At that time, the Justice officials in the meeting advised FBI officials that there wasn't sufficient evidence to move forward and declined to give the authorization for overt investigative techniques. Some officials described a contentious meeting with strong disagreement on both sides.Officials leading the meeting told the FBI that investigators hadn't turned up much more evidence beyond that contained in ""Clinton Cash.""FBI lawyers at headquarters concurred with the Justice Department's view that agents be allowed to continue their work with the option to return if they found more evidence.In July, Comey made his announcement to recommend no charges against Clinton.At a Capitol Hill hearing days later, Comey told members of Congress that he was proud there had been no leaks of his decision.But blowback from some current and former agents was immediate. As Comey made his rounds of visits to field offices around the country, he heard stinging criticism, particularly from retired agents.At one meeting in Kansas City, Comey was confronted with stinging criticism of the probe. He pushed back, saying the career agents who knew the most of the case arrived at the conclusion that the case against Clinton wasn't even a close call.FBI agents again pressed to take more overt steps in the Clinton Foundation probe, including possibly issuing subpoenas.Justice Department officials again opposed such moves. They cited, again, a lack of evidence to warrant more investigative steps. And they expressed concerns that with the election close, any overt actions shouldn't be made until after Election Day.""It's just a (message of) 'hold right now until after the elections -- no subpoenas issued, no interviews,"" one law enforcement official familiar with the July decision said.  Some FBI officials also viewed the existing cases in the four field offices to not have advanced much beyond the allegations in ""Clinton Cash.""Officials at FBI headquarters decided the Clinton Foundation probe should be consolidated in New York. They ordered that agents in Los Angeles, Little Rock and Washington, D.C., turn over their files to the FBI New York office, which appeared to have the strongest case to make.Agents were told to continue their work. But the order to the other field offices angered agents there.In the Washington field office, a half-mile away from headquarters, agents were told they could continue to work on a probe of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, but would have to discontinue what they viewed as relevant connected work on the Clinton Foundation. McAuliffe is a close ally of the Clintons and previously headed the Clinton Foundation. In New York, some agents working the Clinton Foundation case chafed at the decision that they had to sit and wait until after the election.How will controversy shape the bureau?Decades after the death of J. Edgar Hoover, who built the mystique of FBI agents as a special class of investigators, the bureau continues to nurture that image. The bureau lends its help to Hollywood, which churns out movies and television shows glamorizing the work of FBI agents.In recent years, the bureau has sought to modernize, promoting more women to some higher ranks, and seeking to train new ranks of analysts alongside agents as a way to make clear that intelligence analysts should be treated as equals to gun-carrying agents. Struggles remain as Comey tries to change what is still an overwhelmingly white and male-dominated organization.How much the recent controversy changes the FBI is to be seen.James V. DeSarno, who spent 28 years in the bureau and rose to the level of assistant director, agrees that Comey's July announcement and Friday letter were unprecedented. But he says it doesn't signal how the FBI will run cases.""I don't think he believes he's changed the rules,"" DeSarno said of Comey, ""But I can see where other people may think he has."""
