The issue for the RNC: it's not allowed to work with the Trump campaign on ballot security activities because of a decades-old consent decree. So while Trump has actively urged backers to watch for anything suspicious, the RNC can't be involved.""Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don't come in and vote five times,"" Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania this summer.Democratic lawyers have already gone to court in New Jersey asking that the judge extend the consent decree for several more years -- it is currently set to expire in December 2017 -- arguing that the RNC has enabled Trump's efforts to ""intimidate and discourage minority voters"" from voting.  Judge John Michael Vazquez has scheduled a hearing for Friday morning in Newark to discuss the case, including Pence's comments.In his filing, Phillippe said he and other RNC personnel investigated the matter in a series of interview with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and several top committee staffers. They also ""reviewed RNC electronic and hard-copy files for any agreement with Mr. Trump or his campaign related to voter fraud, ballot security, ballot integrity, poll watching or poll monitoring activities,"" and found no such document.Pence told Phillippe via phone this week that he didn't know about any cooperation between the RNC and Trump campaign.""Governor Pence stated to me that he has 'no knowledge whatsoever' of any effort between the Trump campaign and the RNC to ensure ballot integrity,"" Phillippe wrote. ""He further stated that he neither ever has been a part of, nor is aware of, any discussions between the Trump campaign and the RNC concerning any efforts to ensure ballot integrity or that would suggest any RNC involvement in such activities.""Phillippe added that he and Donald McGahn, general counsel of the Trump campaign, spoke and confirmed ""that the RNC would not be involved in any such activities, and that, to the extent it was involved in any of these activities, the Trump campaign would not receive any assistance from the RNC whatsoever."""

In 2016, Republicans are trying to learn from their mistakes. After their lagging 2012 operation failed to elect Mitt Romney, the Republican National Committee began working to step up their game, investing manpower and resources in many key states some three years ago.""We are 100 miles away from where we were in 2012,"" said Matt Dailer, the RNC's director in the battleground state of Iowa.One of the biggest differences between this election cycle and those in the past is that Republican activists and volunteers are working on a new phone app to get out the vote.""It will show you their party affiliation, how reliable they are as a voter. You just click that voter, do tech survey, boom there you go right there,"" said Dailer, as he demonstrated the way it works.It also gives volunteers what's called ""dynamic scripting,"" a tool that prompts different pitches to voters depending on their answers to a set of questions, information instantly sent back to RNC headquarters.""If we have someone who says the country is going in the wrong direction but they plan on voting for Hillary Clinton, there we go,"" Dailer said. ""Now we know how we can target them.""""We need to talk to low-propensity Republicans to make sure they know when the election is and figure out who they're going to support so we can drive them out,"" he added.Now, in the final push, thousands of GOP staffers and volunteers are using that app in battleground states across the country. The RNC, which is leading Trump's ground operation, says it will complete 17 million door knocks by Election Day, up from the 11.5 million it did in 2012.It's an ambitious plan, but it's been done before -- by the Democrats.Republican strategists openly admit that they are trying to emulate the Obama ground machine that crushed the GOP for two presidential election cycles.And this cycle, the Democrats are not slowing down. Armies of Democratic volunteers and activists are spread out over the same key states as Republicans.Clinton campaign aides say they are expecting to have close to 1 million volunteer shifts in the final 96 hours alone.In some ways, team Clinton is old school. Unlike the Republicans who do almost everything on an app, the Democrats still distribute call sheets and send volunteers out canvassing with paper and clipboards. All the information is then imputed and tallied at the end of each day. Still, overall, the Clinton system is very high tech, using social and digital media to build on that vaunted Obama operation. Jessalyn Reid, the Clinton campaign's Virginia state digital director, explained that their technology is all about meeting voters where they are, which in 2016 is online.""We've got apps and mobile websites and email and all of the stuff that we're going to bring together for a holistic direct voter contact program that really reaches people where they are and enables them to organize their communities and get out the vote both on and off line,"" she said.For Team Clinton, getting out the vote is all about decentralizing the process and helping volunteers reach out to people in their own communities.Democrats also stress the importance of getting their supporters to make a concrete voting plan. Reid demonstrated on her phone how voters can use text messages to nail down every detail, from their polling location to what kind of transportation they will take to what time of day they plan to go. And on Election Day, Reid said those voters will get a reminder straight to their phones telling them to go vote.With just days until the election, Clinton officials say their volunteers are pretty much done trying to persuade voters to support the Democratic nominee; they are just focused on turnout. ""Right now, and through the final stretch of the campaign, we are talking to Hillary supporters -- so people that we know support Hillary,"" said Reid.Republican officials say they are also focusing their phone efforts on turning out supporters, but say their technology makes it possible to continue trying to persuade soft voters door to door, even in the final days of the campaign. Still, for both sides, on Election Day, all the phone calls, messaging, door knocking, has to translate to one thing: votes."	US election: The final get-out-the-vote flurry begins
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/early-voting-battleground-states/index.html	With five days to go, registered Republicans also lead Democrats in early voting in Arizona, while Democrats are also ahead in Colorado and Iowa.More than 30 million votes have been cast already across 38 states with early voting. And with five days to go, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are encouraging their supporters to hit the polls early. So far, about 7.4 million registered Democrats and about 6.4 million Republicans have done just that.CNN has partnered with Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates and groups, to receive detailed early vote return information this year. Catalist's voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote.These are not results -- ballots aren't counted until Election Day. But the findings provide clues on who is voting and which party is turning out to vote. And in states that track party affiliation, it's important to remember that not all Democrats are voting for Clinton, and not all Republicans support Trump.Here's a look at the early voting data from several battleground states:ArizonaThere's good news for both parties in Arizona, where about 1.3 million people have already voted.Registered Republicans are ahead right now -- they lead by about 71,000 votes or 5.5%. But at this point four years ago, the GOP had a 10% advantage over Democrats. Perhaps sensing an opening, the Clinton campaign decided this week to pump an additional $1 million into Arizona for TV ads.But the good news for Republicans here is that it appears they're gaining ground. One week ago, their lead over Democrats was only about 11,500. Today that lead is more than 71,000.In Arizona, about 2 in 3 votes were cast early in 2012.ColoradoColorado is a state where the election is almost entirely conducted by mail. And with voting underway, there is good news for Democrats: They've consistently led Republicans in terms of ballots returned.Today, they're ahead by more than 18,500 votes, or about 1.5%. Four years ago at this point, Republicans had a lead of more than 33,000 votes, or about 3%. That is a significant flip.But there are some new polls out of Colorado that show a tightening race, and there are some indications in the early voting numbers to back that up. The Democratic lead one week ago was about 5.6%. That narrowed to about 2.4% on Tuesday and stands at 1.5% today.FloridaRepublicans have been steadily ahead in the early vote by about 0.5% over the past week. Maybe that's why President Barack Obama rallied voters Thursday in Miami and Jacksonville, hoping to turn things around.The GOP lead is tiny -- it's only about 16,000 votes out of more than 2.7 million cast -- but it's a strong sign for Republicans because at this point in 2008, they trailed Democrats by more than 73,000 votes.Turnout increased across the board, but it rose at difference paces for different racial groups. Latinos had the largest spike in terms of raw votes, boosting their turnout by 129% from 2008. White voters increased their turnout by 55%. And even though African-American turnout is up by 24%, that is clearly a slower growth rate than the other racial groups, and their share of the electorate dropped from 2008.What does this mean? For Democrats to win, they're likely hoping the big gains among Latino voters are enough to overcome whatever drop-off there is in the African-American vote.IowaDemocrats lead Republicans in Iowa, but they've been consistently behind their winning 2012 pace.Right now, about 41,000 more Democrats than Republicans have voted in the Hawkeye State. But at this point four years ago, they had an edge of more than 60,000 votes. According to the data, their advantage is shrinking as Election Day draws closer, but this also happened in 2012, when Obama won.All that being said, a majority of voters in Iowa typically cast their ballots on Election Day.NevadaThe early vote in Nevada has tracked closely with 2012, a year when Democrats built a significant lead during the early voting window. Obama relied on that lead to help him carry the state on Election Day.Registered Democrats are ahead by about 29,000 votes right now over registered Republicans. That's a slight drop from the 31,000-vote lead they had on Tuesday. But their lead is larger today than it was one week ago. Four years ago at this time, Democrats were ahead by about 38,000 votes, or 7.6%.The early vote is crucial in Nevada: Almost 70% of votes came early in 2012.North CarolinaDemocrats are padding their lead in North Carolina, consistently increasing their raw vote advantage over Republicans as more early voting locations open across the Tar Heel State.Right now, registered Democrats are ahead by about 243,000 votes statewide. That's an impressive showing, but at this point in 2012, the Democratic lead was more than 307,000 votes. In other words, Democrats are lagging a bit behind their pace from 2012, a year when they narrowly lost the state.The reason might be in the demographics. African-American turnout is lower this year and they have dropped as a share of the early electorate from 28% in 2012 to about 23% today. As more polling places open this week -- especially in counties with a large black electorate -- their turnout might tick up.The overwhelming majority of African-Americans that voted already in North Carolina were also registered Democrats, so when their vote falls, it affects Clinton's chances in a significant way. OhioRegistered Republicans expanded their lead this week in Ohio. They're now ahead of Democrats by almost 66,000 votes, or about 5 points. They were only up by 2.5 points one week ago.This is good news for the Republican Party's chances in Ohio. That's because at this point in 2008, the last year when there is comparable data, Republicans led by a razor-thin margin of 0.4%. And that early vote lead wasn't enough for them to ultimately carry the Buckeye State that year.Early voting is down across Ohio this year. That's likely the result of cutbacks, imposed by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2013, to the number of days of early voting.

You take a look at her email situation, can we trust her with our security?"" Trump said of his rival, who has repeatedly argued that Trump is too erratic to be trusted with the nation's security.Trump delivered his military-focused remarks days away from the election that could be decided by voters in this state, where more than 100,000 active duty military personnel are based and where the military supports nearly 600,000 jobs, according to the North Carolina Department of Commerce. Additionally, 775,000 veterans live in the state. That's why Trump, flanked by a dozen veterans, including retired military officers and Medal of Honor recipients, touted the strong support he enjoys among military veterans and even sought out a moment of humility as he touted the Medal of Honor recipients supporting his candidacy, calling them ""so much more brave"" than him.""I wouldn't do what they did. I'm brave in other ways. I'm financially brave. Big deal,"" said Trump, who sought multiple deferments to avoid military service in Vietnam, his voice trailing off.Trump later pivoted back to the group of veterans who served as the backdrop to his speech alongside a massive American flag, suggesting they would recoil at the thought of serving under Clinton as commander in chief.""You know, when I look at these great admirals and these great generals and these great Medal of Honor recipients behind me, to think of her being their boss?"" Trump said skeptically after a pause. ""I don't think so ... They're incredible patriots, they would never say a thing, but I know what they think.""Trump rehashed his plans to build out the military by increasing the number of troops, ships and fighter jets and, stoking fears of ISIS attacks reaching American shores, Trump also pledged to defeat the terror group and ""defeat it quickly."" And he tied that plan to his hardline immigration policies, arguing that Clinton ""wants to fling our borders wide open"" and allow terrorists ""to infiltrate our country,"" mischaracterizing his opponent's immigration plans.But Trump didn't offer just bravado and fear-mongering. He also sought to speak directly to military families in North Carolina whose votes will be crucial to securing victory in this pivotal swing state.""The military families of North Carolina have shed their blood and poured out their hearts for our country,"" Trump said, before pledging to fully equip military forces in combat, end the defense sequester and deploy troops only if military action is ""vital"" to US national security interests.Trump also vowed to improve medical care military veterans receive as he lamented problems at the Veterans Administration and the high rate of suicide among veterans.""You're our great people. You are our great people. It's not gonna happen,"" he said to cheers from the crowd of thousands who gathered outdoors to see and hear the Republican nominee.Trump, who repeatedly criticized the foreign policy actions of President Barack Obama, also argued for a break with past foreign policies of the United States, vowing a Trump administration ""will stop trying to build foreign democracies ... and race recklessly to intervene in situations that we have no right to be there, folks.""""America needs new leadership, quickly,"" Trump said.Trump will return to the state several times before voters head to the polls on Tuesday, with rallies already scheduled in the state on Saturday and Monday."

They are key ingredients in the house salsa, a recipe Sandoval has used for decades.Sandoval, who spoke to CNN after the final presidential debate had taken place, came to the US as an immigrant from Mexico in 1986, when he was 18 years old. He became a citizen in 1993 and lived in a few places around the country, but eventually moved to Ohio.  ""Columbus is a good market for restaurants,"" he said. ""It's growing like crazy. We have Latinos everywhere.""Sandoval now owns two restaurants and says that's why on November 8 he'll vote for the presidential candidate that will make life better for him as a businessman.Stark County, Ohio, is a swing county in a swing stateHe's registered as a Republican, but adds that ""doesn't mean I have to vote for that one because I always go with the party that offers more benefits for me and my family.""Sandoval says he never votes a straight-party ticket. When Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012, Sandoval was one of the Latino voters who helped the first black president capture the Buckeye State. He believed Obama was going to change immigration policy, something Sandoval says remains a high priority for him.For the last two decades, attention has been focused on Ohio during presidential election years. In a City University of New York study commissioned by CNN en Español, 1.8% of total voters who cast their ballots in Ohio in 2012 were Latino. Obama won the state by 1.9%.How the Latino vote could affect the 2016 raceFour years later and the state's population increase indicates about 2.2% of votes around Ohio will come from Latinos. Despite the fact that the Hispanic population is so small in the Ohio, the study shows Latinos could very well be the decisive factor in the election.""The Latino vote is important not because it's a big number, but because it represents a big impact when it comes to the elections,"" says German Trejo, a political consultant with experience running campaigns on both sides of the aisle. He says Ohio's electorate is, for the most part, set -- with the exception of about 100,000 voters, most of whom are undecided Latino voters.""Out of those 100,000, Latinos have a big chunk of that population and if they go and cast their ballot, they'll account for between 20% and 80% of that margin of victory,"" Trejo said. ""These are voters that traditionally stay at home, but in this election, because of the nature of the political candidates and rhetoric that is going on between the two parties, I think the Latino community is motivated and will go and vote in their best interest, whatever that interest is.""Ohio also outpaces the rest of the country in one aspect when it comes to Latino voters. According to the CUNY study, Ohio registration rates for Latinos in 2012 were at 69%, well above the national average of 58.7%. For 2016, that rate is expected to increase.Polls: Clinton, Trump neck-and-neck in Florida; new results in NC, PA and Ohio""Elections are won and lost by the slimmest of margins and we provide that margin of victory to most of the electorate,"" says Juan Molina Crespo. Crespo heads up the Hispanic Alliance of Cleveland, a grassroots, non-profit group that works to increase voter registration. He knows the importance of the Latino vote in the northeastern part of the state.""When you look at the state of Ohio, we have three counties out of the 88 counties that typically vote Democrat, and in those three counties we also have the highest number of Latinos in the state,"" he said.Crespo looks at Cleveland, in Cuyahoga County, with the highest density of Latinos in the entire state.Cuyahoga County, Ohio, could be Clinton's bright spot""President Obama won Ohio in the previous two elections in large part by very, very slim margins,"" he says, ""and that slim margin was predicated upon the Latino vote.""But Crespo points to problems in political camps with their last-minute push for the Latino vote here. ""It's critical,"" he says. ""Unfortunately, I think both parties do a dismal job of courting the Latino vote until the 11th hour.""Now, with just a few days until the election, some voters in Ohio are already casting their ballots, forcing local Latinos to decide now which candidate has their best interests at heart.RELATED: Latino vote: Will the sleeping giant finally choose the next president?""I just want to encourage all the Latinos to be more united,"" says Yasin Cuevas, a Puerto Rican transplant to Ohio and entrepreneur. ""To vote for those who can't, to understand that we are a community of unity, family-oriented and to see the candidates and watch which one more embraces our values and morals.""Cuevas moved to Northern Ohio a decade ago and teaches modeling techniques as the director of Miss Ohio Latina. She says politics comes into conversation with her clients a lot.""I remind them they have the right vote. Before we didn't, and this is something really important that can affect who we are as women and what rights we have in the society,"" she says.Cuevas says she's learned that most Latino families have similar priorities in what they want from a commander-in-chief, regardless of how small the number may be.""We are a powerful community and (we've grown) so (much) in the last years and it's really important,"" she says.Experts like Trejo point to Obama's narrow victory in Ohio four years ago as an example of why all candidates know the importance of winning the state and why they spend so much time and money here.""The state of Ohio has 18 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win the White House,"" he said. ""The state of Ohio is one of the top two important states to win the White House, and that's why presidential campaigns pay so much attention to this state in particular.""But with only a 2% voting base, it's a wonder Latinos in Ohio can make such a major difference on Election Day.""Here in Ohio that 2% could be decisive,"" Trejo said, ""And as we know: as Ohio goes, so goes the nation."""

Al Sharpton, Obama said it was essential agencies like the FBI remain nonpartisan. He was apparently referring to accusations that have been leveled against the bureau for meddling in the presidential election. Last week, FBI Director James Comey told Congress the FBI was reviewing emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton's private server, drawing outrage from Democrats.Over the summer, when the FBI did not recommend criminal charges in the email matter, Republicans criticized the bureau for making a politically motivated decision.""Historically, both under Democratic and Republican administrations, our goal has been and should be that our investigators and our prosecutors are independent of politics,"" Obama said. ""They're not politicized. They're not used as a weapon to advantage either side in partisan arguments. And I want to make sure we continue with that tradition and that norm.""Still, Obama praised Comey as a ""good man"" and insisted he did not believe the FBI director was attempting to sway the election.""I do not believe that he is in any way trying to influence the election one way or another,"" Obama said. ""I think he is a serious public servant who wants to do the right thing. And I think the overwhelming majority of FBI feel the same way.""The admonishment against becoming mired in politics was a step further than Obama's comments earlier this week about the FBI's decision to publicly reveal new developments in its investigation of Clinton's private email server. Speaking Tuesday to NowThis, Obama said it was essential the bureau not operate based on ""leaks"" and ""innuendo,"" but didn't explicitly warn against politicization.In neither interview did Obama criticize any specific action taken by the FBI in the Clinton case. He told NowThis the case had been settled when Comey declared there was no prosecutable evidence that Clinton had broken the law.After those remarks, the White House said Obama wasn't going any further than his press secretary, Josh Earnest, who two days earlier said he would neither ""criticize nor defend"" Comey for his actions. Like Obama, Earnest cited ""norms"" at the agency about revealing public information, but didn't warn against leaks.Speaking aboard Air Force One Friday, Earnest said it was essential to keep law enforcement and politics from mixing.""Our democracy places a premium on separating out criminal investigations, law enforcement, from politics. That makes our democracy stronger. It inspires greater confidence in our criminal justice system by the public.

The executive director of the transition is Rich Bagger, a former Christie chief of staff and New Jersey politician. Also leading efforts for the transition is Bill Palatucci, a New Jersey committeeman to the Republican National Committee and former Christie campaign chairman. Christie's influence has also been felt in donor solicitations for the transition's funding stream, which is separate from the campaign, including a fundraising briefing that was held in New Jersey.   But Christie's ongoing headache from the Bridgegate scandal got more complicated on Friday, when a jury found two former aides -- former deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni -- guilty on all counts of conspiracy and fraud related to bridge lane closures that caused massive traffic problems for a town run by a Christie political opponent.  Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said Christie should resign.""Rather than just criss-crossing the country and hop-scotching and talking about cleaning up the swamp, he might start by draining his own swamp and asking Mr. Christie to resign as the head of his transition.""Christie has never been charged in the case, though witness testimony during the trial said he knew about the retribution-motivated closures as they occurred. Christie has maintained he had no prior knowledge of the scandal, and called the testimony ""simply untrue.""  In December 2015, however, when they were primary opponents, Trump told an audience in South Carolina Christie ""totally knew about it,"" referring to the Bridgegate closures. What's next for Chris ChristieThe New Jersey governor was scheduled to make a rare appearance on the campaign trail for Trump on Saturday with planned stops in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, but campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront"" that those plans were scrapped. Miller would not say whether or not Christie will return to the trail before the election, saying it is up to the New Jersey governor.Speaking to CNN outside a campaign event in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump and Christie had not spoken Friday and there has been no discussion about whether Christie would step aside as head of the transition team.""All of our personnel remains the same"" going into Tuesday, Conway said. She encouraged reporters to look at Christie's comments earlier in the day. ""He says that there's nothing in the testimony that would indicate any knowledge that he had. And that I believe I saw him comment publicly that this shows that he made a good exercise in judgment in firing the two people who were convicted. Those are his words,"" Conway said.As for Christie's schedule changes Saturday, she said, ""Gov. Christie keeps his own schedule.""How the transition team operatesMultiple sources familiar with the transition say Bagger is essentially running the show. Christie has spent little time in Washington in the past month, with schedule demands including a commuter train crash in Hoboken, New Jersey, in late September and a strong role in Trump's debate prep in October. On Thursday, Christie called into a fundraising breakfast briefing for the transition held at a Washington law office, attended by industry lobbyists, according to a source in attendance. Bagger was on hand, as was Ed Feulner, former president of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank who has taken a leadership role in the transition.The conversation was largely similar to past briefings Christie and the transition leadership have held in DC. The staff of the team has made progress on identifying candidates for key positions in the administration, are preparing a list of potential executive actions a President Trump could enact or repeal on his first day in office, are developing concrete policy proposals to match Trump's campaign pledges, and are working on developing a roadmap for his first 100 to 200 days in office, according to the source in the room.Another source who has been briefed on the transition efforts says the ""skeleton"" for the transition is in place. ""While the meat's not on the bones, the bones are there, ready to really take off if Trump were to win it,"" said the source, who is close to the Trump campaign. While activity and interest in the transition has ebbed and flowed with polling, sources familiar say, recent tightening in the polls have served as a shot in the arm for the effort. Christie's world is not the only sphere of influence in the Trump transition.Heritage has been well represented on the effort throughout.

Lawyers for the civil rights group argued that boards of elections in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties had canceled thousands of voter registrations after a small number of individuals challenged the registration of approximately 4,500 voters based ""exclusively on mass mailings that were returned as undeliverable.""                               They argued the ""en masse"" cancellation was done in violation of the National Voter Registration Act that prohibits systemic voter removal programs within 90 days of a federal election and that it disproportionately targeted African-American voters. ""The court finds that a narrowly tailored injunction is warranted to ensure that eligible voters are not deprived of their right to participate in the upcoming election due to a flawed process engaged in by the State and County Boards,"" Biggs wrote.  One plaintiff, James Edward Arthur Sr., said that he had planned to vote but recently learned that his voter registration was canceled, ""as a result of a third-party challenge brought under North Carolina's voter challenge statute."" Grace Bell Hardison, a 100-year-old African-American woman living in Beaufort County is another plaintiff. In court papers the NAACP argued that she has voted in nearly every election for the last 12 years but recently learned that her registration was challenged based on an alleged change of residence -- even though she hasn't moved since 2011. Her nephew was ""ultimately successful"" in presenting evidence of her residence.The NAACP alleged the purge was done after first-class mail to the voter at the address listed on the voter registration card was returned. ""In many cases, voters purged by defendants still reside at the address where they are registered to vote, or have moved within the county and remain eligible to vote there,"" NAACP lawyers argued. ""Nonetheless, a single item of returned mail has resulted in their ultimate removal from the voter rolls."" The Justice Department had weighed in on the case, telling the judge in court briefs that if the allegations made by the plaintiffs were true ""safeguards"" were absent and federal law was violated.  Kimberly Westbrook Strach, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, says that the challenges at issue were not initiated with the counties, but by private individuals.Under North Carolina law any voter in a county can challenge the eligibility of any other county voter up to 25 days before the election. The challenge can include a residency challenge. Strach addressed the controversy in a letter sent last week to Dr. William J. Barber II, president of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP. ""A challenge validly entered will trigger a preliminary hearing, written notice to the affected voter and a full hearing on the merits before the appointed members of the county board of elections."" She said that in all the cases ""county officials indicate that their respective boards of elections held preliminary hearings, notified the challenged voters by mail, and held hearings on the merits.""In the letter Strach emphasized that while the federal law prohibits a state from ""conducting systematic list maintenance within 90 days of a federal election,"" the challenges involved in the case come from private citizens and were resolved through a ""statutory process that ensures notice and an opportunity to be heard before the appropriate body within the county."" In a statement after the lawsuit was filed she said, ""the statutes at issue are decades old and are common across the country and widely regarded as compatible with the National Voter Registration Act. If the plaintiffs are right, then most states are wrong."" After the hearing, and even before the opinion was released, Strach issued a statement saying that, ""As the independent agency that administers elections in North Carolina, we will comply with any court order.""This story has been updated."
