While GOP leaders have not settled on this tactic yet, it is one of several strategies being considered, two Senate GOP leadership aides told CNN.  Democrats dealing with the issue were skeptical the unique approach would pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian, who plays a major role in deciding what can be done under the complex and highly technical reconciliation rules.If that route is used, it could speed up by several months the process of  ""repealing"" the law. However, the process of ""replacing"" the Affordable Care Act. with a GOP alternative could still last many months and possibly up to two years. Complicated procedures Republicans can repeal significant portions through a budget procedure that avoids a Senate filibuster and allows them to pass it on a party-line vote. But they cannot repeal all of it that way. And if they want to replace Obamacare, that's even harder. They will need 60 votes (and Democratic support) to overcome a filibuster.RELATED: Obamacare under President Trump: What happens next?So it may be listed as a ""100 days"" priority, but it's complicated and likely to take several months. Even if they can get Democratic support, passing a replacement bill could take up two years, aides say.That's because the GOP doesn't have the 60-seat supermajority in the Senate needed to overcome a filibuster that Democrats plan to launch against the repeal effort. In January, when the new Congress starts, Republicans may hold as many as 52 seats.To get around that blockade, Republicans could use a process called ""budget reconciliation,"" which would allow the Senate to dismantle large chunks, but not the entire law with just 51 Senate votes. Those sections are related to taxes and spending -- such as subsidies to buy health insurance, tax credits, penalties for not having insurance, and the expansion of Medicaid.RELATED: Obama faces sharp repudiation and a legacy nightmareBut Republicans would still need 60 votes to get rid of remaining sections of the law -- including popular provisions such as allowing young people to stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26 and preventing insurance companies from not covering people with pre-existing conditions.  That means Republicans would need to get support from at least eight Democrats to make changes to those provisions. Democratic leaders say they won't engage in negotiations that would undermine the law, although they say they would be open to talks to improve it.  But Republicans believe they might be able to persuade some moderate Democrats -- especially those running for re-election in 2018 in more conservative states -- to possibly vote for their proposals.RELATED: Donald Trump to soon receive intel 'crown jewels'Republicans say their repeal language could provide a window of about two years to give them time to ""replace"" what they are repealing. That is a reflection that negotiating the changes with Democrats could be time-consuming."	Repealing Obamacare? Here's how Congress could do it	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]

No member has emerged to challenge the California Democrat for the top spot, but shifting the vote up weeks earlier makes it difficult for anyone to mount a campaign to defeat her.""Members have indicated a strong desire to proceed with elections next week in order to prepare forcefully for the lame duck session and the challenges we will face in January,"" Pelosi explained as the reason for the earlier date, adding that ""this has been a very sad and trying week for all of us.""Pelosi has not officially announced that she is running for another term, but several House Democratic sources tell CNN she is expected to launch another bid. She held a post-election conference call with stunned Democrats on Wednesday and argued the minority party could have an impact shaping some policies with a Trump White House, pointing to their agreement over approving more federal money to build roads and bridges.On Friday, a group of 40 female House Democrats boosted her candidacy, signing onto a letter that was circulating that said ""our caucus and our country need your strategic, battle-tested leadership to guide us through the years ahead.""They invoked the loss of Clinton as a reason for another woman to remain a leadership voice for the party. ""After everything that happened in this campaign, the defeat of Hillary Clinton is an especially heavy blow to the aspirations of young women and girls. They need to see the first woman speaker -- and every woman member of Congress -- standing firm in the halls of power, continuing the fight for their rights, their dignity, and their dreams,"" the letter said."

Keith Ellison of Minnesota is looking to make a run for the influential post, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Although Ellison has not yet officially commented on the speculation, the congressman has already picked up endorsements from prominent colleagues in Congress, including popular liberal Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is expected to be the next Senate minority leader. On Sunday Ellison also won the backing from the current Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.""My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done,"" Reid said in a statement. ""Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith.""The election of the next DNC head -- and what kind of Democrats emerge as the new and younger leaders of the party -- will send an important signal about the direction that the Democratic Party takes in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's shocking defeat to Trump this week.If Ellison is elected DNC chair, he could play a potentially powerful role in advocating for ethnic minority groups, including Muslims, who feel deeply concerned about Trump's past comments about non-whites.Earlier this year, CNN traveled to three growing Muslim communities and spoke to more than 40 Muslim Americans about the election. In these conversations, the community expressed emotions ranging from disbelief to anger to fear.In an extensive interview outside of his district office in Minneapolis, Ellison said at the time that Muslims in his community feared possible backlash and spike in racial discrimination if Trump were to be elected president.""I've had more than one mom say, 'My kids are asking me whether we're going to be deported, whether we're going to be safe.' Teenage girls asking whether they should wear the hijab if they want to,"" Ellison said. ""It's a choice, but they're now getting the message that maybe it's not safe for them to do that.""Like many others that CNN interviewed, Ellison also made a surprising revelation: that he believes things are worse now for Muslim-Americans than they were right after the September 11 terrorist attacks.""I think it's probably harder now,"" he said.Ellison described a gradual easing of tensions and normalization in the 15 years since 9/11. After becoming the first Muslim-American elected to Congress, Ellison said former President George W. Bush ""extended his hand to me and said, 'Ellison, I'm glad there's a Muslim in the Congress.'""Bush ""stood with Muslims and he said that Islam's not the problem -- these terrorists, murderers and maniacs are the problem,"" Ellison says. ""George Bush doesn't get enough credit for that."""	First Muslim elected to Congress eyes run at DNC chairmanship	['Reid', 'Sanders', 'Trump', 'Ellison']	[]

The personal information of cardholders, including addresses and dates of birth, is stored on encrypted databases and servers, according to the city. It cannot be disclosed to federal law enforcement or immigration authorities without permission from the city's human resources administration. Applicants do not have to disclose their immigration status to receive a card. Mayor: Privacy is going to be respectedTrump has not inquired into the city's database publicly, but his statements throughout the campaign have made many fearful that he will act on his words.  Early in his campaign, in 2015, Trump announced that he would deport all of the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US by creating a ""deportation task force"" within Immigration and Customs Enforcement.He later altered his plan and said he would be ""focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens in America."" He said he would boost the ranks of agents to enforce existing laws. Trump has said he is against any amnesty for the undocumented. ""[Trump] can change some federal laws but the Constitution protects a lot of the rights and powers of localities,"" de Blasio said. Sanctuary city status could be affected""So on something like [the database], I think because it touches that button directly of whether people's personal privacy is going to be respected, I think that's one where there would be a real fight.""A provision of the ID law that allows the personal information retained in the database to be ""destroyed"" by the end of the year -- a deadline included intentionally in case a ""Tea Party Republican"" won the White House, according to one of the law's sponsors -- could also be enacted, de Blasio said.""As you know there's been an ongoing plan regardless of any electoral activity how long records are kept. Given this new reality we're certainly going to assess how we should handle it,"" he said.New York's status as a so-called sanctuary city, which allows it in some cases to shield undocumented immigrants who have broken the law from deportation requests, could also be affected if Trump follows through on his campaign promise to block funding for cities with the policy.Asked about the possibility, de Blasio said ""We're not going to tear families apart. So we will do everything we know how to do to resist that.""De Blasio would 'happily invite' Trump to dinnerDe Blasio has called Trump a blowhard and, a few weeks ago, de Blasio said the billionaire was running a racist campaign and had acted like a fascist when he complained the election was rigged.   Trump has tweeted that New York's Mayor is ""probably the worst mayor in the history of NYC."" Speaking at City Hall on Thursday, de Blasio extended a conciliatory note to the President-elect. He said he had reached out on a staff-to-staff level.He would ""happily invite him to dinner to have a conversation,"" and would ""work with him and do everything we can to help him"" to achieve goals of mutual interest, including infrastructure investment and tax code reform, de Blasio said.However, de Blasio noted the number of issues that stood between them -- the mayor of the country's biggest city and the Republican who came to power propelled largely by the support of middle America -- were great too. ""I take his platform and his vision very seriously and I think it's in many ways very dangerous. That being said, one has the distinct impression that some of that was just for show. So we're going to find out,"" he said."	Mayor: Database of undocumented New Yorkers could be deleted	['Trump']	[]

His victory has been greeted with dismay by those in the Moroccan capital.READ: Kids are taking the feds -- and possibly Trump -- to court over climate change'Rhetoric'""I hope that his rhetoric doesn't match his actions,"" senior climate change specialist Rasmus Lauridsen, at European Investment Bank, told CNN.""I've read an analysis saying that people take what he says seriously, but not him seriously. Maybe we should do the opposite and disregard what he says.""READ: The other election week storyOne of Trump's primary targets is the Clean Power Plan which President Obama unveiled to transform the US electricity sector, but is seen by many of its critics as a ""war on coal.""The plan is currently being contested and is expected to go before the Supreme Court in early 2017.Many of those who oppose the plan in the coal sector have been boosted by Trump's support for the industry.At a time where coal production is decreasing and businesses struggling, those who have opposed Obama's plan have backed Trump into the White House.'Bluster'But should the plan be overturned, it would represent a huge setback for those pushing the case of tackling climate change.""Trump's election has been met here by Americans and the international community with a great deal of concern for what it means for our climate, our environmental quality and the safety and well-being of people around the world,"" Mike Burger, executive director at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law told CNN.""Trump's campaign position on climate change was that it was a Chinese hoax -- an irrational, nonsensical idea, that is also plainly wrong. ""He also made a number of bold statements about his plans to set climate policy back by a decade and to undo all of our domestic and international commitments to climate action. ""Let's hope that he sees things differently when he is responsible for leading our country, and that these -- and so many of his other statements over the last year -- were just bluster.""   'Tears'For Henry Dallal,  photographer and author of ""Addressing Climate Change"", the election of Trump comes as a bitter blow.Dallal was at COP21 in Paris last year when President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry both attended, giving ""great momentum"" to the summit.""It's very sad. It's an absolute shock,"" Dallal told CNN. ""I still don't believe it ... I was also told that America cannot withdraw from the Paris agreement. ""The idea of them pulling out sends such a negative message.""'Billions'In Paris last year, the world agreed to do everything possible to limit harmful warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.The agreement, which became international law last Friday, has been ratified by the US, China, India and Brazil --  representing between them nearly 70% of the world's emissions. According to Lux Research, Trump's policies would lead to US emissions being 16% higher after two terms of office than they would have been after two terms of Hilary Clinton being in charge.That would amount to 3.4 billion tons of greater emissions over the next eight years.""As independent analysts, we don't endorse candidates, but the data and analysis clearly show that energy policy and the resulting emissions will go in very different directions under Clinton and Trump,"" said Lux research analyst Yuan-Sheng Yu.'Instability'The US is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas polluter after China and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would leave the rest of the world facing a losing battle.""America has established itself as a leader, if not the leader, in solving some of the biggest environmental problems in the world,"" Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund in the US, told CNN.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/trump-chief-of-staff-priebus-bannon/index.html	In the same way he grappled with his choice for vice president, Trump is fighting competing impulses as he decides who to tap to be his White House chief of staff. The decision is a critical one that will shape Trump's presidency, the priorities his administration sets and how it deals with leaders in both political parties.Trump's choice is coming down to two men who have closely advised the brash billionaire in the final months of his campaign, but whose backgrounds and political styles could not be more different: Republican National Committee  Chairman Reince Priebus or Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign CEO and executive chairman of Breitbart News.Priebus has the clear advantage. Just as many of his advisers and party leaders urged Trump to tap Indiana Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, the reliably conservative and mild-mannered counterbalance to the brash billionaire, top Republican officials are pressing Trump to tap Priebus for the top White House post.House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Trump on Thursday in his first meetings in Washington as president-elect to pick Priebus, telling Trump they believed the RNC chairman is the right choice and the best fit for the position, a source told CNN on Friday.Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, has also said privately he is supportive of that decision.Priebus would be a reassuring presence to establishment Republicans still uncertain about what a Trump White House will look like. He would also bring decades of political experience and understanding of the wheels of power in Washington.And while Trump ultimately asked Pence -- the favorite of conservative and establishment Republicans -- to join him on the GOP ticket instead of the bare-knuckled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the newly-minted President-elect is once again being drawn toward making a pick who will enable his outsider persona and bellicose instincts.Bannon is the very embodiment of those two characteristics, and he will also steer Trump toward enacting some of his most controversial and far-right policy proposals. And a source with knowledge of the transition told CNN on Thursday that advisers close to Trump believe Bannon is not suited to the top White House post, which demands keeping the wheels spinning and priorities aligned in the complex organization that is a presidential administration.As the head of Breitbart News, Bannon has helped shape the alt-right movement for which the site heralds itself as a home and has helped drive hardline positions on immigration, terrorism and cultural issues to the center of the Republican Party. It's the same movement that Trump seized on early in his primary campaign that catapulted his improbable candidacy to the Republican National Convention.The choice Trump now faces is one between two competing impulses -- both within his own mind and in the circle of advisers he listens to -- to fill the ranks of his White House with the hard-right figures who propelled his campaign to victory or the more establishment figures he will need to enact his policies in Washington.Both Priebus and Bannon have traveled with Trump in the final months of his campaign.Bannon has also been a major force behind some of Trump's more controversial stunts, including when Trump held an impromptu press event with women who had accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault and misconduct. He was spotted in the back of the room smiling as reporters were led in for the debate night surprise.Yet Bannon would likely have a place in the White House regardless.While at times Bannon is seen as feeding into Trump's worst instincts, he also has the credibility with the President-elect to convince him not to do things that would hurt him.Priebus, though, earned Trump's trust in the final months of the campaign, as he steered the RNC's resources behind Trump's candidacy despite Republican officials urging Priebus to abandon Trump and instead help down-ballot candidates.As Trump's candidacy was engulfed in the controversy stemming from a 2005 tape in which he boasted about being able to grope and kiss women without their consent, and as sexual assault allegations surfaced the next week, Priebus stood fast behind Trump and worked to salvage his campaign.And when Trump took the stage in the wee hours of Wednesday morning to declare victory in the presidential transition, he ceded the podium to one man only, to thank him for getting him to the victorious moment.That man was Reince Priebus.

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/popular-vote-turnout-2016/index.html	While election officials are still tabulating ballots, the 126 million votes already counted means about 55% of voting age citizens cast ballots this year. That measure of turnout is the lowest in a presidential election since 1996, when 53.5% of voting-age citizens turned out.   As election officials go through outstanding ballots -- such as provisional ballots and those with write-ins -- the turnout figures will change. But it would take another 18.7 million votes to reach the high point for turnout of 2008, when nearly 64% of voting age citizens cast a ballot. Early results in some of the key states that propelled President-elect Donald Trump to his win reveal that more voters cast ballots this year than in 2012, even though overall turnout was down.  In Florida, nearly 9.4 million ballots were cast, compared to 8.5 million in 2012.  Michigan saw 4.8 million compared to 4.7 million four years ago.  And in North Carolina, the 4.7 million ballots this year was about 138,000 more than last cycle. Full measures of turnout won't be clear for as long as several more weeks, when election officials in the various states finish tabulating and certify the results.  The figures also do not include people of age who are ineligible to vote or have not registered.  	Voter turnout at 20-year low in 2016	['Trump']	[]

Secretary of Defense Ash Carter called the additional money ""vitally important for our national security"" and said it would ""hasten the defeat of ISIL and make our nation more secure,"" using the government's preferred acronym for the terror group.It's a request that comes as Iraqi troops, backed by US airpower and advisers, are locked in a fierce battle with ISIS as they enter the city of Mosul. It's also being made as US backed Syrian forces make preparations to begin the isolation of the ISIS capital in Raqqa.""Additional resources will help sustain that positive momentum by boosting our support to partner forces and our intelligence efforts,"" Carter added in his statement.The new assets will aid a campaign that, come January 20, will be overseen by President-elect Donald Trump. Carter said in a new interview that aired Friday he would urge the incoming Trump administration ""finish the destruction of (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria."" ""Continue to strike them elsewhere where they arise, like Libya and Afghanistan,"" he told CBS' Norah O'Donnell.The defense secretary said in a statement that the money would also fund Obama's decision to maintain a larger troop presence of 8,400 in Afghanistan into 2017. The administration's original plan was to draw down that number to 5,500 troops.Those funds will allow the US to ""better support the Afghan government's strategy to secure its nation, and would help enhance Afghanistan's aviation capability,"" Carter said.The change was made as part of an effort to boost the Afghan military as it works to defeat an enduring Taliban insurgency. America's Afghan allies have only just begun to field an indigenous air force and the US continues to provide airstrikes in support. ""Swift passage of this plan will help the Department of Defense and our partners in the US Government and around the world protect this nation, and I urge Congress to support it,"" he added.Rep. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, issued a statement calling the request insufficient.""While we will review the request carefully, the amount still does not accommodate the increased pace of operations against ISIL,"" the Texas Republican said. ""It is time to put politics aside and provide our men and women in uniform the resources actually required, not just what is politically expedient.""The request also includes an additional $5.8 billion for the State Department and US Agency for International Development.
