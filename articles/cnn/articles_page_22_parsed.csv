But if you look closely, you can see why that's impossible. Many of the planes are missing engines, wing parts or cockpits. And that's why they call this place The Boneyard.'If only these planes could talk'It's a sprawling field where planes are stripped down for parts for resale or are 'regenerated' to be sold to soar again to a country allied with the US. The desert, with its low humidity and limited rainfall, is the ideal retirement home of sorts for aircraft packed with metal that could rust or corrode. There are more than 3,000 aircraft here -- the largest storage and preservation home of its kind in the world. The imagination roams as you walk under a hot sun looking up at the large planes parked here. It makes you wonder. Did this jet take incoming ground fire? Who was on the receiving end of bombs dropped out this bay?""If only these planes could talk ... What stories they could tell,"" retired Brigadier General Keith Connolly said, tapping the wing of an F4-C jet, the kind he flew in 176 missions in the Vietnam War. Connolly and several other US military veterans strolled the Boneyard with CNN. They may not see again the exact fighter jets or trainers they flew, but it was easy to feel the emotional pull of what the old planes -- and those who flew them -- meant to each other.   Lieut. Col. Ron Prunce rode with Connolly on many of those Vietnam War missions. During dozens of combat flights, the men sat back to back, jammed in the F4C. They now both live the Tuscon area, which is not that far from the massive Davis Monthan Air Force base that contains the Boneyard. Prunce grew emotional as he described seeing planes landing.""Not a day goes by that I don't look up and wish I was still up there,"" he said. His voice broke as he reflected on his aviation past and connection to the base.""Mentally,I think I could get into the F4 and we can go fly,"" Connolly said, standing next to his old cockpit buddy. ""I would have trouble remembering how to start it.""Charles Gebhardt flew a much larger plane: the B-52 bomber. He quickly recalled details like the ""108"" bombs it hauled, as he stood under the towering aircraft. He said he appreciated being able to walk around the B-52, a type of plane still in use by the military. ""This is not a museum,"" said retired Colonel Scott Hines, who flew a variety of aircraft here helping to train thousands of other pilots.""It's a special place,"" he added, admiring the rows and rows of aircraft neatly parked in order. The Bonyard, according to Hines, also represents the US military air service that powered America to victory in faraway lands.This visit here was a real-life version of a famous scene from one of the best movies ever made about soldiers after war. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" in 1946 featured down-on-his-luck vet Dana Andrews coming to terms with his life as he climbed into a bomber about to be chopped up for parts.These veterans, however, have lived full lives -- with serving their country at its heart. A graveyard of new lifeThe Boneyard is also still active helping the US military in current battles. The Marine Corps announced in June that it was going to resurrect 23 F/A 18 Hornets from the Boneyard to meet fleet requirements while a long-delayed F-35 fighter is eventually delivered. In a hangar, an F-16 was being ""regenerated,"" preparing to roar through the skies as part of expanding drone surveillance operations.Timothy Gray, deputy director of the Boneyard, said air power has been the signature element that has defined America in combat.For 70 years, this desert facility has been a final resting home for that power and still a source for valuable pieces for planes that live on to showcase American strength in the skies."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/pence-will-lead-trump-transition/index.html	"Christie, who began leading the presidential transition in the months before Trump's surprise victory, will now serve as a vice-chairman to the transition effort alongside Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Dr. Ben Carson and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, all of whom have been close confidantes of the billionaire during his presidential campaign.""I am proud to have run the pre-election phase of the transition team along with a thoroughly professional and dedicated team of people,"" Christie said in a statement.Trump said in a statement that Pence ""will build on the initial work"" Christie accomplished ""to help prepare a transformative government ready to lead from day one.""The mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington. Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation -- specifically jobs, security and opportunity,"" Trump said.The New York Times first reported the shakeup.Trump also announced a 16-member executive committee advising the transition efforts composed of Trump's children, some of his top political supporters and some of the top advisers to his campaign, including Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and campaign CEO Steve Bannon, who are both leading contenders to be named White House chief of staff. Trump also formalized the staffing of his transition team, including naming Sessions' chief of staff, Rick Dearborn, as executive director.Dearborn, a longtime Sessions aide, had been working on the transition for some time as a chief legislative affairs and policy official and was the organizer of Trump's campaign policy shop in Washington before that.  Trump's senior campaign staff will also transition to roles with the presidential transition organization, largely retaining the same roles they had with the campaign. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway will serve as senior adviser.Sources also told CNN top Pence staffers Marc Short and Nick Ayers will be heavily involved.Bridgegate scandal hurt Christie's standingPence, the governor of Indiana and a former member of Congress, is not the first vice president to lead transition efforts. Former Vice President Dick Cheney played a leading role in the transition leading up to George W. Bush's presidency.A Christie aide cited Cheney's role in explaining the staff shakeup.""This is what Bush did post election with Cheney. I saw tweets on demotion. That's the absolutely wrong take,"" the aide said.Pence was tapped for the post in part because of his deep and longstanding relationships with both Republicans on Capitol Hill and Republican governors. The role will complement Pence's efforts during the campaign in urging Republicans to rally around Trump's candidacy.The decision to backbench Christie comes as the New Jersey governor faces intensifying scrutiny over his role in lane closures of the George Washington Bridge after two of his former aides were convicted in the scandal. Christie has denied any wrongdoing, but federal authorities continue to probe his role in the incident.Several sources familiar with the process said the Bridgegate scandal and questions over Christie's loyalty to Trump were factors in the decision. While Christie was one of Trump's earliest prominent backers, he disappeared from the public eye after the surfacing of the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump bragged about groping women.Christie has also had a tenuous relationship with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has been intimately involved in transition efforts, stemming from Christie's prosecution of Kushner's father.'It's kind of chaos'Sessions had taken on much of the leadership of the planning effort, the sources said, despite Christie retaining the chairman title. While Christie had made frequent visits to D.C. early in the transition process, he was not seen in the office for weeks leading up to the election.While the nearly 100 staffers working on the transition had been toiling for weeks to prepare for a potential Trump administration, even those in the transition had not expected it to come to fruition. A source close to the transition said the staffers were networking last week, looking to line up post-election jobs as they prepared for a loss.That left the transition in a state of shock when Trump was elected. Though they had done the work to prepare a Trump administration, the mogul himself had not been actively involved and staff weren't immediately able to put plans into action.""I think it's kind of chaos. I don't think anyone was ready for what happened,"" the source said. ""They have a plan in place, it's just a question of whether Trump's OK with it.""The reshuffling of the transition and addition of many of the campaign's heavy hitters -- who had been detached from the transition as they worked toward the election -- comes the first day that Trump has held a meeting with his transition team.With Trump's engagement, the transition is expected to now be able to get going in earnest on planning his agenda, developing policy and vetting and naming Cabinet officials.The transition team compiled possible names for Cabinet positions in advance, but has added vetting staff in recent days to be able to begin the process of clearing those names ahead of what will likely be tense Senate confirmation hearings in the new administration, according to a source familiar with the process."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/trump-supporters-react-street-protests/index.html	"In the weeks leading up to his stunning win, Trump repeatedly warned the election would be ""rigged.""The real estate mogul urged supporters to monitor polling places in case of voter fraud and wouldn't say if he would accept the election results in the event of a loss. But the streets of some American cities have been teeming since Tuesday with thousands protesting Trump's triumph.And the reaction from the right is outrage. Julie Ponzi, senior editor of the conservative Web site American Greatness, wrote this week:  ""For these outbursts you can thank 50 years of piss-poor education in American civics, the devolution of our constitutional order in the face of a Progressive onslaught against its institutions, the hyperventilating, lying, unscrupulous press (and their willing accomplices in the NeverTrump right), and a handful of other factors I am probably forgetting right now but all contributing to this result: When significant numbers of people hysterically believe the country just elected Hitler, what do you expect?""The majority of the anti-Trump demonstrations have been peaceful. But a rally attended by more than 4,000 people in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday night quickly devolved into violence.After some in the crowd hurled objects at officers, vandalized businesses and damaged cars, the police on Twitter publicly declared the ""unlawful"" protest a ""riot"" due to ""extensive criminal and dangerous behavior.""A headline FoxNews.com declared: ""'Professional protesters' riot over Trump's election, attacking bystanders and vandalizing cars, property."" Another on the Infowars website blared: ""NON-VIOLENT, PEACEFUL PROTESTERS PUNCH TRUMP SUPPORTER: More evidence of the hypocrisy coming out of the left.""Paul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large of Infowars.com, tweeted: ""Remember when conservatives rioted, attacked people in the streets & smashed up shops when Obama won in 2008 & 2012? Me neither. #TrumpRiot."" A tweet from a woman with the handle ""Leah the Boss"" said: ""The people saying Trump scares children and families are smashing cars, setting fires, and blocking traffic. Words vs. Actions. #TrumpRiot.""Charlie Kirk, founder and executive director of conservative student movement Turning Point USA, wrote: ""When Obama was elected, we didn't cry and burn stuff down, we waited 8 years & protested in the ballot box. #TrumpRiot.""Kirk may have been referring to Oakland, California, where some protesters among the 1,000 who attended an anti-Trump march this week broke store windows, left graffiti on buildings and threw M-80 firecrackers, Molotov cocktails and bottles at police officers, authorities said.Eleven people were arrested in Oakland, including someone who had seven Molotov cocktails in his possession, police said. Some of those arrested are accused of assaulting police officers.Still, Rick Perlstein, a historian of modern conservatism, referred to a popular 1988 hip hop song by Public Enemy to describe the rhetorical line labeling the anti-Trump protests as ""riots"" -- ""Don't Believe the Hype.""""The protests have been 99% peaceful,"" he said via email. ""Pro-Trump forces have a profound vested political interest in depicting these events (which, from my own experience witnessing the march in Chicago, were maybe 95 percent anti-Trump and 5 percent pro-Clinton) as harbingers of chaos.""He added, ""What does a riot look like? Well, in Chicago after Martin Luther King was shot, two straight miles of Madison Street were burned out. This is not that.""In November 2012, however, Trump himself called for public insurrection when major news outlets began calling the race for President Barack Obama after the polls closed in California.""We can't let this happen,"" he tweeted then. ""We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!""On Thursday, still basking in the glory of his victory, the President-elect took to Twitter to address the widespread protests around the country against his presidential victory: ""Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!""Nine hours later, however, Trump abruptly reversed course with praise for those same protesters.""Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!"" he wrote. The public memory regarding American politics has always been short lived. In 2010, politicians reported slurs as well as threatening letters and phone calls from Tea Party supporters. Congressmen reported vandalism to their offices. One said he was spit on. Another said his brother's gas line was cut after a Tea Party member posted his address online.Tea Party leaders denounced the threats and deny involvement, pointing to fringe elements -- not Tea Party members, per se. The Southern Poverty Law Center at the time loosely lumped in Tea Party organizations with hate groups such as the Patriot movement -- which the center defined as ""militias and other extremist organizations that see the federal government as their enemy."" Davarian Baldwin, a history professor at Trinity College in Connecticut, said a rhetorical line was crafted during the run-up to the election that ""any and all frustrations and meanness"" by Trump supporters are acceptable because they represent the ""silent and suppressed white male working class.""The rhetoric can be traced to the ""racist and riotous rallies"" of the Tea Party movement, he said.Baldwin added, ""At the same time, in the same way that we have gone to great (lengths) to make sense of these 'left out'  Americans -- and honestly I don't think it is a reality of marginalization but a fear of the new America and a fear of losing power -- I think we also need to make sense, and not caricature, of the fear of deportations, deregulation, corporate callousness, licensed white nationalism that Trump has certainly given a voice to."""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-voters-dislike/index.html	It was an astonishing dilemma created by two campaigns whose dominant message was that their opponent was unfit.Those who agreed with both campaigns may have decided the election.This disillusioned group -- 14% of all voters -- broke heavily for Trump: 69% to 15%, according to exit polls. About 1 in 7 in this group voted for someone other than the major party candidates. Most were independent voters, with 38% Republicans and 18% Democrats. Had they sat out the election instead, Clinton would have won in a landslide with 53% of the vote to Trump's 44%. Further evidence of this disillusionment can perhaps be found in total voter turnout; while votes are still being counted, early indications are that turnout is on par with its lowest rate in 20 years. As both parties scour the exit polls for answers, they may have trouble distinguishing between fundamental shifts in the electorate and a strong distaste for both candidates. Voters who expressed negative feelings for both choices broke in Trump's favor. Of the 29% of voters who said neither candidate was honest, 45% voted for Trump compared to 40% for Clinton. Of those who had concerns or fears about both candidates, 49% voted for Trump while only 29% voted for Clinton.These findings suggest both the persistent negative attacks worked so well that some voters agreed with both campaigns. Voters who held their nose in the voting booth appear to have preferred someone new over someone who had been in politics for decades. Among this disaffected group, 44% favored change while only 13% prioritized experience.Beyond this group of voters, Clinton lagged behind other Democratic nominees in recent elections among groups that make up the party's base. She failed to make up that group with voters outside that core.Despite her prospect of being the first female president, her share of the female vote at 54% was no better than average. Her support among men -- at 41% -- fell nine points from 2008 and was the worst showing for a Democrat since her husband Bill Clinton ran for office in 1992, when he was able to win with the support of just 43% of voters because the general election was split three ways between him, Republican George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot.While it's no surprise that African-American voters were more enthusiastic for Obama than for Democrats in other recent elections, even Al Gore in his failed 2000 bid garnered 90% of the black vote compared to Clinton's 88%.Among younger voters, Clinton's appeal was closer to John Kerry's 54% than Obama's 66% in 2008. And union voters, long a bastion of the Democratic base, broke for Clinton by a 51% to 44% margin, the worst for a Democrat since Ronald Reagan's election in 1980.Her support among white voters -- at 37% -- was the lowest for any Democrat in the past seven elections. Her husband, Bill Clinton, garnered 39% of the white vote in 1992, while Obama got 43% in 2008.Clinton did better than average among college graduates, including hitting 45% among white voters with college degrees, the best showing for a Democrat since exit polling began in 1972. But she did worse with voters without a college degree -- 44% -- than any Democrat since her husband in 1992.Her appeal among white working-class voters was especially weak. Just 28% of white voters without degrees backed Clinton, again the worst performance for a Democrat in exit poll history.Trump, meanwhile, hit a new high among white evangelicals, carrying 81% of those votes, better than Mitt Romney, John McCain or George W. Bush.	Presidential election: How voters who found both candidates unfit broke	['Obama', 'Ross', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'McCain']	[]
7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/trump-tower-fortress/index.html	As Trump's top aides and leaders of the transition team headed to the new executive's New York headquarters Friday, they were met by jersey barriers and concrete blocks set up by police. And a large police presence was established on the block surrounding Trump Tower, limiting public access. Securing Trump Tower, in the heart of Manhattan, has become a challenge for New York police and the Secret Service. The entrance to Trump tower -- which sits near heavily trafficked luxury shops, including Tiffany & Co. and Gucci -- has become a special challenge. New York City zoning rules require that the space in front of Trump Tower remain open to the public, and Secret Service officials say they have told city officials they are trying to be mindful of any impact on business.Secret Service officials have raised the possibility of shutting down some lanes on Fifth Avenue -- or even shutting down the major thoroughfare entirely -- in talks with city law enforcement.Flight restrictions were put in place the moment Trump was declared the winner. Those restrictions apply to personal and general aircraft but not commercial flights.The press pool covering Trump was originally forced to wait across the street from the tower, though after clarifying with the New York Police Department, the media was allowed into the building's atrium Friday. The moves are routine for the next President of the United States, but they have coincided with heavy protests outside Trump's New York HQ and other, massive protests, in cities across the country.The fortifying of the President-elect's home is nothing new -- eight years ago, President Barack Obama's daily routine in Chicago was turned on its head after he was elected, with Secret Service even stepping in when he attempted to get a haircut at his favorite barbershop. Former President Bill Clinton's personal habits, which became a headache for the Secret Service, were famously parodied by Phil Hartman on Saturday Night Live two decades ago.

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/donald-trump-transition-drain-the-swamp/index.html	"Trump's transition team is staffed with long-time Washington experts and lobbyists from K Street, think tanks and political offices. It's a far cry from Trump's campaign, which ended only Tuesday night, and message that he would ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. He has advocated congressional term limits and proposed a ""five-point plan for ethics reform"" that included strengthening restrictions on lobbying, including five-year bans for members and staff of the executive branch and Congress from lobbying, and expanding the definition of lobbyist to prevent more revolving door activity.But he has so far fully embraced lobbyists within his transition, and all signs point to a heavy influence from longtime Washington Republican circles on his transition. And with Trump mostly skipping detailed policy proposals during his campaign, they can have a powerful impact on his agenda. Leaders in his transition include former Rep. Mike Rogers, former Reagan Attorney General and Heritage Foundation fellow Edwin Meese, former President of Heritage Edwin Feulner, former Bush administration official and lobbyist Christine Ciccone, former Dick Cheney adviser Ado Machida, former Senate Budget Committee staffer Eric Ueland and Sen. Jeff Sessions' former chief of staff Rick Dearborn. The effort is chaired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Trump counts former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sessions as close advisers.  Lower level staffers assigned with crafting different departments are also heavily drawn from K Street, the center of lobbying in Washington, and congressional staff, according to a staff organizational chart obtained by CNN.  Welcome to Trump's AmericaSources close to the operation say Sessions and the conservative Heritage Foundation have had a strong role in shaping the transition, in addition to staffers from the Bush administration, K Street and Capitol Hill.At a Heritage Foundation event Thursday, John Yoo, a Berkeley Law professor and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, got a warm reception from the crowd by cracking about the closeness.""I'm surprised there are so many people here because I thought everyone at Heritage was working over at transition headquarters,"" Yoo said on the panel about Trump's win. ""I asked the taxi cab driver to take me to Trump transition headquarters and he dropped me off here, instead.""The crowd let out an appreciative laugh. Insiders seek to sway Trump's policy directionTrump's policy is likely to be shaped largely by Republican stalwarts. Trump's policy positions throughout the election have been thinner than traditional campaigns, and he has made contradictory statements at times or has changed his state policy goals amid criticism. Meese told CNN that in general, the transition is going ""very well,"" and suspected the heavy involvement from key Heritage personnel shows that his think tank will have a strong influence on Trump. With Trump having less experience in some areas of policy, he will have to draw on others' expertise to craft his positions, Meese said.Early in the transition process, staff including Chairman Chris Christie held a series of meetings on K Street in Washington with different industry groups and key lobbyists. Sources in those meetings said the conversations were top level, but when asked about specific policies, the transition team signaled they would be open to input from K Street.In one financial services meeting, an attendee asked about Trump's past positions on reinstating Glass-Steagall, legislation that regulated banks. While the GOP platform called for reinstating Glass-Steagall and Trump's campaign manager at the time promoted it, Christie told the financial services lobbyists gathered that Trump is often open to changing his mind when he gets input from people with expertise. Trump meets with Obama at the White HouseLobbyists around Washington feel that the Trump administration could be heavily influenced by their input, as his campaign's policy positions were considerably thinner than Hillary Clinton's, and some of his promises could be open to interpretation.It also helps K Street that the Republican Party is far from united on policy. Establishment Republicans and allies of House Speaker Paul Ryan expect Ryan's ""Better Way"" agenda to drive much of Trump's administration, as Ryan has been working to promote it for years in the House and has even toured the country touting it.But social conservatives and farther right Republicans like the Heritage circle have seen hope in Trump's campaign promises and closeness with Sessions -- signaling hard-line positions on immigration and social issues. Fighting with K Street to fill jobsBoth sides are trying to influence his policy development and have representation on the transition team. Trump's Cabinet appointments could signal which way he's leaning. A senior aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence said that the former congressman would have a strong role in Trump's administration working with Congress and on legislation. But the aide also said that the transition would have to find people outside of Washington to staff the administration. ""This campaign was an outsider campaign. It would be foolish to go ahead and place a whole bunch of DC insiders into roles, right?"" the adviser said. ""So it'll be a mix.""Trump is also competing with lobbying shops themselves for some of the top talent in Washington. Having prepared mostly for a Hillary Clinton presidency, Washington had been hiring Democratic talent. After Trump's surprising win, K Street is also trying to staff up with the best GOP policy staff from Capitol Hill and around DC.  James Wallner, group vice president of research at Heritage, said he is encouraged that Trump will heed the recommendations of his organization for two reasons. One is that their ideals line up with many of his campaign promises, and two is that Heritage has made an effort to craft all of their recommendations in an easy-to-use manner.   ""You don't have time to digest a huge tome of material to have some moment of enlightenment to say, 'Oh I've figured out how to solve our health care problem.' You really need actionable type information that you can then process and make up your own mind on how to proceed and how to advise people to proceed,"" Wallner said. ""As long as President-elect Trump appoints people to this administration that are going to do things that are consistent with the promises he made while campaigning for this office that the American people clearly supported, then I'm optimistic about where we're going.""This post has been updated."
