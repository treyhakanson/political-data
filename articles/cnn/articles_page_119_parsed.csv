Here's the fact-check, as it happened:Can Trump appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton?VERDICT: TRUETrump said ""If I win, I am going to instruct my Attorney General to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.""The US Attorney General does have the authority to appoint a special prosecutor, according to Stephen Vladeck, a CNN legal contributor and  law professor with the University of Texas School of Law. Such action can be taken when the Attorney General determines that a criminal investigation is warranted and that an investigation by the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest or ""other extraordinary circumstance"" and that ""under the circumstances it would be in the public interest to appoint and outside Special Counsel.""Trump: I didn't say ""check out the sex tape""VERDICT: FALSETweeting at 5 a.m. amid allegations that he called former Miss Universe Alicia Machado ""Miss Piggy"" -- which Trump didn't deny - the Republican nominee urged his Twitter followers to ""check out [Machado's] sex tape and past.""Clinton: Trump has incited violence at ralliesVERDICT: TRUETrump has said himself that he wanted to ""punch him in the face,"" referring to a protester at his rally in February. And during another rally that month he urged: ""If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?""Trump: ""I would not have had our people in Iraq.""VERDICT: FALSETrump was on the record as supportive of the Iraq War as early as a month before Congress voted to authorize military force in Iraq and even soon after the invasion. He didn't express his outright opposition to the war until more than a year later, in an August 2004 interview.Trump: My opposition to the Iraq War ""has not been debunked""VERDICT: FALSETrump's claim that he opposed the Iraq War has been repeatedly debunked by fact-checkers. He offered support for the invasion a month before Congress voted to authorize military force. And he praised the invasion soon after it launched. He didn't express his outright opposition to the war until more than a year later.Trump: Clinton called TPP ""gold standard""VERDICT: TRUEClinton said in 2012, as Secretary of State, that the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal ""sets the gold standard in trade agreements."" The trade deal wasn't yet finalized, and Clinton has since said she opposes the deal.Trump claims Clinton campaign source of Obama photo in Somali garbVERDICT: IT'S COMPLICATEDTrump told Clinton that ""your campaign"" was responsible for circulating photos during the 2008 primaries depicting Barack Obama dressed in traditional Somali garb, a famous flare-up during the Democratic primary eight years ago.Well, sort of.The photo first appeared on the conservative aggregator, the Drudge Report, and was attributed at the time to sources within the Clinton campaign, though no names were offered.Clinton's campaign pointed the finger at a ""volunteer coordinator"" in Iowa who shared the photo, which was part of what Trump said was an effort to discredit Obama's heritage and legitimacy. It's not certain whether the volunteer was drawing a paycheck from her campaign and therefore an official Clinton actor.Clinton: Trump didn't apologize for insulting commentsVERDICT: TRUEClinton argued that Trump never apologized for attacking the parents of a slain US soldier; for calling a judge ""biased against him"" because of his Mexican heritage; for mocking a disabled reporter; and for questioning President Barack Obama's birthplace. Trump never apologized for any of those statements.Quick take: Obamacare costs riseVERDICT: TRUE, BUT MISLEADINGIt's true that some insurers are raising some of their plans' premiums by ""68%, 59%, 71%,"" but that's not the typical increase. Insurers have requested a rate hike of 9%, on average, for the benchmark Silver plan for 2017, up from 2% for this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.The vast majority of Obamacare enrollees, however, don't see those massive hikes. Some 85% of them receive federal subsidies that can lower their premium to less than 10% of their income.Trump: ""Many people saw the bombs all over the apartment""VERDICT: FALSETrump has repeatedly claimed that acquaintances of the San Bernardino terrorists saw ""bombs all over"" the shooter's apartment, as he did on Sunday night. There is no evidence to support that claim.Trump: Clinton didn't know what ""C"" meantVERDICT: TRUEClinton told the FBI during her interview over her use of a private email server that she did not know what the ""C"" marking meant on classified documents. ""C"" means ""Confidential.""Trump says US is giving $150 billion to IranVERDICT: FALSETrump argued that the United States is giving $150 billion to Iran, suggesting that the US is making a lump sum payment to the country as a term of the nuclear deal. The US did not make a multibillion-dollar lump sum payment to Iran, instead freeing up about $50 billion in previously unfrozen Iranian assets, according to a White House estimate."

That source said the two parties had agreed among themselves before the debate that only family would sit in the family box.The source described a tense scene playing out minutes before the debate began. As organizers waited for Trump's motorcade to arrive, an aide on the commission got wind that his campaign wanted Bill Clinton's accusers to be in the family box. Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and a woman, Kathy Shelton, whose rapist was defended by Hillary Clinton as a young lawyer, appeared with Trump immediately before the debate at an event that was livestreamed on the Republican nominee's Facebook page. Commission co-chair Frank Fahrenkopf went to the Trump staff room, knocked on the door and told the staff that the women could not join Trump's family in their box. Fahrenkopf told them that if they tried to, security guards would prevent them from entering the box, according to the source.The idea was so closely held in Trump world that the staffers in the room, including a Trump lawyer, didn't know what the Trump team was planning for the women.At that point, the debate commission co-chairs had to go on stage to welcome the audience. The Trump motorcade had not yet arrived, but Fahrenkopf instructed aides to tell the entourage when it arrived that the women would not sit with the family.Later, the Trump team tried to justify the move by saying that billionaire Mark Cuban, a Trump antagonist, was allowed to sit in the front row during the first debate in September -- though that's not the same as the family box.News of the thwarted plan was first reported by The Washington Post. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway did not dispute the story during an interview Monday with CBS ""This Morning,"" but she said the family box was actually a ""VIP box,"" and that the team had originally thought that the campaigns could choose who sat in those boxes.""In the Clinton box they invited Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and she is not a family member,"" Conway said. McCaskill, too, was denied a seat in the family box.""But they threatened to have security remove the women. I thought that was unfortunate because Mark Cuban got to sit where he wanted to sit,"" she said in a reference to Cuban's front-row seat at the previous debate."

That man was convicted of a lesser charge and served 10 months in jail. All four women attended the presidential debate in St. Louis, as is Bill Clinton.Trump's Facebook Live broadcast came after two days of sharp criticism of the Republican nominee by many in his own party after The Washington Post discovered 11-year-old lewd and sexually aggressive comments captured behind the scenes of a TV interview. Some Republicans have even called on Trump to abandon his run, although Trump has pledged to carry on.The Clinton campaign huddled in their office Sunday evening before the debate, discussing Trump's decision to invite the women to the debate. Two aides acknowledged to CNN they didn't expect this -- in all their planning and were jarred by the news.A scorched earth debate, on The Daily David ChalianHillary Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri responded moments after news of the live streaming video broke, saying,""We're not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom."" ""Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn't change that. If Donald Trump doesn't see that, that's his loss. As always, she's prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.""Jones is a former Arkansas state employee who sued Clinton in 1994 for sexual harassment. When subpoenaed in relation to the Jones case, Broaddrick filed an affidavit denying she was assaulted. She later changed her story and in 1999 accused Bill Clinton of rape in the late 1970s. Independent Counsel Ken Starr's team thoroughly investigated her claim and noted in his exhaustive Whitewater Report that Broaddrick had changed her story.Congressional Republicans at the time did not think she was credible and she was not called to testify in Clinton's impeachment trial. ""I'm here to support Mr. Trump because he's going to make America great again ... I think they should all look at the fact that he's a good person and he's not what other people say he's being, like Hillary,"" Jones said. Bill Clinton's alleged sexual misconduct: Who you need to know""Actions speak louder than words,"" Broaddrick said. ""Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don't think there's any comparison.""Trump did respond to any questions at the event with the Clinton accusers, although reporters shouted questions to him about the newly released video in which he brags about being able to be sexually aggressive with women because of his stardom.""Mr. Trump does your star power allow you to touch women without their consent?"" a reporter shouted.Not long after Trump's appearance with her husband's accusers, Hillary Clinton tweeted a looped video of snippet from Michelle Obama's Democratic National Convention speech: ""When they go low, we go high."""

Eligible citizens who fail to register will be unable to case a ballot in November.""Florida voters, however, face a daunting and, indeed, life threatening obstacle to registering to vote in the form of Hurricane Matthew,"" lawyer Marc Elias argued court papers, ""a massive and dangerous weather event that has threatened Florida with substantial damage and loss of life.""Last Thursday, Gov. Rick Scott told reporters he didn't ""intend to make changes,"" saying ""people have had time to register.""  In court papers, Elias, who serves at the general counsel for the Clinton campaign, argued that Scott, a Republican, ""unambiguously ordered"" Florida citizens to evacuate, and now some voters have been prevented from being able to register which might decrease ""the overall likelihood"" that the party will be successful in helping to elect Democrats.He argued that if the court does not step in ""there is a strong likelihood that the right to vote of thousands of Floridians"" would be burdened. He said a failure to extend registration would impose a ""disproportionate burden"" on the voting rights of minority voters in the storm affected areas.Election law expert Richard L. Hasen of the University of California, Irvine School of Law questioned whether the court would grant relief. ""To begin with,"" Hasen wrote on his Election Law Blog, ""it is not clear if this will be seen as violating equal protection"" or the Voting Rights Act. He said a ""further complication"" is that it is not clear if Florida law allows the extension.The hurricane hit Florida last Thursday and Friday, with at times 130 mile per hour winds. Scott deployed the national guard and more than 1 million residents lost power.Elias noted that South Carolina, also a target of the storm, extended its mail-in voter registration deadline."

Trump's threat -- which he has made before on the campaign trail -- is extraordinary even by the standard of the vitriolic 2016 campaign.Clinton responded first by calling Trump's comments about her emails false, then said, ""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.""Trump, as if continuing her sentence, added: ""Because you'd be in jail.""After the debate, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta dismissed the remark, telling CNN's Brianna Keilar that Trump would never get the chance to follow through. ""Fortunately, he's not in charge of the laws of the country and never will be,"" Podesta said.Asked about the remarks, Trump campaign chief Kellyanne Conway said the candidate was taking his cues from angry supporters.""Donald Trump is channeling the frustration of a lot of Americans he hears from,"" Conway said, adding that the anger stems from what some voters perceive to be ""different set of rules for this woman, as goes her emails.""Conway further elaborated in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show the morning after the debate. ""It was a quip,"" she said of Trump's threat that Clinton would be in jail if he were president. ""I saw in NBC's reporting it was called a quip, so I'll go with NBC on it.""Trump's campaign manager also repeated her assertion that Trump's call for another investigation of Clinton reflected voters' frustration. ""As for the special prosecutor, I think that's Donald Trump channeling the frustration he hears from thousands of voters on the stump every day. They're very frustrated that she has a different set of rules for her.""Earlier in the evening on Sunday, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, a Republican who worked for President George W. Bush, criticized Trump.""Winning candidates don't threaten to put opponents in jail,"" he tweeted. ""Presidents don't threaten prosecution of individuals. Trump is wrong on this.""But the sharpest attack came from former Attorney General Eric Holder, who compared Trump's threat to actions taken by President Richard Nixon at the height of the Watergate scandal.""So @realDonaldTrump will ORDER his AG to take certain actions,"" Holder tweeted. ""When Nixon tried that his AG courageously resigned. Trump is dangerous/unfit.""Holder was referencing one of the darkest episodes of the Nixon presidency. In what is now commonly referred to as the ""Saturday Night Massacre,"" Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate burglary.Richardson resigned rather than follow the President's request. When Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus was asked to do the same, he too refused and left the administration. Nixon ended up outsourcing the deed to Robert Bork, who formally fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox.News broke on the morning of Sunday, October 21, 1973. Less than a year later, on August 9, 1974, Nixon resigned in disgrace."	Donald Trump threatens to jail Hillary Clinton	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Nixon']	[]

Chelsea Clinton slipped into the booth later, avoiding potentially awkward eye contact with her friend, Ivanka Trump.America collectively clutched its pearls when the candidates came out and didn't shake hands.You have two options in a town hall debate: move constantly, like a shark......or sit awkwardly on a bar stool.Trump mostly loomed in the background. The nominees gave us a preview of our family Thanksgivings next month and just talked over each other.They tuckered themselves out talking with their outside voices.Since these nominees are hip with the youth, Hillary Clinton embodied the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯And Trump embodied ""SMH."" Clinton also auditioned for the role of Jim on next fall's new sitcom ""The (Oval) Office.""Donald Trump broke the laws of physics and was in two places at once.Clinton smiled when Trump talked about her emails and told her she should be in jail, as if to say, ""Oh, you.""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/trump-pence-syria-disagreement/index.html	"""He and I haven't spoken, and he and I disagree,"" Trump said in response to a question about whether he backs the possible use of military force against the Assad regime in Syria as staked out by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, with whom he shares the ticket, at the vice presidential debate Tuesday.Trump at Sunday night's presidential town hall was asked how he would deal with the ongoing humanitarian crisis triggered by the Syrian regime's bombing of Aleppo, a rebel stronghold, which it's doing in cooperation with Russia. RELATED: Pence goes further than Trump on Syria military actionIn Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Pence said he felt the US ought to establish safe zones and meet Russian ""provocations"" with strength, backing the use of military force if necessary. Pence made no immediate public reference to their foreign policy disconnect. At the debate's end, Pence tweeted ""congrats to my running mate @realDonaldTrump on a big debate win! Proud to stand with you as we #MAGA."" Pence made no immediate public reference to their foreign policy disconnect. At the debate's end, Pence tweeted ""congrats to my running mate @realDonaldTrump on a big debate win! Proud to stand with you as we #MAGA.""Pence on Monday insisted that he and Trump stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" on Syria. He told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" that debate moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC News ""misrepresented"" his position.""I think the way she framed that was to suggest that I had implied we ought to use military power to achieve regime change,"" Pence said. ""I simply never said that.""Pence said he and Trump agree on the establishment of safe zones in Syria to address the country's humanitarian crisis. He said that could include using military power to secure those zones.Asked by Camerota why Trump said Monday night that he had not spoken with Pence about the issue, Pence said his running made said they ""hadn't spoken specifically"" about what Raddatz asked.The question to Trump, however, was how he would respond to the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, and in the vice presidential debate, Pence cast his answer as a response to humanitarian concerns about the besieged Syria city.The US ""should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo,"" Pence said.On Sunday night, Trump indicated that he didn't think that Russia was part of the problem in the war-torn country. Instead, he said that Russia is fighting ISIS, a conclusion that is not shared by US intelligence agencies, the Obama administration or US allies.""Russia is killing ISIS,"" Trump said, making similar comments about the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""Syria is fighting ISIS.""Democrat Hillary Clinton countered on Sunday that ""Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS, Russia is interested in keeping Assad in power.""Clinton said at the debate, at Washington University in St. Louis, that she advocates creating a no-fly zone that would offer safety to Syrians fleeing the violence. She added, ""We need some leverage with the Russians, because they're not going to come to the table.""RELATED: Kerry calls for probe of Russian, Syrian 'war crimes'Secretary of State John Kerry called on Friday for war crimes investigations against Russia and Syria for their bombing of Aleppo. On Saturday, Russia vetoed a United Nations resolution calling for a halt in air attacks on Aleppo.Clinton said at the debate that she supported ""the effort to investigate war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians"" in Aleppo. Trump, for his part, has held a number of different positions on Syria, suggesting in September 2015 on CBS that the US should wait out the conflict in Syria and let ISIS fight Assad's government, after which the US could ""pick up the remnants.""In a March 2016 debate, he seemed to advocate sending tens of thousands of US troops to battle ISIS, saying, ""We really have no choice, we have to knock out ISIS."" He added that, ""I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000."" Trump has also said that he would support the creation of a safe zone inside Syria, but only financially. He has proposed that US allies including the Gulf States do the work of creating the safe zone."	Trump dismisses running mate Pence's Syria view	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	['creation']

Jesse Lehrich tweeted, ""hey, @realDonaldTrump -- regarding your claim that Captain Khan would be alive if you were president: go fuck yourself. #debate""Lehrich, who has been actively tweeting about the debate, later apologized about his tweet, but didn't delete it. He wrote, ""I want to apologize for the clearly inappropriate nature and language of this personal tweet.

Trump said during the debate: ""First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero. If I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster.

Jeff Davis said, adding that the guided-missile destroyer deployed ""onboard defensive measures"" and was undamaged.But the Houthis -- a minority Shia group that has taken control of much of Yemen, including the capital -- denied Monday that its forces had targeted the warship.An official from the Houthi-controlled military said the reports were aimed at covering up a ""heinous"" Saudi-led coalition airstrike on a wake Saturday in the capital, Sanaa, that officials said killed at least 155 people, the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency reported. ""Reports that allege that Yemeni rockets targeted ships off the Yemeni (coast) are baseless,"" the official said. The US warship was in international waters more than 12 nautical miles (22 km) offshore, in the southern end of the Red Sea, north of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, according to a defense official.The missiles were launched within 60 minutes of each other, Davis said.""We assess the missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. The United States remains committed to ensuring freedom of navigation everywhere in the world, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our ships and our service members,"" he said.Airstrike on wakeWashington has backed a Saudi-led coalition fighting to prevent Houthi rebels allied with Iran and forces loyal to Yemen's deposed President Ali Abdullah Saleh from taking power in Yemen. But on Saturday the US said it was reevaluating its support after the deadly wake airstrike.The Saudi-led coalition had earlier denied accusations that it was responsible for the attack and said it would ""immediately investigate"" reports that its warplanes were behind the airstrikes, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.How war broke outThe Saudi-led coalition, involving several Arab countries, began a military campaign in Yemen in March 2015 after Houthis  drove out the US-backed government, led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and took over Sanaa.The crisis quickly escalated into a multisided war, which allowed al Qaeda and ISIS -- other enemies of the Houthis -- to grow stronger amid the chaos.The conflict has killed an estimated 10,000 Yemenis and left millions in need of aid, according to the United Nations.Since peace talks in Kuwait failed in August, the coalition has intensified airstrikes, despite vocal criticism from rights groups that the bombardments have been indiscriminate and could constitute war crimes. The attacks have often hit civilian targets with devastating results.Arms dealThe United States has come under increasing pressure to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia.The US Senate last month rejected a bipartisan proposal to block a pending $1.15 billion United States arms sale to Riyadh.Critics of the military deal, which was approved by the Obama administration, complained it could further drag the US into the war in Yemen and contribute to the worsening humanitarian crisis there.Civilian casualties are only part of the crisis. Yemen's UNICEF office has reported that nearly 10,000 children younger than 5 died from preventable diseases there during the past year.Some 1.5 million children are currently malnourished in Yemen, and 370,000 of them suffer from severe acute malnutrition, according to the charity.Yemen's economic infrastructure has also been ravaged by war. At least 430 factories and companies were destroyed by coalition airstrikes since the start of the conflict, according to Ahmed Bahri, political chief of the Sanaa-based Haq Party."
