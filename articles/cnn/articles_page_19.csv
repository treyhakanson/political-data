""I find Harry Reid's public comments and insults about Donald Trump and other Republicans to be beyond the pale. They're incredibly disappointing. Talk about not wanting my children to listen to somebody,"" Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said on ""Fox News Sunday.""Then, she added: ""He should be very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense. He thinks -- he thinks he's just being some kind of political pundit there, but I would say be very careful about the way you characterize it."" Conway's reference to ""a legal sense"" led host Chris Wallace to follow up, pressing Conway on whether she was suggesting Trump might sue Reid. ""No, I'm not suggesting that at all,"" Conway said. ""I'm calling for responsibility and maturity and decency for somebody who has held one of the highest positions in our government, in a country of more than 300 million people."" Conway, Trump's campaign manager, noted that Reid is retiring and said she is ""really pleased as are many Americans that he won't be the Senate minority leader much longer."" Reid's office swung back in a statement issued by an aide Sunday, pointing to Conway's comments as a ""threat of legal action."" ""It took only five days for President-elect Trump to try to silence his critics with the threat of legal action. This should shock and concern all Americans,"" said Adam Jentleson, Reid's deputy chief of staff in the statement. ""Trump has always used threats and intimidation to silence his critics. Now he wants to silence a discussion of the acts of hate and threat of violence being committed in his name across the country,"" he said."	Kellyanne Conway, Harry Reid trade barbs over Donald Trump

Donald Trump's not planning on that,"" Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""""I think we should put people's minds at ease: That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border. We think that's first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue, we've got to know who's coming and going into the country -- we've got to secure the border,"" he added.Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl in a ""60 Minutes"" interview set to air Sunday night that he still plans to build a US-Mexico border wall.And asked if he'd accept a fence instead of a wall, Trump said: ""For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction."" Trump added that ""there could be some fencing.""He did not, though, repeat his campaign promise to deport all undocumented immigrants. He pledged to focus first on deporting those who have committed crimes within the United States -- ""gang members, drug dealers ... probably two million, it could even be three million"" -- and worry about others later.""After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about who are terrific people,"" Trump said. Ryan deflected questions about whether he'd support Trump's calls to slap hefty tariffs on imports from countries like Mexico.Instead, Ryan said, he supports tax reforms to address the same challenges ""without any adverse effects -- without any collateral damage to the economy.""The House speaker also said he is on board with Trump's call to keep some elements of President Barack Obama's signature health care law.But he won't commit to mandating insurance coverage of birth control for women at no cost.""Obamacare is failing. It must be replaced. We're going to do that. We're excited about it ... We can fix what is broken in health care without breaking what is working in health care,"" Ryan said.The Wisconsin Republican said he agrees with Trump's comment to CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that Obamacare's laws against barring those with pre-existing conditions from receiving coverage and allowing those up to age 26 to remain on their parents' insurance can stay in place even as the GOP pushes to repeal Obamacare.Ryan said the GOP plans to push refundable tax credits that would allow low-income Americans to essentially use those tax credits as vouchers to buy insurance, rather than receiving government-funded Medicaid.He demurred when Tapper asked whether insurers would be required to cover birth control at no cost to women -- a primary feature of Obamacare -- by saying he wasn't going to discuss ""nitty gritty"" details/Pressed by Tapper, Ryan said: ""I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn't even been drafted yet."""

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/13/politics/donald-trump-lessons/index.html	"In the aftermath of his improbable victory and on the cusp of a presidency fueled by a movement that could signal a generational realignment in American politics, the country emerges deeply divided -- and with so many feeling that there are further reckonings to come.As sure as the last 16 months put a relentless focus on the candidates, the 2016 election also held up a mirror to society at large. For all his idiosyncrasies, Trump had one thing very much in common with other outsized cultural figures: the ability to provoke and elicit emphatic, emotional reactions to his every utterance.In awarding Trump the presidency, Americans revealed themselves. Here are a few things we learned.1. The U.S. is part of the global community, like it or not When Trump called himself ""Mr. Brexit,"" too many of us laughed.But whether or not he truly saw his triumph coming -- reporting suggests even his closest aides were surprised -- the reality is that a rising tide of resurgent nationalism from Western Europe, triggered in part by economic stagnation, has reached our shores.It was apparent throughout the campaign. British right wing leader Nigel Farage campaigned in the US and his ideological allies in France, Germany, Hungary and Greece all applauded the election results. So when the electoral wave crashed on Tuesday, it delivered a new president-elect and, perhaps more instructively, a lesson that this country is as susceptible to the broader sweep of history as any other.It was an unprecedented ending to a familiar story.In the 1930s, Father Coughlin and Charles Lindbergh peddled the right-wing extremism and xenophobia that was metastasizing overseas. George Wallace turned backlash to the Civil Rights movement into political profit in the 1960s. Decades later, Trump seized on the anger of a troubled electorate, telling them as he accepted the Republican presidential nomination, ""I alone can fix it.""On Tuesday, tens of millions of voters decided to give him the chance.2. Our politics are messier than we thoughtLeft and right, red and blue -- some of our most fundamental understandings about American political life were smashed by Trump and his winning campaign.In viewing the election through the usual prism, with many analysts mourning about the absence of ""serious"" issues, we largely missed out on one of the most elemental debates in modern political history.   This campaign was flush with serious, sweeping clashes over the future. Americans wrestled for nearly two years over how they envisioned our society as it moves deeper into the 21st century. Whites, in particular, were asked to contend with an ebbing majority.From Trump, we learned that on this new, high stakes table, the transgressions that sunk so many past political hopefuls have lost their perceived currency. He showed us this over and again, breaking taboos gutting sacred cows at a breakneck pace. He told Republicans that President George W. Bush did not ""keep us safe,"" as Jeb Bush insisted. And, though his lie about opposing it was quickly exposed, he argued openly that invading Iraq in 2003 was a terrible mistake.On abortion? Trump hemmed and hawed. On entitlement reforms? Nope! Trump dumped on Paul Ryan, not for the last time, when he pledged not to mess with social security or Medicare.Often though, his conservative heresies and challenges to policy norms were conflated with darker claims, which regularly took the form of attacks on broader cultural standards. As his primary rivals fell by the wayside, Trump racked up higher percentages of support -- breaking any supposed ""ceiling."" By Election Day, he had alienated and scorned most of the establishment leaders in his party.It didn't matter.Politics are messy. It's a deeply personal business. No one is promised anything and if voters don't believe that candidates or officials or party bigwigs have their back in a fundamental way, the facade of deference will fall away -- and fast.3. We don't know one another wellIn the weeks ahead of Election Day, Trump allies and staff insisted that their candidate would be bolstered by ""hidden"" and ""undercover"" voters.For reporters who spent the better part of two years traveling the country, meeting with Trump supporters at campaign events and often in more private settings, the argument felt like weak spin. This was not a shy group. To Americans who viewed Trump primarily in the context of televised rallies, the idea of his laying claim to a ""silent"" majority seemed to border on the absurd.But the misunderstanding runs much deeper -- and traces back much further.Whether or not Trump supporters actually feared sharing their loyalties with pollsters -- or even friends and family -- the fact remains: division in America, in 2016, is not limited to simple policy disagreements. Social media is the easy scapegoat. The loudest voices prevail. People retreat into bias-confirming bubbles. We know this. Americans have insulated themselves from their neighbors' ideas for hundreds of years -- from the partisan press to cable news, in gated communities and through decades of diminished civic engagement.After President Obama first took office in 2009, his new attorney general, Eric Holder, called us a ""nation of cowards.""Holder was talking about race relations, and while he conceded that the issue was common fodder in high-handed political debate, ""we, average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about race."" As the Trump presidency approaches, it's hard not to think of all things that make headlines, but not conversation.4. By choice or by design, millions of Americans never cast a vote  More than 80 million people watched the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump. Add in the millions who viewed it online and at bars or parties, and the number might have reached nine digits.And yet, when the time came for choosing, turnout at the polls was unimpressive -- its lowest since 1996.An estimated 55% of voting age Americans cast a ballot in 2016. Though some tabulations have yet to come in, that's nearly 10 points lower than in 2008, a deficit of approximately 18 million votes. Trump's total was not only less than Clinton's, but looks like a 20-year low for election winners.How is it possible?To start, a number of states made it more difficult to vote or vote early. In North Carolina, where the state legislature openly sought ways to drive down minority turnout, raw totals crept up a bit from 2012 but basically flatlined as a percentage of the voting population.  In October, a Trump campaign official told Bloomberg that operatives had made ""voter suppression"" a focus of their late-stage efforts, using online ads to target Clinton's base. The goal was not win them over but to keep them home on Election Day.But as many progressive activists and liberals will tell you -- along with a growing number of establishment Democrats -- Clinton too made some fundamental miscalculations. Her campaign failed to activate the coalition that twice delivered Obama resounding electoral victories. African Americans did not turnout for her in the same numbers as for the president, and white women ultimately broke for Trump.The siren song of change, which had inspired so many Democrats to the polls in 2008 and 2012, played on 2016, but this time its tune drew a different cohort.In the final telling, this historic and deeply consequential election might be remembered as much for those who voted as those who did not -- by choice or design.And in their silence, they spoke volumes.5. We're not in a 'post-truth era' -- but it's on the horizonTrump will enter the White House as one of the most prolific prevaricators in American political history.Fact-checkers routinely called out his unending stream of distortions, falsehoods and bogus provocations. In most cases, their work shouldn't have been necessary. But Trump made an art of shamelessness. He assailed entire races and ethnic groups, then turned around and said they loved him.When the backlash grew to a point of concern? Trump denied it ever happened.But the most prevalent defense, at least at the start, was that Trump simply ""told it like it is."" If you couldn't deal with that, then the onus was on you.By the time he introduced his plan to ban Muslim immigration into the US in early December, the Trump train had left the station. Trump that night told a certain group of people a particular thing they desperately wanted to hear -- that it was not their fault, that complex issues had a simple problem.And that it would cost them next to nothing to have him fix it.6. Social media can trump big donor moneyWhen the early GOP favorites were pre-campaigning for big donors' affections and Clinton was filling her own war chest, two candidates were busy building something else: movements.And they did it, primarily, on social media.Bernie Sanders supporters organized around a now famous hashtag, #feelthebern, and made use of forums and tools like reddit, WhatsApp and Slack to bring the grassroots together.Meanwhile, Trump's Twitter account emerged as the season's most potent communications platform — more influential than Jeb Bush's Super Pac ""shock and awe"" millions or anything the Koch Brothers' could offer, or threaten to withhold.""The fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where (my opponents were) spending much more money than I spent,"" the president-elect said in a post-election interview with 60 Minutes. ""I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.""The influence of money in politics remains very real, especially as you look further down the ballot, but in the presidential and national political game, the traditional powers must now contend with a new reality — that simply engaging online and via social networks is not enough.In the coming years, winning candidates and movements will need to make persuasive, eye-catching cases to voters. The asymmetric tactics of 2016's big winners could soon be the norm.7. The fundamentals of US democratic pluralism are strong -- but not invulnerableHe refused to say he would accept the results of the election even his own campaign expected him to lose. He told his supporters the vote would be rigged and urged them to ""go down to certain areas"" in Pennsylvania to keep an eye on voters.And that was Trump's idea of subtlety.More often, the Republican presidential nominee openly dismissed any pretense of respect for some very basic pluralistic ideals. Mexicans were ""rapists"" and Muslims weren't doing enough to police the would-be terrorists in their communities.He attacked women in sexist terms and strained to condemn anti-Semitic behavior by his more radical supporters.It was jarring, but in the final account, instructive. Trump voters are not, as some opponents would suggest, a band of racists. But to vote for him, one had to look past the elements of racism, misogyny and Islamophobia that flared up in his campaign.Trump largely dispensed with the traditional dog whistles of the right. For most of the campaign, he seemed to revel in a kind of freedom and iconoclasm. ""Political correctness"" and ""identity politics"" were profanities, not complex questions about how we speak to one another.This feeds into the big question that confronts us now -- and the next lesson to be learned.If political campaigns are the enemy of nuance, then governing must be its friend. Trump has signaled an interest in forging unity from historic division. Now is his chance. Will he take it?"	Election 2016: What Donald Trump taught us about ourselves

Farage later posted a picture on Facebook and Twitter of him with Trump, who gives a thumbs-up for the camera.""It was a great honour to spend time with Donald Trump today.

Many say his statements disqualify him from leading such a large and diverse nation, and fear that his words may embolden racists and bigots. Others point to his lack of political experience. However, nearly all of the protesters are enraged that he beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton despite losing to her in the popular vote.Though there have been some instances of violence, the protests have been largely peaceful, with participants raising signs calling for love, respect and a new president-elect.For his part, Trump called the participants ""professional protesters, incited by the media"" before commending them for their ""passion.""CNN has compiled a collection of some of the protesters' most creative and expressive signs: The protesters are drawing attention to a wide range of issues from women's rights to the acceptance of refugees. However, one overarching theme runs through most of the civic actions: love and acceptance of all people, regardless of race, religion, sexuality or citizenship status.The protesters believe that President-elect Trump has built his campaign largely on intolerance and hate. As such, many believe he is unfit to lead the United States.Many participants have taken exception to Trump's vow to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally and to build a wall along the border with Mexico to keep them out.Arab- and Muslim-Americans are particularly angry at the President-elect for his disparaging remarks about Muslims, who he says should be forced to register with the government and be barred from entering the country.A popular protest sign is an image of Trump emblazoned with the word ""nope,"" which is a play on the popular ""hope"" poster that was used during President Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.The slogan ""Love trumps hate"" can be seen on protest signs throughout the country. Clinton reiterated this in her concession speech Wednesday, saying, ""Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted."" Many protesters are angry with the President-elect for offensive comments that he has made about women, as well as his stance on abortion rights. They also point to the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct levied against Trump that they say should disqualify him from office.The President-elect's previously stated position on preventing refugees from entering the United States has also raised the ire of protesters, who believe the country is morally obligated to resettle families escaping foreign wars and persecution.Many of the protesters have taken a note from Britain's playbook in response to Brexit by wearing safety pins as a symbol of solidarity with minorities. Most of all, protesters are annoyed that Donald Trump will assume the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Clinton, 47.3% to 47.8%, respectively. Many are calling for the Electoral College, which granted him the victory, to be abolished."	Trump protesters voice anger, call for new president
7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/13/politics/donald-trump-reince-priebus-white-house-chief-of-staff/index.html	"""Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again,"" Trump said in the release.It's an unusual arrangement that could create two power centers in the new White House, one around the Republican establishment and one connected to the far right and more controversial wing of conservatism. The campaign statement, which listed Bannon's role first, referred to the two men as ""equal partners.""""Bannon and Priebus will continue the effective leadership team they formed during the campaign, working as equal partners to transform the federal government, making it much more efficient, effective and productive,"" it said.The dynamic will continue the structure of the two men's roles in the campaign, with Priebus and Bannon working as partners, but with very different Trump constituencies to manage. Both Priebus and Bannon were highly involved with working out the arrangement, a source familiar with the decision said.Bannon represents bare-knuckle style politics seen as appealing to Trump's most inflammatory instincts, and his initial hiring prompted a raft of criticism from Democrats accusing Trump of embracing the ""alt right,"" an ideology closely associated with white nationalism, anti-Semitism and misogyny.Priebus should be a reassuring presence to establishment Republicans still uncertain about what a Trump White House will look like. The pick signals that Trump may look to build bridges in Washington and keep continuity with longtime Republican agendas, as opposed to make waves from the beginning.Priebus is among the longest serving chairmen of the Republican Party, and has generally been popular amid different factions within the party. He is largely credited with building the ground game that elected Trump and with helping to unite his party after a divisive primary that resulted in many Republicans shunning Trump's nomination.The news of Priebus' hiring was first reported by Politico.Trump's choice for chief of staff was believed to come down to Priebus and Bannon. In a repeat of the tumultuous process that led Trump to tap Indiana Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running-mate, GOP officials pressed the President-elect to go with Priebus for the chief of staff job.House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Trump on Thursday to pick Priebus, a source told CNN on Friday. Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, has also said privately he is supportive of that decision.After the announcement, a spokesman for Ryan said the speaker was pleased by the decision.""The speaker is very happy for his friend and ready to get to work,"" said Doug Andres, his spokesman.Priebus has served as a negotiator between the party and Trump. When Ryan did not initially endorse Trump, Priebus organized meetings and helped diffuse tension between the two when Ryan criticized Trump and Trump hit back.Sources say Priebus and Trump have grown very close over the course of the campaign. Priebus had a leadership role in Trump's debate prep and traveled with him in the latter days of the campaign. Many of the RNC's top operatives were installed in Trump Tower to work closely with the campaign.During the campaign, Trump often said he would look to politicians to help him govern, including his selection of Pence -- another Ryan friend and ally -- as vice president. But he also ran a campaign as an outsider, saying he would ""drain the swamp"" of Washington.Priebus earned Trump's trust in the final months of the campaign, as he steered the RNC's resources behind Trump's candidacy despite Republican officials urging Priebus to abandon Trump and instead help down-ballot candidates.As Trump's candidacy was engulfed in the controversy stemming from a 2005 tape in which he boasted about being able to grope and kiss women without their consent, and as sexual assault allegations surfaced the next week, Priebus stood fast behind Trump and worked to salvage his campaign.Trump's debate over the selection demonstrated how he was once again being pulled between a more pragmatic selection with a pick who will enable his outsider persona and bellicose instincts.On Sunday night the Bannon appointment drew scorn from the office of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. ""President-elect Trump's choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide signals that white supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House,"" said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for the Nevada Democrat, who is retiring from Congress. And Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted, ""We at @ADL_National oppose the appt of Steve Bannon to sr role at @WhiteHouse bc he & his alt-right are so hostile to core American values"".But Trump ran an outsider campaign and Bannon's hiring signals an intention to keep the insurgent sentiment that propelled his campaign close.Bannon is a former Navy officer and Goldman Sachs investment banker and has been an executive in the right-wing media for years. His website Briebart News, which Bannon has been associated with since its start in 2007, has been vehemently pro-Trump throughout his presidential campaign, and is also known for pushing nationalist policy positions, as well as conspiracy theories, and has been criticized as being racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. Bannon's wife has also accused Bannon himself in court documents of making anti-Semitic comments. He joined Trump's campaign in August alongside new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, after Paul Manafort was fired as campaign manager. While pundits worried that Bannon's hiring would hasten Trump going way off-message, he had some of his most disciplined weeks of his campaign under Bannon and Conway's leadership, though it was almost derailed by a hot mic video that caught Trump bragging of sexually violent and aggressive behavior toward women.A potential White House role for Conway is a possibility. A Trump source says the President-elect has made clear to Conway that he wants her to work in the new administration, but she has not decided whether to do so for several reasons. That includes being mother to four young children.CNN is told Conway is more likely to stay outside the government and follow the template of President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign strategist David Plouffe, who opted not to go in the White House.Conway may follow that model and help the Trump administration by organizing conservative groups and pushing Trump policies and legislation from the outside.Given Conway's exposure through the Trump campaign, she is also poised to make a lot of money working outside of government.This story has been updated."
