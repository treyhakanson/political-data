The tributes came as Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination this summer -- the first time in U.S. history a woman won such a nod from a major political party.During the 19th century, Anthony was one of many reformers instrumental in pursuing the women's right to vote and was a tireless activist against slavery and for women's rights throughout her life.In one well-known incident, in 1872, she was arrested for voting and was indicted. She was tried and fined but refused to pay the penalty, according to the Susan B. Anthony Museum & House website.Anthony died in 1906, 14 years before the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified. The measure -- also known as the Susan B. Anthony amendment --says citizens should not be denied the right to vote on the basis of sex.Latest election resultsThe Rochester, New York gravesite has long been a hot destination during election season and is particularly popular on Election Day.Because of the site's popularity, the cemetery will remain open until 9 p.m. Tuesday. It usually closes at 5:30 p.m.Brynn Hunt, a Rochester resident and first-time voter, was one of many to visit the site Tuesday morning.""I voted today because of women like her,"" she said. Hunt said she wore white in honor of women's suffrage.Early Tuesday, hundreds of people began to form to thank Anthony for her efforts.The line, much like the lines to vote, is long. Jes Karakashian noted that the line ""wraps around twice.""""I've never seen anything like this before in my life,"" she said. Despite the long wait, said visitor Max Bourgeois, the mood was peaceful, proud and respectful.But a sign near her tombstone reading ""Sisters, take the wheel"" expresses voters' ongoing sentiment: There is still a lot of work to do, but there are a lot of women to do it."

1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/american-election-voters-campaign-camper/index.html	"But this is no ordinary election.The candidates from both parties have the lowest approval ratings in modern history. Republicans remain divided over the nomination of Donald Trump, with many lifelong party devotees vowing support for his opponent. Some Democrats are still sore after their own bruising primary, which culminated with the resignation of the party chairwoman after leaked emails exposed a preference for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. And perhaps most of all, voters from both parties say they feel their voices aren't heard in Washington.These were the concerns and frustrations we heard when CNN embarked on a journey across the country during the height of general election campaign. From New York to Nevada, CNN reporters traveled with a camper retrofitted to give voters a chance to speak their minds through social media and post their thoughts about the election. For a month, we just listened. On the trip, we encountered thousands of voters who shared diverse opinions about this election, the nation, and their role in shaping it. We met Black Lives Matter demonstrators in New York who are pessimistic that change will come from either candidate, but remain steadfast in their cause. We spoke to undecided voters in North Carolina who are struggling with whether they can stomach voting for either candidate. In Pennsylvania, we rode down Highway 81 in a big-rig that had been transformed into a massive pro-Trump mobile billboard by a supporter who believes so strongly in his candidate that he set up a volunteer office to make calls day and night. In Arizona we followed ranchers who live on the US-Mexico border and feel as though Washington has abandoned them. In deep red Tennessee a man named Davy Crockett who suffers from multiple sclerosis described what it was like hearing Trump mock people with disabilities. And we interviewed families from St. Louis' north side who are hopeful that Clinton's education reforms would help lift their community. There were many more, but below are just some of the American voters we met along the way.Which best represents you on Election Day? Let us know with the #myvote hashtag on social media.THE UNDECIDEDCassandra Jones, North Carolina  ""I've never seen an election time when we've had so polar opposite candidates where I can't decide which is the lesser of two evils. That's very frustrating for me.""Lee Edsall, North Carolina  ""This is the first time I've had trouble deciding. I'm genuinely undecided still. The job is just way too important. It literally could be the end of the world if you get somebody who's likely to fire off nuclear weapons at 3 in the morning. For me, Donald Trump is a no-go. Hillary Clinton is certainly very well-qualified. I just have some concerns and reservations about some of her positions. So for me it's going to boil down to, are those reservations enough that I would write in another candidate or in the end, am I comfortable enough to choose her?""THE SETTLERSGabriella Johns, New York ""We're going to need a savior. We're going to need somebody to help us. Because I'm scared. I'm really scared for what's going to happen next. I'm not really expecting a lot from the two candidates. But I'm hoping something gets done. I just want change. ...I'm personally voting for Hillary, but I think that me voting for her, I'm just settling. Because I don't want to vote for someone like Donald Trump.""THE FED UP TRUMP SUPPORTERS Peggy Davis, Arizona ""I'm getting to where I think Congress is a bunch of elitist snobs who look down their nose at us and tell everybody how un-educated we are. We're deplorable, irredeemable, red necks, pretty long list. I don't care what they call me. We are so sick of establishment politicians. So tired of Washington telling us they'll do something and they don't. We feel like we've been just completely left to fend for ourselves down here. It was refreshing to me to finally have somebody step up and have the nerve to say we've got to stop this. This is a sovereign nation and it's going to be gone if we don't do something to stop it.""Debbie Merrigan, Pennsylvania""I worry. I worry a lot. You have people in America here who can't get what they want. They have to work for things. It's tough. People come here and they get things for nothing, and we're here in America, we've got poverty out here. People trying to get things and they can't. You have people who are going for food stamps, and our Americans can't get it. We have people moving in from other countries that are able to get it; it's not fair to the American people. And I think hopefully things will change.""TRUMP'S CHAMPIONS Bob Bolus, Pennsylvania""One of the first things that I ever heard Trump say was, 'I don't have time to be politically correct because America doesn't have time to be politically correct.' I agree with that. Stop worrying about offending everyone. Say what's need to be said and do what's need to be done. ""He means what he says and he says what he means and - he's just not a politician that you can buy off."" John Ladd, Arizona ""There's nothing I dislike about Trump. He has some abrasive qualities. We're all big people now, so get over it.""WITH HER ALL THE WAYAl James, Missouri ""I am going to vote for Hillary. She has education on her mind for helping the youth, and what she's trying to propose, that will help the country. I don't trust Donald Trump to save my life. He's not the guy to lead this country anywhere.""Victoria Kusy, Scranton, Pennsylvania ""I support Hillary. I think it's really sad the things he's said about women. Hillary Clinton's ads aren't anything she's said. It's all quotes from him. It's 2016 and we're all trying so hard to get away from that and I think he would bring us so far backwards. When you say a Trump presidency, I just think it's scary."" "	What kind of voter are you?	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Black']	[]
2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/colorado-early-voting-election-2016/index.html	But even though there are signs that Republicans have late momentum in the Centennial State, they are still behind their 2012 pace, which ultimately wasn't enough for then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney to win.Colorado is conducting its election almost entirely by mail this year, for the first time in a presidential cycle. Ballots were mailed out to all registered voters starting October 17, and more than 1.8 million Coloradans have already cast their votes by mailing in their ballots or dropping it off at a polling center.Live election coverageOn the eve of the national election, 652,380 Republicans and 645,020 Democrats have cast ballots, according to the Colorado secretary of state. That's a razor-thin Republican lead of 7,360 votes, which is much smaller than the roughly 31,000-ballot edge Republicans had at this point in 2012. So even though Republicans can celebrate taking the lead Monday, they are still underperforming compared to 2012.The 2012 numbers are from Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates that CNN has partnered with to receive detailed early vote return information this year. Catalist's voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote in the election.These are not results -- ballots aren't tallied until Election Day. But the findings provide clues on who is voting and which party is turning out to vote. And while the numbers track voters' party affiliations, not all Democrats are voting for Hillary Clinton, and not all Republicans are supporting Donald Trump.2016 exit pollsEven though Republicans led through much of the early voting window four years ago, President Barack Obama carried the state by 137,858 votes. He won thanks in part to a late surge of votes from younger voters, who often wait until the last minute to cast their ballots. So far this year, voters over 65 years old are 28% of the electorate that has already voted, even though they were only 16% of the final electorate in 2012.This time around, it was the Democrats who held the lead during much of the voting process. Their advantage peaked in the last weekend of October, when they led Republicans by about 27,000 voters. Since then, their edge dwindled with every new voting update from the Colorado Secretary of State.The Clinton campaign dispatched former Vice President Al Gore to Colorado on Monday for get-out-the-vote events in Boulder and Lakewood, a key swing area in Jefferson County. Trump made his final visit to Colorado on Sunday, holding a rally in Denver.Clinton and Trump were tied at 39% in a recent poll of likely Colorado voters, released last week by the University of Denver and the Crossley Center for Public Opinion Research. The survey showed a much closer race than much of the polls throughout the election season that gave Clinton a comfortable edge.

Latest election resultsOn a frigid night in the largely forgotten region about halfway between the Maine and Canadian borders, the small northern New Hampshire town came alive for several minutes of kitschy democratic conflict. This latest round of wee hours voting extends a tradition that traces back more than a half-century.  With the results in from Dixville Notch this long-awaited Election Day is officially underway, and sure as the Earth turns on its axis, the end of the 2016 presidential contest seems impossibly closer.The Granite State's tight Senate race will enter Election Day deadlocked, with Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan and incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte each Dixville notching 4 votes. Tuesday night's result will hearten superstitious Clinton supporters. The town's small collection of dedicated voters have correctly picked the eventual winner in three of the last four contests. In 2000 and 2004 it broke for George W. Bush and in 2008 it delivered a victory for Barack Obama. Its more recent results have been less predictive. Romney and Obama split 10 votes in 2012, and John Kasich edged out Trump in this year's GOP primary kick-off. Nearby Millsfield, which also voted at midnight, delivered a big win for Trump, who scored 16 votes to Clinton's four. One voter wrote-in Bernie Sanders, the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner. Meanwhile, Clinton rallied to a narrow victory in Hart's Location, outscoring Trump by a 17-14 margin, with Johnson gaining another three votes and two more voters volunteering Sanders.With overnight in-person voting completed, Trump carries a seven-vote lead over Clinton, 32-25. Millsfield in 2016 is looking to horn in on what has been a calling card for Dixville Notch since 1960, when Richard Nixon shutout John F. Kennedy 9 votes to nil. Hart's Location, too, has a tradition here, one that traces back to 1948, when voting began at dawn, and then a move to midnight in 1952. But they quit in 1964, leaving Dixville Notch as the leading hours-after-primetime player.    Wayne Urso, Millsfield's ambitious election official, is hoping to displace Dixville Notch. He spent the morning talking trash about his very-early voting rivals.  ""We actually have a population here,"" Urso told CNN. ""They may be registered to vote there (in Dixville Notch), but if you ask them where they live, you'll find that nobody actually lives there.""The Dixville Notch voting takes place in the storied Ballot Room of the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel, which has been closed to tourists for five years as new owners work to revamp the once bustling ski stop. Millsfield's decision to take on the embattled establishment was made, he said, during a post-primary skull session.""We had a meeting of all the voters -- because all the voters can probably fit in my living room,"" Urso said. Asked if they wanted to continue midnight voting in the general election, ""Everyone said, 'Yeah.' ""But why this year -- why call attention to the town during this especially divisive season?""We don't have that problem in Millsfield,"" Urso said of his isolated provincial town. ""We almost never talk about politics amongst ourselves. Whether it's divisive across the country ... it doesn't pertain to us.""An American institution, indeed.

""If you share my faith, then I ask you to vote,"" the President said. ""If you want a president who shares our faith in America, who's lived that faith in America, who will finally shatter a glass ceiling and be a president for each and ever one of us, then I'm asking you to work as hard as you can this one last day.""Calling his former opponent a fighter, a stateswoman, a mother, a grandmother and a patriot, Obama introduced his former secretary of state to the stage as ""our next president of the United States of America.""After a long embrace, Clinton thanked both the President and the first lady for serving the country for eight years with ""grace, strength, brilliance and a whole lot of cool.""She said the best way for Americans to express gratitude to the Obamas would be to elect the only presidential candidate committed to preserving Obama's legacy.2016 Election Results""I'm pretty sure as they said tonight, that the best way to thank them is to do something really important tomorrow -- to vote,"" Clinton said. ""As the President just pointed out, there is a clear choice in this election. A choice between division or unity.""Echoing a message she has taken across the country through the general election, Clinton vowed to be ""a president for all Americans"" -- not just those who support her in this election.""I believe we all have a role to play in building a better, stronger fairer America; building on the progress that we have enjoyed under President Barack Obama over the last eight years,"" she said. ""I am not going to let anybody rip away the progress we've made and turn the clock back, sending us back in time where people are free to question the foundation of our country.""Clinton, Trump make final pitch in battleground statesMonday marked eight years and three days since then-Sen. Obama became the first African-American elected president, after a contentious primary battle against Clinton.As the Obamas have neared the end of their two terms in the White House, the first couple has emerged two of Clinton's most powerful surrogates as the Democratic nominee has confronted an extraordinary opponent -- Republican nominee Donald Trump -- in an extraordinary election. First lady Michelle Obama, who has been out on the campaign trail the past few weeks vouching for Clinton, struck a nostalgic tone.""This is truly an emotional moment for me for so many reasons. We are one day away from once again making history,"" Obama said. ""I am also emotional because in many ways, speaking here tonight is perhaps the last and most important thing that I can do as the country's first lady.""The president, too, reflected on the past eight years, and thanked his supporters for electing a little-known ""skinny guy with a funny name.""""Eight years ago, I asked all of you to join me on an unlikely journey,"" Obama said.

""As my son and I walked away, I heard the man with the gun say... you're voting for Crooked Hillary."" But elections officials say the man broke no laws, as Virginia is an open carry state -- meaning that individuals are generally allowed to carry an unconcealed weapon in public.Yet the restrictions on firearms around polling places in most battleground states are a messy patchwork of state and local regulations -- with some banning guns completely and others only restricting firearms around schools or government buildings. So, before you head to the polls on Election Day with your gun, know the rules in these key states:Arizona: Arizona generally allows carrying an unconcealed firearm in public, but it does prohibit bringing a gun to the polls on Election Day, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety.Colorado: Colorado generally allows carrying an unconcealed firearm in public. Guns are not permitted, however, on school grounds, and local governments may enact regulations prohibiting open carrying of firearms in a specific area within the local government's jurisdiction, as long as signs are posted to that effect. Florida: Florida generally prohibits the open carrying of a firearm -- full stop. Iowa: Iowa allows carrying an unconcealed firearm in public with a valid state license and nothing in the Iowa state code prohibits guns at polling places, according to Kevin Hall of the Iowa Secretary of State's Office. Most polling places, however, are covered by other state laws prohibiting weapons around schools or government buildings. Michigan: Michigan does not prohibit carrying an unconcealed firearm, but Michigan law is silent on the whether guns are permitted polling places. ""It's just not addressed in election law,"" Fred Woodhams, spokesman for the Michigan secretary of state, told CNN.  Nevada: Nevada generally allows carrying an unconcealed firearm in public, and has Nevada has no statute prohibiting firearms at the polling places, but administrative regulations may still apply.New Hampshire: New Hampshire is an open carry state and there are no regulations prohibiting the possession of firearms at polling places. ""So yes, a safely holstered sidearm is permitted at polling stations in New Hampshire as far as New Hampshire law is concerned,"" Assistant Attorney General Brian Buonamano told CNN. ""However, there is the federal gun free school zones act which an individual might be violating by coming into a school-based polling place with a firearm."" North Carolina: North Carolina generally allows carrying an unconcealed firearm in public and has no statutes prohibiting firearms in polling places. ""(I)nstead firearms are regulated under various provisions associated with the facilities at which voting is taking place: no guns in schools (most polling places), state buildings, municipal buildings, etc.,"" according to Patrick Gannon of the North Carolina State Board of Elections.Ohio: Ohio state law does not restrict the carrying of unconcealed firearms in public, including in polling places. ""However, if the polling place is held in a location with a firearm ban (e.g., a school), that is obviously still in effect on Election Day,"" the Ohio Secretary of State's Office told CNN. And if you want to serve as a poll observer, you are not allowed to carry a firearm into a polling station. Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania generally allows the carrying of unconcealed firearms in public and there are no laws that specifically prevent a person from carrying or possessing a firearm at a polling place. Philadelphia, however, is different, and a license is required to openly carry a firearm. Moreover, if the polling place is located in an otherwise prohibited place, such as an elementary school or courthouse, then firearms are prohibited, according to Pennsylvania State Department spokeswoman Wanda Murren.Virginia: Virginia generally allows carrying an unconcealed firearm in public. Virginia does, however, prohibit the carrying of certain kinds of loaded firearms, openly or concealed, in certain locations, such as schools.Wisconsin: Wisconsin generally allows carrying an unconcealed firearm in public, but polling place prohibitions depend on local rules. ""If the municipality does not designate polling places as gun-free zones, then it is up to the owner of the building where voting takes place,"" Reid Magney, Public Information Officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, told CNN. ""There is no blanket policy for the state of Wisconsin -- it's a local decision. There are 1,854 municipalities in Wisconsin, and each of them may decide whether to set a policy on firearms."""
