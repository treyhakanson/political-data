Other states affected by Matthew -- Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina -- have extended deadlines in counties hit by the hurricane.The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, accused Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal and Secretary of State Brian Kemp of infringing upon residents' right to vote by refusing to extend the deadline. The storm interfered with voter registration drives, leaving African-Americans disproportionately affected by the state's refusal to extend the deadline, the lawsuit claimed.""Gov. Deal's refusal to do the right thing by simply extending the deadline means thousands of Georgians will be disenfranchised in November,"" said Kathleen Burch, interim counsel for the ACLU of Georgia. ""Protecting the right to vote is not a political stunt, nor a partisan effort. Our state's elected leaders should be protecting that right, not undermining it. This is a travesty to the people of Georgia and to the democratic process. We are exploring possible legal next steps.""Returning to registerGeorgia has six coastal counties that are home to more than half a million people. Deal ordered those residents to evacuate on October 6 -- five days before the deadline to sign up to vote in the November election. According to the ACLU lawsuit, the week ahead of the deadline has typically been one of the busiest periods for voter registration.The ACLU lawsuit came on the heels of similar lawsuit filed last week by the Lawyers' Committee of Civil Rights Under Law. In response to that suit, Moore Jr. ordered Deal and Kemp to extend the deadline for Chatham County -- one of the six counties along Georgia's coast. The county's board of elections, which closed ahead of the storm, did not reopen until after the day after the voter registration deadline.Days after Moore's Chatham County ruling, the ACLU's lawsuit claimed Deal and Kemp had illegally refused to extend the deadline for five remaining coastal counties -- Bryan, Camden, Glynn, Liberty and McIntosh -- despite repeated requests from voting rights groups to do so.After Matthew passed, many people started to return home to the coast, but could only register at local board of elections offices within a day of the deadline.According to the ACLU lawsuit, plaintiffs J'Mari Bethea and Joshua Lattimore, both residents of Glynn County, returned home on October 11 to homes without power. As a result, they could not access the secretary of state's website to register online, the lawsuit said.Burdened, but not blockedHowever, the burdens they faced were ""slight"" compared to ""Georgia's interest in conducting a smooth statewide election,"" US District Court Judge William T. Moore Jr. said in his ruling Tuesday. Moore added that it was unfortunate that a natural disaster coincided with Georgia's ""constitutionally valid"" voter registration deadline. Ultimately, it was ""difficult, but not impossible"" for most residents to register, Moore wrote. ""However, these circumstances are not impediments created by the State of Georgia that require it to provide an extension to the voter registration deadline,"" he said. ""At some point, Georgia's constitutionally valid voter registration deadline must be respected.""Early voting in Georgia has gone on for three days. Moore said he gave considerable weight to the state's claims that conducting voter registration at the same time as early-voting could pose significant ""administrative and technological difficulties.""""Georgia's ability to conduct efficient and accurate elections at the local, state, and Georgia's electoral system is simply not arranged to handle registration past the deadline and certainly ill equipped to handle it once early voting has commenced,"" he wrote. Preparing for the electionCandice Broce, Kemp's press secretary, told CNN that ""siding with the ACLU would have wasted valuable resources and caused unnecessary disruptions with voting already underway.""""Now, we can focus on ensuring a secure, accessible, and fair election in our state,"" Broce added."

If you accept the glory, be willing to accept blame.""Trump continued, ""Nip problems in the bud before they grow into more serious and hard-to-solve issues. In other words, take responsibility. People who take responsibility have no need to blame or continually find fault with others. Naysayers rarely contribute much, and they usually don't amount to much. By now, I've been in business long enough to have had ups and downs. I've enjoyed magnificent victories and suffered painful defeats. I've learned to go quickly from seeing problems to seeing their solutions. The secret to resolving problems is to emphasize the solution more than the problem; accentuate the positive without ignoring the negative.""Trump in 1988 CNN interview: I enjoy the political system, it's 'a beautiful thing'""Take responsibility, and don't just lash out at others,"" he concluded.

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/challenge-presidential-election-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html	"Some of Trump's defenders compared his remarks to the aftermath of the 2000 presidential election, when challenges by Democratic nominee Al Gore to the results in Florida culminated in the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Bush v. Gore. Critics blasted Trump for subverting perhaps the most basic principle of our democratic system -- that election results, reflecting the will of the people, are sacred.Here's our legal explainer of how Trump -- or Hillary Clinton -- can try to challenge the election if they appear to be on the losing side at the end of election night: Can a presidential candidate legally ""contest"" election results?Yes, but not at the national level. US elections, even for president, are administered on a state-by-state basis. Every state has its own laws governing elections, including laws that allow (and, in some circumstances, require) that the vote be recounted if the preliminary results show a very close outcome in that state, regardless of what happens elsewhere. State laws also identify other exceptionally narrow circumstances in which challenges can be brought. And in any event, every state also has procedures for counting absentee and provisional ballots, many of which are counted after Election Day. What this means in practice is that the results that are reported on election night are, both practically and legally, preliminary -- and may very well be subject to change in the days and weeks to come depending upon the different ways each state finalizes its results and resolves close calls.We all remember Florida in 2000 because the margin between Gore and George W. Bush was razor-thin and because whoever won Florida would cross the 270-vote threshold in the Electoral College -- and thereby win the election. Fewer folks remember New Mexico that year -- in which the vote was even closer than it was in Florida, and in which it took 23 days to certify the final results -- because the outcome wouldn't have tipped the scales nationally either way (Gore won the state's five electoral votes).This is why, when presidential elections are not as close (for example, in 2008 and 2012), there's far less talk of challenges or recounts. Some states may still be decided by razor-thin margins, but not enough to make a difference in which candidate received 270 or more electoral votes. Thus, the larger the apparent margin in the Electoral College on election night, the harder it would be for the losing candidate to legally challenge the election -- since he or she would have to succeed in overturning the results in enough states to change the outcome in the Electoral College.How does that process work?Every state's election laws are different. At the risk of oversimplifying, there are usually two different sets of issues: Whether state law requires the state to conduct a recount and whether state law allows one of the candidates to request a recount or some other kind of relief (e.g., whether absentee ballots without postmarks should or should not be counted). Either way, most states' laws impose a statewide deadline for certification of the final state-wide results, and a federal statute -- the Electoral Count Act of 1887 -- imposes a pair of deadlines that tend to drive the timing: a ""safe harbor"" deadline that guarantees that a state's chosen slate of electors will be recognized by Congress only if the state's results are certified within 35 days of the election and a requirement that the electors -- the state's representatives to the Electoral College -- be appointed 41 days after the election. In a nutshell, then, states usually have five weeks to resolve any challenges to the preliminary results. They can take longer, but they then run the risk that Congress would not recognize the state's reported results (and would instead decide for itself who won the state).Who decides who's right?Unless the challenging party can show some kind of federal constitutional violation (which is exceptionally rare), almost every challenge to preliminary election results is resolved under the relevant state's law. And in every state, the authoritative meaning of state law is up to the state supreme court, which will usually have the last word in any dispute over the mechanics -- or result -- of any post-election challenges.Of course, the final arbiter of presidential elections under the Constitution is the US Congress, which, by law, meets to count the electoral votes in a joint session on January 6. One of the purposes of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 is to make this joint session a formality, but if there are lingering disputes arising out of states that did not meet the safe harbor deadline, it is up to Congress to settle them. And if, upon counting the electoral votes, Congress determines that no candidate has received a majority (which has happened three times -- in 1801, 1825, and 1877), the Constitution provides that the matter will be resolved by the House of Representatives, with each state casting one vote.Does the Supreme Court play any role?In almost every case, no. As noted above, most of the legal questions that could arise in states with contested results are state law issues that are beyond the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. What made Florida different in 2000 was the Supreme Court's determination that the unique manner in which the Florida state courts had ordered a manual recount violated the US Constitution -- to wit, the Equal Protection Clause. Because the Supreme Court thereby prevented the recount from going forward, and because the ""safe harbor"" deadline was the same day as the justices' ruling, the decision had the practical effect of ending Gore's ongoing challenge to the results.But because of both the uniqueness of the constitutional violation in 2000 and the controversy surrounding the Supreme Court's role in the election, it seems highly unlikely (all the more so with the court operating with only eight Justices) that what happened in that year could repeat next month.What does it mean if a candidate might not accept the ""results""?It depends on the ""results"" to which the candidate is referring. If he or she means the preliminary results announced on election night, they are under no obligation to ""accept"" those results if the margin in a large enough number of states is close enough that recounts might somehow change the national outcome. Indeed, as noted above, some state's laws might automatically require a recount if the results are sufficiently close.But if he or she means that they might not accept the final results as certified by each of the states, as voted upon by the Electoral College, and as confirmed by Congress, that would be unprecedented in American history.Steve Vladeck is a CNN contributor and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law."

The vice presidential debate was a low point. Wrestling with their own rhetorical limits, Mike Pence and Tim Kaine ultimately found themselves pinned under a pile of cringeworthy gibes.   ""You are Donald Trump's apprentice,"" Kaine told Pence, to crickets. Pence dove into the uncanny valley of zingers, appropriating one of Ronald Reagan's signature lines -- ""There you go again"" -- by responding to a Kaine attack by saying, ""There they go again."" Thud.The primaries hadn't been much kinder. The most memorable one-liner, delivered by Marco Rubio, was delivered and then delivered and delivered again. Four times in one brief exchange, he told voters it was time to ""dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing."" ""He knows exactly what he's doing,"" Rubio said and said again, though it was clear that, at least in this endeavor, the Florida senator clearly did not.So what went wrong -- or right? Had blunt, bombastic, boisterous and brusque billionaire Donald Trump slain another sacred cow? Was the era of the one-liner over?""I don't think so,"" said former Mitt Romney campaign aide and CNN commentator Lanhee Chen, optimistic even after the vice presidential fiasco. ""I think there is still a purpose for them because what normally makes a one-liner good is that it encapsulates a really big point in a very memorable way. There is still going to be a demand for that kind of thing for candidates.""Social media, especially Twitter, can grab an effective one-liner -- especially the kind with a quirky touch -- and act as an accelerant, like it did when Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would consider Trump his ""puppet"" in the White House.When ""Child's Play"" creator Don Mancini posted an image of his ""Chucky"" minutes later, it was clear. Clinton had broken out and delivered a very serious message about Trump's alleged affinity for Moscow in a way that landed with the broader public.She struck again minutes later, succeeding where her running mate did not, by tweaking Trump over his most recent day job.""On the day when I was in the (White House) Situation Room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice,"" she said, readying the hammer, ""he was hosting 'The Celebrity Apprentice.' ""And how about what Trump shot back? Chances are, you don't remember.John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says the cost-benefit analysis has never come out more heavily in favor of at least attempting to create what politicos call ""a moment.""""There's a heavier reliance today on trying to land that one-liner, because candidates are looking for that tweet, that little bit of snark that can be conveyed in a very short, punchy way,"" he said. ""Because Twitter has become such a force in media and such a force in politics, too often now candidates are trying not just to land the zinger, but land the tweet.""As an example: ""Imagine Twitter in 1988,"" Hudak said. ""It would have gone crazy when Lloyd Bentsen said that (see below). He won that debate and he won on that line. But he probably would have won by a much bigger margin if he were saying it in an era of Twitter.""But as Bentsen and the top of his losing Democratic ticket, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, can attest, simply ""winning"" a debate is not the same as gaining a meaningful toehold in a tough campaign. They lost to George H.W. Bush and Quayle in an electoral landslide.The full measure of Clinton's salvos can't be taken in their immediate aftermath, but in the days -- and news cycles -- to come. The question now is whether her pithy attacks accomplished their fundamental intent. ""If you effectively land it, you know it will dominate the TV coverage all day the next day and into the next week,""  said Lis Smith, the director of rapid response for President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign and a top aide to Martin O'Malley during his primary bid this year. ""So if you effectively land a zinger, it is guaranteed that it will dominate the news coverage and there is a very real utility in that.""The rewards may be greater as ever, but the degree of difficulty in pulling off that successfully sharp, if telegraphed jab, grows as cultural consumers, already inundated with too-cute brand messaging, gets more clued-in to political stagecraft. ""The curtain has been pulled back on debate prep more than ever,"" Smith said. ""The public is more conscious about the artifice that goes into debates -- the zingers and different debate tactics that candidates use. So because people are more aware of the artifice that goes into these things, they're more likely to roll their eyes when they hear a clearly scripted a one-liner.""The eyeball test was kindest to Clinton in her third and final debate with Trump. Her cringe inducing allusion to, deep breath, ""Trumped-up, trickle down"" economics from their first round, on September 26 in New York, seemed so very far off. ""In tonight's debate,"" Smith emailed late Wednesday, ""Hillary Clinton made the zinger great again."" "	Zing! Why debate one-liner winners are worth all the flops
4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/presidential-debate-theatrics/index.html	"From the moment Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton stepped on stage in Las Vegas, they did not so much as acknowledge each other. They did not shake hands. Their campaigns dispensed with the customary greeting between their spouses after the Clinton campaign sought to prevent any new Trump theatrics, like his parade of Bill Clinton's accusers at the last debate. From that cold introduction to their deliberate avoidance of each other as they left the stage, the two candidates spent the evening exchanging icy glares of contempt. There were substantive policy discussions, but they were laced with insults, accusations and innuendo. This has largely been a vacuous contest that has centered on personality rather than policy. These final debates will be remembered as the denouement of the most crass, coarse and uncomfortable campaign in modern political history. Donald Trump: 'I will totally accept' election results 'if I win'Debates in the recent past have been tense, sometimes caustic. But it is difficult to recall any like last night that displayed an utter absence of comity. Clinton talked over Trump, letting his personal insults slide past her so she could punch her points. He repeatedly interrupted her, leaning into the microphone with pursed lips -- perfectly recreating Alec Baldwin's impression on ""Saturday Night Live"" -- as he bellowed ""wrong"" to try to cut her off. Then there were the insults and the name-calling. She charged Trump would be Russian President Vladmir Putin's ""puppet."" He retorted that Putin had outsmarted and outplayed her as secretary of state.He's for Trump. I'm for Clinton. We're still pals She called his rhetoric on nuclear weapons ""terrifying."" He called her ""a liar,"" framed her family's foundation as a ""criminal enterprise"" and described her campaign as ""sleazy."" Trump capped the evening by muttering into the microphone that she was ""a nasty woman"" as she landed one of her final attacks.Of course, the most breathtaking moment of all was when Trump sowed the seeds of discord for the aftermath of the election. Contending that the election is ""rigged"" and the media has ""poisoned the minds of voters,"" he refused to commit to accepting the results of the election. ""I will look at it at the time,"" Trump said when Chris Wallace of Fox News, the debate moderator, asked if he would ""absolutely accept the result"" of this election. ""I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time."" ""But sir, there is a tradition in this country,"" Wallace persisted. ""In fact one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign the loser concedes to the winner."" ""What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time,"" Trump replied. ""I'll keep you in suspense. OK?"" Amidst a hailstorm of criticism, even from fellow Republicans, Trump appeared to backtrack -- a little -- on Thursday afternoon by saying he would accept a clear election result. Reality Check: Who told the truth and who didn'tAs with all of Trump's cryptic statements, we won't know exactly what that means until the moment arrives on the night of November 8. In the meantime, the two candidates meet again Thursday night at the famed Al Smith dinner in New York -- an event that is meant to set partisan politics aside for one night in the heat of the campaign. The 2012 Al Smith dinner is remembered for the gracious remarks by Mitt Romney and Barack Obama about one another. Romney noted that night that it would be easy to let healthy competition on the campaign trail ""give way to the personal and the petty."" ""But fortunately, we don't carry the burden of disliking one another,"" Romney said.  ""Don't tell anyone I said so but our 44th president has many gifts and a beautiful family that would make any man proud.""Obama, in turn, spoke of how he admired Romney ""very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.""Obama also noted that he and Romney shared the hope that the next four years would ""reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening."" Clinton and Trump will be seated one chair apart this evening. Whether they can recapture that spirit of civility -- even just for one night in this soul-crushing campaign -- is anyone's guess.

""Second, there's been so many studies of voter dynamics around the country that prove there is not meaningful voter fraud in this country at this point.""If Trump loses to Clinton, it won't be due to fraud but because he's run a campaign with ideas that American voters found problematic, de Blasio argued.""He's going to lose because the American people rejected his idea. He's run a racist campaign. He's run a divisive campaign, has not spoken to how he'll change this country for the better, so people are going to reject it,"" he said.
