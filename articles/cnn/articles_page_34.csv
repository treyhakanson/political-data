BrexitThe first big political shock of 2016: Brexit.To the surprise of many Brits -- and pollsters -- the UK voted to leave the EU in this summer's referendum.The result was close, with 51.89% voting for leave, and revealed a deep divide in the country. It led to the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron and hit the pound hard although the economic impact hasn't been as bad as expected. Trump's response? The US is next.Columbia peace deal crumblesIn September, an historic peace deal was signed by the Colombian government and the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia rebel group, ended the long war that had killed 220,000 people.It was such a seminal moment that the country's President, Juan Manuel Santos, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.Except it didn't go through -- the deal was stalled after Colombian voters rejected it by a narrow margin in a public referendum. Sports surprisesAfter 108 years of heartache, a curse at the hands of a goat and a guy named Steve Bartman the Cubs finally won a World Series.And boy, did they do it in dramatic fashion. Down 3-1, the North Siders stormed back to force a decisive Game 7 against the Cleveland Indians, who themselves haven't won a title since 1948.The game was an instant classic, a nail-biter that went extra innings.Disclaimer -- the Cubs were a favorite to win it all when the season started. But being the favorite doesn't always mean you get the job done. Despite the heartbreaking World Series loss, Cleveland still had a good year in sports.The Cavaliers, down themselves 3-1 in the NBA Finals, came back to win the city's first professional sports championship in 52 years.It was a once-in-a-lifetime moment for LeBron James, the hometown star who left the Cavs in 2010 in an acrimonious fashion but returned in 2014 with the goal of finally bringing a title to ClevelandAnd back in the UK, Leicester City triumphed in last season's Premier League, overcoming 5,000-1 odds to win it all. Bookmakers were giving better odds on Kim Kardashian becoming president of the US by 2020 and Hugh Hefner confessing to being a virgin.Poet, Musician, Nobel Prize winner Bob Dylan took home the Nobel Prize for Literature this year for ""having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.""People were surprised by the choice, as Dylan isn't necessarily considered an author in the traditional sense. BrangelinaArguably the biggest power couple in Hollywood called it quits after a decade together.And the internet responded with the amount of shock you'd expect.Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from husband Brad Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences in September. Custody of their six children still remains in dispute."	2016: Trump's victory the latest in a year of shocks

He tapped into their anxiety about the present and the fear of the future. He spoke to the pain they felt about working hard and getting left behind. And in doing so, he eviscerated every convention about politics.The pundits thought Trump's reality show antics, his vulgar rhetoric, speeches filled with falsehoods and insults thrown at almost every sector of American society -- Latinos, African Americans, war heroes, women and Muslims -- would disqualify him from the presidency.It didn't.Instead Trump marshaled a movement -- a modern day uprising of forgotten Americans, reminiscent of Richard Nixon's ""silent majority"" of the late 1960s.How Clinton lostHe argued that Americans were hungering for change and that he alone could ""drain the swamp"" by sweeping away corruption in Washington.Changing the mapTrump said he would change the complexion of the electoral map -- putting Democratic states in the decaying industrial Midwest into the Republican column with his anti-trade rhetoric. He did.He said he could humble the most talented Republican field in a generation: He did.He said he could teach Republicans to beat their nemesis -- the Clintons. He did.He said the polls were wrong and that he would pull off a surprise that would dwarf the shocking poll-defying Brexit vote in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. And he was right.Trump's rewriting of the rules of politics could usher in a period of global turmoil and uncertainty, as US allies, foreign markets and the Americans who were revolted by his behavior during the campaign look to the future with deep anxiety.How politicians, pollsters and media missed Trump's groundswellThe question now, is when he becomes the most powerful man in the world in January, whether Trump will try to rewrite the rules and conventions of American government and the international system, just as fundamentally as he rewrote the rules of American presidential elections.Trump pledged unity during a victory speech in the early morning hours Wednesday.""I say it is time for us to come together as one united people,"" he said. ""I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.""Still, Trump pulled off one of the most staggering upsets in the history of Western democracy.As recently as a month ago, pundits were still contemplating the possibility of a Hillary Clinton landslide. But the polls began to tighten, returning the race to a more accurate reflection of a deeply polarized country.Then came uncertainty as FBI Director James Comey cast a new cloud of suspicion over Clinton's campaign, reopening a review of emails tied to her server.Clinton allies said the damage was undeniable -- their hope of swaying those final persuadable Republican women and independents -- suddenly looked bleaker.As late as this weekend, the polls suggested Trump would have to run a near perfect race and chart a very narrow path to the White House, essentially pulling an inside straight.Relying on the RNCSomehow the candidate -- who relied almost entirely on the Republican National Committee for his ground game -- outmanned the Clinton campaign.  The results Tuesday night stunned strategists from both parties. Many of the supporters who had gathered for Clinton's celebration in New York were shocked, some of them crying as they watched the states roll in for Trump. Early on Tuesday, Obama's former chief strategist, David Plouffe, tweeted a picture of vodka and Orange Crush, with the optimistic message: ""Ready to watch her victory speech.""Eight hours later, Plouffe tweeted that he had never ""been as wrong on anything"" in his life. ""Still a beating heart in WI, and the two (congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine). But sobriety about what happened tonight is essential.""The world reacts to U.S. election resultsWhile Trump fueled an enormous amount of enthusiasm among working class voters and brought many new voters to the polls, many Republicans were also quick to credit the RNC, which essentially ran Trump's entire ground game.One Republican strategist noted that unlike in past campaigns, the GOP had permanent staff on the ground since the summer of 2013 in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada.Working off the model of what the Obama campaign had done in 2008 and 2012, they spent the early days recruiting organizers and volunteers, testing their GOTV prowess in 2014.Over the past three years, they plowed money into voter registration and field staff -- flipping ten counties in Florida, for example, from a Democratic advantage to a Republican advantage. GOP aides said they cut the voter registration disadvantage that Mitt Romney had in 2012 by half.Around the time of the Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign and the RNC forged an awkward alliance. Instead of building their own ground game, the Trump campaign looked at the infrastructure that the RNC had built to support the Republican nominee and agreed to work within that framework.Many of the voters drawn to Trump's campaign were new to the political process. So throughout the year, the RNC conducted countless trainings for phonebanking and door-knocking. "	How Donald Trump won
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-farage-us-election-brexit/index.html	"Both men have turned voter disaffection into electoral triumph.Farage did so in the now infamous Brexit -- taking the UK out of the EU; Trump in winning the US presidency.Both men identified the other as a brother in arms along the way. So much so that at one recent rally, Trump told his supporters: ""We are going to do something so special. It will be so special. It will be an amazing day. It will be called Brexit plus plus plus.""The same people that didn't expect the Brexit vote scoffed. Today, both Farage and Trump will feel vindicated.70 years ago, Winston Churchill, in his famous ""Iron Curtain"" speech, forged a new phrase, casting the relationship between UK and US as a ""Special Relationship"".Trump and Farage 'kindred spirits'After the Brexit vote, Trump and Farage saw a different kind of transatlantic synergy -- one where both men's political message could feed off the other.Appearing at a at Presidential rally with Trump, Farage told the Republican crowds exactly what he told the British before Brexit: ""remember anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to standup against the establishment"".Trump and Farage are kindred spirits. Both men have galvanized a groundswell of anti-establishment sentiment and turned it into era-defining change.They have spoken to those who feel that a liberal elite has left them marginalized. In the UK, Farage was for a decade a fringe voice that few in the mainstream took seriously. His UK Independence Party (UKIP) always looked fractured and fragile. Most thought he'd never be more than an ""also ran"".Trump was also underestimated; Farage's success could have only given him hope. With the UKIP leader by his side, he told a rally that ""soon they will be calling me Mr Brexit"".Campaigning together, Farage gave Trump yet more ammunition for his campaign, telling his supporters how Obama had come to the UK two months before the Brexit vote, urging Brits to vote against Farage: ""he talked down to us, he treated us as if we were nothing"".Both leaders had message of 'fear'For both men the message that resonated was one of fear, of immigrants, of the political elite, of experts, of being left behind in an unfamiliar post-industrial world where brawn counts less than brains and anyone's job can be outsourced.Both men cajoled and corralled the electorate with half-truths and flat out lies. In victory, Farage was fast to say that one of the biggest Brexit campaign slogans, a £350 million a week rebate from the EU once the UK left, was untrue.Churchill's ""Special Relationship"" with the US was to bring the two countries closer together, making Europe and the US safer in an uncertain cold war era.Neither Trump, nor Farage -- who has stepped out of UK politics now -- have a fraction of Churchill's political experience. The world however is once again entering uncharted territory, with threats and uncertainty piling up. It's a big ask of anyone."	Trump predicted 'Brexit plus plus plus,' and he was right

But he lost to Democrat Paul Penzone, a former Phoenix policeman.Arpaio called himself ""America's toughest sheriff"" and was known for his tough stance on immigration in the border state. His reelection run was imperiled, though, when a federal judge ordered him to be tried on a criminal contempt charge, accusing him of disobeying a court order in a racial-profiling case.A staunch supporter of Donald Trump, Arpaio has insisted that President Barack Obama is not a US citizen and that his birth certificate is fraudulent."

Appearing on the ""Howie Carr Show"" on WRKO Tuesday evening, Trump said he didn't think the news has any impact. ""I think it's sad,"" Trump said. ""I think it's sad, you know. When I see George Bush do that, and look I was very critical of him for getting us into Iraq, which was obviously a horrible decision, and getting out the way Obama got us out was a horrible way to get out too -- the combination. I don't think it has any impact, frankly. I think it has no impact."""	Trump on George W. Bush not voting for him: 'It think it's sad'
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/clinton-loss-women-politics/index.html	"It was intended to be a night that would celebrate a historic first -- serving as a high point in a toxic election cycle.But in the end, the glass ceiling wasn't broken. The surge in female voters that Clinton's campaign hoped for didn't materialize. Clinton never even came to the microphone beneath that ceiling that she had hoped would symbolize a historic milestone, instead calling Donald Trump to concede.According to early exit polls, Clinton underperformed Barack Obama among women. Turnout among women was 1 point higher than in 2012, but Clinton only got the support of 54% of women -- compared to Obama's 55%.Trump actually won 62% of white non-college educated women to Clinton's 34%. Clinton won white college educated women 51% to Trump's 45%, according to those same polls.Clinton led among independent women but only by a 4-point margin.It was a stunning conclusion to a race where the first female nominee of a major party was matched with a candidate who has made the most sexist, misogynistic comments of any nominee to run for president in recent memory.Women typically make up 52 to 53% of the electorate in presidential years, but Clinton's allies and advisers realized early on that the history-making nature of her candidacy was not generating much excitement among voters -- certainly not in the same way that electing the first African-American president had galvanized Democratic voters around Barack Obama in 2008.'Incredibly polarizing figure'""Hillary Clinton is an incredibly polarizing figure, in a way that Barack Obama was not,"" said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University. ""He was an amazing orator, he was inspirational, the way that he spoke about helping to generate a post-partisan politics -- a lot of those promises and a lot of that language was something that had not been seen in politics.""""She (was) running as the first woman candidate for a major party nomination, and that's incredibly significant,"" Lawless said. ""But she also represents the establishment -- and those are competing forces.""There were successes for female politicians on the ballot Tuesday. Tammy Duckworth picked up a Senate seat for Democrats from Illinois. Kamala Harris won a Senate seat from California and Catherine Cortez Masto kept the Nevada Senate seat in Democratic hands.How Donald Trump wonBut complicating matters for Clinton this time, older women who were excited about casting their first ballot for a female president had already done so when she ran against Obama in 2008.On the flip side, millennial women often rejected the notion that gender should be a factor in their vote, particularly if their loyalties lay with Clinton's primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Over her three decades in public life, Clinton has struggled to strike the right balance in addressing her gender and the role it has played in her career.She became a polarizing figure for women early on with her infamous remark about staying home and baking cookies. She made women's rights a central focus for her both as first lady and as secretary of state.She has touched on those experiences, as well as her own near-glass ceiling-shattering moments during key moments throughout the 2016 race, most notably at the Democratic convention. But she tried not to overplay her hand, perhaps in part because she was faced an opponent who openly accused her of playing ""the woman card.""""Frankly, if Hillary were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote,"" Trump memorably said during an April victory speech at Trump Tower after a series of primaries in northeastern states. ""The only thing she's got going is the woman's card,"" Trump said. ""And the beautiful thing is that women don't like her.""Rallying cryThe Clinton campaign tried to turn that remark into a rallying cry against Trump with a tweet that became a call-and-response line at her rallies.""If fighting for women is playing the #WomanCard, well... Deal me in.""Still, Clinton chose not to make her gender the centerpiece of her campaign.How Clinton lostMichelle Obama highlighted Clinton's delicate balance on gender while speaking on her behalf during a recent rally in Winston-Salem: ""She has more experience and exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime. Yes, more than Barack. More than Bill. So she is absolutely ready to be commander-in-chief on day one. And yes, she happens to be a woman.""The final weeks of the campaign were dominated by discussion of Trump's boasts in a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape obtained by The Washington Post about his ability to grope women because ""when you're a star, they let you do it.""After he denied ever having carried out one of those acts, 11 women came forward to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct.It was Michelle Obama, a Clinton surrogate, who most effectively used Trump's comments about sexual assault as a rallying cry to get women to the polls during a powerful speech in New Hampshire last month. ""It's not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election cycle,"" the First Lady said in that address. ""If we have a president who routinely degrades women, who brags about sexually assaulting women, then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world?"" she asked.Clinton took the first lady's argument a step farther during her subsequent rally with Michelle Obama in Winston-Salem: ""Dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election,"" Clinton said. ""And I want to thank our First Lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value.""Celinda Lake, who has long specialized in polling and targeting messaging to women, noted that the Obamas have taken on a remarkably central role in the closing weeks of this campaign, particularly with their response to Trump's comments about women.Trump victory shocks world""Both of them bring a certain moral authority to this as the father and mother of two young daughters,"" Lake said, citing Michelle Obama's speeches, as well as the President's interview with Samantha Bee and the speech he gave on the trail confronting sexism last Tuesday (Nov. 1). ""It's easier when you're not the candidate, but they are the ones who have in some ways been the moral authority on gender here.""Trump's weaknessLong before the ""Access Hollywood"" tape emerged, Trump's weakness with female voters -- particularly white suburban women -- appeared to be his Achilles heel.But Clinton's aides feared that she lost a significant number of persuadable female voters because their enthusiasm was dampened by the FBI's late-breaking announcement that they were taking a new look at the emails of one of her aides.Still, Clinton pushed hard to rally women against Trump in the last days of the campaign.One of her closing ads amounted to a montage of what her advisers viewed as a montage of Trump's most offensive comments about women.""Anyone who believes, says, does what he does is unfit for president,"" the ad said in its closing tagline. Lake, the Democratic pollster, said research leading up to Election Day showed that sexism was actually only the third most cited reason that women said they were voting against Trump.The foremost concerns of women who could not support Trump, Lake said, was the fact that he would have been in control of the nation's nuclear arsenal and overall concerns about his temperament.But those women did not decide the election on Tuesday night. And in the end, the glass ceiling held firm."	What Clinton's loss says about women in politics

""They are just stunned at the idea that they were completely sure they were coming to this event for what they thought would be even an early night to celebrate Hillary Clinton becoming the first female president,"" Keilar said.

""I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans and this is so important to me."" Trump began that process by congratulating his opponent Hillary Clinton on her ""very, very hard-fought campaign"" and said Americans ""owe her a major debt of gratitude"" for her decades of public service. He said Clinton called him to concede the race and to congratulate Trump on his victory. And Trump also sought to reassure people around the world about what his presidency will mean for the world.""While we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone -- with everyone. We will seek common ground, not hostility,"" Trump said. The newly minted president-elect put aside his penchant for bashing the media and belittling his political rivals, instead repeatedly emphasizing that his next focus will be on unifying the country, which has been battered and deeply divided by the intensely vitriolic 2016 presidential campaign. ""To those who have chosen not to support me in the past -- of which there were a few people -- I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country,"" he said. Trump emerged on stage at 2:50 a.m., followed by his family and dozens of his closest campaign advisers and surrogates. Instead of descending an escalator, the Republican walked down a set of stairs onto the stage below to the soundtrack of ""Air Force One."" His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway outstretched her arms and exclaimed gleefully as she joined in the parade of aides and family members. Trump would later give her a warm hug as he went down the line of those who joined him on stage, offering kisses and hearty handshakes.Trump thanked his staff and advisers, but singled out Reince Priebus for special praise, asking the Republican National Committee chairman to join him at the podium. Of course, Trump also tipped his hat to the movement that propelled his improbable campaign -- and his outsider victory, which he said has ""been what they call a historic event."" ""I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family,"" he said. ""While the campaign is over, our work on this movement has really just started."" Introducing Trump, his vice presidential nominee Mike Pence also tipped his hat to the ""historic night"" and said ""the American people have elected their new champion."" And he wrapped up his brief remarks with a simple phrase: ""It is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce you to the president elect of the United States, Donald Trump."""

""I think that gives you a better taste of it. And you know, and then I think that was one of the first times he didn't have to campaign. It's a shift now from campaigning to governing.
