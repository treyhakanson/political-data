He said that in business, ""it's my job to minimize the overall tax burden.""""I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit ... Honestly, I have brilliantly used those laws,"" Trump said.QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump?The Times did not look at Trump's federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax returns as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns. CNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by The Times.Trump's 1990s business failings -- bankruptcies at his casinos in Atlantic City, disastrous real estate deals in Manhattan -- were just fodder for an epic comeback, he said at a rally in Pueblo.And any lingering questions about his business dealings and his tax returns -- which Trump is the only presidential nominee since 1976 to refuse to release -- is just a news media ""obsession,"" he said.He called himself ""a fighter"" and said he ""knew that I would make a comeback, without question. I never, ever had a doubt in my mind.""""The conditions facing real estate developers in that early-'90s period were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008 -- not even close,"" he said.Trump called the era ""a bad time -- it was an ugly time. A lot of people you won't ever hear from again from that period. But I never had any doubts ... I knew in my heart that when the chips are down, that is when I perform my very best.""RELATED: GOP distances itself from Trump againTrump's comments came under withering attack from Hillary Clinton, who charged Monday that Trump lived a billionaire's lifestyle while ""contributing nothing to our nation.""""Imagine that,"" Clinton told supporters Monday at a rally. ""In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill."" That, she said, ""tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business.""Indeed, there are still a long list of unanswered questions about Trump's finances, including whether or not Trump actually paid income taxes, and if voters believe someone who lost nearly $1 billion in one year could be labeled a brilliant.Trump did say, though, that he pays a slew of taxes aside from income.""I face enormous taxes -- city, state, sales, excise, employee, federal, VAT, different countries,"" Trump said in Pueblo.He said he had a ""fiduciary duty"" to his business to use tax laws -- ""or, to put it another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible.""Democrats have pointed out that Trump's fiduciary duty could only exist in his businesses' taxes -- not his personal taxes.Still, Trump's supporters weren't dissuaded -- cheering loudly in Pueblo when he added: ""I must tell you, I hate the way they spend our tax dollars.""""Put me into the board room as your representative and I will deliver for you like no politician has ever delivered, believe me,"" he said later in Loveland.Trump also argued in Loveland Monday night that his handling of his own taxes matches left-leaning billionaires, including George Soros and Warren Buffett, who he said in 2014 lost $873 million.""I wonder if they deducted that, you think? No, I don't think so,"" Trump said sarcastically. ""You think they'd ever do a thing like that? I don't think so.""Campaigning in Virginia and Colorado on Monday, Trump sought to regain his footing after a damaging week by refocusing his attention on attacking Clinton.The same candidate who spent days last week -- including one overnight tweet-storm-- blasting former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, on Monday complained that Clinton ""focuses on small, petty things.""""We're going to talk borders. We're going to talk trade, jobs and refugees,"" Trump said of his message. ""We're going to talk about crime and failing schools and how to turn our country around.""And Clinton, he said, will ""do everything she can to distract from the issues.""Trump also showed he is increasingly aware and focused on early voting. He visited a volunteer call center that Trump's campaign said had already made 9,500 calls, and planned another volunteer visit later Monday night. Twice he reminded the voters in Loveland -- which is conducting its presidential election entirely by mail for the first time this year -- to mail in their ballots.""All that stands between you and the country you want is Hillary Clinton's special interests,"" he said. ""And all you have to do to beat those special interests is mail in those ballots and get out the vote."""	Donald Trump: 'I'm working for you now, I'm not working for Trump'

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/military-death-penalty-supreme-court/index.html	"Army Sergeant Hasan K. Akbar was convicted and sentenced to death by a court-martial for killing two of his fellow soldiers and wounding 14 others during the attack in the run up to the invasion of Iraq. Akbar is the first US soldier convicted for ""fragging"" -- intentionally killing fellow soldiers overseas during wartime -- since Vietnam. In deciding not to consider Akbar's appeal, justices passed up not only an opportunity to clarify how two of their important death penalty precedents relate to each other, but also a chance to revisit the debate Justice Stephen Breyer rekindled 15 months ago over whether the death penalty itself might be unconstitutional.Akbar initially appealed his conviction and death sentence on a number of grounds, all but one of which were rejected by the highest court in the military justice system -- the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces -- in August 2015. The one question the military appeals court did not resolve, and the question Akbar asked the justices to answer, was a technical question about who prescribes the case-specific ""aggravating factors"" that, according to the Supreme Court, must be found to be present in an individual case to support imposition of a death sentence. In its 2002 decision in Ring v. Arizona, the Supreme Court had held that aggravating factors in capital cases are elements of the underlying crime, and thus must not only be found by a jury -- rather than the judge -- but must be identified in advance by the legislature. In the federal military justice system, in contrast, Congress has delegated its responsibility to identify aggravating factors to the President, who has done so through the Manual for Courts-Martial, a series of administrative rules promulgated by the Secretary of Defense. Such a procedure, Akbar argued, was inconsistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in Ring, because Congress's power to delegate such authority to the President was based on the view that aggravating factors are not elements of the crime -- a view the court had expressly rejected in Ring. The military court of appeals refused to consider Akbar's argument because of a prior Supreme Court decision, Loving v. United States, that had upheld Congress's power to delegate to the President the authority to identify aggravating factors in military capital cases. Even though Loving seemed to be called into question by the Supreme Court's later decision in Ring, the appeals court held that only the Supreme Court could overrule its decisions -- implying that the Justices should clarify the relationship between the two precedents.Monday's action, delivered without comment by the court, therefore leaves open the question of whether a practice that has been expressly ruled to be unconstitutional in the civilian courts is constitutional as applied to US military personnel."

An exclusive story from Roll Call when the RNC ad was first released Monday morning described the ad as ""Willie Horton-style."" Republican Party chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer tweeted a link to the Roll Call story with the headline comparing the RNC ad to the Horton ad. The GOP account also tweeted the link. Both have since been deleted after Spicer's tweet of the Roll Call story headline triggered an outpouring of criticism. Kristine Viesselman, Roll Call's editor-in-chief, issued a statement defending their headline.""Like the Horton ad, the new ad specifically criticizes the candidate (Kaine) for his perceived weakness in dealing with criminals. Our story makes no reference to race,"" she said in a statement.Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted, ""When the RNC is forced to delete its own tweets promoting an ad, that tells you everything you need to know about how shameful the attack is.""The RNC ad itself highlights four criminals, three white men and one black man. ""Long before Tim Kaine was in office, he consistently protected the worst kinds of people,"" a narrator says over black and white images of Hillary Clinton's running mate. RELATED: How to watch the vice presidential debate on CNNThe ad mentions two death penalty cases Kaine defended as an attorney, Richard Lee Whiteley and Lem Tuggle, his commutation of the death sentence of Percy Walton as governor, and his 2010 decision to support the extradition of Jens Soering, a German man convicted of double murder.Spicer told CNN's Chris Cuomo Tuesday that the ad is not similar to the controversial Horton ad.""Anyone who compares it to the Willie Horton ad either hasn't seen the ad or doesn't understand history,"" he said on ""New Day."" ""As you pointed out, the folks in the ad -- three of the four are white.""""Tim Kaine had previously said someone should be judged by the totality of their record,"" Spicer added. ""This is the Tim Kaine part of the record that they don't want to discuss."" Kaine, a devout Catholic, has a faith-based opposition to capital punishment. But when he was running for governor in Virginia, he vowed to enforce the death penalty. ""I'm against the death penalty, I don't think we need it,"" Kaine said in a June interview with C-SPAN before he was chosen as Clinton's running mate. ""The law in Virginia is that the death penalty can be the ultimate punishment for the most serious crimes ... and I really grappled with, I'm against the death penalty, but I'm going to take an oath to uphold the law."" But Spicer Tuesday said the ad is not about Kaine's religious convictions. ""It's not just about the death penalty. It's about making sure they served the least amount of time possible. That's a big difference,"" he told Cuomo. ""He went out and defended people who committed heinous crimes, and he sought to get the lowest penalty for them.""""That's fine. He chose to do that. But he should be judged for it as well,"" Spicer said. Eleven people were executed during his tenure as governor. He faces off with Pence Tuesday evening.

For example, North Korea conducted a missile test and then a nuclear test shortly after President Barack Obama was elected.""Doing a major test would be a way of trying to intimidate the incoming president,"" said Victor Cha, one of the study's authors. ""North Korea chooses particular windows that they know will gain maxmum attention from the world, and the US in particular.""""It could be a sixth nuclear test, it could be launching of their rocket which put a satellite in orbit,"" Cha added.The study is scheduled to be published this week on the CSIS website Beyond Parallel.But some analysts see a shift in North Korea's provocations, from symbolic actions to concrete military tests, since Kim Jong Un took power after his father's death in 2011. These analysts see a decrease in deadly provocations that are primarily symbolic, such as the 2010 shelling of the disputed South Korean island Yeonpyeong, or the 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan with a torpedo. Only one has occurred recently -- the placing of land mines in the demilitarized zone, which injured two South Korean soldiers last year.""Nothing as aggressive as we saw under his father,"" said Ken Gause, who analyzes North Korea's leaders for CNA Corp. ""Kim Jong Un, with the exception of the August crisis of last year, he has pretty much restricted his provocations to missile tests, nuclear tests, and cyber attacks.""The past few years have seen an exponential jump in the number of North Korean weapons development tests, according to statistics from 38North, including 15 missile tests in 2016 alone. Any provocations carry an increased risk of escalation these days, analysts say, for two reasons.First, the South Korean government after 2010 made it easier for military commanders to respond to a provocation without waiting for politicians to consider a response.""They are more likely to retaliate earlier than in the past; they are also more likely to respond exponentially,"" said former CIA analyst Bruce Klingner, now with The Heritage Foundation.And second, Klingner said, the North's growing nuclear capability could give North Korean leaders a sense of impunity.""They may feel more emboldened conducting not only provocations, but actual attacks,"" he said, ""feeling that they have immunity from any kind of US response, because North Korea has a nuclear deterrent to the US nuclear umbrella.""North Korea is one of the most difficult national security challenges the next president will face, according to CIA director John Brennan. Asked to identify America's biggest risk across the globe, he told CNN's Erin Burnett last week: ""Kim Jong Un's nuclear arsenal missile capability. Not just to threaten his neighbors, but also to have intercontinental capability. That's something that the new team and the current team is looking at very, very closely and will need to be able to address.""But, national security analysts say, the US appears to have little leverage to stop the country's nuclear program from racing ahead.""I don't think we can solve it diplomatically, that much is clear. Every administration in the last 20 years has tried a diplomatic approach, and the North Koreans have blown through every one,"" said CSIS's Michael Green, who himself handled such efforts when he was director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council. ""What the US can do, with allies and partners -- and hopefully China -- is constrict North Korea's access to technology, to money, slow down their nuclear program, and start setting the stage for negotiations,"" he said."

Officials have said the Russian and Syrian attacks have been indiscriminate and killed civilians. US officials point to the fact that over 90% of weapons dropped by the US and its allies are ""smart bombs"" that are either laser or GPS guided munitions. The Russians on the other hand use less sophisticated gravity bombs that are considered much less precise. The US and non-government organizations have also accused the Syrian regime of using ""barrel bombs,"" an even cruder weapon.President Barack Obama has described the Russian and Syrian air campaign as ""'barbarous"" and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen.
