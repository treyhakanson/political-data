Trump's edge in the Peach State is well within the poll's margin of error.Most surveys have not shown Georgia to be as close a race as is Arizona, where Clinton campaigned Wednesday. Trump leads in Georgia 45% to 44%, and in Arizona 45% to 40%.Clinton has not campaigned extensively or spent much money in the Peach State. She has run millions of dollars of ads in Arizona, and her campaign has also sent Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders to the state in recent weeks.In Texas, a vote-rich state where Trump has been underperforming previous top-of-the-ticket Republicans, Trump leads solidly -- 49% to 40%, the survey shows.Green Party candidate Jill Stein does not earn more than 3% in any state, and Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, takes in 9% in neighboring Arizona, 6% in neighboring Texas and 8% in the state of Georgia.In down-ballot contests, Georgia GOP incumbent Johnny Isakson only earned 48% support, raising the prospect that he could fall short of the 50% threshold and that a January runoff could be required.The polls, fielded from October 30 to November 1, surveyed 948 registered voters in Arizona for a margin of error of 3.2 points and 719 likely voters for 3.7 percentage points; 937 registered voters in Georgia for a margin of error of 3.2 points and 707 likely voters for 3.7 points; and 943 registered voters in Texas for a margin of error of 3.2 points and 679 likely voters for 3.8 points.

""When you say 'not one shred of evidence,' somebody's firsthand, on the record, named account and contemporaneous accounts of their friends and family. That's not evidence?"" Bossie replied, blaming the the Democratic establishment for the allegations. ""Jake, not one person has come forward as a witness to anything other than people who were put up by Gloria Allred, and the DNC and the Clinton campaign,"" said Bossie.

But the batch also includes new correspondence from Clinton's 2010 clean-up tour amid the stunning WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables. A series of largely redacted emails from 2010 include Clinton's discussions of how she will approach world leaders, as well as how hard she should go after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The newest emails from Clinton were released by the State Department while Assange continued his extended bombardment of the Clinton campaign with regular releases from campaign chairman John Podesta's hacked emails. In a Dec. 2, 2010, top aide Huma Abedin wrote to Clinton that an ally had suggested Clinton say, ""We view this not as a 'clever game' of wiki leaks but rather as a 'criminal act' against the United States of America. He might think this is a clever game today but when he is prosecuted and if convicted he will move from being a clever cyber thief to a convicted criminal -- and will find out that's a whole different kind of game.""Assange has been in asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for four years, and has blamed Clinton in part for his seeking asylum. Democrats have accused Assange and the Donald Trump campaign of coordinating the release of the Podesta emails with Russia, but Assange told Russia Today that the Russian government was not the source of the emails. WikiLeaks' release of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables in 2010 -- with stark and cutting assessments of foreign leaders -- created a massive problem for Clinton as she played clean-up in her role as secretary of state. Emails released by the State Department Thursday detail some of the behind-the-scenes scramble inside her office. A Nov. 26, 2010 email about her planned call with French Foreign Minister Michele Aliot-Marie is largely redacted, but includes some background, including bracing for ""the first of several articles"" that Le Monde was set to publish from the WikiLeaks cables. A Nov. 27, 2010 from Huma Abedin to Clinton shows them bracing for the impact from the New York Times' publication of WikiLeaks material dealing with the U.S. relationship with Canada.""Two cables set for release contain especially sensitive information on counterterrorism and intelligence sharing. The depth of bilateral cooperation detailed in the cables may be controversial for Canadians,"" Abedin wrote in the email.The latest release follows a compromise agreement reached this September in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The agreement paved the way for at least 2,900 pages of Clinton's emails to be reviewed ahead of November 8.None of the new emails contained information marked as classified or newly upgraded to classified, but 18 were near duplicates that included a previously-released email that had been upgraded when originally released.The State Department was initially tasked with processing 1,050 pages out of about 5,600 work-related emails before the election as part of an order in a separate FOIA lawsuit. But attorneys for the State Department and VICE News reporter Jason Leopold agreed to an accelerated release before the election. After an initial review of the documents turned over by the FBI, the State Department concluded a ""significant number"" of the 5,600 work-related emails were duplicates or near-duplicates of emails already released to the public, and therefore will not be subject to re-release.Clinton turned over approximately 55,000 pages of her emails in early 2015. Those were processed and produced to the public, with redactions, between May 2015 and March 2016.An additional 350 pages are scheduled to be released Friday."

Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation again,"" the narrator says as the spot opens. ""Her emails were found on pervert Anthony Weiner's laptop. Think about that.""The FBI told Congress last week it is reviewing emails from Clinton aide Abedin after finding them on a laptop belonging to Weiner, her estranged husband. The agency is investigating whether the former lawmaker had inappropriate sexual contact online with an underage girl.The Clinton campaign has repeatedly criticized the FBI for announcing the review so close to the closing days of the 2016 race without providing many details. FBI Director James Comey has said that some emails could be ""pertinent"" to the bureau's review of Clinton's email server -- an investigation that did not result in criminal charges over the summer -- but the review is not expected to be completed by Election Day.The spot, which the Trump campaign said is running nationally, ends by saying Clinton is ""unfit to serve"" as president because she is ""crippled by a criminal investigation,"" but the FBI has not said Clinton herself is the subject of an investigation.The Trump campaign also released a statement saying Clinton's latest scandal has kept her from focusing on the issues that matter most to voters.""While Mr. Trump has spent the closing weeks of this campaign drawing huge crowds of Americans hungry for a common sense change agent who will bring our jobs back and strengthen our borders, Crooked Hillary Clinton has been busy living in an alternate reality where her litany of email scandals and FBI investigations don't disqualify her from running for President,"" said Jason Miller, the campaign's senior communications adviser."

""And unless there is some additional evidence that the FBI director and the Justice Department would take to a grand jury, then she is not likely to be convicted of a crime.""As CNN's KFILE reported, several GOP congressman, asked about the possibility of a Clinton impeachment, have warned a Clinton presidency could lead to a ""constitutional crisis"" should the FBI's acquiring of emails from top aide Huma Abedin lead to an indictment. Cornyn blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch for not convening a grand jury or special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. ""To me, the only way to get to bottom of all this would be to have the attorney general appoint a special counsel, convene a grand jury, present the grand jury with the evidence and let the chips fall where they may because clearly none of us really have the whole story,"" he said.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/donald-trump-2016-election-campaign-discipline/index.html	"Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado introduced Hillary Clinton at a Florida rally Tuesday, blasting Donald Trump. And for once, the billionaire didn't react. No tweets. No attacks from the stump. Nothing. Instead, he stayed on message going after Clinton on her email server while pledging to repeal Obamacare.In the final days of the 2016 campaign, Trump isn't taking Clinton's bait.The new self-discipline comes as the election tightens and polls indicate a razor-close race in battleground states such as Florida, New Hampshire and Colorado. On the stump Wednesday night in Florida, Trump revealed how he is focused on staying disciplined and how hard it is for him. He talked to himself out loud on the stump: ""We've got to be nice and cool, nice and cool, right? Stay on point, Donald, stay on point. No side tracks Donald. Nice and easy."" For months, when the campaign narrative wasn't going Clinton's way or polls were tightening, all her team had to do was go after their Republican rival on something that hit him close to home. He reliably reacted by lashing out in a way that caused a firestorm and then -- boom -- the discussion was back where Clinton advisers wanted it: all about Trump.Obama's final mission: Help Clinton close the dealIt's a strategy that exceeded the Clinton campaign's wildest dreams at the Democratic convention, where they gave Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan prime-time speaking slots attacking Trump. That prompted an angry response from Trump that drew criticism from fellow Republicans -- and dominated the news cycle for days.Rinse and repeatAfter that, it was rinse and repeat for the Clinton campaign.Their biggest success was the way Trump reacted to Clinton ending the first debate, when she highlighted his past comments about Machado. He not only ranted about it at events, he went after Machado personally, including an especially odd tweet sent at 3 am suggesting she had a sex tape.     Clinton was quite transparent about her strategy, tweeting, ""a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.""Why Clinton's closing message is so somberThroughout Trump's entire White House run, the biggest frustration among members of his campaign team -- and one of the reasons he went through three campaign managers -- has been that his advisers couldn't control him and therefore couldn't control the message of his campaign. And it's not as if they didn't try. They did, but Trump didn't listen.""Up until a week ago, he would say 'I hear you, I get it. But you're wrong,' "" said one source close to Trump, who described his attempts for months to get him to stay on message.This source says Trump's refrain in private was that's what makes him different -- people view him as real, even if he is off the mark sometimes.Why the change?But now, the GOP nominee is suddenly showing remarkable discipline. He is restraining himself on Twitter and is largely sticking to script during speeches at rallies.So where did Teleprompter Trump come from? What changed? There are several answers, according multiple sources close to Trump. One is what a Trump confidante called a ""thunderbolt from God"" -- the bombshell news from FBI Director Jim Comey that the agency is reexamining emails potentially tied to Clinton's private server.Turmoil in the FBIThat gave Trump a reason to focus where he should -- on his political opponent. It also gave him hope that he actually could win, especially since even before news of the review surfaced, Trump's advisers were showing him data suggesting polls were narrowing in some must-win battleground states.That's heightened with new polls in battleground states such as Florida and North Carolina showing razor-thin races.Another change is the calendar. Trump knows it's almost over. He is telling those close to him that he realizes he has been in the ""red zone,"" but now -- using a football analogy -- he can see the ""end zone.""A different Trump source used a baseball analogy to describe Trump and why he is exhibiting the self-control many thought he didn't have.""He is a closer,"" said this Trump source, who also called him a ""big game player.""And then there is the company he is keeping on the campaign trail. Sources say, Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, has been traveling more often with Trump. Kushner has long been an instrumental behind-the-scenes force in Trump's campaign and GOP sources tell CNN his presence recently on the trail has helped keep Trump in check.Same goes for Steve Bannon, a top Trump campaign official on leave from the conservative Breitbart. Bannon is also now a regular presence on the plane with Trump -- which sources say is aimed at keeping the candidate focused. Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus is another force with Trump often pushing him to stay on message.Another source tells CNN what Trump's trusted traveling advisers do now is encourage him to get his frustration, anger or off-script thoughts out of his system before he gets on stage.Republicans say Trump's self-control directly affects poll numbersDuring the primaries, Trump always spoke off the cuff in his speeches and regularly mocked Clinton for using a Teleprompter in her speeches. But after one too many self-inflicted wounds, he gave into the entreaties of advisers to use one himself. He didn't stick with it -- not even close. And it usually got him into trouble. It was not really until recently when things started moving his way. The government reported Obamacare premiums will go up next year, and the surprise FBI announcement its investigation of Clinton emails isn't over gave Trump an unexpected opening. The bang-their-head-against-the-wall exasperation Republicans experience when Trump goes rogue stems from the direct correlation they see in his off-message mishaps and the poll numbers for his campaign -- not to mention as down-ballot Republicans.   ""When Mr. Trump stays on message, people come home real quick,"" said RNC Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, speaking to Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham on their ""Party People"" podcast.  Early voting update: Black vote declining with 24.4 million ballots castBut when the news cycle is all about Trump -- often things he said or did to offend people -- GOP strategists say they saw many vulnerable Senate and House candidates take a hit in the polls.""When Donald Trump sticks to the script and reads from a Teleprompter, like he did in September and like he is doing this week, we see a bump in polling for down ballot races,"" said Mike Shields, a CNN contributor who runs the Congressional Leadership Fund, the primary super PAC for House Republican leaders aimed at maintaining their majority.""If the election is about Hillary, everyone on the ticket does better. If the election is about Trump, everyone on the ticket does worse,"" Shields added.Last month's release of the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape depicting Trump lewdly talking about what he does to women was one of the low points for Republicans watching House races. The tape had such a negative effect on other GOP candidates that Republicans started to worry Democrats might be about to find the 30 seats they need to flip in order to re-take control of the House.It got even worse when women started to allege that Trump had groped them, and he lashed out -- even stepping on what aides had previewed as a key policy address in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.6 ways Trump could win 270 electoral votesIn an interview a few days after that incident, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN she made clear to Trump she thought that was a mistake on his plane following that event, telling him that he sounds like he is going to lose.In public, Conway's not-so-subtle refrain was that her candidate is at his best when he is talking about the issues, as opposed to controversies swirling around him or his campaign. But even in the face of evidence that his lack of self-control often causes his campaign to spiral downward, Trump seemed impervious to pleas from his advisers to stop.Sources close to the GOP nominee concede his brash responses often made it seem that Trump simply couldn't stay on message and was inherently unable to let a slight or attack go -- even if it meant hurting his own campaign.Yet for almost a week, Trump has shown he is in fact capable of being disciplined. Luckily for Trump's battle-worn advisers, it's a lot easier to get him to that place when the focus of the campaign is on his opponent's problems -- and not his.But, they concede, there is still time -- lots of time -- for Teleprompter Trump to revert to Rogue Trump before next Tuesday.

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/presidential-polls-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-2016/index.html	CNN's Poll of Polls shows Clinton leading Donald Trump, 46%-42%, which was updated Thursday to include two new national polls taken after Friday's revelation that the FBI is reviewing new emails to see if they pertain to the bureau's probe into Clinton's handling of classified material at the State Department.The CNN Poll of Polls is based on an average of the five most recent national phone polls.In one, via CBS News and the New York Times, Clinton leads Trump among likely voters nationwide, 45%-42%. The other, a new ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, shows Clinton with a 2-point edge, 47%-45%. In each poll, Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein -- once thought of as potential spoilers -- hover in the low single-digits. The CNN Poll of Polls currently shows Johnson and Stein at 4% and 3%, respectively. It was only a couple weeks ago when Clinton's lead ballooned in several national polls after the release of a video in which Trump could be heard making sexually aggressive comments about how he treats women. That revelation was followed by an onslaught of sexual misconduct allegations levied against Trump that seemed to only further diminish his chances. Trump denied all the allegations.Clinton's campaign was then rocked by the letter FBI Director James Comey sent to members of Congress regarding the potential for new email scrutiny.The latest CBS/New York Times poll suggests that most voters are unaffected by the development. About 6-in-10 likely voters who haven't cast their ballot yet said the FBI's announcement makes no difference to them, while 32% said it made them less likely to support Clinton.The CBS/New York Times poll was conducted October 28-November 1 using phone interviews with 1,333 likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.The ABC/Washington Post tracking poll was conducted October 29-November 1 using phone interviews with 1,167 likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.	Election polls: Tight race, Hillary Clinton hanging on	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/trump-clinton-military-relationship-mosul/index.html	"The Republican nominee, in particular, would enter office having backed a number of positions contrary to the Pentagon and having leveled harsh critiques of military policy and strategy. Though the military is duty-bound to serve its top commander, and officials have refrained from naming the candidate in comments they've made over the past year, analysts predicted a complicated relationship should Trump assume the Oval Office. ""I think there has been a lot of angst about what a Trump administration would look like,"" Seth Jones, a former adviser to US Special Operations Command, told CNN Wednesday. ""His learning curve will be immense.""The former dean of the Army War College, retired Army Col. Jeff McCausland, told CNN's Chris Cuomo Tuesday that ""the brain trust of the Republican Party and national security affairs"" have all chosen to ""repudiate Trump and say he is, in fact, not qualified to be president of the United States.""During an earlier interview with ABC, Trump had said of McCausland: ""I'll sit down and I'll teach him a couple of things.""The GOP candidate also has more broadly criticized the US strategy toward ISIS; suggested bringing back torture; called for a drastic rethinking of American military alliances; and floated the possibility of shifting America's nuclear policy to allow for greater proliferation. ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me,"" Trump said in November of 2015.Asked in June he still thinks he knows more about ISIS than Americans generals, Trump told CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" ""Well, they don`t know much, because they're not winning.""""What's not clear is whether he actually means what he has said,"" noted Jones, now with RAND Corp. ""If he tries to jam through some of the statements on torture, if he tries to jam through the rethinking of the US relationship with European allies and Pacific allies, I think he is going to face a lot of resistance.""Clinton, too, has taken positions that appear at odds with some of the public positions of the military, particularly regarding the imposition of a no-fly zone in Syria.""I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians,"" Clinton said at the third presidential debate.Not only has President Barack Obama opposed such a move, military leaders have also expressed concerns.Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford told Congress in September, ""For us to control all of the airspace in Syria, it would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia. That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going make.""However, his perspective on some of Trump's proposals has been even harsher.Asked about the practice of waterboarding suspects and targeting the families of terrorists, Dunford called such actions illegal, ""inconsistent with the values of our nation"" and warned they ""would have an adverse effect on troop morale.""Trump has said that US allies need to pay more for the deployment of US troops in their territory.But Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of US forces in South Korea, told Congress that it was actually cheaper to station American troops in Korea than back in the US due to financial contributions from the host country -- though Trump was quick to dismiss the general's argument, saying the US should compel allies to pay for the entirety.More recently, the GOP nominee has butted heads with the military over the Iraqi-led campaign to reclaim the city of Mosul from ISIS.For weeks, Trump has lambasted the coalition effort, calling the undertaking a ""total disaster"" and saying the US and its allies were ""bogged-down"" there even as defense officials say they are encouraged by the progress being made.Trump's repeated criticisms have concentrated largely on the amount of information made public about the Mosul fight.""Did we give Mosul enough advanced notice?"" he asked rhetorically during a Monday rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. ""Whatever happened to the element of surprise?""But the commander of the US-led coalition fighting ISIS, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, pushed back on the assessment, albeit without mentioning Trump directly.""I don't see any evidence that it's bogged down at all,"" Townsend told CNN's Michael Holmes. ""Whoever is saying that I don't know where they're getting it, I don't see that.""Townsend was also doubtful whether complete secrecy could be maintained during a campaign as big as Mosul.""It's just really hard to move 40,000 troops into position from you know, from middle Iraq to northern Iraq, and maintain complete secrecy. It's almost next to impossible,"" he said. ""I would tell you I know this: The enemy was surprised.""Despite the differences, though, Trump has maintained that he enjoys widespread support from the military and showed little sign of concern about his relationship with military brass should he become their boss.""I have been endorsed largely, conceptually at least, by the military,"" Trump told a local Florida TV station last month.The military, however, does not endorse candidates. Trump also hinted that he might replace a significant number of senior military leaders not to his liking. Asked in September if he would seek a plan for fighting ISIS from generals who he has already claimed to know more than, Trump told NBC, ""They'll probably be different generals, to be honest with you."""

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/election-2016-world-series/index.html	"A World Series game seven for the ages offered some rare relief from the most bitter presidential election in recent memory.The Chicago Cubs, in carrying off their first title since 1908 when Theodore Roosevelt was president, finally proved that no curse is forever and offered a few moments of hope fulfilled and optimism — two qualities badly lacking from this grimmest of presidential races.And the Cleveland Indians, falling just short of their NBA brethren in a championship year for their city, at least offered some distraction for Ohioans assailed by a divisive swing state election campaign.The notion of baseball as a metaphor for life has become a little trite over the years. But this World Series transfixed the country, harkening back to an earlier America where political divisions were less pronounced, before media splintered along ideological lines and the proliferation of personal screens in every pocket made cathartic and unifying national cultural moments so rare.Opinion: Why America needed this Cubs winAnd the final night played out in the critical battleground state of Ohio, making the moment all the more poignant by creating a unified space days before the election.But even the nerve-jangling night in Cleveland did not completely escape the fury of an election cycle that at last is in its final days. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton took out hard hitting political ads during the broadcast. That's not surprising since the presidential race is heading into the equivalent of its own game seven — a presidential race that could be decided on election night with polls tightening.OmensIf Trump and Clinton were seeking an omen from Wednesday night's thrilling showdown, there was something for both of them.For Trump, it's proof that lightning can strike — after all many Cubs fans thought that the Cubbies were fated never to win again.For America to elect a president with no previous political experience would seem to require a stunning long shot of similar proportions.Clinton might seek inspiration from the Cubs' status as the pre-season favorite who prevailed through a long season to win it all.Just as she was the prohibitive front-runner for her general election clash against Trump, so were the Cubs singled out by a majority of MLB.com and ESPN baseball experts during spring training as the World Series favorite.The Democratic nominee has warm memories of going to Wrigley Field with her father as a kid. But her allegiances became a political issue when she morphed into a Yankees fan when she ran for the Senate seat from New York.Photos: At last, Cubs win!Critics at the time complained her switch was symptomatic of a politician who chases popularity over principle.Clinton took to Twitter after the Cubs victory.""They did it! 108 years later and the drought is finally over. Way to make history, @Cubs. #FlyTheW -H,"" Clinton said — no doubt with an eye to emulating her childhood team by making her own history on Tuesday.Warning for ClintonBut there's also a warning for Clinton in looking for omens. The last Democratic nominee to see his team break a decades-long curse ended up losing a close general election. That happened to John Kerry after his Boston Red Sox broke the Curse of the Bambino and won the World Series in 2004.Trump has yet to react to the Cubs victory, perhaps because he has history with the Ricketts family, which owns the team. In February, the billionaire lashed out at the Ricketts for contributing to his rivals in the Republican primary, tweeting ""They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!""6 ways Trump could win 270 electoral votesHe later told the Washington Post editorial board that he would take out ads ""telling them all what a rotten job they're doing with the Chicago Cubs.""More recently however, the Ricketts family has come on board, backing Trump through a super PAC.Another top politician who couldn't help but comment on the Cubs was the most famous fan of the crosstown White Sox — President Barack Obama.The President jabbed Cubs devotees over how long it took them to win the World Series trophy.""I was watching something on television, they explained that the last time the Cubs had won, Thomas Edison was alive and they hadn't even invented sliced bread yet,"" Obama said Thursday in Florida during a rally for Clinton. ""So you know the expression 'this is the greatest thing since sliced bread?' This is actually, for Cubs fans, the greatest things since sliced bread!""But there's one parallel between the fabulous game seven in Cleveland that no one wants to see mirrored after this painful presidential election: extra innings."
