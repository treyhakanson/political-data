Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and one of the chamber's most experienced foreign policy hands, said the attempt by a foreign country to interfere with the US voting process needs better understanding and a vigorous response.""Assuming for a moment that we do believe that the Russian government was controlling outside organizations that hacked into our election, they should be punished,"" Graham told reporters Tuesday. Referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Graham added that, ""Putin should be punished.""Graham, who wants the hearings to examine all Russia's ""misadventures throughout the world,"" has the support of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As other Republicans issued warnings about Russian activities, the hearings could become a source of tension between the GOP and the new President.""You could see, going forward, a Congress that's really at loggerheads with the White House on policy toward Russia,"" said Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University.Trump's AmericaGraham, who ran against Trump in the Republican primaries, admitted that ""clearly Donald and me have issues."" But he added that he'll do ""everything I can to help him because he will be commander in chief in dangerous times."" Russia, Graham said, is a ""bad actor.""To that end, Graham said hearings into Russia's activities should also address Moscow's annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine, its cyberattacks against US allies, and examine whether Russia is guilty of war crimes due to its intervention and bombing campaign in Syria.Splits on RussiaThere have been splits on Russia in the past between Trump and fellow Republicans. GOP lawmakers have long called for the US to arm Ukrainian forces fighting Russian-backed rebels in the eastern part of the country. But the Trump campaign stripped that language from the Republican platform before the party's national convention in July, angering some lawmakers.The intelligence assessment about Russian hacking during the election highlighted an even more dramatic split between Trump and many in his party. In an October 7 statement, the US intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security announced they were ""confident that the Russian Government directed"" the theft of emails from US institutions including the Democratic National Committee and individuals, including Democratic campaign officials. Those emails were later leaked by groups such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the online persona Guccifer 2.0. Yet during the campaign, Trump said he didn't accept the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was behind the hack, suggesting instead that it ""could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.""Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said early classified assessments he saw were inconclusive. Donald Trump's team of bitter rivals""But do I personally think Russia's somewhere in the mix? Yes."" Corker said he was ""all for more fully understanding what happened"" through hearings.Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the vice-presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket with Hillary Clinton, said the investigation would be well worth it. ""It's really important to know what a foreign government was trying to do to influence this election,"" Kaine said. 'Stop it from happening again'""Just the knowledge that it happened isn't the same as knowing everything about how it happened,"" Kaine said. ""Knowing how it happened can help everybody protect themselves, a lot of insight can come from that. It can stop it from happening again.""In Russia, there's a widespread sense that Trump's election will bolster ties with the US, leading to better trade and economic relations and perhaps the easing of sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea.Trump has repeatedly praised Putin as a strong leader and speaks of the need for better relations with Moscow. Putin was one of the earliest leaders to congratulate Trump on his victory, and has said he wants to improve relations with the US.Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday ""we should put as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections.""Graham urged Republicans not get sidetracked by the fact that the hacks may have helped their party. His fellow GOP lawmakers shouldn't ""let allegations against a foreign government interfering in our election process go unanswered because it may have been beneficial to our cause,"" he said."

Activists on the front lines of fighting racism say it denotes white domination and superiority.Promoting the interest of whitesOren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism, said white nationalism is a term for a form of white supremacy or separatism.Its supporters defend ""country by white racial identity."" They promote the interests of whites exclusively and denigrate all others.""Bannon established himself as the chief curator of news for the alt-right,"" he said. ""And when you descrbe Breibart as a platform for the alt-right that's not insignificant.""""Under his stewardship, Breitbart emerged as a leading source for the extreme views of a vocal minority who peddle bigotry and hate.""White dominationMark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the term white nationalism means white domination. It isn't necessarily an endorsement of a 100% pure white society, a goal now regarded by the far right as unrealistic, he said. ""White nationalism is more the idea that whites should dominate,"" he said, that the culture should dominate and policies that jibe with the idea should be supported, such as opposing nonwhite immigration.White nationalists believe the country ""should be built by and for white people."" They ""tend to be less about ethnic slurs, less about Nazi slurs, tend to speak more academic language."" Some people who embrace the white nationalist identity refer to themselves as ""race realists"" -- generally speaking, that means people who believe the races can't live together. They may also call themselves ""Identitarians,"" a movement that emerged last decade on the French far right. The movement is linked to the opposition to multiculturalism and anti-Islam attitudes.'The people I'm describing don't live in Washington'Paul Gottfried is the former Horace Raffensperger professor of humanities at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. He is also the president of the H.L. Mencken Club, which calls itself a ""society for the independent right.""He said ""white nationalism is more often used by the left than on the alternative right"" and that ""white Identitarian"" and ""race realist"" are the terms more common on the alt-rightGottfried rejected the view that Bannon is a racist, an anti-Semite, a white Identitarian or race realist. Instead, Gottfried said, Bannon comes from the world of Washington politics and journalism.""The people I'm describing don't live in Washington,"" he said, when making reference to race realists and Identitarians. ""I don't think he knows any of those people.""'I like the term alt-right'A major voice of the alt-right is Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute and the editor of Radix Journal. He defines ""white nationalism"" as a U.S.-focused movement concerning white racial consciousness and identity.""I don't use the term white nationalist to describe myself,"" he said. ""I understand it's a fairly fair term. Obviously white refers to race, of European descent.""To the extent that nationalism means caring for one's family, that is a good thing, he said.But the word ""nationalism"" reflects deep-seated historical grudges, ""ethno-nationalism,"" in which Europeans warred with one another.""We want to get beyond these things,"" Spencer said. ""I like the term alt-right. It has an openness to it. And immediately understandable. We're coming from a new perspective.""He prefers the terms Identitarian and alt-right.Alt-right, he said, ""has a new starting point from conventional conservative. That was the origin of it."" ""It's been filled out and come into its own. It's an Identitarian movement. Race realism is a component of it. It's an understanding of European identity.""Distancing themselves from white supremacyDaryl Johnson is the owner of DT Analytics, with DT standing for domestic terrorism. He is a security consultant and a former counterterrorism expert at the Department of Homeland Security. Johnson was the primary author of a 2009 report about right-wing extremism that drew fierce outrage on the right.White nationalism is a ""new buzzword,"" Johnson said, but the first time he saw the term was in ""white supremacy literature."" The far rightists used ""white nationalism"" to appear more credible and patriotic, Johnson said, and the term detracts from the stereotypes conjured by white supremacy. But make no mistake, he argued, white nationalism is a euphemism. ""They want to distance themselves from white supremacy,"" he said."	White nationalism, what is it?

And a move to purge some transition advisers and employees has further slowed the process of getting the incoming administration off the blocks.So-called landing teams, which President Barack Obama installed at federal agencies within days of the election for his own transition, had been expected to arrive in DC Monday. But Vice President-elect Pence's takeover of the team caused a cascade of delays.Trump denies inquiry about security clearance for kidsChristie had signed the official document -- a memorandum of understanding -- with the Obama administration to run the Trump transition, meaning a new copy was needed with Pence's signature. That paperwork didn't arrive until Tuesday evening, White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said.Trump's team will announce the first teams -- for the Justice Department and national security agencies -- Thursday, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Wednesday night. Economic and domestic policy teams will be announced next week. But it was not immediately when those officials will actually arrive at agencies in Washington.The White House was still waiting Wednesday night on names from the transition of the individuals who will form the landing teams.""Once we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts as we continue our work to facilitate the transition to the next administration,"" Hoffine said.In addition to the names, the transition will need to certify the individuals are free of conflicts of interest and paperwork from the team members that they meet the criteria of the transition code of conduct. And transition officials going into the most sensitive agencies, like the national security community, will need a pre-clearance to go in, which requires an entry-level investigation, said David Eagles, director of the Center for Presidential Transition, a nonprofit dedicated to the smooth transfer of power and good governance. For less sensitive agencies, all that is required is a quick background check, similar to what the White House might conduct on anyone seeking entrance.The State Department and Pentagon have said on the record they have had no contact with any member of the transition staff. Many of the remaining civilian agencies have said on background that they have not or have referred CNN to the White House statement from Hoffine. Pence's move to clean house in the transition team, removing selected lobbyists, people who have breached protocol, not lived up to standards or leaked information to the outside world, is also slowing things up. Several individuals who were leading agency teams according to an internal organizational chart obtained prior to the shakeup have been registered lobbyists, meaning new individuals will have to be identified.Trump's team says things are going well. ""We're going to get the transition team where we need it to be,"" spokesman Jason Miller told reporters in Trump Tower on Wednesday. ""It's going to be a team that will be able to put in place the exact type of team that President-elect Trump wants to have in.""Trump tweeted Tuesday night that the process is ""organized.""Who's in, who's out?Given the new ban on lobbyists Pence announced Tuesday -- a term the Trump team has not defined -- K Street -- the hub of lobbying in Washington -- is trying to determine who's in and who's out.Some sources on K Street were under the impression that the lobbying ban only applied to the landing teams -- staffers assigned to join transition offices in each federal agency to begin learning the ropes and preparing for a handoff -- and not policy staffers.Trump and Pence's offices did not respond to questions about the transition team lobbyist ban.What is clear is that some aides who were a key part of the effort are out.Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who was leading national security, was asked to leave the transition, and it was not clear who would replace him. Two people working with Rogers were also out: Matthew Freedman, a former DIA innovation adviser and former Bush transition official, was focused on the National Security Council, and Kevin O'Connor, a former Bush administration official at the Department of Justice, was working on DOJ. Freedman was fired in part for using his company's email address to make foreign contacts on behalf of the Trump transition, a source familiar said. O'Connor was said to be pushed out for his connections to the old transition leadership. Energy lobbyist Mike McKenna, who had been tasked with the Energy Department was also out over leaks, according to a source. According to a review of the chart, at least six other agency leads have been a lobbyist, and more have had ties to lobbying businesses. On the policy side of the transition, a review of the chart shows that eight out of 17 names listed have been registered lobbyists at one time.It's unclear what definition or timeframe the transition will use. A document dated November 10 apparently from the transition obtained by Politico required transition staffers to pledge they would not work on any transition area ""if I have engaged in regulated lobbying activities with respect to such matter, as defined by the Lobbying Disclosure Act, within the previous 12 months.""Who could be in Trump's CabinetThat alone would disqualify several of the staff on the organizational chart, including some who were leading agency teams. Trump has also pledged to introduce ethics reforms that would expand the definition of lobbying to cut down on the revolving door in Washington, but it's unclear whether that would apply to his transition.Foreign governments struggling to reach TrumpThe confusion extends outside the US. One close US ally had to reach out to multiple contacts in the Trump world before successfully arranging a phone call between the President-elect and their head of state, a diplomatic source told CNN. The call finally took place a full day after his victory and after Trump had spoken to other leaders. This diplomatic source said the delay did not spark anger as much as confusion as to how to establish contact with the incoming president.The State Department has not heard from the transition to coordinate at all, State Department spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday.Trump's transition released a list of 29 foreign or international leaders that they said the President-elect and Vice President-elect have spoken with. However, that list did not specify if all the leaders spoke with both men, or some only spoke with Trump or Pence.Frank Gaffney says he's not on Trump's teamOne person says he's definitively not on the team. Frank Gaffney, an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist, denied a media report that he had been named to Trump's transition crew.""An unattributed quote appeared in the press yesterday indicating that I had been appointed to the Trump transition team,"" Gaffney, the founder of the Center for Security Policy, said in a statement. ""In fact, I had not been contacted by anyone from the team and appreciate the campaign's clarification today that the previous day's reports were inaccurate. I look forward to helping the President-elect and the national security-minded team he is assembling in whatever way I can.""The Southern Poverty Law Center called Gaffney ""one of America's most notorious Islamophobes."" Gaffney in 2009 suggested that Barack Obama had become ""America's first Muslim president."""	Why hasn't Trump's transition team called the Pentagon?
4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/trump-transition-jared-kushner-chris-christie/index.html	"His opponent then, in the early 2000s, was the billionaire real estate developer Charles Kushner. Also a prominent Democratic political donor, Kushner's criminal tax evasion and witness tampering case won Christie, then a US attorney, triumphant headlines in the country's largest media market.More than ten years later, first as Donald Trump's Republican primary campaign gained traction and now as the President-elect stitches together his administration, Christie has again found himself seated across from a Kushner -- one seemingly determined to curb his ambitions and frustrate his plans at every turn.This time around, though, it is Jared Kushner, son of Charles, and husband to Ivanka Trump. The younger Kushner has emerged as one of Trump's most trusted advisers and a power broker inside what has been a tumultuous transition process. Sources have put Kushner, 35, at the center of pitched ""infighting"" over the composition and direction of the team, most notably the dismissal of Christie, who was displaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and his earlier hires.RELATED: Kushner at the center of Trump transition 'infighting,' sources say""There are people who are in and people who are out,"" former Congressman Mike Rogers, who was ousted on Monday, told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday night. ""And the people who have been asked to move on have some relationship with Chris Christie.""Trump fought back against the depiction that his transition team was having issues, tweeting Wednesday. ""Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!"" Trump's surrogates have also publicly dismissed the idea of infighting to reporters. Kushner was a student when Christie took on his father. In 2014, he told The Real Deal, a New York real estate news publication, that the case put him off a career in criminal law.Here's how he described the experience:""My dad's arrest made me realize I didn't want to be a prosecutor anymore,"" he said. ""The law is so nuanced. If you're convicting murderers, it's one thing. It's often fairly clear. When you get into things like white-collar crime, there are often a lot of nuances. Seeing my father's situation, I felt what happened was obviously unjust in terms of the way they pursued him. I just never wanted to be on the other side of that and cause pain to the families I was doing that to, whether right or wrong. The moral weight of that was probably a bit more than I could carry.""The ""obviously unjust"" pursuit, as Kushner put it, was carried out by Christie and his office. And the prosecutor, in his public statements at the time, did not seem particularly concerned with massaging the family's wounds.After Charles Kushner pleaded guilty to 16 counts of tax evasion, one count of retaliating against a federal witness -- his brother-in-law (more on that below) -- and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission, Christie put out a statement calling the deal a ""great victory for the people of New Jersey.""Months later, Christie went a step further, expressing his pleasure in triumphant terms when Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison. The punishment, he said at the time, ""sends a strong message that when you commit the vile and heinous acts that he has committed, you will be caught and punished.""The statement landed not only a rhetorical twist of the knife, but called to mind the absurd revenge plot hatched and executed by Charles Kushner in December 2003.Under investigation at the time for making illegal campaign contributions, Kushner targeted his brother-in-law, William Schulder, a former employee turned witness for federal prosecutors in their case against the Democratic donor.In retaliation, Kushner hired a prostitute to lure Schulder into having sex in a Bridgewater, New Jersey, motel room as a hidden camera rolled. A tape of the encounter was then sent to Kushner's sister and Schulder's wife, Esther.Ultimately, the intimidation stunt failed. The Schulders brought the video to prosecutors, who tracked down the call girl and threatened her with arrest. She promptly turned on Kushner. Less than a year later, Christie announced the details of the plea deal. In its aftermath, Jared would take over his father's commercial interests, purchase the weekly New York Observer newspaper, which he still owns, and lead the Kushner Companies' $1.8 billion purchase of 666 Fifth Avenue in 2007. That same year he would meet a young woman, also the child of a controversial real estate mogul, named Ivanka Trump during a business lunch."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/climate-change-donald-trump/index.html	"Trump's ascendance is threatening not to simply undo a series of already tenuous international agreements, but give a boost to interests opposed to fossil fuel regulation, while amplifying voices who express doubt -- or outright deny -- that climate change is real. It is. Scientists agree people are causing climate change primarily by burning fossil fuels, and the longterm consequences are expected to be disastrous.""""The disaster that Donald Trump represents for the climate cannot be understated,"" Jamie Henn, a spokesman for 350.org, a leading environmental action group, told CNN on Tuesday. ""He is the only head of state in the world who is an all-out climate denier and he has the most radical, anti-environmental policies of anyone to ever assume the role of the presidency.""Here are the four centers of concern -- right now:1. Trump plans to resist the Paris climate dealThe Paris Climate Agreement became international law November 4, days before Trump scored his upset defeat of Hillary Clinton. But the non-binding deal is still very much a work in progress. Negotiators are gathered now in Marrakech, Morocco, in an effort to implement its historic framework.While the Trump administration does not have the authority to ""cancel"" the international pact, as the now President-elect pledged during the campaign, it is reportedly looking for ways out and could, because individual countries set their own standards, effectively remove the US from the process. ""If one party decides to withdraw that it doesn't call the agreement into question,"" Moroccan foreign minister Salaheddine Mezouar said at a news conference last weekend in an effort to downplay the new administration's potential action -- or inaction.But a US reversal would likely also cause other major carbon emitting nations, like China or India, to at least slow their own efforts. 2. Obama's ""Clean Power Plan"" under threatThe keystone of the US plan to meet its Paris accord commitments is currently tied up in federal courts, with the Environmental Protection Agency fighting a legal challenge from nearly two dozen states, the Chamber of Commerce and coal-mining companies.During the campaign, Trump framed the ""Clean Power Plan,"" which promises a nearly 32% reduction in domestic greenhouse emissions by 2030, as a job-killer he would be quick to scuttle.""This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plants in America,"" Trump said during a September speech. ""They're shutting down all over the country.""The crux of the plan, though, should it survive the court challenge, relies on the authority and willingness of the EPA to carry out its mandate. Trump could easily decline that and seek to roll it back during his term.3. Trump picked a leading climate denier to head the EPA transitionTrump's decision to install Myron Ebell as the head of his EPA transition team sent shivers through the activist community.Ebell, though not a scientist, has emerged as one of the world's foremost climate deniers. As the Paris pact entered its final (and successful) stage of negotiations at an international conference in December 2015, his face was one of seven pasted, mug shot-style, outside hotels in the French capital. A few months before that, he wrote in a blog post that Obama's ""Clean Power Plan"" was ""illegal"" and lamented the gains likely to be incurred by ""renewable energy producers"" at the expense of coal and natural gas.Now the man activists call a ""climate criminal,"" and who has said that climate change is ""phony"" and a bogus ""pretext for expanding government,"" has been given the power to staff the federal agency most often tasked with monitoring and enforcing actions to slow or reverse it.4. Trump himself is a climate denier ""He believes that global warming is naturally occurring,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" the morning after the first presidential debate. The issue came up because Hillary Clinton had, the night before, said that her opponent ""thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.""Trump made the claim on Twitter in 2012, almost four years to the day he was elected, writing, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""It is a thread he has kept up for years, often through skeptical tweets. ""It's late in July and it is really cold outside in New York,"" he wrote in July 2014. ""Where the hell is GLOBAL WARMING??? We need some fast! It's now CLIMATE CHANGE.""And on a cold January evening in 2015, he asked, ""Where the hell is global warming when you need it?""Trump has said he was ""joking"" about the Chinese conspiracy theory, but in multiple public statements has framed policies designed to combat climate change as a threat to American industry.""I am not a believer in climate change,"" he told CNN in September 2015. ""You have rain, and you have beautiful days. But I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country."""	Climate change worries escalate as Trump elevates top deniers

It happened in the campaign and there's no reason to think his presidency won't be the same.Trump has only been President-elect for a week. But he's already dismembered the team that under Chris Christie spent months preparing the transition and put his future vice president Mike Pence in charge. He's set up future competing power centers in his White House, including son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner, who is at the center of the effort against Christie, sources say. And though he's been restrained on social media, Trump has still fired off contradictory tweets on protests against him and the Electoral College.It's clear the President-elect is just getting started.Trump is the only person elected to the top job without political, diplomatic or military executive experience. And he ran a campaign rooted in breaking the mold of the gridlocked capital city. So no surprise that Trump is already approaching his presidency in an unorthodox manner. Who could be in Trump's cabinet?""He comes from from a different school of thought than we are used to here in Washington. People here, they want everything choreographed. They are by nature risk averse. He is going to be very different from that perspective,"" said Howard Schweitzer, managing partner of Cozen O'Connor Public Strategies, who had high level posts in the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations.""He is not going to be afraid, nor should he be, to throw some spaghetti against the wall and see if it sticks. He is not afraid to have people with differing views on his team and play around with some things and throw people overboard if merited,"" Schweitzer added.While Trump's transition appears chaotic from the outside, the President-elect Tuesday night tweeted that things are ""organized"" and proceeding apace. ""Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!""But Peter Emerson, a Democratic communications consultant who took part in the Jimmy Carter and Obama White House transitions, said if Trump Tower wanted to make things run more smoothly, it could.""If the Trump people wanted it to be the no drama Obama transition then Trump would make it happen -- but they don't,"" he said.Meetings, more meetings and leaksWannabe White House advisers and would-be cabinet members are streaming in and out of Trump Tower in New York. Tuesday's day of meetings was for going over cabinet names and plans for various departments, a source tells CNN.""This was a 'dig in with a CEO who knows how to get things done day,'"" said the source, who called it ""very productive.""Pence, meanwhile, is scheduled to visit the Trump transition offices in Washington Wednesday morning.But leaks regarding potential administration appointments proliferate by the hour, about Trump loyalists who are angling for jobs and others apparently trying to elbow their way into his administration.Top figures are ruling themselves in and ruling themselves out of jobs. Rudy Giuliani, seen as a possible attorney general, says he won't do the job, and sources say he wants the State Department. Ben Carson, who had been seen as a possible Cabinet pick, says he doesn't want to be considered. Another Trump presidential rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, visited him Tuesday as well.Rumors are flying about already bitter internecine warfare already raging between various parts of Trump world, the role of the billionaire's children and sources inside the operation are using phrases like ""knife-fight"" and ""buffoonery"" to describe the spectacle.One establishment figure, former Rep. Mike Rogers, seen as a rare safe of hands in Trump's orbit and a possible CIA chief has quit -- apparently a casualty of too close ties to now out-of-favor Christie.There are also signs of disarray in the Trump foreign policy shop, such as it is.""After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming ""you LOST!"" Will be ugly,"" said Eliot Cohen, a former George W. Bush foreign policy official in a tweet Tuesday.Trump has only made two appointments so far: Reince Priebus will serve as White House Chief of Staff and far more controversially, Stephen Bannon, who has close ties to the white nationalist alt-right movement, will be a counselor and senior adviser to Trump.Anyone who thinks that the wails of protest among political elites at Bannon's suitability to grace the White House would sway Trump were not watching his populist, convention-busting campaign closely.The contrast between the buttoned up, intricately choreographed transition minuets by the future Bush and Barack Obama administrations could not be more pronounced.From Washington, it all looks chaotic, disorganized and made up on the fly and utterly at odds with the conventional wisdom about how best to prepare a presidency.""They are choosing to not have Trump lay down the law,"" Emerson said, arguing Trump was the first reality show president of the Kardashian era.""In previous transitions its been top-heavy -- that is to say either the president or his designated adviser have said no leakage to the press we are going to do everything internally,"" he added.What's it mean for Trump's Oval Office?The question that will arise as the transition moves ahead over the coming weeks is if Trump's instinctive, gut level, improvisational management style is suited not just to the job of building an administration but to the presidency itself. On the one hand, the business of policymaking, enacting an agenda and maintaining alliances with friends abroad requires a high level of planning and execution for which Trump seems ill prepared.After all, in running his family business, Trump has had to answer to no one but himself, and has the freedom to do what he wants when he wants, something the President, with all the constraints on his power, rarely has the option to do.""For sure he is going to have to adapt to Washington but Washington is going to have to adapt to him,"" said Schweitzer.'Knife fight' as Trump builds an unconventional national security Cabinet""The sacred cows that people here hold so dearly are not going to be as sacred to him,"" Schweitzer said, though added ""I do think he will have to adapt. He is going to find out that the reality of governing is very different from the reality of even being in government or not having any power. ""Some Republicans are watching the media coverage of the last few days, and predictions of strife to come between Priebus and Bannon especially, a sensing a bit of a double standard.""This whole conversation is something that speaks to Trump supporters and Republicans who think they can't get a fair shake,"" said Doug Heye, a former Republican National Committee communications director on CNN Tuesday.""In 2008, at this point, when there were internal divisions, in the Obama transition, we were told it was a team of rivals and something to be applauded,"" Heye said.

Rick Santorum praised the idea of Urban running the RNC in a tweet, writing: ""Hope rumor @DavidJUrban may be #RNC Chair is true. West Point, decorated in combat, solid blue collar conservative from Steel town in WPA.""The President doesn't choose the RNC chair -- the candidate must run and be selected by its membership. But approval from the President helps the person's case."	Dave Urban to be considered as RNC chair, sources say

It was those forces that propelled Donald Trump to electoral victory in the United States last week, a fact Obama tacitly acknowledged even as he promoted a forward looking agenda. ""We can't look backward for answers, we have to look forward,"" Obama said, adding that progress must be mitigated by citizens' well being. ""If people feel like they're loosing control of their future, they'll push back,"" Obama said. On his final overseas swing as President, Obama faced urgent questions from his counterparts about Trump's victory and his plans for the US going forward. Obama has attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, insisting Trump remains committed to transatlantic ties and NATO, despite the Republican businessman's statements during the campaign.Obama repeated his assertion Wednesday that the US commitment to NATO and Europe would continue under Trump's presidency, saying the treaty to protect allies was ironclad.""I am confident that just as America's commitment to the transatlantic alliance has endured, whether under a Democratic or a Republican administration, that commitment will continue. Including our pledge and our treaty obligation to defend every ally,"" Obama said.Obama insisted that people deserve the right to choose their governments and leaders.""Democracy can be especially complicated. Believe me. I know,"" Obama said. ""But it is better than the alternatives because it allows us to peacefully work through our differences and move closer to our ideals.""He said a system where people choose their leaders is naturally self-correcting, allowing citizens opportunities to change course if a party or system isn't working.""It allows us to correct for mistakes,"" he said. ""Any action by a president or any result of an election or any legislation that has proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy.""He lent symbolism to his commitment to democratic ideals Wednesday when he climbed the Acropolis in central Athens and toured the Parthenon, the 2,500-year-old temple built by ancient Greeks dedicated to the goddess Athena. He also toured the museum constructed near to site that houses antiquities from the era.It's the final stage for Obama's two-day stop in Athens, where he was the first US president to visit in 17 years. He came to discuss the nation's persistent debt issues and its program for admitting refugees, though at a news conference Tuesday he also addressed Trump's election to succeed him in January.RELATED: Obama's last trip: Addressing a divided EuropeThe previous day, Obama advocated for debt relief from Europe and an end to austerity-only measures to help the economy recover, though it's not clear where Trump will stand on those issues when he assumes office next year.""I've been clear from the beginning of this crisis that in order to make reforms sustainable, the Greek economy needs the space to return to growth and start creating jobs again,"" Obama said. ""We cannot simply look to austerity as a strategy and it is incredibly important that the Greek people see improvements in their daily lives so that they can carry with them the hope that their lives will get better.""Speaking alongside Obama, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras linked austerity practices to a wave of isolationism that has swept Europe in the past several years, suggesting restrictive spending policies could lead to an ""increasing trend in skepticism and inward-looking, which is a threat to modern democracies.""""The insistence of European leaders to austerity policies keeps the European economy strapped in stagnation. And it therefore brings about huge political and social problems,"" he said. In his speech Tuesday, Obama also lauded Greece for its role in housing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who are fleeing the civil war. Many have passed through Greece on their way to Europe, and Obama has called for countries to accept more refugees in an attempt to alleviate the crisis.RELATED: Greece's 'warehouse of souls:' Refugees stuck in old stadiums, derelict airportTrump, meanwhile, has been sharply critical of Obama's plans for refugees, insisting he'll stop Syrian migration into the United States until stricter background checks can be put in place to prevent terrorists from entering the country."

He is currently described as the frontrunner for the position.Giuliani also earned millions of dollars in speaking fees from more than 100 groups in 2006 and 2007, including big US banks, oil giants and foreign companies.One matter should be familiar from his 2008 presidential campaign: a possible link between his former massive law firm, Bracewell Giuliani, and a Venezuelan oil company. The firm represented Citgo Oil, which is a subsidiary of the state-owned oil company in Venezuela.Giuliani is also likely to be criticized for of his work for the government of Qatar, which hired Giuliani to help with intelligence security. The firm also had offices in the United Arab Emirates and worked on financial deals for other nations in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.Bracewell Giuliani had hundreds of attorneys employed across the US and the world, with foreign contracts spanning the globe and tens of millions of dollars in contract fees. Other work was through another company of his, Giuliani Security.Those contracts include work combating crime in Mexico City, El Salvador, Colombia, Chile, along with helping political candidates in Ukraine and the Dominican Republic.Some critics are already seizing on the paper trail. Rand Paul, a Republican opposed to the interventionism supported by Giuliani, deemed them a problem.""I think it's a bit worrisome -- some of his ties to foreign governments,"" Paul said. ""Because that was a big complaint from many of us about Hillary Clinton and her ties and money she received from foreign governments. So whether or not you have divided loyalty obviously is very important.""During the general election campaign, Giuliani frequently intoned against Clinton's influence-peddling around the world, most of which centered on the charity work by the Clinton Foundation. He called the philanthropy a ""racketeering enterprise"" and alleged that she turned the State Department into a pay-for-play operation.""Giuliani also slammed Clinton for earning millions of dollars in paid speeches.But the former New York City mayor earned a net total of $9,195,000 in speaking fees from more than 100 groups in just 2006 and 2007, according to the 2007 personal financial disclosure form he released during his 2008 presidential campaign.Giuliani earned $60,000 in speaking fees from Shell Oil Products and the same amount from Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars from big banks including JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse.He also pulled in $200,000 from an Icelandic telecommunications company Siminn and $200,000 from a Polish research group.The biggest check he earned came from Sage Capital Group, a New York private equity group."
