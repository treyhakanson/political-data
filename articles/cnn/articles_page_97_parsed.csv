Will they not accept the result? The only violence I saw the last day was perpetrated on a Republican headquarters in North Carolina. Somebody firebombed it, I doubt it was a Republican.""Over the weekend a GOP office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, was firebombed and vandalized, spray-painted with a swastika and the words ""Nazi Republicans get out of town or else"" on an adjacent building, according to local officials.Mike Pence: On his ownTrump -- without evidence -- blamed the firebombing on Clinton supporters on Sunday night.""Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP,"" Trump tweeted.""Well that's his position,"" Conway said when asked by Blitzer about Trump's tweet. ""But again, CNN for a week now plus has been covering things as if there is evidence. You've had accusers with their allegations.""Conway was referencing the accusations of sexual assault against Trump that have come after release of a video of Trump captured on a hot mic talking about women in a sexually aggressive and lewd way.Conway said that if ""women want to lodge their complaints, they have avenues to do that.""When asked to follow up on that specific remark, Conway said: ""I'm not encouraging anyone to (go to court).""Trump on women's appearancesConway told Blitzer she wouldn't have said the things Trump did about the looks of the women accusing him of misconduct.

""Clinton bullied Monica Lewinsky so badly she started a foundation to help other victims of bullying, not to mention Clinton's bullying of Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones.""The ad is the latest in a string of ads that hit Clinton while arguing for more positivity in the United States, hoping to counter the Trump campaign's strategy of increased negativity with the hopes of depressing turnout. Clinton's top aides have worried that Trump's strategy -- which one Trump aide described as ""war"" -- will impact the excitement people have in this election and keep the Republican nominee competitive.RELATED: Clinton campaign pushes back against suggestion Trump negativity will depress turnout"	New Hillary Clinton ad comparesTrump to famous movie bullies	['Jones', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Lawrence']	[]

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/arizona-election-2016-voting-rights/index.html	"Last month a federal judge declined to enjoin the law for now ruling that the challengers had not shown that it would ""disparately impact"" minority voters. ""Deference to the judgments made by Arizona's elected representatives in exercising their constitutionally prescribed authority to regulate elections is, therefore, required,"" Judge Douglas L. Rayes of the the US District Court for the District of Arizona said.But in an unusual order, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday agreed to hear an expedited appeal with briefs due from both sides by close of business Monday. The court has scheduled oral arguments for October 19.""This litigation is a good example of the clash between Republican elective operatives who say they are trying to root out voter fraud and Democratic leaning activists who are trying to open access to the ballot as much as possible,"" said election law expert Joshua A. Douglas at the University of Kentucky College of Law. In Arizona, voters can request an early ballot to be sent to them before the election. The voters can then mail it back or drop it off at a polling locations as long as it is received by 7 p.m. on Election Day.Democrats in the state argue that thousands -- particularly those in towns near the border and in native American reservations without reliable mail service -- have relied upon having their ballot collected by organizers in past years to ensure the ballots are received on time.""Over the years, many voters have adopted the practice of dropping off their ballots at local Democratic Party offices, which may be closer than their polling place, so that their ballots could be turned in by party officials, staff or volunteers,""  said Spencer G. Scharff, voter protection director at the Arizona Democratic Party.""This practice, which H.B. 2023 criminalizes, is especially prevalent in communities that have experienced state-sanctioned discrimination and thus prefer to entrust party officials to ensure that their ballots are counted,"" he said.Arizona Republicans passed a law in March of 2016, banning the practice.The law makes it a felony, punishable by a year in jail and $150,000 to knowingly collect ""voted or unvoted early ballots"" from another person. It provides for an exception for family members or caregivers.In briefs, lawyers for the Arizona Democratic Party point to the fact that some county election officials have told the media that they will be unable to implement the law in time for the next election, but the challengers argue that Republican Party activists will use the law as an ""excuse to interrogate, follow and otherwise harass voters who appear at polling locations to drop off multiple ballots.""In a brief filed by the Arizona Republican Party and joined by the Arizona attorney general, lawyers call the law a ""well-reasoned"" safeguard to a ""fair and transparent election."" They argue that the challengers ""have not and cannot meet their burden to overcome the important regulatory interests protecting voters and ensuring an orderly and fair election process.""They say the law was in effect for the primary election and that the challengers could not identify ""a single voter whose ability to vote was burdened by the law. """"Indeed, even after the primary election and as the district court noted, plaintiffs have not identified a single voter whose ability to vote was burdened by H.B. 2023,"" they said.Douglas says that ballot collection is an attempt by election workers to find alternative means to allow as many people as possible the chance to vote. ""Early, voting, accompanied by ballot collection is one way to make voting more convenient,"" he said."	Voting wars continue over ballot collection law in Arizona	[]	[]

That divide could have an immediate and potentially disruptive impact on the incoming administration of either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, especially when it comes to nominations, which require Senate confirmation.""I think it would be partisanship on nitroglycerin,"" said Ron Bonjean, a veteran Republican strategist and former spokesman for both Senate and House leaders.It's a rare situation for the 228-year-old legislative body and, while the Senate historian's office recounts ""The Great Senate Deadlock of 1881"" and another smaller impasse in 1953, arguably the real precedent for figuring it out is relatively recent history that happened in the wake of the most extraordinary presidential election of modern times.While the country was on edge in late 2000 watching the Florida recount and then the front steps of the Supreme Court to hear the Bush v. Gore decision in mid-December, newly-elected and returning members of the Senate were slowly coming to grips with another issue. Despite Al Gore's failed bid for the White House, Democrats actually gained five seats to even up the balance of power in the Senate.With Dick Cheney coming in as vice president in 2001, the 50 Senate Republicans had the rightful claim to the majority with Cheney as a tie-breaking vote. But some Democrats, reeling from Gore's defeat and emboldened by their own gains -- after six years in the minority -- questioned why committee make-up should be anything other than an even divide.One of the first items of business for a new Senate is a plan for committee assignments and budgeting. It's the backbone for how the Senate does its business. Committee breakdowns have historically mirrored the make-up of the overall chamber. For example, if the Senate breakdown is 60 members in one party and 40 in the other, then a 20-member committee could be split by the same proportion of 12 to eight.The agreement for equal shares of committee seats -- Republicans held all the chairmanships -- was reached largely through a direct conversation between the two Senate leaders at the time, Mississippi Republican Trent Lott and South Dakota Democrat Tom Daschle.""Tom and I had a very good relationship. It was one based on communication and chemistry,"" Lott said. ""I have to tell you that working out that 50-50 agreement with Tom was the toughest job I ever had to do as majority leader.""""We attempted to allocate resources, committee membership, and legislative calendar matters on a 50-50 basis,"" Daschle said. ""It required virtually daily conversation and cooperation between the two leaders. We had initial opposition from members in both caucuses.""Some Republicans recoiled at the idea that Democrats would have the same number of seats on committees given that Cheney was the incoming vice president, but ultimately they agreed to the plan, which made Daschle the majority leader for 17 days in January 2001 and then turned things over to Lott once Cheney replaced Gore as vice president.""Compromise was not such a dirty word back then,"" said Bonjean, who was Lott's spokesman at the time.The outlook for a repeat scenario just 16 years later is mixed.""The optimistic view is the Senate now has a precedent for what to do in that circumstance. The pessimistic view would be, as partisan as things were then, they're more partisan now,"" said Mark Patterson, who was Daschle's policy director during the 2001 session. ""It's quite conceivable that no agreement would be reached and the Senate would be thrown into some state of gridlock or chaos.""""There were a lot of raw feelings [in 2001],"" said Rodell Mollineau, who served as a spokesman for Daschle in 2001 and later worked for Nevada Senator Harry Reid. ""I don't necessarily think you're going to have that this time.""The biggest complication for the incoming president could be getting swift confirmations for nominees and other appointments. If committees aren't up and running, then there's no way to hold hearings or send a nomination to the floor for approval. That means Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump could spend weeks or even months without confirmed cabinet members. As the Senate historian's office notes, the 1881 standoff lasted for what they describe as ""11 chaotic weeks.""A resolution could come down once again to the relationship between the two Senate leaders. Kentucky's Mitch McConnell is expected to continue to serve as his party's leader and New York's Chuck Schumer is expected to take over as Democratic leader for the retiring Reid.""I think that McConnell and Schumer might come closer to reaching a solution than Reid and McConnell would,"" said Lott. ""They haven't screwed each other yet.""Today's climate also has some different dynamics than what faced Daschle and Lott in 2001 with the rapid rise of new media platforms that have become central to shaping political fights.""We weren't beaten up with this Facebook and social media chatter that you have now,"" Lott said. Of course, the 2001 power-sharing agreement was upended just months later when longtime Republican Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the party to become an independent and caucus with the Democrats, swinging control to them with a one-seat majority in the chamber as well as on all committees except the one dealing with ethics issues.At that time, there were a handful of moderates in both parties who were casually and aggressively courted by party leaders to flip allegiances, but there are even fewer members in the ideological middle just 16 years later."	50-50 Senate a recipe for 'partisanship on nitroglycerin'	['Reid', 'Schumer', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'McConnell']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/warren-sanders-mock-trump-in-denver/index.html	"Warren called the Republican Party's presidential nominee a ""selfish little sleaze ball"" who ""will never be president of the United States."" She sought to convince millennial voters -- who have remained somewhat resistant to Clinton after her contentious primary fight with Sanders -- that his efforts to move the party left had been rewarded. ""I am proud of the debate that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton had in our primary, way to go. I am proud that we are party that doesn't debate who has the smallest hands, or who can build the longest, tallest, fake gold-plated wall in the world. I'm proud that we are not looking for the most obscene way to demean women,"" Warren said. The progressive firebrand also pointed to the 2016 Democratic platform, which included a series of policy compromises hammered out by the Sanders and Clinton camps ahead of the party's convention, as an example of what a unified party could achieve. ""Thanks to Bernie Sanders, we have the most progressive Democratic platform in American history,"" Warren said. Warren also laced into Trump over recent allegations of sexual assault, all of which Trump has denied. ""You know, I want to say this -- that some people say it makes them sick to hear Donald Trump talk like that,"" Warren said. ""Well not me. Donald Trump's words don't make me sick anymore. They make me furious.""At one point, Warren even clucked like a chicken as she mocked Trump's ongoing refusal to release his tax returns. ""The big brave Donald Trump is too chicken to release his tax returns,"" she challenged.  CNN did not immediately receive a response from the Trump campaign to a request for comment on Warren and Sanders' remarks. Flanked by Warren, Sanders also argued against Trump's candidacy by honing in on the Republican nominee's taxes.""I have been running all over this country for a year and a half talking about a corrupt tax system. And in one day, Donald Trump did more to explain the corrupt tax system to the American people than I did in a year and a half. Thank you, Donald,"" Sanders said.  ""What Donald said is, 'Yeah, I'm a multibillionaire. I've got mansions all over the world. But you know what? I, a billionaire, don't have to pay any taxes and I'm proud of it because you suckers are going to pay the taxes for me.'""Warren has been an outspoken critic of Trump throughout his presidential bid, regularly attacking the Republican nominee in sharp terms. In the last month, she's called Trump a ""nasty little bully"" with a ""dark and ugly soul"" at various campaign stops.Trump, for his part, has lived up to his reputation as a ""counter-puncher"" with regard to Warren, hitting back at her barbs with a few of his own --  frequently calling the Massachusetts senator ""goofy"" and ""Pocahontas,"" a reference to her claim of Native American heritage."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/hillary-clinton-server-patrick-kennedy-quid-pro-quo/index.html	"According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton's email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling ""pressured"" by another FBI official at Kennedy's request.The FBI is denying that any ""quid pro quo"" was offered in the fight between the bureau and State Department over the classification level of the email, though one interview described it as such.  ""Not only is there no proof. It's absolutely not true, a completely false allegation. It just didn't happen that way,"" John Kirby, State Department spokesman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" Tuesday. ""There was no bargain sought by the FBI. There was no bargain rendered. This was simply an inner agency conversation about the classification over one particular email. So there was no wrongdoing here.""At issue are somewhat contradictory interview notes contained in the crop of newly released FBI documents. In one, an FBI official recounted hearing second-hand that the State Department had offered a ""quid pro quo"" in exchange for declassifying an email. In another, a different FBI official said he told State Department he'd look into the email, if State Department looked into his request for personnel in Iraq.An FBI records management official told the FBI in one interview that a member of the International Operations Division (IOD) told him that Kennedy had reached out to have an email unclassified in exchange for a ""quid pro quo,"" according to the records management official, documents revealed Monday show. The records management official said the IOD official ""pressured"" him to change the email's classification. In return for FBI declassifying one of the Clinton server emails, the interviewee said as relayed by the IOD official, the State Department official offered to help station FBI agents overseas in sensitive areas.The anonymous individual said in a later meeting at State with several intelligence agencies, Kennedy responded to a question about whether any emails were classified by making eye contact and saying, ""well, we'll see."" After the meeting, the individual said, ""Kennedy spent the next 15 minutes debating the classification for he email and attempting to influence the FBI to change its markings.""That records management official concluded State had an ""agenda"" related to ""minimizing"" the classification issues with Clinton's emails.  The newly released documents contain a summary of interview notes related to the FBI's investigation into whether classified information was improperly handled while Clinton was secretary of state. But another interview contained in the same collection said that though Kennedy reached out to FBI about declassifying the email, it was the FBI that brought up getting agents stationed in Iraq. That FBI employee said he personally spoke with Kennedy about the email, and that he suggested he would ""look into the email matter"" if Kennedy ""would provide authority concerning the FBI's request to increase its personnel in Iraq.""In a follow-up, however, that FBI employee was told the email would remain classified, and relayed that to Kennedy. According to the interviews, Kennedy tried several times to get the FBI to declassify the email. The dispute was over an email that State determined to be unclassified, but in inter-agency review, the FBI said contained classified information. State said the email was released, with redactions, in May 2015 as part of its Freedom of Information Act disclosure. The email, from November 18, 2012, was about possible arrests related to the Benghazi attacks.Later in the FBI documents was an interview with an employee of the State Department inspector general, who said Kennedy was ""not positive"" in his interactions with the inspector general.""Some FOIA officials have seen events and behaviors they did not like or that made them uncomfortable, to include Kennedy's attitude towards them and how they handled the FOIA process related to Clinton,"" the interview notes said. Both FBI and State on Monday denied any ""quid pro quo.""""The FBI determined that one such email was classified at the Secret level,"" FBI said Monday in a statement. ""A senior State Department official requested the FBI re-review that email to determine whether it was in fact classified or whether it might be protected from release under a different FOIA exemption. A now-retired FBI official, who was not part of the subsequent Clinton investigation, told the State Department official that they would look into the matter. Having been previously unsuccessful in attempts to speak with the senior State official, during the same conversation, the FBI official asked the State Department official if they would address a pending, unaddressed FBI request for space for additional FBI employees assigned abroad.""  The FBI maintained the email should remain classified. Trump calls for government ethics reformsState Department Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner called allegations of a quid pro quo ""inaccurate"" and said Monday that Kennedy was trying to ""understand"" the FBI's decision to withhold the information.  ""Classification is an art, not a science, and individuals with classification authority sometimes have different views,"" Toner said. ""There can be applicable FOIA exemptions that are based on both classified and unclassified rules. ... We have been committed to releasing as much information to the public as possible, and ensuring that documents are withheld due to classification only when necessary to prevent damage to national security -- as the Executive Order on classification calls for.""No increase in FBI Iraq slots resulted from this conversation, Toner said. He added in the daily press briefing that Kennedy would remain in his role and had the full confidence of Secretary of State John Kerry. The FBI is releasing the documents after concluding its investigation into Clinton's server. After its review, the FBI found there was not evidence for any criminal charges related to the probe. Still, Republicans were seizing on the new interviews Monday, using them to attack Clinton and calling for Kennedy's departure. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump tweeted simply, ""unbelievable.""His campaign released a statement from spokesman Jason Miller calling the documents ""deeply disturbing.""""The news that top Clinton aide Patrick Kennedy tried to engage in a blatant quid pro quo for changing the classification level of several of Clinton's emails shows a cavalier attitude towards protecting our nation's secrets,"" Miller said.""These documents further demonstrate Secretary Clinton's complete disregard for properly handling classified information,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. ""This is exactly why I called on (Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper to deny her access to classified information. Moreover, a senior State Department official's attempt to pressure the FBI to hide the extent of this mishandling bears all the signs of a cover-up. This is why our aggressive oversight work in the House is so important, and it will continue.""The top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee and House Oversight Committee, Reps. Devin Nunes and Jason Chaffetz, respectively, put out a joint statement calling the allegations ""disturbing"" and asked for Kennedy's removal.""We find Under Secretary Kennedy's actions extremely disturbing,"" Nunes and Chaffetz said. ""Those who receive classified intelligence should not barter in it -- that is reckless behavior with our nation's secrets. Someone who would try to get classification markings doctored should not continue serving in the State Department or retain access to classified information. Therefore, President Obama and Secretary Kerry should immediately remove Undersecretary Kennedy pending a full investigation.""And the Republican National Committee also seized on the exchange, saying the White House was trying to ""shield"" Clinton. ""It is deeply troubling that a top State Department official close to Hillary Clinton offered the FBI a 'quid pro quo' to hide the full extent to which she mishandled classified information,"" Chairman Reince Priebus said. ""The Obama administration's blatant attempts to shield Hillary Clinton from accountability for her reckless conduct will only inflame the growing distrust Americans have for their own government."""

I think it would be wonderful,"" Trump told Michael Savage in an interview for his radio show.Hillary Clinton and other Democrats have seized on Trump's open admiration for the Russian ruler as a way to cast him at odds with mainstream US thinking on foreign policy. Trump has largely embraced such a characterization, regularly saying he would prefer to get along with Putin.""They say, 'Oh well Russia loves Donald Trump and Putin loves Donald Trump,'"" Trump told Savage. ""They insult him constantly, no wonder he can't stand Obama and Hillary Clinton.""Tensions with Russia have boiled over in recent weeks as the US and Russia have failed to reach an agreement on Syria, and the US has officially indicated it believes Russia was behind several high-profile hacks of Democratic Party institutions.

In the past, he has also dismissed Putin's human rights record.In his latest comments, Trump again hailed Russia's nuclear weapons program as ""so far ahead of us"" and hit Clinton over her opposition to the Kremlin.""She talks tough with Russia.
