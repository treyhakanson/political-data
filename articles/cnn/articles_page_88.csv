""But look, I think we're ready for anything and, again, I think this is a strategy that that's driving Trump down and has produced that lead.""Clinton enters the third and final debate in Las Vegas in a position of strength. Polls increasingly point to a decisive win for the Democratic nominee on Election Day, with traditional Republican strongholds such as Arizona, Georgia, Utah and Texas emerging as competitive battlegrounds.It's been a remarkable fall for Trump since the second debate earlier this month in St. Louis, a nasty affair that came days after the publication of a videotape in which the real estate mogul can be heard making vulgar remarks about women. After the Trump campaign arranged a pre-debate press conference with women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, neither candidate shook hands after taking the stage that night. (They did, however, shake hands at the conclusion of the debate.)On Wednesday, Podesta said he wasn't sure if the two would exchange a handshake at the third debate.""We would like the appropriate courtesies of normal debates, but what you saw in the debate in St. Louis is they don't recognize those normal courtesies,"" Podesta said. ""I think we'll see what we get tonight. She didn't shake his hand at the beginning but she did at the end. So we'll see tonight.""Podesta declined to confirm the authenticity of the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks that were stolen from his account. He avoided answering Blitzer's direct questions about emails containing transcripts of Hillary Clinton's speeches to Goldman Sachs. Instead, Podesta kept the focus on intelligence reports indicating that the Russian government was behind the hack. The Clinton campaign has asserted that the breach was an effort by the Russians to tilt the election in favor of Trump.""This is the Russians trying to interfere with our election,"" Podesta said."

""Hillary (Clinton) is the epitome of that establishment.""Farage led the effort behind the United Kingdom's exit from the EU, decided by a June  referendum, a political movement that has been compared to Trump's rise because of its focus on trade policy and immigration.RELATED: Trump on Brexit: America is nextFarage told Baldwin that on the day of the vote, some opinion polls had put the ""leave"" campaign nearly 10 points behind its opposition, yet the results indicated otherwise. He added that while polls show Clinton's lead widening over the GOP candidate, voters -- especially newly registered ones -- might be withholding their true intentions to pollsters but will act on their consciences in the privacy of the voting booth. ""Maybe also people aren't telling pollsters the truth,"" Farage said. ""Thinking, I don't want to tell a pollster I'm voting for Trump, but in private, that's how I feel and that's what I'm going to do."""	Nigel Farage: Trump should focus on issues at debate

Jan Schakowsky -- announced his resignation in a statement after conservative activist James O'Keefe released a video under his organization Project Veritas Action, which showed Creamer and other operatives purportedly discussing methods for inciting violence at rallies for the Republican nominee.In the past, O'Keefe and his Project Veritas Action have been criticized for strategically editing footage to create false accusations about people or groups. Creamer was helping the Democratic National Committee with Clinton's campaign while working for Democracy Partners, a progressive consulting group. He is also the head of a group called Mobilize, which contracted with the DNC.""I am unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing Hilary Clinton, and defeating Donald Trump in the upcoming election,"" Creamer said in a statement. ""As a result I have indicated to the Democratic National Committee that I am stepping back from my responsibilities working with the campaign.""He confirmed that he was referring to the Clinton campaign, with which he was ""fully integrated.""Creamer added that ""contrary to the outrageous claims of the notorious right wing blogger James O'Keefe, we have always adhered to the highest standards of transparency and legality in our work for the DNC.""Trump super PAC chair: Trump needs 'a miracle' to winHe also denied that any of the schemes in the ""hypothetical conversations"" recorded for the video ever took place.""We regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a regional contractor for our firm, and he is no longer working with us,"" he said. ""While none of the schemes described in the conversations every took place, these conversations do not at all reflect the values of Democracy Partners.""Democracy Partners called O'Keefe's video a ""well-funded, systematic spy operation that is the modern day equivalent of the Watergate burglars.""Creamer told CNN that the national field director of Americans United for Change, Scott Foval, who was also recorded in the video, made false comments that are wrong about inciting violence at the rallies. Foval has since been fired from Americans United for Change, which had a contracting relationship with Democracy Partners.""I mean, honestly, it's not hard to get some of these a------- to pop off,"" Foval purportedly says at one point in the video. ""It's a matter of showing up, to want to get into their rally, in a Planned Parenthood T-shirt. Or 'Trump is a Nazi,' you know. You can message to draw them out, and draw them out to punch you.""Creamer said Foval's comments were ""flat out wrong.""""We have gone to extreme measures to ensure no violence took place at any of our (counter protest) rallies,"" Creamer told CNN.Pence: North Carolina GOP office firebombing is 'political terrorism'In 2005, Creamer pleaded guilty to tax violations and $2.3 million in bank fraud in relation to his operation of public interest groups in the 1990s. DNC distances itselfThe DNC quickly distanced itself from the accusations. Donna Brazile, the interim DNC chair, said O'Keefe ""is a convicted criminal with a history of doctoring video to advance his ideological agenda"" and that the practices have nothing to do with long-term efforts by the group.""The practices described in the video by this temporary regional sub-contractor do not in any way comport with our long standing policies on organizing events, and those statements and sentiments do not represent the values that the Committee holds dear,"" Brazile said in a statement. ""We do not believe, or have any evidence to suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually occurred.""The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, denied that it has helped plant rogue protesters or deliberately incited violence at Trump campaign events.""While Project Veritas has been known to offer misleading video out of context, some of the language and tactics referenced in the video are troubling even as a theory or proposal never executed,"" Zac Petkanas, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, said in a statement. ""We support the Democratic National Committee's appropriate action addressing this matter and look forward to continue waging a campaign of ideas worthy of our democratic process.""In 2010, O'Keefe plead guilty to a misdemeanor for breaking into former Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu's office to tamper with her phone.In 2013, O'Keefe had to pay $100,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a former employee of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, better known as ACORN, after O'Keefe and fellow activist Hannah Giles allegedly solicited advice from ACORN workers on setting up a brothel and evading taxes.The videos led to some employees being fired and contributed to the disbanding of ACORN, which advocated for low- and middle-income families and worked to register voters.But prosecutors in New York and California found no evidence of wrongdoing by the group, and the California probe found the videos had been heavily edited."

And waited. And waited. Then, in late October, Biden announced that ""the window"" to run had closed. If you were condemned to this circle of hell, you would be forced to relive the day before Biden's announcement forever.LustThis circle speaks for itself, so we're moving on.  GluttonyThe obvious example of this circle of hell is the Iowa State Fair. Imagine an eternity having to pose for photo ops eating everything fit to be fried.GreedIn January, Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a speech that ""greed is not good."" Sanders continually rallied against big banks and corporate greed. If we revamped Dante's vision of hell, this circle would be one in which the damned would have to swim in a sea of money, Scrooge McDuck style.   AngerThis campaign cycle has had moments that could make anyone angry, really. Offensive things were said about veterans, prisoners of war, women, minorities and large swaths of Donald Trump's supporters. Candidates talked over each other at debates. Surrogates said infuriating things on TV. In this case, I think this Donald Trump GIF truly speaks for all of us. Imagine a hell in which you would have to relive all of those moments on repeat.HeresyMany campaign conventions have gone out the window this cycle. We could have chosen a number of moments -- from candidates not agreeing to support their party's nominee to being critical of said nominee -- to exemplify heresy. But let's be real, Sen. Ted Cruz calling a basketball hoop a ""ring"" is about as heretical as it gets. Especially in the Midwest. ViolenceSouthern gentleman Sen. Lindsey Graham may seem like an odd person to represent violence in campaign hell, but just listen to what he said he wanted to do to Donald Trump. Lordy!FraudThere's been a lot of talk about voter fraud lately, and it would certainly have a place in hell. But Ohio Gov. John Kasich doesn't seem to be too concerned about it. If Dante rewrote his work for a 2016 audience, this circle of hell would probably be one in which poor souls would have to count election ballots by hand. Ironically they wouldn't be able to vote because they would be dead.TreacheryAs totally real historical figure Captain Jack Sparrow once said, ""The deepest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers."" In a campaign, really the worst thing you can do is to switch sides. Which is why the Trump campaign's announcement that they had invited Obama's half-brother Malik as a guest to the final debate was so shocking. If choosing the punishment for this circle of political hell were up for a vote, having to sit in the front row of a never ending presidential debate seems like a pretty strong contender. Lucky for the rest of us, we've reached the final presidential debate, which will air on CNN at 9 p.m. ET tonight.  "	2016 election: The Nine circles of campaign hell
6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/politics/rubio-will-not-discuss-wikileaks-emails/index.html	"Rubio told CNN that ""as our intelligence agencies have said, these leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process, and I will not indulge it."" His remarks were first reported by ABC News. ""Further, I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks: Today it is the Democrats. Tomorrow it could be us,"" he told ABC.The Florida senator -- engaged in a tough reelection fight against Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy -- said that he ""will not discuss any issue that has become public solely on the basis of WikiLeaks.""Rubio's position is a departure from the attacks launched by Republicans -- led by presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence -- who have seized on the emails to portray Clinton as politically calculating and dishonest with voters. One of the hacked emails from campaign chairman John Podesta contained apparent transcripts of Clinton's private speeches, where she advocates for ""open borders and free trade,"" which her campaign later downplayed as a generalization of her views on trade. Trump, though, seized on the email to press his case against illegal immigration. ""Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders ... would end the United States as we know it,"" Trump said at a Pennsylvania rally this month. ""Because in the WikiLeaks, it was all about open borders, free trade for everybody.""Rubio's argument is actually much closer to the talking points pressed by the Clinton campaign itself, whose aides and representatives have said the revelations contained in the emails should be discounted due to the illegal means by which the emails were obtained. This month, shortly after WikiLeaks began publishing emails from the Clinton campaign, Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon tweeted, ""@wikileaks You are no media organization. You are a propaganda arm of the Russian government, running interference for their pet candidate, Trump."" ""Media needs to stop treating WikiLeaks like it is same as FOIA. Assange is colluding with Russian government to help Trump,"" he also wrote. US officials told CNN that there is mounting evidence that the Russian government is supplying WikiLeaks with the hacked emails. The methods of the disclosures ""suggest Moscow is at least providing the information or is possibly directly responsible for the leaks,"" one US official said."

Clarke said that the state ""failed its citizens when its online registration system collapsed"" and added that the lawsuit ""seeks to ensure that all aspiring voters in Virginia are given a full and fair opportunity to register and vote this election cycle.""Clarke said that the group received dozens of calls from Virginia voters who were unable to register. Before filing the lawsuit, she wrote to Edgardo Cortés, commissioner of Virginia Department of Elections, asking him to reopen and extend registration by at least 72 hours. Cortes responded that there is ""no statutory provision in the Code of Virginia that allows for extending the voter registration deadline."" Indiana officials investigating possible voter registration tamperingCortes noted, however, that ""despite technical issues,"" 38,725 voters successfully submitted a voter registration through the online portal in the 48 hours leading up to the deadline.""We understand the frustration experienced by voters and we apologize the system was unable to handle the overwhelming demand from voters,"" he wrote.One plaintiff the Lawyers' Committee is representing is Kathy Kern, a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia, who says in court papers that she tried, with her husband, to register ""multiple times"" on Sunday October 16 and Monday, October 17, using the online system but kept getting ""file not found"" message.

He adds that Attorney General Christopher Porrino served previously as chief counsel to Christie and his then-Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly.According to Brennan, ""Porrino holds supervisory authority over every county prosecutor's office, therefore each and every prosecutor in the State of New Jersey has a conflict of interest and is thereby precluded from participating in this prosecution.""Court documents also show stipulation between the prosecutor and the defense, confirming the time for Gov. Christie's appearance on November 23, 1:30 p.m. According to Brennan, the timing of his appearance is intentionally set before Thanksgiving to lower media attention.Christie's attorney, Craig Carpenito, referred CNN to the governor's press office for any comment. CNN has yet to hear back from Christie's office.Last week Brian Murray, Christie's spokesman, released a statement saying the complaint was ""dishonorable"" and ""filed by a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,"" Murray went on to say, ""The simple fact is the governor had no knowledge of the lane realignments either before they happened or while they were happening.
