The poll showed Hassan leading among undecided voters as well. Earlier this week, WMUR released its survey of the presidential race, showing Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 15 points -- a much stronger lead for the Democratic nominee than other polls had found in recent weeks.New Hampshire poll: Clinton leads Trump by 15 pointsThe swing-state race is one of several close contests around the county that could decide control of the US Senate, and Ayotte's re-election bid has been complicated further by her party's controversial presidential nominee. After initially wavering in support, Ayotte offered her full backing to Trump, who eventually returned it to her. Hassan, who struggled with supporting her own party's nominee, has pounced on the Trump connection. In particular, she has hammered Ayotte for asserting at a debate that Trump was ""absolutely"" a good role model for children. The Republican senator later said in a statement that she had misspoken.Following the revelations earlier this month from a leaked 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape showing Trump bragging about being able to grope women and get away with it, Ayotte pulled her full support of Trump. The Republican presidential nominee's subsequent difficulty in the polls has had some Republicans worried Trump could threaten their hold on Congress.WMUR's poll, conducted between October 11 and 17, included 770 likely voters reached by telephone, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."

""Hillary, on the other hand, was able to laugh at herself and at the same time not underplay any of the serious things Donald Trump has said or done."" Smith -- who attended the dinner -- noted that some of Trump's jibes drew boos from the crowd at an event that typically features more comity than conflict, and encourages self-deprecating remarks from its speakers. He said one of Trump's jokes -- which referenced an email published by WikiLeaks that purportedly shows Clinton aides joking about Catholicism -- fell particularly flat.The white-tie dinner at the Waldorf Astoria is hosted by the archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who sat between Trump and Clinton. Al Smith, a Democrat, was the first Roman Catholic to become a major party nominee for the presidency. Trump had cracked, ""Hillary believes that it's vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private...Here she is tonight in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.""""That's a tough crowd to drop that line in front of,"" Smith said. ""To be honest with you, that certainly took the tone in a different direction, and you know, I think ultimately at the end of the day, that made things a lot harder for Hillary when, ultimately, she got the mic -- she had some funny things that she had said, and I don't think they got as many laughs as they could have because the tone in the room had shifted a bit.""""That line in a room full of predominantly Catholics didn't go over well,"" he added. Al Smith V is the grandson of Alfred E. Smith, a former governor of New York who and a prominent Catholic politician in the 1920s and 30s, whom President Franklin D. Roosevelt had once dubbed ""the happy warrior of the political battlefield."" Smith mounted multiple unsuccessful runs for president as a Democrat, alternating between rival and ally of FDR. Smith V said that ""in the beginning of the night it was pretty friendly,"" and that he had seen Clinton and Trump shake hands. Smith also thanked everyone involved with the dinner for raising money for Catholic charities and Cardinal Dolan for ""bringing them together."""

Trump said Thursday he will accept the results of the November election in the event that he wins. Critics have said that this caveat threatens to cast unprecedented doubt from a major party candidate on the legitimacy of the electoral process.""I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, if I win,"" Trump told supporters in Delaware, Ohio.The GOP candidate, who is trailing Clinton in both national and key state  polls, raised concerns about voter fraud -- something that is extremely rare.""Of course, I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result,"" he said.

""Some people start out with a self-deprecating joke. Some people think this would be tough for me but the truth is I'm a modest person ... Some people tell me modesty is my best quality.""2. ""You know Cardinal Dolan and I have some things in common, such as we both run impressive properties on Fifth Avenue. Of course, his is much more impressive than mine. That's because I built mine with my own beautifully formed hands.""3. ""It's great to be here with 1,000 wonderful people. Or, as I call it, a small, intimate dinner with some friends. Or, as Hillary calls it, her largest crowd of the season.""4. ""This is corny stuff.""5. ""And even tonight, with all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night, we have proven that we can actually be civil to each other. In fact, just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very simply said, 'Pardon me.' And I very quietly replied, let me talk to you about that after I get into office.""6. ""One of the things I noticed tonight -- and I've known Hillary a long time -- that this is the first time ever, ever, that Hillary is sitting down and speaking to major corporate leaders and not getting paid for it.""7. ""You know, last night, I called Hillary a nasty woman. But this stuff is all relative. After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I don't think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore. In fact, I'm actually starting to like Rosie a lot.""8. ""You know the President told me to stop whining. But I really have to say the media is even more biased than ever before. You want the proof? Michelle Obama gives a speech. And everyone loves it, it's fantastic. They think she's absolutely great. My wife, Melania, gives the exact same speech and people get on her case. And I don't get it. I don't know why. And it wasn't her fault ... Oh, I'm in trouble when I go home tonight. She didn't know about that one.""9. ""I'd like to address an important religious matter -- the issue of going to confession. Or as Hillary calls it, the Fourth of July weekend with FBI Director (James) Comey.""10. ""I wasn't really sure if Hillary was going to be here tonight because, I guess, you didn't send her invitation by email. Or maybe you did, and she just found out about it through the wonder of WikiLeaks. We've learned so much from WikiLeaks. For example, Hillary believes that it is vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private.""When the audience booed at that line, Trump replied, ""That's OK, I don't know who they're angry at, Hillary, you or I. For example, here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.""Hillary Clinton1. ""This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.""2. ""It's a treat for all of you, too, because I charge a lot for speeches like this.""3. ""I've got to say, there are a lot of friendly faces in this room, people I've been privileged to know and to work with -- I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables.""4. ""And Donald, after listening to your speech, I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.""5. ""People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants. A beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald sees the Statue of Liberty and sees a 4. Maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.""6. ""But I understand that I'm not known for my sense of humor. That's why it did take a village to write these jokes. People say I'm boring compared to Donald. But I'm not boring at all. In fact, I'm the life of every party I attend -- and I've been to three.""7. ""Now, you notice there is no teleprompter tonight, which is probably smart because maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day. And I get that. They're hard to keep up with. And I'm sure it's harder when you're translating from the original Russian.""8. ""Many people don't know this, but Rudy (Giuliani) actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But as the saying goes, if you can't beat 'em, go on Fox News and call 'em a genius.""9. ""There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump. Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate. And look, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer. Now, actually I did. It's called preparation.""10. ""And whoever wins this election, the outcome will be historic. We'll either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher. And if Donald does win, it'll be awkward at the annual President's Day photo when all the former presidents gather at the White House. And not just with Bill.

Humayun Khan's, life.""In 2004, my son was stationed in Iraq. He saw a suicide bomber approaching his camp. My son moved forward to stop the bomber when the bomb exploded. He saved everyone in his unit. Only one American soldier died,"" Khan says as video shows the father holding the flag that was draped over his son's casket. RELATED: Being Muslim American in the year of Donald TrumpKhan adds, ""My son was Captain Humayun Khan. He was 27 years old and he was Muslim American.""The ad then shows a tight shot of a visibly emotional Khan. ""I want to ask Mr. Trump,"" he asks, ""would my son have a place in your America?""The ad -- titled ""Captain Khan"" -- will air in key battleground states, a campaign aide said Friday, including Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.Early in his campaign, Trump proposed ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" a policy that has become known as his Muslim ban. Since then, however, Trump and his aides have looked to back away from the policy, despite it still being on his website.Khan has provided a counter to Trump since his speech at the DNC in July. Standing next to his wife, Ghazala Khan, Khizr Khan chastened Trump for his proposed Muslim ban.""Let me ask you, have you even read the United States Constitution,"" Khan, a lawyer, asked as he held his own pocket copy up. ""I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words, look for the words, liberty and equal protection (under) law.""RELATED: Six facts to catch you up on the Khan storyWhat cemented Khan's place in 2016 political history, though, was the way Trump responded to the speech, telling ABC the following Sunday, ""If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably -- maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. You tell me.""The interview drew instant rebuke from Democrats and Republicans, including GOP leaders who said it was unacceptable for the party's nominee to go after a Gold Star family. But Trump doubled down on the comments and tweeted later that Khan ""viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!"" Since then, Khan has done interviews for the Clinton campaign and Clinton regularly references him, including at the third and final presidential debate Wednesday in Las Vegas.""He went after Mr. And Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a gold star family because of their religion,"" Clinton said.""Those other charges, as she knows, are false,"" Trump later responded.RELATED: Khizr Khan: 'Saddened all over again' after Trump's debate comments"	In emotional new ad, Khizr Khan asks if his fallen son would have a place in Trump's America	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/bernie-sanders-nh-voters-general-election/index.html	"That's the conversation progressive radio show host Arnie Arnesen said she's been having with many New Hampshire voters over the last couple months, with less than three weeks to go until the presidential election.""Because they have a sense of ownership, they personally lost. It wasn't their candidate that lost. They lost, too,"" Arnesen said of the coalition of voters that brought Sanders 1,893 delegates, not enough to clinch the party's nomination. In New Hampshire the loss was even more pronounced. Sanders won more votes than any candidate in the history of the state's primary and beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by a huge margin of 22 percentage points.Sanders trounced Clinton in New Hampshire with millennials as well as Independents, and winning over both groups will be a test of Clinton's strength as the standard bearer of her party. In the latest national public polls Clinton appears to be doing just that -- she has opened up a lead with younger voters against Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is splitting the independent vote with Trump.The latest poll of likely voters in New Hampshire, from WMUR/UNH, has Clinton up 15 percentage points over Trump in the state, with 87% of Democrats consolidating behind her compared to Trump's 75% of Republicans.According to the poll Sanders voters are more likely than any others voters to say they will vote for a third party candidate, though history suggests many will end up picking a major party candidate in the end.Sanders endorsed Clinton in July after dropping out of the primary race in June, and about two thirds of his voters in New Hampshire say they will vote for Clinton.But even as Sanders' coalition appears to have coalesced behind her, 53% of New Hampshire voters have an unfavorable view of Clinton and a snapshot of some of his most ardent supporters in New Hampshire hints that deep fissures remain. 'I don't know which one would be worse'New Hampshire represents a particular slice of the Democratic party: It is a state that is less diverse than many in the country and one where primary voters largely ignored the local party elite's full embrace of Clinton and their rejection of Donald Trump.  ""A vote for Sanders wasn't really an ideological vote. It was much more age and political independence that made key differences in whether you were going to be a Sanders voter or a Clinton voter,"" Dante Scala, associate professor at the University of New Hampshire tells CNN. Scala discounts the idea that there are many true Sanders-Trump voters, although he adds younger voters tend to be the most skeptical of Clinton.Jed Fiato, a 24-year-old graduate student at New England College, is a member of the demographic that Scala says will be one of the hardest for Clinton to attract -- young males who don't have strong party affiliation.Fiato is an Independent and didn't vote in the 2012 presidential election, the first one he was eligible for. He was frustrated with President Barack Obama over his handling of health care reform and the economy. Tucked away on a shelf in a closet on the second floor of the house he shares with his wife Jenny, Fiato keeps memorabilia from his time volunteering for Sanders during the primary. He has the front page of the Concord Monitor the day after the primary, reading: ""Trump, Sanders ride voter anger to victory in New Hampshire,"" and a ""New Hampshire for Bernie"" sign he held up at a 4 a.m. rally for Sanders the night of the Iowa caucuses. RELATED: Bernie Sanders beats Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire primary""It's something I'll never forget, being there with Bernie Sanders supporters standing out in the cold in February, waiting for Bernie Sanders to arrive on his bus and him speaking to us standing on top of a pick-up truck,"" Fiato told CNN on a recent October night. He does not have the same ardor for Clinton. ""When I hear Hillary Clinton speak, I do not hear someone who actually believes what they are saying,"" Fiato said. At the same time Fiato said that Trump is a ""menace"" and ""exhibits all of the character traits that I find repulsive in a person.""""We're going to have either Trump or Hillary as the President of the United States and, honestly, I don't know which one would be worse,"" Fiato told CNN.Although he wavers on what he will actually do on Election Day, Fiato told CNN he plans to write in Bernie Sanders' name on the ballot if he votes at all. He is sick of the argument that not voting for Clinton is a vote for Trump.""I can imagine a four-year presidency under Hillary Clinton where she makes policy decisions that directly contradict things that I believe in,"" Fiato told CNN. ""I don't want to have to be confronted with someone in the future who says, 'Well, you voted for Hillary Clinton.'""Fiato also still resents a nominee that he feels was preordained by the Democratic party establishment, a feeling shared by others Sanders supporters. ""I'm talking to a lot of people and there is not a lot of enthusiasm. People who jumped into the process and got involved that hadn't before are feeling like it doesn't matter, like it's futile, and that is wrong. It matters so much,"" says Mark King, a 54-year-old library worker who cites Sanders as his inspiration to run for state representative this election cycle.  King was on Sanders state steering committee and sees reasons to vote for Clinton,""I've been voting for the lesser of two evils for a while now. It doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth, but I'm practical. I'm pragmatic,"" King said.Although he told CNN he feels pressure to endorse the entire Democratic ticket because he is running for local office, King later said -- like Fiato -- he plans to write in Sanders' name on the ballot. ""This election is the most difficult thing I've ever considered,"" he told CNN. 'They changed the party. They changed the country'Arnesen remembers hosting Sanders for a house party back in January 2015. Back then few guessed he would be running for president, but Arnesen, who didn't endorse a candidate in the primary, says she wasn't surprised when his campaign took off. ""They changed the party. They changed the country. They changed the conversation. Hillary Clinton had to change on so many issues. If you don't call that winning, you're nuts,"" Arnesen said. Arnesen points to the changes Clinton has made in her platform, as well as the Democratic agenda hammered out at Democratic National Convention, due to Sanders' presence in the race. Clinton's supporters say those changes helped their efforts to bring over Sanders voters -- but that her effectiveness relies on a wide margin of support in November.""If she gets that kind of support, including the support from Bernie Sanders supporters, then she can say look this is what the voters want,"" longtime New Hampshire activist and Clinton supporter Terie Norelli told CNN.""A lot of people had given their hearts and souls to Bernie for months, and we needed a little time to heal. But we have healed, and we are passionate now about Hillary,"" said activist Dudley Dudley, an early key endorsement for Sanders in New Hampshire and a member of his steering committee.""My support for Hillary is not just because I don't support Donald Trump. It's because I do support her, and the way that she has grown, and stretched, because of her contact and support from Bernie,"" Dudley told CNN.Although Sanders has not shared his vast donor list with the Clinton campaign he has campaigned for her in New Hampshire four times since the convention, appearing with her twice, and has been a near constant presence on the campaign trail across the country. RELATED: Michelle Obama, hoping to turn Arizona blue for Clinton, tears into TrumpThe Clinton campaign and Democratic party have hired Sanders staffers in New Hampshire at senior levels as well as field organizers.Sanders' former state director and a national field director, who is now Executive Director of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, says she sees significant change.""I see what's happening at the DNC,"" Julia Barnes tells CNN. ""All of the changes that have happened there, while not as public as some of the missteps that have happened in the past, are legitimately setting the groundwork for some really good inclusive collaboration moving forward which hasn't always been the case.""The organization Sanders launched after his run, ""Our Revolution,"" has been focusing on down ballot races, and has endorsed a number of Democrats running for state representative seats in New Hampshire, including Mark King.Sanders' campaign committee ""Friends of Bernie Sanders"" also recently sent out a fundraising email for congressional candidates, including New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is running for Senate. Many Sanders supporters see a focus on local elections and policy initiatives as the most urgent legacy of Sanders' campaign. For Arensen, that doesn't mean that Sanders' influence on the presidency is over.  ""What I would love to say to millennials is that you did lose. Your candidate lost, the person that you most committed to,"" Arnesen told. ""But the person I think now that I want Hillary Clinton to be the most afraid of is Bernie Sanders.""""Change doesn't happen with a switch. It takes time. Hillary Clinton is smelling it, and realizing it, because Bernie showed that that's what people want,"" she added. ""Bernie won, but he will lose if she loses. If Donald Trump wins, we all lose."""

Gore, Clinton campaign togetherTop Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills sent a copy of an article on Gore's non-endorsement, to which aide Huma Abedin replied that they had been warned.

""(Israelis) would like to know that the president is going to follow pretty much mainstream, friendly policy toward Israel.
