They dutifully jeered Comey's name as Clinton called his decision and its timing ""pretty strange,"" but roared when she pivoted back to her usual fare -- a promise to keep ""focused on one thing, you and your families.""Apart from the quick round of booing, the crowd here had little to say about the campaign's new bÃªte noire. Minutes away from the historically black Bethune-Cookman University, this was a safe space. Her supporters in this coastal city -- the kind of quiet loyalists who could vault her to the White House next week -- didn't just take the FBI news in stride, they mostly strode right past it.Retired veteran Walter Browning, his ""Operation Iraqi Freedom"" cap tipped up high on his head, strained to explain just how little he cared.""Let's talk about the meat and potatoes. We don't want no more of the salad, let's talk about the meat and potatoes,"" he said. ""This is about Hillary,"" he continued. ""The hating don't really matter. You have the character of a person -- everybody has dirt on them, everybody -- but you have to focus on what that person can do. You look at their stats. Hillary? She gives you the opportunity.""Charting a different path from Obama and Sanders In the months since he emerged as the favorite to win the GOP nomination, Trump and his supporters have been scrutinized and psychoanalyzed, their motivations and ""anxieties"" studied like the Dead Sea Scrolls of American politics.Why I'm voting for Trump: CNN talks to 150 people in 31 cities Meanwhile, Clinton's gravitational pull has been treated less like a force of nature than a mundane fact of life. It's understandable. For millions of Americans, her place in the firmament is fixed and the decades-long run-up to the 2016 election, with its unexpectedly rancorous primary and the lingering email server scandal, has cemented many of the less pleasing impressions of the former first lady, senator and secretary of state.But while the Trump voter is widely viewed as a man on a mission to reclaim some past greatness, the caricature of a Clinton voter manages to be both less distinct and more rigid. Ideology plays a part -- but only up to a point. As a candidate, Barack Obama drew crowds to rival or exceed Trump's while pitching ideals that directly contradict the Republican nominee's performative pathos. Same for Bernie Sanders, who because of some topline similarities -- mainly a broad economic populism and faddish personal brand -- is too often conflated with Trump, or held up as a false conduit for Republicans making eyes at working-class Democrats.Clinton cannot play that game. In 2016, she has embraced her inner wonk and bet that voters would do the same. Victory next week would offer a fittingly paradoxical end to this daft campaign: the election of one of our most politically sane and rhetorically mild candidates.   ""She evokes a peacefulness in people,"" said Martha Massfeller, 58, after the Daytona Beach rally. ""It's more hometown -- she's seems more hometown to me. It's more grassroots. I love her -- that's all I can say. I'm just very proud, very proud.""At the New Mount Olive Baptist Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Sunday, Clinton was received with glee. Rapturously, by some. The candidate is a Methodist, but she knows the room. And she said hello, smiling and in pious lavender, with a piece of scripture.""Now this is the day the Lord has made,"" Clinton said upon taking stage, her voice attuning itself to the regional twang, much like Obama and generations of politicians before her have done with relative peace.Among those present waving their approval, Julia Paul-Momdaizie, an American citizen born in Trinidad, spoke with delight in her eyes about Clinton's policy positions. ""She has great ideas for the country,"" Paul-Momdaizie said. ""Change is good, yes, but if it's not broke then you shouldn't fix it. Our country isn't broken. We have things we need to work on and I think she can fix those areas."" ""Mr. Trump wants to burn it all down,"" she added with a laugh, ""get rid of all of us."" Clinton counting on quiet supporters to speak with their ballotsOn the trail, signs at rallies for the Republican showman declare that ""the Silent Majority stands with Trump."" The reference is a cultural marker, still-valuable currency with crowds that fill up at the mention of ""law and order"" in a campaign speech. But it is Clinton who, at press time and for long stretches of the campaign, has commanded not only more support, but from a less vocal band of backers. Alma Ellis, 70, was chatting about the opponent with a friend before Clinton arrived. ""Just like the scripture in the Bible: 'Satan is going to and fro seeking whom he can divide. He desires to sift us wheat.' If Trump gets elected he is going to sift all of us as wheat,"" she said, and paused. ""You can't say that someone is leading you when they don't know the way themselves.""  Being Muslim American in the year of Donald TrumpOpposition to the Republican nominee is not incidental, even to many of the people who call themselves enthusiastic Clinton voters.A night earlier in Miami, at a ""get out the vote"" concert headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, college student Diana Zelaya, 23 years old and nearing graduation, argued that Trump was not being held to a very simple standard she expected to face on the job market.""He basically woke up one day and said I'm going to run for president,"" she said. ""It's not fair -- even most college graduates need to have experience to jump into a field. He has no political experience to jump in the field."" Clinton, she added, ""is more qualified, just like (students) need more experience for wherever we want to go work. She worked in this her whole life.""On Monday in Ohio, at Clinton's first stop -- a rally on the campus of Kent State University -- ticketed supporters lined up an hour before the doors to the school's Recreation and Wellness Center were scheduled to open, and two more before Clinton was expected to arrive.Along with a friend, Lyric Aquino, a sophomore double major in anthropology and aspiring photojournalist, bested the Midwestern chill in a long shawl. She spoke about the relative mellow of a Clinton event when set against the sometimes ugly and weird scenes at Trump's gatherings.""Hillary has been bashed but she still remains to be so strong,"" Aquino said. ""So she is able to hold attention and cast a sense of power and it makes people want to listen to her. I like that she's able to do that and it's not dangerous, it's not a harsh vibe -- it feels good to know that you're in a safe environment where you can listen to her and actually hear her talk.""Red meat? Clinton voters hunger for a more balanced mealOn Monday, Clinton's first order of business was to deliver a message about Trump. These lines of attack tend to drive news coverage and win broader attention, but the live audience seemed distracted. After 25 minutes, though, Clinton began a riff on the diversity of her coalition and the room began to heat up. Then, as she closed, listing the sundry accomplishments of the Obama years, it blared.""That is something to defend and build on,"" she said, ""and in the end, that is what this election is all about.""As the last of the crowd filtered out past what had behaved like an airport checkpoint, a trio of merchandise sellers -- ""J&J Concessions"" -- were cleaning up. Kevin Terry, 40, said his small company had been as far south as Texas and all the way up to Maine hawking both both Clinton and Trump gear. The big sellers at Kent State, he said, had been pins reading, ""Hill, Yes!"" and another featuring ""Rosie the Riveter"" saying ""Hillary 2016.""This is America, 2016: Confessions from the campaign trailThe big movers at Trump rallies also focused on Clinton, he said -- stuff like ""Hillary for Prison"" tee shirts and another that says, ""Life's a bitch, don't vote for one."" The demand was such that Terry, who had arrived at the convention in Cleveland this summer with ""American flag elephant shirts saying, 'Cleveland rocks' and 'RNC 2016,'"" had to put in a late order for the nastier swag.Hanging back a few hundred feet away with her mother, Ann, Sarah Schlosser, 22, pinned the contrasting nature of the the year's campaign rallies on the candidates: ""Trump has a very dark and gloomy message and that is going to attract a very dark and gloomy voter. Hillary's message is very different and you see that in the demeanor of the people who attend.""A former vice president of marketing at the Chamber of Commerce, Ann professed awe at Clinton's fortitude, but underlined what she saw as one of the candidate's fundamental handicaps: what men expect from powerful women.   ""She's not warm and fuzzy,"" Ann said. ""But we as women are supposed to (be) warm and fuzzy and embracing and love and hold hands and skip off into the sunset together. We should sh-- rainbows and pee puppies. But that's not going to happen.""That's not going to get things done."""

""It's gonna come out at some point.""On Clinton: 'Hold her accountable'Common, who endorsed the Democratic Party's presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, said that voters who are jaded by the political system should not withhold their votes, but become even more politically active and aware of local elections.The rapper, who has been a prominent activist against police brutality and mass incarceration, said Americans can usher in change by exercising their right to vote -- not only for the highest office in the land, but for district attorneys, mayors and other local officials who will ensure that the civil rights of Americans are protected. Early voting update: Black vote declining with 24.4 million ballots castThe rapper said that Clinton is more aligned with Obama's agenda and having a Democratic administration in the White House in 2017 is the best chance to build on and preserve Obama's legacy on issues like criminal justice reform.He said he is looking forward to seeing a woman president and ""Black America Again"" includes a song called ""The Day Women Took Over.""""If she even thinks about going to a second term and she doesn't do the things that we want, then we make sure that she's not a president again,"" Common said, ""but if you allow Donald Trump to get into office then it's going to be a really tough time in this country.""'Obama still represents hope'In 2008, Obama's ""Hope and Change"" slogan colored the lawns and the cars of thousands and thousands of Americans and the iconic portrait of the candidate in red and blue with the word ""hope"" sprung up on T-shirts, posters and even newly inked tattoos across America.But once Obama took office and gridlock in Congress persisted, tough political realities settled in and for many, the idealism surrounding Obama's presidency evaporated.But for Common, who was one of Obama's most vocal supporters in 2007, the outgoing President ""still represents hope.""""Obama still represents hope because he is a symbol and the true expression of where we can reach,"" the Chicago rapper said. ""Little young Latino girls know that they can be president because of Obama. He broke the whole mold.""Obama to black voters: Trump would undo my legacyCommon acknowledged that Obama was unable to accomplish everything he set out to achieve, but said he expects the President to build on his legacy and remain connected to causes he cares about like the ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative once he leaves office.""As a black man, I know that (Obama) has represented black people in a beautiful way,"" Common said, ""and we thank him for all his hard work, his commitment, his heart and his spirit ... he empowered all of us."""

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/arizona-ballot-collection/index.html	"The ruling is a blow to Democrats in the state who say the law could disenfranchise thousands of voters, especially in minority communities that rely upon neighbors and activists to collect and hand-deliver the ballots.Friday, a 6-5 ruling by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted a preliminary injunction of the law; the Supreme Court's order stays that decision. There were no noted dissents.In Arizona, voters can request an early ballot to be sent to them before the election. The voters can then mail it back or drop it off at a polling locations as long as it is received by 7 p.m. on Election Night.Democrats in the state argued that thousands -- particularly those in towns near the border and in Native American reservations without reliable mail service -- have relied upon having their ballot collected by organizers in past years to ensure the ballots are received on time.The law makes it a felony, punishable by a year in jail and $150,000 to knowingly collect ""voted or unvoted early ballots"" from another person. It provides for an exception for family members or caregivers. ""It is no secret that ballot collection and delivery has been particularly beneficial for Arizona's minority voters, and legislators who have not traditionally enjoyed broad support in those communities have repeatedly tried to restrict it,"" Democratic lawyer Marc Elias argued in his filing with the Supreme Court Saturday morning.Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan praised the decision. ""We are extremely pleased the Supreme Court reversed the ninth circuit's decision, Reagan said in a statement. ""This commonsense law simply ensures ballot security in the state of Arizona and we're relived that there will be no changes to the law this late in the election cycle. ""In briefs filed by lawyers for the Arizona, lawyers had argued that the law ""will not actually have a discriminatory impact or anything more than a minimal burden on the right to vote,"" and lambasted the appeals court for blocking the ""sensible"" law so close to the election. Joshua A. Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky College of Law, believed a major concern for justices could be the timing.""This could be a close vote,"" Douglas said Friday. ""I could see several justices worrying about the impact of the law while others will be more concerned with the timing issues."" The majority of the appeals court said it recognized that it was blocking the law close to the election but said that its injunction would not affect the state's ""election processes or machinery."" ""The only effect is on the third party ballot collectors, whose efforts to collect legitimate ballots will not be criminalized, pending our review,"" the majority said. In a brief filed by the Arizona Republican Party and joined by the state attorney general, lawyers called the law a ""well-reasoned"" safeguard to a ""fair and transparent election.""They argued that the challengers ""have not and cannot meet their burden to overcome the important regulatory interests protecting voters and ensuring an orderly and fair election process.""They said the law was in effect for the primary election and that the challengers could not identify ""a single voter whose ability to vote was burdened by the law."""

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/critical-counties-bucks-pennsylvania/index.html	On election night, watch to see if Hillary Clinton's firewall materializes.It's an ambiguous, ill-defined idea, but the gist is that if Clinton can lock up a few choice states, she will win the presidency. If Donald Trump can bust through, his path to victory remains open. One way or another, the firewall can't happen without a Democratic victory in Pennsylvania. History is on Clinton's side, as Democrats have won this state every election since Bill Clinton in 1992. To see if Trump could upset that trend, look to Bucks County. Situated outside of heavily Democratic Philadelphia, this area could be more open to the Republican nominee. If voters here turn out in his favor, it could make room for a Trump win in Pennsylvania. Data from Google Trends show an increase in searches about Clinton around the FBI announcing it found emails that could be relevant to her use of a private server as well as search queries about the emails and whether the Democratic nominee would drop out. In the same time frame, voters searched Google for reasons to vote Trump.As a whole, much of Pennsylvania is Republican and rural, particularly in its western half. But the population is concentrated in a few areas, particularly Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Clinton needs these towns to turn out for her, and Trump needs to tap into their outlying areas. Keep Bucks County in mind to see how this election plays out, and take a look at Allegheny County across the state -- another one of CNN's Critical Counties.PopulationEconomyTough sellRepresentationPopularityTop searchesWho's searching?TrendingSearches by candidate	Critical counties: Is Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a brick in Hillary Clinton's firewall?

Christie is heading planning for Republican nominee Donald Trump's transition if he wins the presidency.What's next for Chris Christie?In a statement, the New Jersey governor said he was ""saddened"" by the case and repeated his long-standing claim that he had no knowledge of the plot to close lanes as an act of political retribution.""As a former federal prosecutor, I have respected these proceedings and refused to comment on the daily testimony from the trial,"" Christie said in the statement. ""I will set the record straight in the coming days regarding the lies that were told by the media and in the courtroom.""Read Chris Christie's statement on the verdictChristie has also functioned as a high profile surrogate for Trump, and was included on a schedule of campaign stops in New Hampshire this weekend put out by the organization.CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment and not yet gotten a response.The news comes after nearly five days of deliberations from the jury. Sentencing is scheduled for February 21 in the same courtroom. The defense attorney for Kelly said they planned to appeal the verdict and request a new trial. Defense attorneys for both defendants had filed a motion for a mistrial Thursday before the verdict came down Friday.Kelly and Baroni each face a maximum sentence of 86 years, according to Paul Fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case. Kelly and her family were visibly emotional while the verdict was read, while Baroni stared at the jury before hugging his family.Prosecutors alleged that the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge were part of a deliberate effort to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, who did not endorse the Republican incumbent Christie in his 2013 re-election bid.Emails and text messages released in January of 2014 form the basis of the charges. In one particularly damning email, Kelly told former Port Authority official David Wildstein, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""Kelly later said her messages contained ""sarcasm and humor,"" and she claims that she had told Christie about traffic problems resulting from a study a day prior to sending the email."

Judge Richard Allen Griffin and John M. Rogers were appointed by George W. Bush, and Judge Alice M. Batchelder by George H.W. Bush.After the ruling, Marc Elias, the lead lawyer for the Democrats, suggested he could appeal. Elias tweeted ""more to come"" and said that the appeals court order was issued ""without full rsesponse and virtually no analysis.""""We are stunned that a court would rule without even allowing one of the parties to file a memo explaining their case, but that is exactly what the 6th Circuit has done in this decision. We are exploring our options to reverse this unfortunate ruling,"" said Kirstin Alvanitakis, Communications Director, Ohio Democratic Party.Democrats could appeal the order either to a large panel of the 6th Circuit, or to the Supreme Court.Democrats have filed similar lawsuits in Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania, and so far Republicans have won three of those cases, although the Pennsylvania case has not yet been heard.Sunday's order reverses an order filed yesterday by Judge James Gwin of the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. He mostly sided with Democrats against Trump and Roger Stone's group ""Stop the Steal"" and issued  a temporary restraining order. The order also applied to the Clinton campaign.Stark County, Ohio, is a swing county in a swing stateThe Trump campaign Saturday morning appealed the ruling to the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals.Gwin's ruling, the campaign said, ""literally imposes a comprehensive election code the court will apparently continue to invent on the fly.""In Arizona, a federal judge late Friday rejected a similar request from Democrats for a restraining order. Among actions prohibited under Gwin's order: ""Hindering or delaying a voter or prospective voter from reaching or leaving the polling place,"" participating in ""unauthorized 'poll watching'"" activities, including ""challenging or questioning voters or prospective voters about their eligibility to vote, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same"" and ""interrogating, admonishing, interfering with, or verbally harassing voters or prospective voters.""Campaigns and individuals are also barred from questioning voters ""under the guise of the purported 'exit polling' or 'citizen journalist' operations organized and encouraged by Defendants Stone and Stop the Steal.""Gwin's order applies to Hillary Clinton's campaign as well.The Trump campaign denies it is participating in any illegal activity.""Intimidating voters is illegal, and the campaign does not remotely condone such conduct,"" Trump campaign lawyer Chad A. Readler of Jones Day wrote in a 15-page legal filing in Ohio earlier this week. ""This case is one of four coordinated attacks across the country that are clearly long-planned efforts to sow chaos in the Defendants' political efforts, while garnering maximum publicity for Plaintiff's unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims on the eve of the Presidential Election,"" Readler added.Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said the legal action is necessary to limit any questionable activity that prevents voters from casting their ballots.""The concern has been if people were to act upon what Trump and what Roger Stone have been encouraging people to do that you'd have true intimidation and harassment that might scare voters off,"" Pepper said after the hearing. ""I don't want voters to be at all worried about voting on Election Day.""

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/index.html	"The State Department released 285 pages of emails Friday and two emails upgraded to ""confidential,"" retroactively, by reviewers -- the lowest level of classification.State Department spokesman John Kirby said Friday's release included a large number of ""near duplicate"" emails, largely identical to previously released emails.This latest release paled in volume compared to Thursday's release and previous massive document dumps, but it continued a drip-drip of email releases that has followed Clinton since before she entered the race.The content of the emails themselves has mattered little in the election compared against the consistent reminder that Clinton was the subject of an FBI probe because she used a private email server to conduct State Department business.Email woes, in one form or another, have knit together voters' concerns about Clinton's trustworthiness since before she even entered the race and the troubles have been persistent, to say the least.FBI Director James Comey delivered one final October surprise last week when he alerted Congress that the FBI had discovered yet more emails potentially related to Clinton's server. Adding to the damage was the revelation that they were discovered on the laptop of Huma Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, while federal investigators were investigating his sexting with a purportedly underage girl.And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has made the release of John Podesta's hacked emails a daily -- sometimes twice daily -- occurrence in the last 30 days of the election.Friday's batch comes out of the emails the FBI collected in its investigation of Clinton and, recently, turned over to the State Department.The newest emails were largely duplicates of previously released messages, but included some new material, including a February 2010 request from Chelsea Clinton that her mom look into expanding the role of the USNS Comfort in Haiti relief efforts. The emails stem from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by VICE News reporter Jason Leopold and more are expected to come out after the election.The peril for Clinton is unlikely to end on Tuesday, as a handful of Republican lawmakers have begun openly talking about possible impeachment proceedings for her handling of emails and the Congress, if it remains in Republican hands, is all but guaranteed to continue its own investigations of Clinton."

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/donald-trump-political-ads-cambridge-analytica/index.html	"They are Donald Trump's secret political weapon.Â His campaign paid more than $5 million in September alone toÂ Cambridge Analytica,Â which claims itÂ can convinceÂ voters to backÂ him by tailoring Trump's political ads to their personalities.Their approach combines micro-targeting, already in use in political campaigning,Â with psychological profiling.Â The company gathers up toÂ 5,000 pieces of dataÂ about a potential voter to createÂ a psychological profile, then adapts political adsÂ toÂ his or herÂ personality and beliefs.Using a survey usually placed on social media,Â the companyÂ invites users to take a personality test. The results of that test help the company group people under personality typesÂ measuring openness,Â conscientiousness,Â extraversion,Â agreeableness andÂ neuroticism.Data-crunchersÂ then combineÂ individuals'Â personalities with theirÂ voting history, whereÂ theyÂ shop, whatÂ theyÂ buy -- even whatÂ theyÂ watch on television.RELATED: The final get-out-the-vote flurry beginsThe personality test doesn't indicate that this is the purpose of the test, so it's likely those who fill it out are unaware of how it will be matched with other data freely available or purchasable from cable and credit card companies.With that,Â according toÂ Cambridge AnalyticaÂ CEOÂ Alexander Nix, they know the best way to targetÂ the individual and what message to use.""We can then marry this dataÂ with cookies to serve peopleÂ (ads)Â though social media or digitally, or we can match these data to television viewing data so we can understand where the audiencesÂ areÂ that we're interested in, what programs they're watching, and we can then serve them messages during those shows,"" he explained.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.The company does not release examples of ads it's produced for an ongoing campaign, but it did provide CNN with examples from its work for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz when he was challenging Trump in the GOP presidential primaries.One was created for a ""Stoic Traditionalist"" who values time in isolation, is unadventurous and tends to be unassuming in their disposition. It shows Cruz alone with the tag line ""keep calm and Cruz on."" The other, a ""Relaxed Leader"" who is sociable, generally optimistic and empathizes with the emotions of others, depicts the whole Cruz family with the words ""our best days are ahead.""Despite Trump's considerable investment in the venture,Â as spelled out in filings to the Federal Election Commission, the strategy hasn't always delivered the desired results.Cruz paid Cambridge Analytica $5,805,548,Â according toÂ FECÂ filings.But the effort did not secure him enough support to become the party's nominee, though the company maintains it did helpÂ him grab the spotlight in the Republican primaries.Sasha Issenberg, author of ""The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns,"" has doubtsÂ aboutÂ the effectiveness of the psychoanalysis and profiling used by Cambridge Analytica, such as in the case withÂ Cruz.He noted that the Cruz campaign thought they needed to figure out nuanced differences between the Texas senator and competitors like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.RELATED: Examining the candidates' positionsIn the end, Issenberg said, the data yielded ""something like 160 different segments of potential voters that were separated on these personality characteristics, but also by issues, by broad attitudes about politics.""They then developed 160 different tracks of digital advertising and direct mail, according to Issenberg. But those distinctions might have been unnecessarily fine.""It basically became unwieldy in the context of the campaign,"" he said. ""The number of people that you need basically just to create all this content often offsets whatever the efficiency gain you would gain by targeting narrowly.""He added,Â ""You probably would get a lot of the impact if you just sent the same message on gun rights to your neurotic gun rights supporters as you would to your extroverted gun rights supporters.""Though Cruz and fellow GOP primary candidate Ben Carson couldn't ride the company's strategy to success, the firm said it works on eight to 10 political campaigns each year.FEC filings show many of the campaigns helped by the firm -- a US-incorporated affiliate of the SCL Group -- to have been Republican.Cambridge Analytica has been linked to the reclusive GOP donor Robert Mercer, though the company would not confirm or denyÂ the connection.Either way, it will have another test of its techniques when the Republican nominee tries to win the White House in the vote next Tuesday."
