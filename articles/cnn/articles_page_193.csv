He was telling a story about not taking the easy route in Congress, when he quipped: ""When you look at the kind of people running for president, no-brainers are a good thing now.""But while that comment seemed to include Republican Donald Trump, he attacked Clinton's health exclusively. ""A true believer does what Jesus did ... you don't make fun of people who are impaired, have special needs, and whether you like her or not, Hillary Clinton's made clear, she is mentally impaired,"" Gohmert joked, to some laughter from the crowd. Healthers: Debunking the Clinton health conspiraciesNeither the Clinton campaign nor Gohmert's office immediately responded to CNN request for comment. The Texas Republican is no stranger to controversy, and is known on Capitol Hill for regularly having a sharp quip at the ready. Seemingly invoking conspiracy theories about Clinton's health that have been debunked, Gohmert referenced a concussion Clinton sustained in a fall in 2012 as his guess for the start of her ""impairment.""""Maybe it was the concussion, the fall back when she did, or maybe who knows, they won't tell us what really is going on with her, but if I were going to smash cell phones, BlackBerrys, I'd use a two-pound sledge,"" he said, referring to a recent FBI report that said at least one of her phones as secretary of state was destroyed with a hammer. ""Maybe someone got to whaling around, hit her again. We ought to be praying for Hillary Clinton. There's special needs there -- mental impairment.""Gohmert noted that earlier in the week he had made a comment that ""Hillary's brain is in a blender,"" generating headlines. He blamed a song that conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh used to play that included a similar line. But Gohmert, joking about not joking, reiterated the point.  ""That was not a proper thing to say, because again, I'm making fun of the mentally impaired and that's not right,"" he said.What about Trump's health?"

FBI and Justice Department officials believe there's strong evidence to warrant publicly naming Russia as responsible for the political organization attacks, law enforcement and intelligence officials briefed on the investigation say. But there is opposition from US intelligence agencies and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who have cautioned about moving to ""name and shame"" Russia, in part because of concerns about Russian retaliation and the possible exposure of US intelligence operations, the routine spy work that the US carries out against Russia and other countries. White House officials, meanwhile, are cautious for other reasons, administration officials say: the political overtones of making such an attribution against Russia weeks before the US presidential election. Some White House officials also believe the FBI and intelligence agencies have more work to do to show definitive links between Russian intelligence hackers, whom US investigators believe stole documents from the Democratic National Committee, and WikiLeaks, the organization that published the material the weekend before the Democratic Party's convention. An administration official said there's no effort to slow down attribution of the hacks. ""As senior law enforcement officials have said, there is an active, ongoing investigation into recent cyberintrusions against the DNC and related entities,"" the official said. ""The law enforcement and intelligence communities will reach their own conclusions in due course. Policy decisions regarding public attribution for these intrusions are contingent on the results of that investigation, which we are careful not to get ahead of.""Intelligence and law enforcement officials don't believe the Russian goal is necessarily to get a particular candidate elected. Instead, the goal appears to be to sow dissension and raise doubts about the US political system, according to US intelligence and law enforcement officials. It's similar to Russian activity in recent years in Europe, the officials said.Putin ""is taking advantage of the political environment in the US right now,"" one US official said.The US dilemma is particularly notable on Capitol Hill. This week, congressional leaders and staff returned from vacation and received briefings on the sprawling US hacking investigation. They were told by US intelligence and law enforcement officials that there is now near-certainty that Russian intelligence is behind cyberhacking attacks against targets ranging from the DNC and other political organizations tied to Democrats to Washington think-tanks and even reporters at The New York Times, according to US officials familiar with the briefings. There's also increasing confidence that recent attacks against election registration websites in Illinois and Arizona link back to Russian government hackers, though those ties are still being examined, the officials said. The briefing was persuasive for some Republican lawmakers and staff who have been skeptical of claims by Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign of Russian involvement, according to congressional aides. That could pose new discomfort for members of Congress who have endorsed Donald Trump and who focus on national security. Trump and his campaign have cast doubt about Russian involvement. ""I think it's probably unlikely. Maybe the Democrats are putting that out -- who knows,"" Trump said in an interview with Larry King that aired on Russia Today. ""If they are doing something, I hope that somebody's going to be able to find out so they can end it. Because that would not be appropriate at all.""The prospect of Russian hacking activity affecting confidence in the US election is foremost in the minds of US government officials. US officials don't view the hacks of election-registration websites to be a threat to the vote count. Voting machines and tabulations systems aren't connected to the Internet, which would be the way hackers could tamper with results. ""It would be very difficult to -- through any sort of cyberintrusion -- to alter the ballot count, simply because it is so decentralized and so vast,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday. ""You've got state governments, county governments, local governments involved in the election process. It would be very difficult to alter the count.""There are concerns, however, about hackers tampering with registration data and causing voters to show up at their polling places on election day to find they aren't on the voting rolls. While those types of problems are common and happen during every election, the heightened concern about Russian hacks could amplify such issues this year. And that, officials fear, could affect public confidence in the election outcome. ""There are troubling signs that hostile foreign cyberactors are working to undermine our political process,"" Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement. ""This is a direct provocation that goes to the heart of American democracy. Every American should be able to walk away from the ballot box and know that their voice has been heard. We cannot allow such action to go unanswered, which is why President Obama should send a clear signal to intruders: attempts to influence US elections or destabilize the integrity of our electoral process will be met with severe consequences."""

""Twenty recruit training regiment personnel have been identified for possible military justice or administrative action.""Three ""command-level investigations"" concluded Siddiqui committed suicide, the statement said. But Siddiqui's family has told CNN affiliate WDIV they strongly doubt their son killed himself.The Marine statement didn't provide details on the death. The 20-year-old from Michigan died March 18, not long after arriving at Parris Island, reported the Marine Times, a publication not affiliated with the Marine Corps.Investigation found physical and verbal abuseThe Marines statement said investigations found drill instructors physically and verbally abused recruits and that one drill instructor was improperly assigned for duty while being investigated for allegations of assault and hazing. Investigators found inconsistencies in how the Marines responded to suicidal statements, the Marines said.The Marines recommended a number of changes, including mandatory suspension of personnel investigated for abusing or hazing recruits and increased officer oversight of training.Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller said he supported the recommendations. ""When America's men and women commit to becoming Marines, we make a promise to them,"" he said. ""We pledge to train them with firmness, fairness, dignity and compassion.  Simply stated, the manner in which we make Marines is as important as the finished product. Recruit training is, and will remain, physically and mentally challenging so that we can produce disciplined, ethical, basically trained Marines.""We mourn the loss of Recruit Siddiqui, and we will take every step necessary to prevent tragic events like this from happening again.""Dingell to visit Parris IslandSiddiqui's parents are reviewing the findings and deciding their next steps, said Shiraz Khan, the family lawyer.U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan met Thursday with Neller, according to a statement from her office. ""Private Siddiqui was a son, brother and class valedictorian who believed this country represented freedom and opportunity,"" Dingell said. ""As a young Muslim man, he truly understood the value of freedom of religion, and all he wanted was to defend the ideals our nation holds dear. ""This weekend, I will visit Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, to see firsthand the recruit training process, meet with the new leadership and learn about the changes that are being implemented to ensure a tragedy like this never happens again."""	20 Marines face prosecution or discipline in recruit's death

""I also can't figure out for the life of me what's more humane -- waterboarding or killing somebody with a drone.""A 2014 Senate report condemned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, which included waterboarding, saying the program produced little valuable intelligence.

At least in the second situation, he gets a chance to save his life and do something good for society,"" he said.Trump has repeatedly called for bringing back waterboarding as a technique to use against terrorists.""They're chopping off heads of Christians and many other people in the Middle East,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper in February. ""They're chopping heads off, they laugh at us when they hear we're not going to approve waterboarding, and then they'll have (American hostage) James Foley and others where they cut off their heads."""

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/congress-zika-standoff/index.html	"A growing number of House and Senate Republicans now expect Congress will soon pass a $1.1 billion funding package to combat the Zika virus without restrictions on Planned Parenthood, a move designed to overcome a filibuster by Senate Democrats and end the pre-election season with as little drama as possible.Such a move would represent a win for the White House and congressional Democrats. No final decisions have been made, particularly in the House where the dynamics are more complicated than the Senate. But negotiations have intensified over the last several days and final votes could occur as soon as next week in both chambers, according to senior GOP lawmakers and Republican officials. The idea: To tie a must-pass bill to keep the government open beyond the September 30 fiscal year deadline with language to fund vaccines and research to combat the spread of the Zika virus. Senators are likely to reach such a deal, and many Republicans now expect the House to go along as well.Jolly uses jar of live mosquitoes to urge House passage of Zika funding""I'd like to put it together,"" House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, said of a Zika package and a bill to keep the government open.In a private meeting convened Friday by House Speaker Paul Ryan, a vast majority of the 50 rank-and-file Republicans who spoke favored approving a short-term stop-gap bill until Dec. 9, several attendees said. A short-term bill is favored by defense hawks and appropriators, giving them a chance to reprioritize and potentially boost funding for certain programs in the lame-duck session -- rather than a long-term extension that would freeze lower levels of spending. ""I think the short term version is being strongly leaned to by the caucus,"" Rogers said.But doing so would anger House conservatives who are calling for any funding bill to be pushed off to next year -- giving a new Congress and administration say in the spending decisions and avoiding action by a lame-duck Congress after this November's elections.""I don't want a lame-duck,"" said Virginia Rep. Dave Brat, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who estimated between 50 and 100 other Republicans would vote against a short-term measure.""I don't think it would be good,"" said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. ""We don't think big spending bills should be landing in lame-duck. You're going to let people no longer accountable to voters deal with a big issue like that.""But Congress is under enormous pressure to act on Zika funding in the wake of the outbreak -- after legislation has been stalled over a round of partisan bickering. Senate Democrats have blocked a $1.1 billion funding bill three times, citing language in the bill to ease pesticide spraying restrictions and to exclude Planned Parenthood from the list of providers to help combat the spread of the virus, which can be sexually transmitted. Several Republicans exiting a morning meeting said it appeared increasingly likely that a clean bill -- without restrictions on Planned Parenthood -- would eventually be approved by both chambers of Congress.""That's where we're headed,"" said one senior Republican in leadership.But Ryan's office said discussions about a way forward were ongoing.Domestic spending is near 53-year lows. Yet Congress keeps cutting ...""No decisions have been made by House Republicans, and the discussions will continue,"" said AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman.At the Friday meeting, Ryan laid out the various options for keeping the government open, while also expressing his preference to move smaller funding bills in an effort to avoid passing a major, omnibus spending bill at year's end. But he did not specify his preference for how to resolve the Zika stalemate.The discussions come as congressional leaders meet with President Barack Obama at the White House Monday, in an effort to discuss the remaining business before Congress adjourns later this month to campaign ahead of November's elections. And Senate Republicans, in particular, are eager to return home given they are defending 24 seats this cycle and want to be as visible in their home states as possible.Rep. David Jolly, a Florida Republican in a tough reelection race who brought a jar of mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus to the Capitol this week, said voters should ""fire all of us"" if Congress can't approve a clean funding bill this month.""If we can't get Zika funding by the end of September then we are nothing but a bunch of idiots,"" Jolly said. ""At the end of the day, if I had to place my bet it's going to be what we see every year - we're going to have 100 Republicans committed to the 'governing caucus' side with all the Democrats and accept the responsibility that we hold, which is to fund the government. We've seen this before -- it's deja vu all over again.""Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Charlie Dent said some members are still pushing to add controversial policy provisions that would make it difficult to pass. And in a swipe at some of these conservative members, he said, ""We spend a lot of time around here taking advice from members who have no intention voting for bills.""Dent wants his leadership to move ahead with a short term bill that includes Zika money and possibly an appropriation bill that both sides can accept. But he worried that the House will lose any leverage with the Senate if the internal GOP split stalls action. ""If we have our usual circular firing squad discussions that go on ad naseum, then we'll get jammed,"" Dent said. ""And I think everyone is very much aware that that's a likely outcome. I'd rather be doing the jamming than being jammed myself."""	Congress looks to end standoff over Zika
7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/facebook-cofounder-gift-democrats/index.html	"The funds are a surprising infusion of cash from an individual who has never before been active in politics.Dustin Moskovitz, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a net worth of more than $10 billion, announced early Friday that he and his wife would make a historically large donation to a half-dozen Democratic groups, including those backing Hillary Clinton. The donations, once issued, will make Moskovitz the third most generous donor in the 2016 campaign. Clinton super PAC hauls in $21M in record-setting August ""This decision was not easy, particularly because we have reservations about anyone using large amounts of money to influence elections,"" Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna, wrote in a post on Medium. ""We hope these efforts make it a little more likely that Secretary Clinton is able to pursue the agenda she's outlined, and serve as a signal to the Republican Party that by running this kind of campaign — one built on fear and hostility — and supporting this kind of candidate, they compel people to act in response.""Moskovitz said $5 million would go to a super PAC run by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmentalist group running advertising and canvassing campaigns; and another $5 million to For Our Future PAC, an effort by organized labor and environmentalists to run a consolidated, high-powered field program.Other donations will be split between a joint fundraising committee for Hillary Clinton; the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; a political arm of MoveOn.Org; Color of Change PAC; and ""several nonpartisan voter registration and GOTV efforts.""Though Democratic groups are not hurting for cash, the September gifts could potentially open new avenues for Democratic groups looking to recapture control of Congress or defeat Trump. And the sheer size of the gift will make the 32-year-old one of the most sought-after and unlikeliest donors in the 2016 campaign. Moskovitz, a college roommate of Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, has not been particularly active in politics. He has only cut two checks before to candidates — both to New York congressional candidate Sean Eldridge, the husband of another Facebook co-founder — that amounted to $5,200.""Cari and I have dedicated our lives to figuring out how to do the most good we can with the resources we've been given. Until now, those efforts have not included making endorsements or contributions in presidential elections,"" Moskovitz wrote. ""The Republican Party, and Donald Trump in particular, is running on a zero-sum vision, stressing a false contest between their constituency and the rest of the world.""The $20 million will give new life to several Democratic groups, though Moskovitz's list notably omits Priorities USA, the principal super PAC supporting Clinton's campaign.Pro-Trump super PAC led by Rick Scott struggles post-Manafort departure Moskovitz told CNN that he was not ruling out a donation to Priorities USA and that his giving could eclipse the initial $20 million pledge. ""No further donations have been decided. We will say more if that changes."" Moskovitz will only be out punched as a donor by Tom Steyer, the California billionaire and Democratic activist who has given more than $30 million to his groups in the 2016 cycle; and Bob Mercer, a major Trump supporter who has given just a drop more than Moskovitz's $20 million to Republican groups in this election.  Steyer has also made a major donation to For Our Future PAC, which is aiming to raise $50 million to back the Democratic ticket. The largest donor so far to the League of Conservation Voters is a British investor, who gave a total of $2.5 million this summer."

Kerry said the accord would prevent Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's air force from flying combat missions anywhere the opposition is present, calling this provision the ""bedrock of the agreement."" He labeled the Syrian air force the ""main driver of civilian casualties"" and migrant flows.""That should put an end to the barrel bombs, an end to the indiscriminate bombing of civilian neighborhoods,"" Kerry said.In February, a cessation of hostilities negotiated between Kerry and Lavrov fell apart within weeks, and efforts to reach a political settlement in the war-torn country have been on the verge of collapse.Airstrikes in IdlibAirstrikes still went on Saturday in the city of Idlib, with at least 24 people killed, according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. The Syria Civil Defense, a volunteer search and rescue group, tweeted a dramatic image of airstrike victims in the city that's about 35 miles southwest of the besieged Aleppo.Kerry and Lavrov said Friday that once the cessation of hostilities holds for seven days, their countries would begin working on military coordination in an effort to target one-time al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh Al-Sham, previously known as al Nusra Front.""Going after Nusra is not a concession to anybody; it is profoundly in the interest of the United States to target al Qaeda,"" Kerry said, saying the group was planning attacks both in and outside of Syria, including ones directed at the United States.""If groups within the legitimate opposition want to retain their legitimacy, they need to distance themselves in every way possible from Nusra and Daesh,"" Kerry added, referring to ISIS.Kerry said this cooperation would entail ""some sharing of information"" with Russia pertaining to the delineation of the various groups on the battlefield. After the seven-day cessation of hostilities and delivery of aid, ""US and Russian experts will work together to defeat Daesh and Nusra,"" Kerry said.Kerry also said the accord would allow for humanitarian access to parts of Syria such as Aleppo caught in the crossfire and provide for the creation of a demilitarized areas around that northern city.The secretary reiterated several times the deal was dependent on the adherence of all parties, both regime and opposition.Citing private sources for al-Ikhbariya TV, Assad's government said ""all hostilities in Aleppo will be halted for humanitarian reasons"" and that one of the purposes of the deal is to find political solutions to the conflict. It said a US-Russian coordination center will be created to target ISIS and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham with warplanes and high-precision weaponry.World leaders welcome deal Syria's opposition favors the new deal ""if it is going to be enforced,"" Bassma Kodmani, a member of the High Negotiations Committee, said in a statement Saturday. ""When the cessation of hostilities was installed in February, the opposition -- 100 groups -- respected it. It was violated by the regime,"" Kodmani said. ""So a return to a cessation of hostilities has been our demand.""The United Nations also welcomed the deal, saying Saturday that it expected all parties to facilitate in the delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged areas.Foreign ministers in Turkey, Germany and the UK all greeted Friday's announcement. Months of effortThe landmark agreement comes after months of unsuccessful efforts to reach a ceasefire between Assad's government and moderate rebels that would expand humanitarian access for hundreds of thousands of Syrians, efforts met by public skepticism from both the White House and the Pentagon.Officials involved in the negotiations had been less than optimistic about a possible agreement in the latest round of talks in Geneva, with one senior official traveling with Kerry saying, ""We are going to try, but our patience is not infinite.""But during Friday's drawn-out press conference, a lighthearted moment occurred when the Russian minister orchestrated the delivery of pizzas and two bottles of Russian vodka to the reporters, saying, ""The pizza was from the US delegation, the vodka was from the Russian delegation.""Greater cooperation between US, RussiaThe new US-Russia strategy hinges on deeper cooperation between the US and Russian military against extremist groups operating in Syria, particularly ISIS and the former al Nusra. The two sides are also holding talks on coordinating more closely the air operations they are both conducting in Syria.But the United States has resisted coming to an agreement due to Russian and Syrian regime actions against civilians in Aleppo.The United States wants a nationwide ceasefire in Syria between the regime and the rebels to create the conditions for UN-led political talks to end the five-year civil war. The US-backed moderate opposition has refused to resume the UN-led talks unless a cessation of hostilities take hold and the regime and Russia end the siege and bombing of Aleppo.""The opposition tells us they want to reach a deal with the Russians if in fact it would stop some of the worst forms of violence against the Syrian people,"" a second senior administration official said.Clarissa Ward: 'There are no winners in Aleppo'Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, appeared with Kerry and Lavrov after the announcement to signal the United Nations backed the new agreement.Earlier Friday, he said an agreement would make a major difference in terms of the cessation of hostilities and have a big impact on the delivery of humanitarian aid.Both President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Ash Carter have had tough words for Russia in recent days, dimming the prospect of a deal on a ceasefire and closer military cooperation. The United States and Russia are both ostensibly fighting ISIS in Syria, but Washington has charged that Russia has mostly focused on bombing groups opposing Assad, a close ally. The United States supports some of those opposition groups.Obama has questioned whether a deal was possible given the ""gaps of trust"" between the two countries after meeting Monday in China with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20.The decision to deepen cooperation with Moscow was already controversial, given the Obama administration's public criticism of Russia's role in Syria. Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, said Friday he didn't trust Russia on a deal such as this. ""I think it's good and I applaud Secretary Kerry because I think the effort needs to be made. The only way to stop the carnage in Syria is to get some sensible transition away from Assad, and the Russians are key to that,"" Smith told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""""I think in the meantime if we can get humanitarian aid to some of these places that are suffering, I mean that's a win, but at the end of the day, Syria will not make a successful transition to a reasonable government until Assad agrees to leave."""
