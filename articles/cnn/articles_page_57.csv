""People are going to know if you voted or not. Your voting history is public record. It doesn't say who you voted for, but it says if you voted at all,"" she said. ""Anyone who knows you can just look that sh-- up.""Finally, all those years of internet stalking our exes will prove to be a useful and necessary skill. The only thing worse than your mom finding out you didn't vote is people on Twitter finding out you didn't vote. Schumer continues encouraging people to actually go out and vote instead of pretending you did at dinner parties. ""Your decision to vote or not is obviously up to you but judging you for that decision could be up to the internet and everyone has access to that,"" she said. It turns out, you have more to worry about than people finding out that you secretly enjoy Nickelback.Schumer went on to denounce Donald Trump in her usual subtle way, saying ""I hope that people don't blame you if an orange, sexually-assaulting Godzilla who started a fake college is f---ing up the entire planet a year or so from now.""Schumer concluded the video by explaining that she's just looking out for us and by urging people to vote for Hillary Clinton.

Mae Brown Wiggins recalled applying for an apartment at a property operated by Donald Trump's family decades ago, and being rejected because she was black. ""Trump just turned me away because of the color of my skin. And they had done the same thing to many others,"" Wiggins said, pausing several times to wipe her eyes. ""When I think about how they lied to me just because I was black, I still feel the anger. I can't share this experience with him ... without feeling the pain.""A message left with the Trump campaign seeking response was not returned.Wiggins' emotional remarks on Friday were followed by a bleak speech from Clinton, in which the Democratic nominee reached back to some of the darkest moments of Trump's past — a pattern of racial discrimination in his past business dealings, his involvement in an infamous rape case that rocked New York City years ago and more recently, the support his presidential campaign has received from white supremacist groups.In her first public remarks about the 1989 ""Central Park Five"" case, in which five men of color were wrongly convicted of rape, Clinton slammed Trump for taking out full-page ads in newspapers ""calling for the death penalty.""""Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated,"" she said. ""But not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison. To him, those kids were still and will always be guilty, no matter what the evidence says.""Clinton also accused Trump of openly fueling ""his most hateful supporters,"" as she pointed to the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan recently expressing its support for Trump.""He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters,"" Clinton said. ""He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he is being heard loudly and clearly.""Clinton's remarks on Friday in North Carolina -- where black turnout will be critical to whether the Democrat can win the state -- was one of a series of recent somber speeches that the former secretary has delivered in the homestretch of the 2016 election. As a part of her broader strategy to convince voters that she is the only nominee who is qualified to be president, Clinton has repeatedly warned against Trump's divisive and inflammatory language. While she has never outright called him a racist, Clinton has continually painted the Republican nominee as racist and sexist, and has said repeatedly that he lacks the temperament to be commander in chief.In the final days of the election, Clinton has used targeted messaging to speak to different slices of the Democratic coalition that twice elected President Barack Obama. Clinton has looked to popular surrogates -- namely Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- to help energize African-Americans, Latinos and young voters.Key to Clinton's strategy with these groups has been to turn Trump's own words against him. For example, the Clinton campaign released an ad on Thursday titled ""We Are America,"" which strings together what Democrats view as Trump's greatest hits of offensive and salacious comments.This week, guests at Clinton events have included former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump criticized after she gained weight, as well as Bruce Blair, a former ballistic missile launch officer who said he would ""live in constant fear"" if Trump were president. ""You have got to ask yourself,"" Clinton said in Winterville on Friday. ""Do any of us, any of us who believe in our Constitution, believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively towards the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders, do any of us have a place in Trump's America?""Hours later, at a rally in Raleigh with Sanders and musical artist Pharrell Williams, Clinton again shared with supporters Wiggins' story. And echoing her former primary rival, Clinton warned that Trump is on the verge of ""normalizing discrimination.""""So when you hear as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously,"" Clinton said. ""Because it truly, it truly is at stake in this election."""	'Central Park Five' and the KKK: Clinton paints Trump as a racist

But the officials stressed that the threat is non-specific, could just be idle chatter and is not seen as imminent. It is one of many security concerns authorities are monitoring in the run-up to Election Day.New York law enforcement is already on heightened security with the city hosting a marathon this weekend that will attract huge crowds, voting on Tuesday, and both presidential candidates' Election Night campaign parties.Officials said a great deal of security measures are in place.RELATED: Clinton, Trump make their closing arguments""You can assume there will be considerable security around Election Night, particularly given, as I understand it, that the two major party candidates will be having events in New York City,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Friday. ""And so there will be considerable security contributions by the federal government, by the NYPD state and local law enforcement.""""We have these concerns around every election, but I have to say that I think there is more of a concern this time than I've seen in the past,"" California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead.""""There is a threat and I can't go into specifics,"" he said. ""But we often see around pivotal events, like an election, like July 4, an increase in the threat to the country and here you have al Qaeda that is still trying to prove that it's lethal, still trying to compete with ISIS, ISIS losing its caliphate, trying to lash out.""More typical concerns about Election Day have also been compounded because of the particularly divisive campaign, according to law enforcement sources. That's led to concern among law enforcement officials about someone agitated by the toxic political environment taking criminal action.CBS News was first to report the al Qaeda threat.A New York police spokesman said the force is ""aware of the information"" and working with the FBI.""We take any intelligence reports regarding New York City seriously,"" said J. Peter Donald, NYPD spokesman. ""In this case, I would point out that the credibility of those reports is still being assessed and the information lacks specificity.""RELATED: Turmoil in the FBIA law enforcement official in Texas told CNN that there is no specific and credible information that is suggesting a threat to elections in Texas. But the official added that authorities remain very vigilant throughout the state. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement noting that his office was working with law enforcement to monitor the situation.""Texans should go about their daily lives as usual, but remain vigilant over the next several days and report any suspicious activity to state or local law enforcement,"" he said. ""The State of Texas will continue to do everything it can to ensure the safety and security of its citizens.""Virginia State Police issued a statement Friday afternoon saying authorities continue ""to assess any potential threats associated with the election or other major events taking place within the Commonwealth.""The statement noted that the police already have plans in place ""to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our communities on Election Day.""Speaking at Newark Liberty International Airport, Johnson did not directly comment on the reports regarding Election Day security. Instead, he advocated his department's vigilance in reviewing all possible threats and related preventive procedures.""I won't comment on the specific item in the news except to say, in a general manner, the American people need to know that the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, state and local law enforcement review our security posture, review intelligence, review threat streams daily if not hourly,"" Johnson told reporters Friday. ""Something I did this morning.""Federal authorities are also working with local officials across the country.""The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety,"" according to a statement from the FBI's New York field office."

Bush White House suffered years of recriminations for not preparing more robustly to secure Iraq and Afghanistan following initially successful invasions, the Obama administration now risks fielding similar criticism for its campaign to retake the second-largest city in Iraq. But US officials are defending their lack of a completed plan by saying the task is so complicated it would have indefinitely delayed the campaign to kick out the terror group.   The US on Thursday reported that Iraqi troops, backed by US airpower and Special Forces, had stormed toward Mosul with unexpected speed. While that success is welcome, it is intensifying concerns that the US and its partners have not adequately prepared for the biggest challenge yet to come: finding a way to keep the peace in the city after two years of ISIS domination.The battle is expected to lead to a major refugee exodus, a possible ISIS insurgency should fighters opt to blend in with the local population rather than flee or fight to the death, and power struggles among Mosul's diverse ethnic, tribal and religious groups.Some Western diplomats have privately voiced to CNN concern that not enough planning had been done in the run-up to the assault, even when it wasn't ahead of schedule.Lessons of Iraq learned?In conversations with CNN, they questioned whether the US had learned the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan, where critics inside and outside of the Obama administration slammed President George W. Bush for lacking a post-invasion stabilization plan and not ensuring that the countries' new governments were inclusive.Obama administration officials acknowledge that the day-after plan for Mosul was still very much a work in progress when the first shots were fired just over two weeks ago. And there is no agreement to date on who should control Mosul once ISIS is kicked out.""Everybody has a different idea for how Nineveh Province should be governed, who should be the governor,"" said Brett McGurk, the US special presidential envoy for the counter-ISIS fight, referring to the region that Mosul is part of. ""Every other person you meet will say, I should be the governor, he should be the governor.""""The problem here is that if you try to resolve all of those issues, Daesh will remain in Mosul for the foreseeable future and perhaps forever,"" he added, using the Arabic term for the terror group. ""This is really a war of momentum. We feel the momentum is on the side of the Iraqi security forces.""On Thursday, McGurk tweeted that the operation was ahead of schedule.Nick Heras, a Middle East analyst at the Center for a New American Security, described the governing situation in Mosul is ""incredibly complex.""There are two main factions vying for the lead role in the post-ISIS running of the city, he noted.Baghdad's plan is to have the central government's designated governor of Nineveh Province take charge of the governance and policing efforts.But Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government, which runs an autonomous zone near Mosul in northern Iraq, have their own preferred man, Atheel al-Nujaifi, the former governor, who seeks to divide the province into semi-autonomous sub-districts, a plan favored by minority groups like the Kurds.About 1,000 Turkish troops are in northern Iraq helping to train a Sunni tribal police force to help stabilize Mosul, deployment that has irked the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. Turkey has also demanded a greater role in the Mosul campaign, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying that his country's historical role in the area during the Ottoman Empire gives Ankara the right to have influence in the region.Heras said that many of Mosul's Sunni residents view the Shiite-led government in Baghdad with suspicion, especially because of its use of Shiite militias, known as Popular Mobilization Forces, in the fight against ISIS. Many of these militias are aligned with Iran.Humanitarian organization have accused these forces of human rights violations.Assurances from the central government in Baghdad that only local forces will be used to secure Mosul have not dampened those suspicions. Kurdish and Turkish officials are also skeptical that government forces alone are capable of securing the city.Another complicating factor is the Iraqi government's inability to eject the Turkish military or compel the Kurdish Regional Government by force of arms, forcing Baghdad to rely on the US as a mediator.US could be caught as referee""The US will be caught trying to play referee"" between the competing groups, Heras predicted.McGurk acknowledged the challenge of trying to accommodate the various factions but said that effort must begin in earnest only once ISIS is no longer holding the city -- an assessment shared by several current and former diplomats and military officials who spoke to CNN.Diplomats are pushing the Iraqis to set up an interim governing council, similar to the one created after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2002, comprising Iraq's various ethnic groups, tribes, religious sects and sectors of society.  ""There will be an important role for all the notables of Mosul, but the assessment from the Iraqis, which I very much agree with, is that it would be impossible to resolve all of these very difficult issues while Daesh is sitting in Mosul,"" McGurk said.James Jeffrey, the former American ambassador to Iraq during the Obama administration, agreed with the current US approach.The US and its allies ""couldn't afford to wait for the governance plan to be fully in place,"" he said, but ""had to take on ISIS as soon as possible."" He added that the most immediate issue -- providing humanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons -- had been adequately planned for.International relief agencies have estimated that as many as one million Iraqis could be displaced by the fight.While he acknowledged that Turkey and the Kurds were seeking to exert influence on Mosul, Jeffrey said that he was confident a governing plan could be negotiated between the various factions.""I've never seen cooperation between Baghdad and Irbil as good as it is right now,"" he said, referring to the capital of the Kurdistan Regional Government. He said that this collaboration has been on display during the battle for Mosul and that its continuation would be critical given the large number of Kurds in east Mosul.Local police recruits could helpJeffrey added that unlike 2014 when Mosul fell, Baghdad is now putting a much bigger emphasis on recruiting and training local forces for policing.US Military officials have repeatedly said that they are making a concerted effort to train local security forces to help stabilize Mosul and ward off any ISIS insurgents, even as governing issues remaining in flux.""We've trained a very large number of security police forces because these are going to be key to establishing a degree of stability in the areas that get liberated from Daesh,"" US Air Force Col. John Dorrian told reporters last week.""Daesh won't be allowed to simply melt away and then do terrorist attacks or sort of (insurgency) ops. The police will be in these areas and assisting with that challenge,"" he said.Asked if there was a post-conflict plan ready for Mosul, Dorrian said, ""There is a plan in place, but it's an adaptive plan ... they continue to work on this.""He added, ""I think what we have to do is get Mosul cleared of Daesh, and once we do that, we'll see where those remaining elements are.""

""People feel a kinship between the social democrats of the world and we like going to help our sister parties when we get a chance.""Donnelly and his four friends, aged between 39-42, met through Australian campus politics in the late 1990s. This year they embarked on a trip to the US for what they call ""the NBA of political election campaigns."" Their goal is to get as many Americans involved in the electoral process, and encourage them to vote for Hillary Clinton.Their journey in a minivan -- dubbed ""The Truck of Justice"" -- has taken them from the deep south of Tennessee, Louisiana, Alabama and Georgia, through South Carolina and North Carolina, and all the way up to Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York, for Election Night.""We're starting in Republican territory because we want to see all sides of the country,"" Donnelly explains. ""Even Republicans appreciate we're here, they're fascinated, and that warmth and welcoming nature is a testament to the country,"" adds journey mate Steve Cusworth.In a small Democratic campaign office in Charleston, South Carolina, the Australian group immediately stands out, with ""Aussies for Hillary"" t-shirts and matching swag, including beer holders they gift to the local party chairman, Brady Quirk-Garvan, for hosting them.""We get emails and calls from people who want to volunteer all the time, most of them live within 10-15 miles of the office,"" Quirk-Garvan says. ""This is our first group of people who have come to this office from out of the country to volunteer, but the great part is it shows the importance of this election, how critical it is that people are willing to spend their own time and their own money and travel to help elect Hillary Clinton and other Democrats.""This isn't the first time the politically passionate volunteers have been around to campaign in the US. In October 2008, ""Aussies for Obama: a road trip you can believe in"" kicked off a three-week journey that culminated in the group attending a Barack Obama rally and shaking the future president's hand. Donnelly says he was also inspired by American campaigning tactics, which he later brought back to his homeland and utilized to win the electoral campaign for state government of Victoria, AustraliaThis time around their aim to ""Make America Australia Again,"" is both a pun on Trump's slogan and a wishful hope of preventing the US from going down ""a silly path,"" says team member Matt Nurse.Worldwide volunteersThe Aussies are not alone. During the final stretch of the American presidential campaigns, it is not unusual to come across a growth in politically-minded volunteers from across the world.""We believe that the outcome of the presidential election has huge ramifications for international relations,"" says Victoria Desmond, who leads the delegation for the British Young Fabians.The group of 10 delegates from the United Kingdom ranges from teenagers to 30-year-olds, and they are currently helping with the ""Get Out the Vote"" campaign in Florida, making calls and canvasing the towns. ""We are very concerned by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and his particularly stance on Mexico and comments on the Muslim community,"" Desmond adds.""As civil rights activists, we believe electing the first female President of the United States is a huge step forward for women across of the globe,"" she says.According to the US Federal Election Commission, ""even though a foreign national cannot make campaign contributions or expenditures (including advances of personal funds), he or she can serve as an uncompensated volunteer for a campaign or political party,"" with the exception of a decision-making or management role.The Trump camp is also receiving support from people all over the world. ""Our plan is to explain to French people that Donald Trump is a solution to US problems, but also to European problems (with terrorism, Russia, and so on),"" the managers of ""France for Donald Trump"" Facebook group write in a message.They present themselves as two young Frenchmen and asked to remain anonymous ""as it is quite bad seen to support Donald Trump in France, and especially to support both Trump and Le Pen,"" they write, referring to far-right French politician Marine Le Pen.Meanwhile, the Israeli group ""Trump White & Blue"" is organizing a November 7, Trump support rally in Jerusalem, which will include Trump yarmulkes and prayer ""for the success of Mr. Trump as the next president.""But taking it a step further and crossing the ocean to meet American voters face-to-face sparks a different kind of conversation and helps better understand the various community voices, the Australian volunteers say. And as for reactions, Donnelly says that other than a slight accent barrier, people are either intrigued by their presence or simply ""too busy to notice.""Back at home, the group says their family and friends are mostly supportive, though not everyone understands the drive. ""My wife knows I'm a political tragic,"" Nurse laughs, ""but my little daughter, who's four, said, 'Why are you going to America, why are you doing that?' and my boss is looking forward for me coming back and tell him exactly why I did this.""""There's a lot of curiosity because it is a bit different,"" Nurse says, ""but I think going out there and giving up your labor to a serious cause is just as good as sitting on a beach for a day."""

JULIA GILLARDJulia Gillard became Australia's first female prime minister in dramatic style after successfully challenging then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for the Labour Party leadership in June of 2010.Overnight, Gillard went from Deputy Prime Minister to leader of the nation -- and online, people scrambled to find out more about the red-haired, unmarried, British-born woman who had swiftly disposed of Rudd.A few months later, Gillard narrowly won the federal election. But in 2013 she was ousted by the very same person she initially wrested power from --  Rudd. Why were people asking about Gillard's sexuality? Gillard was one of Australia's few unmarried leaders, and her relationship with hairdresser boyfriend Tim Mathieson drew plenty of media attention. In 2013 radio shock jock Howard Sattler was fired after repeatedly asking the prime minister if her partner was gay because of his profession.""There was this sense in the media that Julia should explain why she was a woman in her 50s who didn't have kids and wasn't married,"" said David Denemark, professor of political science and international relations at the University of Western Australia.""So much attention was paid to her as a female, and not as the nation's leader.""What do her earlobes have to do with it? When Gillard faced Liberal Party leader Tony Abbott in a televised debate ahead of the 2010 election, it appeared one of the biggest talking points wasn't her policies -- but her ""pendulous earlobes."" Following the debate, thousands of people liked Facebook pages dedicated to Gillard's ""epic pouches of skin.""""Television is famous for being an image-based medium,"" said Denemark. ""And to play on the personality and not the subtleties of policies is easy to do.""""Most people don't know much about politics, and they rely on the media as their point of access -- and if the media plays to these images then it seems to really emphasize all of that.""The expert view: ""The pre-election Google searches appeared more substantive,"" said Denemark. ""It's a worry that post-election it was all 'earlobes' and 'jokes' and 'partner.'""ERNA SOLBERGErna Solberg was elected Norway's prime minister in September 2013, the second woman ever to hold the position after Gro Harlem Brundtland in 1981.Solberg has been a member of parliament since 1989, and will face her next election in September 2017. She earned the nickname ""Iron Erna"" after tightening immigration rules as a minister in the early 2000s, though in recent years has apparently adopted a more ""caring"" public persona.  Norwegians want a leader who stands for them: Politicians flaunting their wealth and superiority probably aren't going to get very far in social democratic Norway -- and Solberg was no different.""Norway is a country were equality is highly praised,"" said Hilde Danielsen, research professor in cultural studies at the Uni Research Rokkan Centre in Bergen. ""Solberg was representing the Conservative Party, but also had an image as being quite common, definitely not posh,"" said Danielsen, pointing to a popular newspaper feature in the run-up to the election that  showed pictures inside the politician's untidy and unfashionable home. But what's the obsession with Solberg's weight? Solberg has never been shy about discussing her weight, and during a TV2 interview in December last year even read out some of the online abuse she had received -- including messages calling her a ""fat bastard.""""Solberg seems comfortable in her body and makes jokes about her weight even in parliamentary debates,"" said Danielsen, adding that while Solberg's size was in the public eye, it didn't dominate headlines.""Female politicians in Norway are generally respected, and we have had a history of many public female politicians since the 1980s,"" she continued.""However we still see a greater interest in their family life compared to male politicians, and the focus on looks and appearance is probably bigger now than it used to be in the 1990s.""The expert view: ""Since her election, Solberg has been seen more and more as a mother of the nation, parallel to Angela Merkel's position in Germany,"" said Danielsen.CRISTINA FERNÁNDEZ DE KIRCHNERCristina Fernández de Kirchner became Argentina's first elected female president in October 2007, and was reelected for a second term in October 2011. Her predecessor and husband Nestor Kirchner loomed large in her political career until his death from a heart attack in 2010.Since leaving office in 2015, Cristina has been the focus of various corruption investigations -- which she denies. Why don't people know Mrs Kirchner's name? Cristina's husband Nestor was president of Argentina from 2003 to 2007, and some political analysts say his wife rose to power on the back of his name.""It was very difficult to avoid the derogatory construction of Cristina Fernandez as the 'wife of Kirchner,'"" explained Jane L. Christie, author of ""Negotiating Gendered Discourses: Michelle Bachelet and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.""""Many positioned Nestor Kirchner as her authoritative patron, and constructed him as an almost paternal figure who had delegated power to his wife.""That said, Argentina also has a history of women leaders (Isabel Peron served as president in 1974, though was not elected by the people), and the country has gender quotas to increase female representation in parliament. Why did a ""fotoblog"" get people talking? Those wanting an insight into Argentina's first family were granted behind-the-scenes access thanks to their teenage daughter's blog.Florencia Kirchner, who also went by the online name ""Florkey,"" posted images messing about with her friends, interviewed herself, and included backstage photographs of her mom's presidential inauguration.While the site raised eyebrows in the local press for its perceived vulgarity, it also drew many fans who described Florkey as ""just an ordinary teenager trying to enjoy herself.""The expert view: ""There was a mixed perception of continuation and change surrounding Cristina,"" explained Christie.""Some anticipated the continuation of her husband's politics,"" she said. ""At the same time, she was constructed as the face of newness, a break from a long history of male political leaders.""'SHARPER EDGE' FOR WOMEN?In Australia, the focus on Gillard's appearance dramatically increased once she became prime minister.While in Norway, Solberg's policies were scrutinized as fiercely as her weight.And in Argentina, Kirchner struggled to step out of the shadow of first her political heavyweight husband, and then social media sensation daughter. ""Some of these questions are just natural curiosity -- 'who is she?' and 'what do we know about her?'"" said Denemark on the Google searches around the world.""But maybe people do it with a sharper edge for women,"" he added. ""Things such as earlobes and dress styles -- I'd really like to see the media not play to the lowest common denominator and comment so heavily on these."""

Obama hopes to bring the existing sentences of inmates more in line with current laws, which have been relaxed after an era of strict mandatory minimums.""What President Obama has done for commutations is unprecedented in the modern era,"" White House Counsel Neil Eggleston wrote in a blog post. ""The President is committed to reinvigorating the clemency authority, demonstrating that our nation is a nation of second chances, where mistakes from the past will not deprive deserving individuals of the opportunity to rejoin society and contribute to their families and communities.""Obama individually approves each reduced sentence, taking into account the crime committed and the inmate's potential for success outside of prison.Among the inmates who received news Friday their sentences had been reduced: Albert Campbell, who was charged in 1995 with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison.Ricky Mitchell, of Georgia, has been serving a life sentence since 1997 for charges related to distributing cocaine.And Madison Pugh, Jr., who was sentenced in 1996 on drug charges in Ohio, learned Friday his sentence was reduced from life in prison to 30 years behind bars.The White House says the commutations are a step toward instilling fairness in the criminal justice system, but insist that fully reforming sentencing laws will require congressional action."

""I think the endorsement is far different than who you actually vote for. And it's the one vote I actually do for myself. I don't represent anybody else. We all get the same vote.

So far, Clinton's travel plans hint at a strategy of shoring up her strongholds to prevent Trump from breaking out while laying multiple roadblocks that would prevent Trump from winning 270 electoral votes.Clinton can't afford falloffBut she cannot afford any falloff in Democratic turnout from 2012 — and is talking up the chances of a Trump victory to create a sense of urgency among her supporters.""If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander in chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous,"" Clinton said Thursday in North Carolina. Trump could ""easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a Twitter war."" On Friday, Clinton will play defense and head to Detroit to fire up base voters, especially African-Americans. She'll be in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia later on, the epicenters of heavy Democratic votes in Pennsylvania.Both states are on Trump's lists of possibilities where a breach of Clinton's defensive wall could turn the electoral math on its head.On Saturday, after a day on the trail elsewhere, Clinton will be back in Philadelphia for a concert with Katy Perry.Democrats, Trump lawyers going to court early -- and oftenOn Sunday, she'll head to Ohio. She's likely not made her last visits to Florida or North Carolina, states that her campaign is blanketing with high-profile surrogates, including President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton.Should Clinton deprive Trump of Ohio, North Carolina or Florida, she will likely make it all but impossible for Trump to amass 270 electoral votes.Her campaign will wrap up with a symbolic torch passing rally with Obama and first lady Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton in Philadelphia on Monday night. The event will underscore the symbolism of her historic potential as the possible first female president in the city that nurtured American democracy -- and contains a crucial bloc of voters.As it shores up its electoral position, the Clinton campaign's final message to voters is adding a harsh new twist to a narrative she has been spinning for months — that Trump is simply not fit to be President.The races that could flip the SenateIt's the latest in a string of hard-hitting Clinton campaign ads highlighting offensive remarks by Trump about Hispanics, disabled people, veterans and women, and several provocative comments about nuclear weapons, and war, over a black and white montage of Americans of every race and age.The ad ends with the kicker ""We are not him.""The Democratic nominee followed up with a searing indictment of her Republican opponent on Thursday, reaching back to some of Trump's most explosive comments on race as she campaigned in North Carolina, where high turnout among African-Americans will be crucial to her chances.""He has spent this entire campaign offering dog whistles to his most hateful supporters,"" Clinton said. ""He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he is being heard loudly and clearly."" Obama went even further as he beseeched young voters in Florida to send Clinton to the White House, just as their predecessors did for him in 2008 and 2012.""This is different. This is somebody who would do damage to our democracy, who is uniquely unqualified and shows no interest in becoming more qualified,"" Obama said, before going on to make a more positive case for Clinton, who he said dedicated her life to making other people's lives better.Trump's caseTrump's case about Clinton is no less bleak, underscoring the deeply antagonistic and divisive nature of the campaign.The billionaire is portraying his foe as an impeachment waiting to happen, expanding on his ""Crooked Hillary"" theme and seizing on the revived controversy surrounding her private email server to maximize the damage.Rapper Common explains the silver lining of Donald Trump""Hillary Clinton has engaged in a massive, far-reaching criminal conduct, and equally far-reaching cover-up,"" Trump said Thursday in Florida. ""She created an illegal e-mail server to shield and guard her activity, so simple, so simple.""""Here we go again with Clinton, you remember the impeachment, and the problems?"" he continued. ""She's likely to be under investigation for many, many years, also likely to conclude in a criminal trial. This is not what we need in this country, folks. We need somebody that's going to go to work to bring our jobs back, to take care of our military, to strengthen up our borders.""Trump is also keeping himself in check, showing unusual discipline. After a campaign in which he has repeatedly undermined his own prospects with volatile behavior and controversial comments, he's  stuck to the script for days.Can Teleprompter Trump stay disciplined?But the pressure will be intense in the final days and will represent the ultimate test of Trump's temperament and self control. He has so far announced plans to travel to New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania on Friday, North Carolina on Saturday and again on Sunday before heading to New Hampshire.That itinerary suggests Trump is still seeking to secure Ohio, where his blue-collar friendly populist message has him slightly ahead, and must have North Carolina, where he is four points behind Clinton in the CNN Poll of Polls.Trump's trip to New Hampshire comes after several polls showing a serious narrowing of the race in a state Democrats had banked on Clinton winning.The Granite State only has four electoral votes but it is part of a sequence of battleground states that Trump needs to win to take the presidency, also including Iowa, Nevada and Colorado — assuming he wins North Carolina, Ohio and Florida.And the wild race is down to its final weekend."

Es un payaso!"" Kaine said in Phoenix, Arizona, which translates to, ""Donald Trump said that immigrants from Mexico are drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. He is a clown!""Some Hispanic viewers noticed Kaine's call-out. Some supported it and some disliked it, and others just found it entertaining:This isn't the first time Kaine has called Trump a clown in Spanish. In an interview with Univision's Jorge Ramos Kaine called Trump not only a clown, but an idiot. Trump acts like ""un idiota"" and ""un payaso,"" Kaine told Ramos in August, saying Trump's actions against the Latino community are idiotic and actions of a clown.This election season certainly hasn't been lacking any negative language. But Kaine hit a new demographic with this, using his language ability to attack his opponent for a broader audience. Kaine's Spanish speech includes the Hispanic community and over 40 million Spanish-speaking Americans in the conversation during this election. The speech was coupled with a Spanish-language media push with Univision and Telemundo, and Kaine took over the Spanish-language Hillary Clinton Twitter account, @Hillary_ESP.The outreach strategy seemed to be working — Telemundo led their evening broadcast with Kaine's speech. ""While we wanted to do the speech in Arizona for very specific reasons, our goal is obviously to reach more broadly across the country to the Latino community,"" said Kaine communications director Karen Finney, pointing to high registration and early vote numbers from the Latino community in Arizona. ""The Latino vote is going to make a huge difference and I don't think that those that folks are going to turn out for Donald Trump."" Kaine told Thursday's audience that the power of the Latino vote will make a ""historical difference"" in next week's election, and emphasized the value of the Latino community, making a direct appeal. ""Whether your family got here recently, or whether your family has been here since before the US came to be Hillary Clinton and I believe that you are our brothers and sisters, and we will fight for all of you. We will fight for all of you,"" Clinton's running mate said in his remarks.  ""I want all of you to know that we do understand you, and that we are with you. The United States is a better country because of you. A better country."""	Tim Kaine calls Donald Trump a clown in Spanish: 'Payaso'
