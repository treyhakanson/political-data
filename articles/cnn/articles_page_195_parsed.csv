CNN also reported information from the Belgian prosecutor that a man allegedly linked to the Paris attackers was on the loose for months after authorities learned of his existence. ""The outlook is as bleak as it has ever been,"" said Paul Cruickshank, editor of CTC Sentinel, a publication issued by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, and a terrorism analyst for CNN. Characterizing the mood at a recent high-level European conference on counter-terrorism, Cruickshank said, ""We're talking beyond severe concern.""The European countries most firmly in the crosshairs are launching air strikes against ISIS with the US-led coalition: France, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK and Denmark, as well as Germany, which is flying target reconnaissance sorties.US vulnerable, tooTerror analysts warn that despite the buffer provided by the Atlantic Ocean, the US is vulnerable, too.""It is by no means immune,"" warned Matthew Henman, editor of IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center in Houndsditch, UK.He pointed to the US border with Mexico, which ""is far from secure or impenetrable.""Airports are another point of entry. Western European passport holders can travel to the US without a visa. US nationals have also been able travel to Western Europe and from there to Syria via Turkey, returning via the same routes.RELATED: First on CNN: ISIS planned for more operatives, targets during Paris attacksThe difficulties European security services have had amidst these challenges illustrate how daunting it is to track ISIS sympathizers and former fighters.First, ISIS' operating structure means that nabbing one suspected terrorist doesn't necessarily make it easier to find the others. One official likened the ISIS' structure to a series of concentric circles in which only the inner circle knows everything. People in each outward circle have a little bit less knowledge or a very specific role to play.Someone tapped to supply weapons for the Paris attack might have had no idea who would get them or how they would be used, the official said.Then the group's use of encrypted communications, detailed in CNN's initial report, makes it extremely difficult for security services to locate and identify individuals.""Even when they locate suspected ISIS operatives, security services are finding that pretty much the only way to track their communications is to bug their homes or cars,"" Cruickshank said.The CNN investigation showed yet another layer of protection for ISIS employs, insisting that operatives use pseudonyms, leaving them unable to give authorities their co-conspirators real names.Europe bracing for ISIS presence to growEuropean officials are now concerned that ISIS' European presence is set to grow. As ISIS suffers losses in Syria, Iraq and Libya, these officials are bracing for the group's fighters to return to Europe in greater numbers, not only to launch attacks, but also to mobilize others, sources told CNN.Cruickshank said official estimates of the number of European passport holders who have traveled to Syria and Iraq range from 6,000 to 9,000 people, many of whom have traveled to fight for ISIS.Europe's tightening security net could prompt the group to ""send as many fighters back to Europe as possible in the awareness that its ability to do so would not last indefinitely,"" said Henman of IHS Jane's.Against this backdrop, some European officials said security services are struggling.Hazim Fouad, an analyst who focuses on Islamic extremism for the Bremen branch of Germany's Office of the Protection of the Constitution, told the Combating Terrorism Center in July that ""during the past few years a wave of foreign fighters, a general increase in the Salafi movement, as well as a sky-rocketing of right-wing-motivated criminal offenses, stretched security agencies up to and beyond their limits.""Henman noted that security services across Western Europe, let alone in less wealthy Central Europe and the Balkans, are operating at full capacity just trying to identify all those returning from Syria and Iraq and then determine who poses a genuine threat.""Budget and resource constraints, alongside sub-optimal intelligence-sharing practices and protocols between countries, only hamper these efforts further,"" Henman said.That may be why it took European security officials months to track down a man they suspected of being tied to the Paris attackers. Abid Tabaouni, named publicly for the first time in the exclusive CNN report, was the subject of a Europe-wide arrest warrant that Austrian officials requested in February. He wasn't brought into custody until July, when Belgian security officials located him in Brussels. European investigators are now examining an apparent visit Tabaouni made to Amsterdam while security agencies were searching for him, sources told CNN. A CNN analysis of his Facebook account revealed that on February 24, 2016, Tabaouni posted a picture of himself in front of Amsterdam's waterfront skyline and that he reposted the same picture on March 26.Investigators are aware of these posts and are looking into whether they have any significance, sources told CNN. Analysts warn that ISIS propaganda has focused overwhelmingly on inciting individuals -- so-called lone wolves -- to launch attacks independently.  ""It is not just an additional threat that the West now faces, but an additional element for the security services to try and contend with,"" said Henman, who pointed to the December 2015 assault on a regional center in San Bernardino, California, and the June strike on a nightclub in Orlando, Florida.Repeats of those attacks ""will very much be what the Islamic State tries to inspire and provoke in the coming months,"" he said."	30 to 40 ISIS suspects at large, European officials say	[]	[]
1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/hillary-clinton-national-security-meeting/index.html	"With this one brief press conference, Clinton signaled loud and clear: I've done this before.Just two months out from Election Day with the race between Clinton and Donald Trump tightening, the former secretary of state's meeting on Friday with a bipartisan group of foreign policy experts and the press conference that followed demonstrated the increasing prominence of national security in the 2016 campaign. Seizing an opening after a string of gaffes this week left Trump vulnerable, Clinton told reporters here that the 2016 election is the ""most important in our lifetime"" that calls for ""rational, confident and even-keeled leadership.""""No conversation about our national security would be complete unless we acknowledged that the nominee on the other side promises to do things that will make us less safe,"" Clinton said. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle are chilled by what they're hearing from the Republican nominee.""Clinton at length discussed the news that North Korea had conducted another underground nuclear test, saying it was yet another reminder of the threats the United States and its allies face. ""ISIS and North Korea's quest for a nuclear weapon are not entirely unconnected. Because the greatest threat of all would be terrorists getting their hands on loose nuclear material,"" she said. Friday's meeting and press conference, held at the storied New-York Historical Society, appeared staged to draw a stark contrast with Trump, whose comments this week raised further questions about his readiness to be commander in chief.  The brash businessman's performance at an NBC foreign policy forum earlier in the week was widely panned. In particular, Trump's false claim that he had opposed the Iraq War and his comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama drew fierce criticism.Topping off a tumultuous week was Trump's appearance Thursday on the Russian-owned TV station RT America. The campaign later said it did not realize Trump's conversation with Larry King would air on RT, and that they would not have agreed to the interview had they known.On Friday, as Clinton began to walk away from the podium at the press conference, she paused when a reporter shouted a question asking that she respond to Trump's appearance on RT America. For several moments Clinton stood still, shaking her head -- then returned to the podium. ""Every day that goes by -- this just becomes more and more of a reality television show,"" she said. ""It is beyond one's imagination to have a candidate for president praising a Russian autocrat like Vladimir Putin.""She added: ""So can I say I was surprised? I'm not sure anything surprises us anymore.""Meeting with security officialsClinton's campaign, in an effort to paint Trump as a national security risk, has kept close tabs on former defense officials who have endorsed the former secretary of state -- particularly those who worked in Republican administrations. At Friday's meeting, which the campaign dubbed a ""working session,"" Michael Chertoff -- who served as President George W. Bush's final secretary of homeland security, sat at Clinton's side. Richard Fontaine, former foreign policy advisor to Republican Sen. John McCain, and Michael Morell, who worked for both Obama and Bush, were also at the meeting.Clinton has pointed to her four years as secretary of state as one of her major qualifications to be president.Many of the participants at Friday's meeting -- including former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, former CIA Director David Petraeus and former director of the National Counterterrorism Center Matt Olsen -- served with Clinton in the Obama administration.Clinton on Friday said when it comes to foreign policy, partisanship simply doesn't work. ""We won't always see eye to eye, but when it comes to questions of war, peace and the safety of our country, we can't let party affiliation stand between us,"" she said.

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/trump-ground-game/index.html	"The candidate veered off message, jumping from one controversy to the next, his poll numbers plummeted, and the ground game his campaign had long vowed to jumpstart with an injection of cash and resources languished. Morale within the campaign was sinking and as Trump himself lost faith in his leadership, he decided it was time for a change. Three weeks after the campaign shakeup that put GOP pollster and strategist Kellyanne Conway and Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon in charge, Trump's campaign is churning ahead with new vigor, fueled by the candidate's newfound ability to mostly stick to the script and what a half-dozen campaign staffers in key battleground states described to CNN as Conway's commitment to improving the campaign's political operations. Two new national polls out this week put the race at a dead heat, as well as in several battleground states, and campaign and RNC staffers say the campaign's ground game has markedly improved in the last three weeks.Conway and Bannon make up Trump's third campaign leadership team, taking the job following the dramatic departures of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. In an interview, she made clear that overhauling the campaign's ground game has been a top priority of hers, one she sees as crucial to clinching victory on November 8. ""Mr. Trump is an unconventional candidate, but I have an appreciation for... conventional tactics,"" she said. ""We've got to invest in the fundamentals."" There are still plenty of challenges facing the campaign. His appearance at this week's ""Commander in Chief"" forum was marked by controversial statements on everything from Russia, the Iraq war to military sexual assault. And with just two months to Election Day, veteran political operatives question whether the Trump campaign can build out its infrastructure fast enough to recover lost ground as it faces off against a well-oiled Democratic machine that boasts hundreds more staffers and millions more dollars.To add to that, Trump appeared on a television station Thursday funded by the Kremlin, telling Larry King on RT America that he doesn't think Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""probably"" not meddling in US elections. In her three-week tenure, Conway, a self-proclaimed ""huge fan of retail politics,"" has rushed to sign leases on new field offices and approve spending on everything from campaign RVs to yard signs. Last week she finalized the budget for two ground game projects, a door knocking program to increase voter contact in the battleground states and a direct mail effort to encourage absentee ballot voting. She also hired a national field director and deputy campaign manager, two experienced political hands, to build out campaign operations. The campaign also began airing its first TV ads in battleground states. And in the last two weeks, the campaign opened 30 new field offices in 21 states, more than half of which opened in the battleground states of Ohio, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, the campaign's chief operating officer Jeff DeWitt said in an email Conway shared with CNN. ""Do I wish these things had been done before? Sure,"" Conway said. ""But we're trying to accelerate it, and not abandon it."" While Conway took pains to avoid directly criticizing her predecessor, operatives in several crucial swing states bluntly assessed the state of the campaign's field operations under the leadership of Paul Manafort, who helmed the campaign until his official resignation days after Conway and Bannon took the helm.  ""It was completely stalled,"" said one Trump staffer in a key battleground state. ""This is why Paul and Rick (Gates, Manafort's deputy,) were so bad for this campaign, because they left it in shambles,"" said another. ""It was infantile in some regards."" Manafort did not respond to a request for comment.  Top Trump campaign advisers promised the ground operations would rapidly expand as soon as the GOP convention wrapped up. But that rapid expansion never materialized until Conway took over, according to political operatives in swing states.Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign continued to build out its operation and as of Aug. 29 it had more than double the number of field offices as Trump's campaign in Ohio and outnumbered Trump campaign offices in Florida and Pennsylvania 34 to 1 and 36 to 2, respectively. But beyond boosting the number of field offices and directing much-needed resources to state directors, Conway said she is working to make the campaign a more nimble operation after months during which staff complained of a hazy hierarchy, a lack of direction and slow decision-making. ""One of the specific changes we tried to make is just being a more responsive, agile, creative campaign that recognizes that there is literally just a matter of days and weeks left,"" Conway said. Decisions have come faster and resources allocated more quickly, several Trump campaign staffers said. Conway is also reworking Trump's campaign schedule, which in recent weeks has included visits to blue states such as Washington and Connecticut -- which Trump has virtually no chance of winning -- to hold rallies that coincided with fundraising events nearby. ""At this stage of the campaign, political has to drive the finance, not the other way around,"" Conway said, adding that the campaign is less likely to hold rallies in states that are ""overly friendly"" or ""overly hostile."" Conway and Bannon's arrival also heralded the beginning of a more on-message candidate, and the Republican nominee has read prepared remarks from a teleprompter at every single rally since the pair took over as campaign manager and campaign CEO. ""This old call of 'Let Trump be Trump,' actually has merit,"" Conway explained. ""But my goal was let Trump be more of the Trump that those of us who know him see in private."" Conway downplayed her role in Trump's evolution -- ""I don't think that's me. That's him..."" -- but the consensus inside the Trump campaign is clear. ""He listens to her,"" one Trump campaign staffer said. ""She has his ear."" ""She's kept him on message,"" said another.The staffers spoke on background to avoid offending the candidate and senior leadership. Still, Trump has continued to call for a broad campaign aimed at capturing votes in all 50 states, proclaiming Wednesday night during a speech in New York that he is making a play for his deep blue home state. Conway and other members of Trump's top staff have had to gently push back against Trump's eagerness to compete in states where Republicans aren't competitive. ""We're not running a 50-state strategy,"" one senior Trump campaign adviser said. Trump will still remain largely reliant on the Republican National Committee's infrastructure for much of its ground game, which means he will have the most resources in battleground states, regardless. Amid the numerous leadership changes at the top of the Trump campaign  -- first former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski's firing, then Paul Manafort's exit -- RNC officials have struggled to merge seamlessly with the Trump campaign, and the staff shakeup has led to fits and starts in building out ground forces. Several RNC officials said the shakeups in Trump's top ranks were frustrating, but said they were optimistic to see the campaign more dedicated than ever before to ground game efforts.  Sean Spicer, the RNC's communications director and chief strategist, insisted Wednesday on CNN's ""New Day"" that the Trump campaign and the RNC are working ""hand in glove"" and fielding ""the most comprehensive ground game that any political operation has ever put out."" And he didn't dismiss the importance of a solid field operation. ""I think in a good close election -- which this is going to be -- a good ground game is worth 3 to 5 points,"" Spicer said. In states like Ohio, the Trump campaign's expansion and integration with local and national Republican party staff began later than expected and the groups are still ironing out kinks in their collaboration, Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges said. Still, a true ground game is on the way, Borges said. ""You will certainly see what looks like a traditional ground game operation in Ohio (going forward),"" the state's GOP chairman said. ""The question is, did too much time pass before that was really put into place? I'd like to think no.""  "	Trump campaign tackles ground game in earnest	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""I think Gary just didn't realize the context was Syria or geography or anything like that,"" Weld said. Weld added that if the question to Johnson had been, ""'What do you think about the terrible atrocities of the refugee problem in Aleppo', that would put it in context.""Asked what effect the gaffe might have on the campaign, Weld said, ""We'll have to wait and see whether people think that not picking up on the name of a town in Syria is a mortal sin."" He added, ""I don't think it does a great deal.""But Weld acknowledged that the episode comes at a difficult time for a long-shot campaign fighting to register the 15% support in national polls needed to get onto the presidential debate stage later this month. ""It comes as we're in the final stretches of the decision-making about who's going to be in the debates, and that's what's really front and center on our minds,"" he said.Johnson made headlines Thursday when, appearing on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" he blanked in response to co-host Mike Barnicle's question about what he would do to address the refugee crisis engulfing the Syrian city. ""What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?"" Barnicle had asked. ""And what is Aleppo?"" Johnson replied. In a follow up interview just after the show with Bloomberg News' Mark Halperin, a frequent guest analyst on ""Morning Joe,"" Johnson had said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" with himself but admitted he'd been caught flat-footed.""Not remembering or identifying that that's Aleppo -- guilty,"" he said. ""I understand the significance. Genuinely -- believe me, no one is taking this more seriously than me. I feel horrible.""Johnson later issued an unconventional press statement that sought to explain, in great detail, his error and to brace his supporters for mistakes to come:""This morning, I began my day by setting aside any doubt that I'm human. Yes, I understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict -- I talk about them every day. But hit with 'What about Aleppo?', I immediately was thinking about an acronym, not the Syrian conflict. I blanked. It happens, and it will happen again during the course of this campaign."""	Weld on Aleppo gaffe: 'Quite a moment on television'	['Cuomo']	[]
4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/russia-television-donald-trump-interview/index.html	"Speaking to Larry King on RT America, which is an arm of government-funded news outlet Russia Today, Trump said it would ""not be appropriate"" if Russian forces were looking to influence the race, which is suspected by some investigators and has been fanned by Hillary Clinton's campaign as recently as Thursday morning. He also suggested that the allegation was politically motivated.""I think it's probably unlikely. Maybe the Democrats are putting that out -- who knows,"" Trump told King. ""If they are doing something, I hope that somebody's going to be able to find out so they can end it. Because that would not be appropriate at all.""Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, told CNN the interview was recorded as a podcast and was a favor to King, adding, ""Mr. Trump was never told it would be shared anywhere else."" Miller later said Trump wouldn't have agreed to do the interview had he known it would be aired on RT.The interview was striking given that Trump spent Thursday on the defensive over some of his laudatory comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Clinton attacked Trump for praising Putin on Wednesday evening at the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" as a stronger leader than President Barack Obama, and her campaign has for weeks pointed out the alleged ties between Trump's associates and Russian interests.Yet the Republican nominee's operation on Thursday indicated no discomfort with the mounting criticism, with Trump running mate Mike Pence echoing the distinction made between Putin and Obama. And the appearance on Russian television suggested no hesitation from Trump to dive into the controversy.Putin has called the hack of Democratic officials' email accounts a ""public service"" but has denied Russian involvement. Asked by King if he agreed with Putin's assessment, Trump declined to pass judgment.""I don't know who hacked. You tell me: Who hacked?"" Trump said, claiming he had not heard Putin's statement. ""I have absolutely no opinion on that.""Trump also weighed in on domestic politics, declining to criticize Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson for a gaffe he made earlier on Thursday and saying unequivocally that Johnson should not be in the general election debate later this month. Johnson would need to earn 15% support in polls to make the stage, an effort seemingly hampered when he failed to identify the war-torn city of Aleppo, Syria, in a live television interview.""He's not too much of a factor,"" Trump said. ""I'd rather it be Hillary and myself, because we're the only two with a chance of winning.""Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended Trump's appearance to CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" on Friday, saying that Trump wasn't criticizing the US to say the Iraq War was a failure. ""If you think that Donald Trump is the only person in this country that thinks we've had a feckless, anemic foreign policy in the last eight years, then that's just not true,"" Conway said.She also clarified Trump's comments on Putin the day before, in which Trump called Putin a stronger leader than Obama in his country.""In the full clip he said, 'That's not the system I agree with, but he's a strong leader there,'"" Conway said. ""I mean, nobody wants to play the full clip.""Friday afternoon, as she was walking away from a podium at a press conference, Clinton paused when a reporter shouted a question asking that she respond to Trump's appearance on RT America.For several moments Clinton stood still, shaking her head -- then returned to the podium.""Every day that goes by -- this just becomes more and more of a reality television show,"" she said. ""It is beyond one's imagination to have a candidate for president praising a Russian autocrat like Vladimir Putin.""She added: ""So can I say I was surprised? I'm not sure anything surprises us anymore.""King's show, PoliticKing, is produced by Ora TV, which was founded by King and Mexican media magnate Carlos Slim in 2012. In June 2015, Ora announced it was dropping plans to work on a television project with Trump following his controversial remarks about undocumented Mexican immigrants."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-briefing-clinton-obama/index.html	" At an NBC commander in chief forum with the presidential candidates, Trump said that the intelligence briefers had indicated through ""body language"" that they were ""not happy"" because ""our leaders did not follow what they were recommending."" In fact, he said, President Barack Obama and his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, had done ""exactly the opposite"" of what the intelligence community recommended. The remarks left intelligence professionals scratching their heads and Republicans scrambling to interpret their candidate's remarks -- because if they're true, they mark a radical departure from decades of standard practice. Since the intelligence community began briefing presidential candidates in the 1950s, a central pillar of their approach has been to focus on explaining global situations, not offering advice about them, according to David Priess, a former intelligence briefer for President George W. Bush.  ""Wildly unlikely, let me tell you,"" Priess said of Trump's description of his briefings. ""Intel briefers do not make policy recommendations. Period."" A national security expert familiar with the process said Trump's briefers would not have expressed displeasure in any way. That expert asked to speak anonymously because of political sensitivities.   Intelligence analysts and briefers present assessments of global situations to try to reduce uncertainties for an administration making policy decisions, Priess and other former briefers said. They do not recommend a course of action. Doling out policy advice, Priess said, is ""the third rail of intelligence -- you don't touch it."" The senior-level intelligence teams that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper set up to handle the candidates' briefings are career military and intelligence officers, not political appointees, and wouldn't make such a ""rookie mistake,"" he said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comment. In contrast, the picture Trump painted seemed quite different. In a commander in chief forum on NBC, Trump said he received briefings from experts on Iraq, Iran and Russia, and that one thing had ""shocked"" him. ""It just seems to me that what they said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry -- who is another total disaster -- did exactly the opposite,"" he said, mentioning the current secretary of state. He went on to say that he learned ""that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts ... said to do."" ""I could tell,"" Trump added. ""I'm pretty good with the body language. I could tell they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending."" Trump advisor Mike Flynn, who attended the briefings with the candidate, supported Trump's comments in an interview with NBC. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said he also saw briefers convey displeasure with White House policy. ""I sure did ... in a very specific way,"" said Flynn, who added that intelligence officers made distinctions between their briefing points and White House policy, according to NBC.RELATED: Trump, Clinton angle for national security advantageSome Republicans asked about the comments made by their party's presidential nominee took issue -- if cautiously -- with his characterization. ""Typically, I will say, with intelligence briefings they really attempt not to give you a direction,"" Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told CNN's Jake Tapper. Corker complained that Tapper's question put him in a ""personality referee position, which is not a position that I should be in or want to be in."" He then echoed Priess' point that intelligence briefers ""try to keep it to the facts of the intelligence gathering they've put together."" Priess said it's possible, given that Trump has no prior experience with intelligence briefings, that the officers describing global hotspots said ""something that he interpreted as a policy recommendation."" The national security expert said it's also possible that the analysis presented by the briefers didn't align with the President's narrative. The source offered as an example Obama's 2014 reference to ISIS as a ""JV team,"" when many in the intelligence community regarded it as a strong and growing threat. The other interpretation, Priess said, was that Trump is ""seeking to politicize intel briefings he's received in a way that no other candidate has ever done."" Trump's claims about his briefings weren't his first apparent inconsistency on intelligence matters. At Wednesday night's forum, Trump said he had ""great respect for the people"" who delivered his intel briefings. A day earlier, on FOX News' ""Fox and Friends,"" Trump had been asked if he trusted intelligence. ""Not so much from the people that have been doing it for our country,"" Trump said. Referring to the previous decade as ""catastrophic,"" Trump said, ""I won't use them, because they've made such bad decisions."" Trump also took aim at the top tier of US military leaders Wednesday night, saying they'd been ""reduced to rubble"" by Obama. Asked about his plan to have generals submit a proposal to defeat ISIS when he's declared he knows more about the terror group than they do, Trump said, ""Well, they'll probably be different generals, to be honest with you. I mean, I'm looking at the generals."" A President Trump could do that, according to retired Col. Cedric Leighton, a former intelligence officer in the Air Force. But he'd face some hurdles as president that wouldn't exist for a CEO firing employees, he added. There are historical precedents for presidents handing their generals pink slips, but Trump wouldn't be able to simply slot in replacements on his own: Generals have to be approved by the Senate. In an institution like the military where leaders pick their replacements, Leighton said that a new face could be ""hard to sell to the rank and file -- you have to consider morale and the ability of an organization like the Army or Air Force or Navy or Marine Corps to fall in line behind somebody who may not have the credentials they want."" Leighton added, ""It could be potentially disruptive to the services."""	Donald Trump's intel claims 'wildly unlikely' former briefer says	['Corker', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

""I decided to quit my job, I had this breakup and I moved across the country -- very stereotypical,"" Jayne told CNN. It was during this period of her life that the former art director decided to find a new outlet for her frustrations.""I like to deal with everything, any negative emotions with humor and sarcasm. Maybe because it's difficult to face those negative emotions head on, but I think it's also easier to talk to people about them and share it with them if you do it in a kind of humorous way,"" Jayne said. ""I just thought of little things that happened in my life or little moments in my life that are frustrating to me or frustrating to my friends,"" Jayne said. ""So I wrote that, did a little doodle with it, posted it up. Didn't expect anything.

Student loan debt is one of the issues reflected in Jayne's posts alongside its prominent role in the 2016 presidential campaign. Jayne herself went to vocational school because it was cheaper and she saw many of her friends struggle in entry-level jobs or go to graduate school in order to put off their student loan burdens.""They say a lot of millennials still live with their parents, but there's a reason for that.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/donald-trump-2016-election/index.html	"As the campaign hits the home stretch, the task of trying to nail down Trump and some of his increasingly muddy policy proposals is taking on added urgency -- and growing difficulty. He has proven himself to be a more artful candidate than many observers believed, especially as his poll numbers corkscrewed in mid-summer, with the ability to jarringly alter the substance and tone of his rhetoric to accommodate more moderate audiences. Polls now show a tight race nationally, even as Trump lags in some key swing states. While politicians of all stripes have been ""playing to the crowds"" for centuries, Trump's willingness to manicure his message undercuts his promise to eschew ""political correctness"" and speak his mind, come what may.Here's what the Two Trumps look like:The WallAfter a meeting with Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto last week, Trump delivered a well-mannered statement, calling the Mexican people ""spectacular"" while describing his invitation as ""a great, great honor."" On the issue of the wall he's vowed to build on the US-Mexico border, Trump said:""We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs and weapons. Cooperation toward achieving the shared objective, and it will be shared, of safety for all citizens is paramount to both the United States and Mexico.""But later that same day, away from the international press and back in the cauldron with his raucous supporters in Phoenix, Trump struck a more strident tone: ""We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. ... On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall.""DeportationHow Trump discusses his plan for the forced removal of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants -- and whether he intends to launch a ""deportation force"" at all -- also seems to vary depending on the audience.In his Phoenix speech, the nominee made it clear that no undocumented immigrants were safe:""Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.""But in televised interviews both in the days before and after, Trump has hinted at a ""softening.""During a Fox News event hosted by Sean Hannity on August 24, he offered this more tempered message:""Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out. But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject -- and I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me -- and they've said, 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,' I have it all the time. It's a very, very hard thing.""African-American voters Trump has struggled to crack the mid-single digits with African-American voters, polls show. But his renewed pitch to the community can sound very different depending on the audience.This is Trump speaking, in theory, to African-American voters last month in a room mostly full of white supporters in Dimondale, Michigan:  ""What do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? I say it again, What do you have to lose? You're living in poverty; your schools are no good; you have no jobs; 58% of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?""A few weeks later, at a largely African-American church in Detroit -- with people of color on stage and in the pews -- Trump sounded a much different appeal: ""We talk past each other and not to each other. And those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what's going on. I'm here today to learn, so that we can together remedy injustice in any form, and so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.""The mediaIt's no secret that Trump has a love-hate relationship with the press. But even if his language can be wild, his timing is often cleverly calibrated -- as we saw this past holiday weekend:On Saturday, a shot at CNN:""@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.""A day later, it was The New York Times' turn:""Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source""But on Labor Day, he offered this assessment of the journalists picked to moderate the fall presidential debates: ""I like them. I respect the moderators. I do respect them. It's interesting.""CNN's Brian Stelter also reported Wednesday that Trump was ending his controversial ""blacklisting"" of some media organizations. Letting Trump be TrumpSometimes saying things with little or no regard for how those words might strike the broader population can be politically counterproductive, Trump observed about a week after hiring Breitbart executive Steve Bannon and elevating pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager.Here's how he explained his new attempts at self-discipline to The New York Times on August 23:""I have been staying on message more now because, ultimately, I'm finding that I do better with voters, do better in the polls, when I'm on message.""But just a few days earlier, speaking to an audience of supporters -- as opposed to reporters on a phone call -- he seemed to denounce that kind of tactical thinking:""But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth. I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice."""	Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Trump	['Trump']	[]

""Vladimir Putin is violating the sovereignty of neighboring countries. It certainly appears that he is conducting state-sponsored cyber-attacks on what appears to be our political system. That is not acting in our interest. And that is an adversarial stance and he is acting like an adversary,"" he said.What last night's forum taught us about Trump and ClintonBut when CNN pressed the speaker if he had concerns about Trump's high regard for Putin, Ryan dodged.""I made my points about Putin clear right there. I'll just leave it at that,"" he said.Trump's remarks about Putin were among a series of controversial statements the real estate businessman made at a national security forum hosted Wednesday by NBC News. He noted Putin's high approval rating was at 82% and told moderator Matt Lauer he was a better leader than President Barack Obama. ""I mean, the man has very strong control over a country. And that's a very different system and I don't happen to like the system. But certainly in that system he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader,"" he said.Trump defends tweet on military sexual assaultRyan has had a sometimes-rocky relationship with Trump. He initially held back an endorsement when he became the nominee in May and has criticized the businessman periodically when he's voiced views that the speaker believes are detrimental to the party.But when asked again about the latest things Trump has said about military leaders and the other issues if he is reconsidering his support now, the speaker bristled. ""You think I'm going to stand up here and be election pundit? I've got other things to do in this job,"" Ryan said.RNC chief critique: Clinton didn't smile during national security forumTrump is the GOP nominee ""because he won our nomination fair and square,"" Ryan said, repeating his past remarks on Trump. ""I'm not going to sit up here and do the tit-for-tat on what Donald said last night or the night before and Hillary vs. Donald.""Ryan also seemed to give some cover to Trump when he was asked if the presidential candidate should present a detailed proposal to battle the terror group ISIS.  ""We have a plan to defeat ISIS,"" referring to a proposal that is part of Ryan's ""Better Way"" policy agenda. He added about his own 67 point plan, ""look at what we are offering in conjunction with our nominee."""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court/index.html	"The comments were an elaboration of Ginsburg's belief that the Supreme Court should have nine members.Last May, she told an audience in New York: ""Eight, as you know, is not a good number for a multi-member court.""The 83-year-old justice called Scalia's sudden passing the most ""momentous occurrence"" of last term, which included cases on abortion, affirmative action and immigration. ""His absence will be felt for many terms ahead,"" she said.Wednesday's event was a wide-ranging conversation before students at Georgetown Law, where she dispensed advice, spoke about her trail-blazing cases as an advocate concerning gender discrimination, and addressed court cases she felt should be reversed.  Ginsburg was greeted by a standing ovation from the students, many who refer to her by her nickname the ""Notorious RBG.""As she walked the students through the cases she argued as a young lawyer to bring down arbitrary gender lines, she recalled her own battles with discrimination. When she sought a job and ""employers were totally up front in saying, 'We don't want any lady lawyers in the shop.' "" Her efforts in those days were to battle ""variants of the same theme"" that the man is the dominant partner and that the woman's domain is ""home and children.""""We wanted to break down the stereotypical view of the world,"" she said.The justice said that it was ""beyond wonderful"" to be part of a successful movement as a young lawyer when the law caught up with the experiences of many people.Ginsburg -- who is about to begin her 23rd term on the court -- allowed that the most challenging part of being a justice (a job she called the hardest job she ever had) is the ""sheer stamina"" it takes.She has shown no signs of slowing down, however, and next month she will take the bench for a term that will include cases on the death penalty, redistricting, disability rights and racial discrimination in housing among other issues. The justices might also agree to hear a case concerning transgender rights. Also still pending is a long-shot request from the Obama administration to re-hear a case concerning the President's controversial immigration actions. Last term, the court deadlocked 4-4 in the case and in doing so affirmed a lower court opinion that blocked the programs.The court has been unusually busy in late August and September, dealing with emergency petitions concerning voting rights issues in key election states such as North Carolina and Ohio. Because the court is closely divided on many voting rights issues, the possibility of 4-4 splits means that some lower court opinions remain the last word on the subject.In her talk, Ginsburg did not delve deeply into last term's cases, but if a Democratic president succeeds in nominating the next Supreme Court justice, the court will take a turn to the left. Recent cases she thinks should have come out the other way include the 2010 campaign finance case, Citizens United, as well as Shelby County, a 2012 case that struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.She also went out of her way to mention a dissent written by Justice Stephen Breyer she called impressive on why ""the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.""Even with only eight justices, by and large last term was a good one for liberals on the bench. The court struck down a Texas abortion law that critics said was one of the most strict nationwide, and it upheld the race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas. Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote was key in those cases.Ginsburg was not asked and she did not offer any comments concerning Republican Donald Trump's presidential candidacy.She caused a firestorm at the beginning of the summer for comments she made to media outlets concerning the businessman. She told Joan Biskupic, CNN's legal analyst and Supreme Court biographer, for instance, ""he is a faker."" ""He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns?"" she said. Ginsburg later issued a written statement saying she regretted the remarks she had made to the press.""On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised and I regret making them,"" Ginsburg said in the statement. ""Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect.""
