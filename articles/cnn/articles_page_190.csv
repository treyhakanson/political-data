It's a new phenomenon,"" Johnson told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" when Tapper asked if the United States is safer now than it was then.""So the answer to your question is really a mixed one,"" Johnson said. ""We're better now at detecting the 9/11-style attacks, but it's more challenging with this new environment that we're in.""Johnson said he could see the towers collapse from his Manhattan office window on 9/11, when he was an attorney in private practice. He said the biggest difference in terms of security threats since then is that terror groups can now ""literally into our homeland through the internet with social media to recruit and inspire people here."" ""We're safer when it comes to the 9/11 style attacks. Our government has become pretty good at detecting overseas plots against the homeland. Our intelligence community, our law enforcement community, are pretty good at connecting those types of dots,"" Johnson said. ""But we've got this new threat, which makes it harder."""	Homeland Security secretary: 'Lone wolf' threat different than 9/11
1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/11/politics/hillary-clinton-health/index.html	"The incident seems certain to prompt further scrutiny of Clinton's health and her campaign's transparency -- though Republican rival Donald Trump was uncharacteristically silent throughout a solemn day marking the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.Clinton, 68, was diagnosed on Friday with pneumonia, and ""was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule,"" Dr. Lisa Bardack said in a statement. ""While at this morning's event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely,"" said Bardack, chairman of internal medicine at the Mount Kisco Medical Group. Bardack attended to Clinton at her Chappaqua home Sunday.Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said Clinton ""continues to feel better"" Monday morning.The Clinton campaign declined to answer questions Sunday about why her diagnosis wasn't disclosed Friday. Many people even inside the Clinton campaign did not know about the pneumonia diagnosis Friday. An aide said that Clinton ""thought she could push through this ... she was feeling better"" -- until Sunday morning.The episode quickly impacted Clinton's campaign. Late Sunday night a campaign spokesman said a Clinton trip to California was being scrubbed, including several high-dollar fundraisers and television appearances by the candidate. Clinton donors who had planned to attend the San Francisco fundraiser Monday were told by the campaign that the event would go on as scheduled and that attendees could expect to hear from the candidate ""via teleconference.""Instead Clinton now plans to stay home and prepare for the upcoming debates, while her advisers to discuss how to move beyond arguably the worst weekend of the campaign. Two people close to the campaign said Monday that Clinton will almost certainly have to release more medical records -- or do an interview on her health, specifically. She is likely to resume campaigning Wednesday, but will almost certainly not fly to Nevada, as originally planned. She is more likely to give her economic-themed speech in a battleground state far closer to New York: Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Ohio are possibles.Clinton's health came into sharp focus Sunday as she appeared wobbly and stumbled as Secret Service agents helped her into a van to exit a memorial service marking the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks. The Democratic nominee traveled to her daughter's nearby apartment and the campaign initially said she felt ""overheated.""A video of Clinton's departure from the 9/11 event at Ground Zero in Manhattan, posted by Twitter user Zdenek Gazda, shows her clearly stumbling, with Secret Service agents helping her into the van in the motorcade.Clinton appeared to faint as she was leaving the Ground Zero ceremony, two law enforcement officials -- including one who witnessed the incident -- told CNN.Leaving her daughter's apartment a little before noon, Clinton told reporters she was ""feeling great.""""It's a beautiful day in New York,"" she added, while smiling and waving to supporters on the street before getting into her motorcade.On Sunday night campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said a planned California campaign trip Monday and Tuesday has been scrubbed.Other incidentsClinton suffered a two-minute coughing fit during an event in Cleveland last week, which she blamed on allergies -- and wryly put on the shoulders of GOP nominee Donald Trump.""Every time I think about Trump I get allergic,"" she joked in front of the crowd.Trump and his top surrogates have claimed that she faces a health crisis, citing selectively edited videos of public events to advance claims she's suffered seizures.There is no credible evidence to support any of these claims. Clinton's physician -- the only person to speak on the record who has actually examined her -- has repeatedly affirmed the former secretary of state's health and fitness for the highest office in the land.In an interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" in August, former New York City mayor and Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani first accused the mainstream media of hiding evidence, then encouraged doubters to ""go online and put down 'Hillary Clinton illness.' ""During an appearance last month on the Jimmy Kimmel show, Clinton called the GOP claims about her health a ""wacky strategy.""""I don't know why they are saying this,"" she said. ""I think on the one hand, it is part of the wacky strategy, just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you.""Trump camp mutedTrump responded to the incident for the first time on Monday morning, but his initial comments were relatively muted for the Republican nominee who has repeatedly brought up Clinton's health and stamina on the campaign trail.""I really just don't know. I hope she gets well soon,"" Trump told Fox News in an interview when asked about the incident, adding later, ""Something is going on but I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail, and we'll be seeing her at the debate."" Trump also said he would be releasing to the public results from a doctor's physical he received last week. Throughout Sunday Trump and surrogates were quiet about Clinton's health. Sources involved in Trump's campaign said they want to be respectful about the health of his Democratic rival.One said the campaign's message was to wish Clinton well and hope she gets the necessary medical care.Another source said surrogates have been instructed to be respectful and not to post on social media about Clinton's health incident.Separately someone familiar with the situation said staff was instructed to keep quiet and not post anything negative on social media about the issue -- with termination a potential consequence for doing so. Trump himself has not tweeted about Clinton's health Sunday, and this afternoon while he visited a firehouse he refused to comment on her health. ""I don't know anything about it, don't know anything about it,"" he told reporters.Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, refused to acknowledge reporters' questions Sunday about Clinton and her health at an awards ceremony that he presided over in Indianapolis. Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein issued a statement Monday wishing Clinton the best. ""In this extraordinary campaign cycle, where the stakes are so high and the media can be merciless, it can be easy to forget that presidential candidates are human beings too,"" Stein said.Health historyThe most recent major health problem Clinton has suffered was a scare in 2012 following a concussion that resulted from a fainting spell -- but she is in good health now, according to a statement from her doctor that Clinton's campaign released in July 2015.""Mrs. Clinton is a healthy 67-year old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidiam and seasonal pollen allergies,"" wrote Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton's doctor since 2001, in a health statement provided by Clinton's campaign.The health statement says the blood clot, also known as a thrombosis, that Clinton suffered between her brain and skull following a fainting spell and concussion in late 2012 is completely resolved.""She had follow-up testing in 2013, which revealed complete resolution of the effects of the concussion as well as total dissolution of the thrombosis. Mrs. Clinton also tested negative for all clotting disorders,"" Bardack writes.But as a precaution, Clinton remains on daily blood thinners, something her husband previously revealed. Clinton takes Coumadin, the brand name for the blood thinner warfarin. She also takes Armour Thyroid for her hypothyroidism, antihistamines and Vitamin B12.Clinton has no known drug allergies, does not smoke, use tobacco products or illicit drugs and drinks occasionally, according to Bardack, who also details her exercise regime: yoga, swimming, walking and weight training.Clinton is up to date on health tests, including a colonoscopy and a few other tests not often seen in a presidential candidate's health disclosure: gynecologic exam, mammogram and breast ultrasound.She received her most recent physical exam on March 21, 2015, according to the the statement. Her blood pressure was 100/65. Her heart rate was 72 and her EKG was normal. Her total cholesterol was 195, with an LDL (""bad cholesterol"") of 118, and anHDL (""good cholesterol"") of 64 and triglycerides of 69.""She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as President of the United States,"" Bardack's letter concludes.This story has been updated."

Yet it is not the Trump campaign or a Trump super PAC that is spending over $650,000 to boost the Republican nominee -- it is Adams himself, who his buying his own billboards in a set of swing states.It is an unusual purchase and a throwback to a previous era when the wealthy had close to unfettered control over how their dollars were spent. Adams disclosed the spending this week in independent expenditure reports almost always filed by political action committees or nonprofits, rather than individuals: $150,000 in North Carolina, $200,000 in Pennsylvania and $300,000 in Michigan.That is not a trivial amount of money, given the long struggles of Trump high-dollar efforts. If donated to a PAC -- staffed by professional operatives and fundraisers -- Adams would instantly become one of Trump's top donors.But Adams is hanging a shingle.""Mr. Adams is a long-time supporter of, and contributor to, the Republican Party,"" said an Adams aide, Rich Zecchino. ""He has contributed these advertisements to the presidential campaign in furtherance of that historical support.""The digital billboards produced by his company, Adams Outdoor Advertising, are not flashy, with simple white text reading ""For the people"" overlayed on a navy background accompanied with an American flag. The bottom reads ""Trump Pence 2016"" in bold.And it is not the first time that Adams has gone outside the normal campaign finance system to support his chosen candidate. A Republican donor for decades, Adams financed similar billboard campaigns in 2000 and 2004, federal election records show, spending $1 million each cycle in order, when asked on federal forms for the purpose of his independent expenditure, ""to win election."" The closest comparison in this cycle? Jeb Bush top donor Miguel Fernandez -- who despite giving millions to Bush's super PAC -- chose to buy $40,000 of his own ads in swing-state newspapers to bash Trump."

Members of the political world for the most part offered similar sentiments online during this day of pause and reflection. "	Politicians remember September 11 anniversary
4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/11/politics/hillary-clinton-september-11/index.html	"""We saw this curtain of black smoke that was stretched across the island,"" Clinton recalled. ""Occasionally it would be broken by a firefighter coming out. I remember one image so indelibly, dragging his ax, and it was as close to depiction of hell that I've ever personally seen.""Those were the things Clinton saw as she approached Ground Zero on September 12, 2001 -- the day after the country's worst terrorist attacks brought down New York City's World Trade Center and left thousands dead.In an exclusive interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, Clinton -- at the time New York's junior senator -- described the ""sickening experience"" of 9/11 and how she coped with the national tragedy by getting right to work.When news broke of the first plane ripping through the north tower of the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, Clinton had just left her house in Washington, D.C., and was on her way to the Senate. By the time she reached Capitol Hill, evacuations were already underway.""So I gathered up my senior staff, we were just looking at each other with such total pain and confusion,"" Clinton said.Soon after, they learned about a second plane hitting the south tower. ""I got to a TV as quickly as possible to begin monitoring it. It was just sickening experience, Chris.""The next day, Clinton and her fellow New York senator, Chuck Schumer, got on one of the few planes that were allowed to fly that day and landed at LaGuardia Airport. After being taken to the city by helicopter, she and others began to walk toward where the twin towers had collapsed.After seeing the devastation, Clinton said, she felt a heavy burden of the task ahead.""There weren't that many survivors; the ones that did survive were grievously injured. The loss of life was overwhelming,"" she told Cuomo. ""But it was also my job and the job of other officials to get our city and state and country what we needed.""In the days to come, Clinton, along with Schumer and others, would personally lobby President George W. Bush for funds to help the city rebuild. There were problems that lingered for New York residents well-past the immediate carnage of September 11, including health problems caused by the debris and toxic air that filled downtown, and victims who survived the attacks but were left with long-term injuries.""I would meet these shattered lives of people where they were broken, but I saw so many of them strengthen and show such resilience.  So I felt privileged,"" Clinton said. ""It gave me an insight into the human spirit -- and I like to think the spirit of New York and America -- that I wish every American could understand.""On Sunday, Clinton will visit the Ground Zero memorial to pay her respects and observe the annual moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. ET -- the moment the first plane hit the north tower.Trump and foreign policyThe CNN interview took place in New York City on Friday, shortly before Clinton told donors that half of Trump's supporters fall into ""the basket of deplorables"" -- a group of people who are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic. The comments have caused an uproar and her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, has slammed her for the remarks.She later said she regretted saying ""half"" of his supporters were ""deplorables.""Clinton's sit-down with Cuomo comes just two months out from Election Day. Increasingly, the Democratic nominee and Trump have wrestled over the issue of national security and terrorism.Addressing the news that North Korea conducted another nuclear test this week, Clinton cautioned that China has underestimated the regime.""Up until relatively recently, I think they were under the impression that they could control their neighbor and they didn't want to crack down because they saw it as a useful card to play,"" she said. ""If he gets a little crazy, maybe the South Koreans will move toward them a little bit, he gets a little crazier, maybe they can make some deals with the Japanese about things they want. It was a strategic calculation.""The former secretary of state said she believes the threats facing the country are not limited to ISIS but rather are part of a larger struggle against ""a violent ideology -- a form of violent jihadism.""Trump's rhetoric, Clinton said, has only fueled the motivations driving ISIS.""What unfortunately Donald Trump has done is made our job harder, and given a lot of aid and comfort to ISIS operatives and even ISIS officials who want to make this some sort of clash of civilization -- a religious war,"" Clinton said. ""It's not, and it can't become that.""Clinton also warned that the message from Trump that has resonated with many Americans is entirely superficial.""It's phony strength to not know what you're talking about and to make outrageous statements that will actually make our job harder, no matter how in the moment it sounds,"" she said. ""Real strength is leveling with the American people and making it clear we will defeat ISIS."""	Hillary Clinton on 9/11: The closest thing to 'hell' I've ever seen

President Barack Obama's approval rating is at 58%, the Washington Post/ABC News poll poll finds, his highest since July 2009.That's one of several differences between the Post/ABC poll and the CNN/ORC survey, which pegged Obama's approval rating at 51%. The Post/ABC poll also showed a significantly less Republican America, finding a 34% Democrat to 24% Republican split in how voters identify themselves, compared to CNN's 32% Democrat to 28% Republican split.In the new poll, Trump's supporters show signs of being slightly more engaged: 46% say they're very enthusiastic about their candidate, compared to 33% of Clinton's supporters; 93% of pro-Trump registered voters say they're certain to vote, while 80% of Clinton's supporters say they're certain to vote. Trump leads Clinton 50% to 36% among white likely voters, narrower than Mitt Romney's 20-point margin over Obama in 2012. Clinton leads Trump among nonwhite voters, 75% to 13%.The poll surveyed 1,002 adults reached by cellular and landline phones between September 5-8. Overall results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points; the error margin is four points among the sample of 842 registered voters, and 4.5 points among the sample of 642 likely voters.Meanwhile, Clinton and Trump are deadlocked in four battleground states, new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls of likely voters show.Among them are New Hampshire and Nevada, two states that Democrats have won in most recent presidential elections. In New Hampshire, Clinton is narrowly ahead, 39% to 37%, with Johnson at 15% and Stein at 3%. In a head-to-head race excluding Johnson and Stein, Clinton leads 42% to Trump's 41%.In Nevada, with likely voters, Trump holds a 42% to 41% lead, with Johnson at 8% and Stein at 3%. Head-to-head, Clinton has a 45% to 44% advantage.Clinton, meanwhile, has succeeded in putting Trump on defense in two states that have historically been reliable wins for Republicans. In Arizona, Trump leads Clinton, 40% to 38%, with Johnson at 12% and Stein at 3%. In a head-to-head race, Trump leads Clinton, 42% to 41%.Among likely voters in Georgia, Trump has 44% support to Clinton's 42%, with Johnson receiving 10% support and Stein at 1%. Head-to-head, Trump leads, 46% to 43%.The NBC/WSJ/Marist polls were conduced September 4-6.In Arizona, the poll interviewed 649 likely voters for a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points; in Georgia, the poll interviewed 625 likely voters for a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points; in Nevada, the poll interviewed 627 likely voters for a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points; and in New Hampshire, the poll interviewed 737 likely voters for a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

We come together in prayer and in gratitude for the strength that has fortified us across these 15 years. And we renew the love and the faith that binds us together as one American family,"" Obama said.The Pentagon attack killed 184 people, including workers inside the building and passengers from hijacked American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into it.Obama praised the country's diversity during his remarks, calling it a strength and not a weakness.""We know that our diversity, our patchwork heritage, is not a weakness. It is still and always will be one of our greatest strengths,"" Obama said. ""The most enduring memorial to those we lost is ensuring the America that we continue to be. That we stay true to ourselves. That we stay true to what's best in us. That we do not let others divide us.""Obama also taped a special 9/11 message played by the NFL in stadiums before Sunday's 1 p.m. games. A similary message recorded by former President George W.

""The legacy will live on every time some underdog outmatches and outguns, defies the odds and delivers a win for the people.""""America has always been about the underdog and always been about defying the odds,"" he added.Schlafly died Monday at 92. An early supporter of the Religious Right, she was most well-known for her opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and becoming one of the leading female critics of the feminist movement.Trump praised Schlafly for being ""America First,"" a phrase he's used to articulate his international policies on trade, immigration and other global affairs.""And in all her battles, she never strayed from the one guiding principle: she was for America and was always 'America First,'"" he said. ""People have forgotten that nowadays. With Phyllis, it was America First.""Trump -- who famously never apologizes, at least not publicly -- also said Schlafly was someone who ""never apologized.""""She never wavered, never apologized and never backed down in taking on the kingmakers. She never stopped fighting for the fundamental idea that the American people ought to have their needs come before anything or anyone else,"" he said. Trump said Schlafly believed in the power of everyday American to challenge ""the rigged system"" he said. ""The idea that so called little people or the little person that she loved so much could beat the system often times the rigged system, you've been hearing a lot about it,"" he added. ""That the American grassroots is more powerful than all of the world's special interests put together. And that's the way Phyllis felt.""In her latest book -- ""The Conservative Case for Trump"" -- released Tuesday, Schlafly argued that conservative Christians should follow high-profile evangelical leaders such as Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins in supporting Trump's candidacy.""Trump has gone to great lengths to court national leaders in the social-conservative movement and has convinced many of the most prominent ones that he genuinely supports their policy positions,"" she and co-authors Ed Martin and Brett M.

But we can meet these if we embrace the kind of smart, tough, and experienced leadership that Hillary exemplifies,"" Gross wrote. ""This is precisely why I am voting for Hillary. She does not make shallow, knee-jerk decisions. She studies alternatives and finds the right path, drawing upon substantial experience as a lawyer and advocate, in the White House, in the Senate, and in the State Department.""In late 2014, Obama announced that the US and Cuba were normalizing relations, and earlier this year he became the first sitting US president to visit the longtime US foe since 1959.
