They just imported the acrimony of Wednesday night's debate to a new venue.In short, the evening became an apt metaphor for the campaign.Neither candidate seemed at ease or performed particularly well -- after all, they are the most unpopular presidential hopefuls in recorded history.But in the end, Trump seemed to come across as the more unacceptable -- and appeared to misjudge the tone of the evening worse than Clinton.""Donald had some very solid minutes early on and eventually he crossed the line and took it a little too far,"" Al Smith V, whose family hosts the dinner, said in an interview on CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday. ""Hillary, on the other hand, was able to laugh at herself and at the same time not underplay any of the serious things Donald Trump has said or done,""And everyone in attendance seemed to just want it to be over, much as the nation seems desperate to rid itself of the ugliest presidential race in decades.Thursday's dinner was notable because it lacked the genuine respect and even warmth that President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney showed when paying tribute to one another's families at the same event four years ago -- after throwing their jabs.Political humor works best when there is at least some respect between the parties and everyone is in on the joke. It's especially important for the person doing the roasting to also turn the humor on themselves, otherwise the barbs can come across as too harsh.Obama and President George W. Bush proved themselves to be particularly adept at this.But Trump clearly didn't get the memo. Some of his jokes did hit the spot but many just seemed a little too cutting for the venue.""We've learned so much from WikiLeaks. For example, Hillary believes that it is vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private,"" Trump said, drawing boos — which are unheard of at this annual event.Trump said, ""That's OK, I don't know who they're angry at, Hillary, you or I. For example, here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.""Smith V said that joke changed the tone of the room.""That's a tough crowd to drop that line in front of,"" he said. ""To be honest with you, that certainly took the tone in a different direction, and you know, I think ultimately at the end of the day, that made things a lot harder for Hillary when, ultimately, she got the mic -- she had some funny things that she had said, and I don't think they got as many laughs as they could have because the tone in the room had shifted a bit.""Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan offered a different picture the morning after, saying Trump gave some encouraging words to Clinton behind the scenes.""When we were going in, I said could we pray together as we were waiting to be announced and after the prayer, Mr. Trump turned to Sec. Clinton and said, 'You know, you are one tough and talented woman,'"" Dolan told NBC's ""Today"" on Friday. ""Then he said this has been a good experience, this whole campaign, as tough as it's been. And she said, 'Donald, no matter what happens, we need to work together afterwards.'""Trump's appearance was much like his debate performance: He started off well, but seemed to run out of energy and momentum and get more and more hard-edged the longer he went on.He did make several good cracks.He said the former secretary of state had bumped into him backstage and said ""pardon me.""And to be fair to Trump, it wasn't exactly a Republican crowd. The gaggle of rich New Yorkers from business, politics and the media, in ballgowns and white tie and tails could hardly be more different than blue-collar, white working-class crowds that have flocked to his outsider message.But by the time he reached his last jokes, Trump had clearly lost the room.""According to her sworn testimony, Hillary has forgotten more things than most of us will ever, ever know -- that I can tell you,"" Trump said.""We're having some fun here tonight,"" he deadpanned with all the enthusiasm as someone experiencing root canal surgery.Clinton cut less close to the bone than Trump, but her speech also seemed to lack the generosity the evening requires.At least the former secretary of state did not take herself quite as seriously as Trump.The soul-crushing 2016 campaign""This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here,"" she said, referring to Trump's claim she lacks stamina.Poking fun at the top-dollar fees that she racked up for corporate speeches, Clinton said: ""It's a treat for all of you, too, because I charge a lot for speeches like this.""But Clinton is not a natural speechmaker — and her jokes sometimes came across as nakedly political.Her best joke poked fun at Trump's attitude towards women — though given recent accusations against the GOP nominee might not have been in the best of taste.""People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants. A beacon of hope for people around the world.""""Donald sees the Statue of Liberty and sees a 4. Maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,"" Clinton added.Too soon?In the end, the off-color evening will have little impact on the presidential race. It's probably too late after all, and no one is likely to be waiting to decide on their vote based on a tony dinner in Manhattan.But like the election itself, it left a bad taste.""2016 is now ruining everything in its wake,"" former top Mitt Romney aide Kevin Madden said on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon.""We have the Al Smith dinner that is supposed to be about collegiality and supposed to be about charity and they left a chill in the room."""

1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/donald-trump-september-donors-jittery/index.html	"As Trump's presidential fortunes dip lower than ever before, Republican donors are struggling to decide how to react to a candidate who is endangering the GOP's brand and down-ballot prospects with less than three weeks to go. There was no immediate donor backlash on Thursday in the aftermath of Trump's final debate performance, though many of the Trump donors at this point in the race remain diehards who have weathered months of scandal and controversy and are unlikely to abandon him given the latest one.Yet the campaign had been spending as if it still has a committed donor base. The $70 million in spending -- $40 million more than what Trump spent in the month of August -- came as he drastically increased his television campaign and as the race tightened.During that September high point, he boosted his staff to about 170 people, according to payroll records, and spent an enormous amount of his money, over $20 million, on a digital-adveritising firm that does his online fundraising. He also spent about $5 million on a data firm, Cambridge Analytica, which is reportedly owned by Robert Mercer, a Republican megadonor whose family is deeply intertwined within the Trump campaign architecture. He spent $250,000 on that same firm a month prior.Trump's campaign had $34.8 million on hand as of September 30.The soul-crushing 2016 campaignTrump has been kept financially alive by his successful low-dollar program, and Trump's campaign on Thursday announced to supporters that it had raised $9 million online in the aftermath of the presidential debate, its single largest one-day haul online. Yet the debate exposed some lingering concerns among high-dollar donors, who are staring at a decision about whether to continue to fundraise and donate to Trump's campaign or spend their time on other races.""I hate to admit it, but Hillary won it,"" said John Harris, a California agriculture titan who just hours before the debate had been unveiled by Trump aides as a business leader backing him. Harris said he is now ""focusing on close House and Senate races.""One name missing from the election reports on Thursday: Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate who has dedicated $10 million so far to a pro-Trump super PAC, and sources say has contributed up to $25 million to back Trump's path to the White House.But in recent weeks, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking, Adelson has grown frustrated with his candidate's performance on the campaign trail. People who have spoken with him say he has bemoaned Trump's lack of focus and what he sees as squandered opportunities, instead choosing to launch intra-party attacks on Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan.""Sheldon's got to protect the House and the Senate, and Trump's going after that isn't helpful,"" said one person who has spoken with Adelson recently. ""He's really upset with the way Trump's been running his campaign.""Zing! Why debate one-liner winners are worth all the flopsAn Adelson spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. But Adelson and his wife, Miriam, sat with Trump, his family and other top Trump allies at a private lunch prior to Thursday's Republican debate. Foster Friess, another top GOP donor who was at the meet-up, said he and the Adelsons ""enjoyed our lunch with Donald and his family."" But when asked if he and Adelson voiced any frustration with Trump on the candidate, Friess said he would ""need to reserve what communication that took place private.""Another Adelson associate noted that he, along with other high-powered donors, are more animated these days by the battle for control of the Senate. Adelson so far has dedicated at least $40 million to super PACs focused solely on the fight for Congress, and even the $10 million he dedicated to a pro-Trump super PAC is only advertising in states with competitive Senate races so as to boost the entire Republican ticket simultaneously.National Republicans must make similar decisions with less than three weeks to go. In late September, Trump's joint fundraising committee finally disbursed the millions of dollars in cash slated for state GOPs that are part of the committee, according to reports Thursday. But rather than transferring that money to fellow state parties in battleground states, as had been expected, the state GOPs immediately handed over the money to the Republican National Committee. That suggests national Republicans feel they need the cash — at least in the short-term — to be held in the RNC's bank account, rather than in state parties'. For all of Trump's troubles, though, Republicans note that he inspired a host of new donors — and not just those who give $25 a month. New FEC reports this week revealed several major donors to Trump who have little track record in the insular world of GOP fundraising.One top donor who has given nearly $1 million to Trump's White House efforts said they were attracted to Trump precisely because of his hostility toward fundraising. The donor recalled trying to find a place to give their money as early as March, but was told by various super PACs that they were shunned by Trump's campaign.""It was quite tough to give Trump money -- and I was actually pleased with that,"" the donor said, describing the ordeal as evidence that Trump was a ""stand-up guy."" The donor has never given so much to presidential efforts before, but Trump serves as an inspiration: ""I don't know whether it's my age or my mouth, but I decided to put my money where my mouth is.""Peter Zieve, a Seattle aerospace engineer, said he similarly was pushed off the sidelines by pure happenstance. The $1 million from Zieve, who has given little to political campaigns in the past, was only revealed this week.""I remember thinking I wouldn't give them money,"" said Zieve, recalling a meeting with operatives from the super PAC Rebuilding America Now at the Republican National Convention. ""And I realized that I have never ever been as excited about a candidate as I've been about Donald Trump."""	Trump spent massive amounts in September just before donors grew jittery

""On Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done. He refused to say he would respect the results of this election,"" Clinton said at a campaign rally in Cleveland. ""Now, make no mistake, by doing that he is threatening our democracy.""For dramatic emphasis, Clinton added: ""We know in our country, the difference between leadership and dictatorship.""Trump has baffled even fellow Republicans with his continued insistence that the election is ""rigged"" -- rhetoric that calls into question a cornerstone of American democracy. But rather than rescind those remarks on the debate stage in Las Vegas Wednesday night, Trump only doubled down. ""I will look at it at the time,"" Trump said when asked whether he will concede if he loses on November 8. ""I will keep you in suspense."" The Republican nominee continued that rhetoric on Friday, saying at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania: ""Wait until you see the results on November 8. People are going to say, 'Wow, that's really surprising.' Because the whole deal is rigged.""Clinton enters the final 18 days of the presidential election with her path to victory widening. The Democratic nominee is leading in national polls and key battleground states, and her campaign is now focused on turning traditionally red states like Arizona blue in November. Her campaign event in Cleveland on Friday marks the beginning of a ramped up campaign schedule. Clinton will be on the trail through the weekend, campaigning in Pennsylvania with her running mate, Tim Kaine, on Saturday, before heading to North Carolina on Sunday and New Hampshire on Monday. Clinton's top aides are particularly eying an opening in Ohio. The state has been one of Trump's bright spots, but Clinton on Friday expressed confidence that she could take the key battleground state out of her opponent's column.To do that, Clinton explicitly reached out to voters ""reconsidering their support for my opponent.""""I know you may still have questions for me. I respect that, I want to answer them, I want to earn your vote, I am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents,"" Clinton said. ""I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in you education, in our future together.""And in a clear reference to Trump's repeated jab that she lacks the physical energy to be president, Clinton joked that the three debates of the general election had proven otherwise. ""Well, that was the third and last time that I will ever have to debate Donald Trump,"" Clinton said. ""I have now spent for and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be president."""	Clinton: We know 'the difference between leadership and dictatorship'

David Copperthite agreed with the government that Martin poses a serious ""risk of flight"" and said he felt compelled to enter the detention order given Martin's history, conduct and the ""nature of the offense charged.""Martin -- a 51-year-old former contractor to the National Security Agency with consulting firm Booz Allen -- was charged in August with stealing government property and unauthorized removal of classified materials after searches of his home and car revealed thousands of hard-copy and digital files containing classified information.""It is clear that the defendant has been engaged in this conduct for 18 or 20 years,"" Copperthite said.Entering the courtroom in handcuffs, glasses and a gray-striped jumpsuit, Martin took a seat at the counsel's table and sat silently throughout the hearing -- wiping his eyes at one point as his attorney spoke about his love of America.Characterizing the alleged theft of classified information as ""extremely dishonorable crimes putting our service members at risk,"" Assistant US Attorney Zachary A. Myers called Martin a ""high-value recruitment target"" for foreign nations seeking to do grievous harm to the US.""An ankle monitor won't prevent from him from going down the road and ending up in territory where we can't recover him,"" Myers said.Referring to their client as ""Hal,"" Martin's defense attorneys argued that their client did not pose a threat or flight risk. Instead, public defender James Wyda depicted Martin as an ""eclectic"" man suffering from ""compulsive hoarding"" and struggling to pay his mortgage and student loans.""He isn't Edward Snowden,"" Wyda said. ""He believes in service to his country and believes in hard work.""Describing a disheveled shed where Martin kept additional classified material as covered with ""dust everywhere,"" Wyda added: ""This is not how a Russian spy would ever conduct business.""The defense team further stressed that the government has ""no evidence"" that Martin shared the classified information he stole with anyone and ""there is nothing to indicate that Hal Martin is a traitor.""On Thursday, Booz Allen announced it had hired former FBI director Robert Mueller to conduct an outside review of the firm's security and management processes. ""We are committed to doing our part to detect potential insider threats, which are complex and constantly evolving,""  Booz Allen, which is cooperating with the federal probe, said in a statement. ""If there are areas where Booz Allen can improve, we will address them.""While the government suggested in its court filings that it intends to seek additional charges against Martin, Copperthite noted that prosecutors have yet to charge him with dissemination of any classified material.Prosecutors had no comment on the case after the hearing, but Wyda told reporters that the defense team plans to promptly appeal Copperthite's detention order.Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property.Martin's wife, Deb Shaw, sat in the courtroom accompanied by Martin's brother, pastor and other friends.""I'm OK. I love you,"" Martin mouthed to his wife as his left the courtroom.Asked outside the courtroom for a response, Shaw would only say, ""I love him. That's it."""	Federal judge orders ex-NSA

He added: ""I will keep you in suspense.""It was that comment which made Wickett sit up, noting that it smacked of ""insecurity rather than someone being secure in their position.""""Trump has been far more forthright in speeches he has given but in the past few days you've had his VP, campaign manager, and whole party saying they will accept the result because it's a legitimate election.""Authority abroad 'more difficult'One man who knows about fall outs from elections is Dr. Alex Vines, director for Regional Studies and International Security at Chatham House.Vines has extensive experience in monitoring elections, particularly in African countries, and said Trump's stance on refusing to concede could backfire politically for the US.""A key plank of US policy is democracy, values and governance -- both Republicans and Democrats are consistent on that,"" he said.""So it makes the authority of asking for credible elections abroad more difficult if you're suggesting your own systems are imperfect.""Vines says many nations in Africa have witnessed a high number of protests against election results amid claims of ""rigging"".GabonThe most recent high-profile cases came in September, when Gabonese President Ali Bongo was installed for a second seven-year term after a disputed election which led to deadly violence and uncertainty in the Central African nation.Bongo's main challenger, opposition leader Jean Ping, labeled the court's decision ""biased"" for ""pointedly ignoring the urgent calls for transparency launched by the national and international community.""Ping formally filed an appeal with the court in early September which alleged election fraud. He lost the presidential bid by a mere 6,000 votes -- less than two percentage points -- before the court recount gave the president a larger margin.The protests that followed the initial announcement of results turned deadly. Bongo's re-election extends his family's half-century rule over the oil-rich nation of 1.8 million.Vines said such protests are commonplace in Africa but believes the introduction of technology could prevent further problems.Kenya and ZambiaVines cited the 2008 Kenyan election as one example where monitors turned to modern methods in dealing with potential rigging of elections, while also pointing to the controversy surrounding the 2016 election in Zambia.""I think technology is the way to make electoral fraud more difficult,"" he said.""Certainly some civil society and election monitors use cell phones to take photos.""That makes it difficult to create complete fraud. We're now at a point where technology can improve things - -but as always with these things, you're relying on human beings.""Venezuela and UkraineAfrica is certainly not alone when it comes to allegations of electoral fraud or ""rigging.""In 2013, an audit was held following Venezuela's presidential election after a complaint was filed by opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski.He claimed there had been thousands of alleged violations during his contest against eventual winner, Nicolas Maduro, the man who has handpicked by former president Hugo Chavez, to replace him before his death in March 2013.Venezuela's opposition filed a lawsuit with the country's Supreme Court, contesting the result but it was rejected.In 2014, there were questions raised over the legality of a referendum held in eastern Ukraine by Pro-Russian activists seeking to declare independence from Kiev.Many of the voters were not on the outdated registration lists but were allowed to vote after showing identification documents.There also seemed to be no system in place to prevent one person from voting at multiple polling stations.A CNN crew saw several people vote twice at one polling station, where the ballot boxes were decorated with new Donetsk independence flags.Resonance elsewhereDr Kevin Yuill, Senior Lecturer in American History at the University of Sunderland, says Trump's stance is ""by no means unprecedented"" on the world stage. Still, he added: ""I think most of the rest of the world sees the United States as a beacon of democracy and will be horrified by Trump's comments.""""Such a contempt for democracy has, of course, been widely -- and rightly -- condemned,"" Yuill told CNN. ""But there is a resonance for such views both in the United States and elsewhere.""Yuill pointed to legal challenges taken against the Brexit referendum result where a number of challenges have been heard in court.He draws parallels with those challenging the outcome of the referendum and those in the US campaigning against the Second Amendment.""Those who are currently launching a court action against Brexit in the UK reject the results of the biggest vote in UK history.""In the United States, those who campaign against the Second Amendment seek to have the Second Amendment annulled on a technicality rather than do the real work of repealing it through the Constitutional process. So Trump's attitude is by no means unprecedented or even, sadly, exceptional."""	Donald Trump: What happens when you refuse to accept an election result?

""I don't know what else would need to be done, said or happen for people to understand that they don't -- the Democratic Party is aligned for Israel only because we have agreements in place to make them have to be.""Tapper responded by telling Schilling he doesn't speak for Jews nor does he support either the Democratic or Republican parties, but guessed that perhaps ""one of the reasons many Jews are Democrats has more to do with Democrats' support for social welfare programs and that sort of thing than it does for Israel.""""That's fair,"" Schilling replied.""And I know a lot of Jews who are very strong supporters of Israel do support the Republican Party, but again, I don't speak for Jews,"" Tapper added.""Right, no, I know you don't.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/early-voting-hillary-clinton-battleground-states/index.html	More than 3.3 million Americans have already voted. And among that group, Democrats have improved their position in North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and even Utah compared to this point in 2012.CNN has partnered with Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates and advocacy groups, academics and think tanks, to receive detailed early vote return information this year. Catalist's voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote in the election.Democratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012, while Republicans have dropped by about 14,500. In Nevada, Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots.Perhaps most surprisingly, Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormon-heavy Utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. At this point in 2012, Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. But so far this year, the GOP advantage is only 3,509.The best news Trump is in Iowa. So far, 38,280 more Democrats than Republicans have voted. It's a narrower advantage than 2012, when Democrats outpaced GOP voters by 53,719 at this point.The numbers are also significantly down in Ohio, where the Republican-led legislature reduced the number of early voting days from 35 to 28. Only 179,162 people have cast ballots this year, a 66% drop from this point in 2012. Democrats have a slight lead in the early balloting, but their lead is smaller than in 2012, and overall Democratic turnout dropped at a higher rate than it did for Republicans.Even though the figures from Iowa and Ohio might bode well for Trump, they might not even decide the election. CNN's latest snapshot of the Electoral College shows Clinton can clinch 270 electoral votes with wins in Colorado and Virginia, without carrying either Iowa or Ohio. She is also favored in Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada and New Hampshire, which combine for 59 electoral votes. There's more likely good news for Clinton in Virginia and Wisconsin, where she's maintained a steady advantage in the polls. Early voting has picked up in both blue-leaning states compared to this time in 2012.In Wisconsin, the number of early voters to date more than tripled, jumping from 46,389 to 142,190. In-person early voting started in late October four years ago. But after a federal court struck down Wisconsin's strict voting laws, early voting began several weeks earlier in the Badger State this year. Virginia saw a smaller increase of 18,079 voters, compared to 2012. The state doesn't allow unrestricted early voting, but residents can still vote early by providing an excuse and receiving an absentee ballot.And in Republican-leaning Georgia, early voting is up by about 25% this year compared to 2012. That was clear Wednesday in Lawrenceville, where about 200 people lined up to vote in the county's only early voting location. Waiting times were two hours, officials said, and dragged longer in the afternoon.For Clinton to upset Trump in the Peach State, she'll need strong turnout from non-white voters. So far, the African-American share of the early vote is slightly lower than it was at this point in 2012. But Hispanic and Asian voters have slightly boosted their share of the early electorate this year.	Early voting numbers promising for Clinton in battleground states

CNN has reached out to the Clinton campaign for comment on Trump's comments and have not yet gotten a response. RELATED: Clinton Foundation president rebuts Trump's 'pay-for-play' accusationsThe accusation is just another example in Trump's attempts to label Clinton as a ""corrupt"" figure as he increasingly looks to frame his candidacy as that of an outsider looking to shake up the system.""Now from WikiLeaks, we just learned she tried to get 12 million (dollars) from the king of Morocco for an appearance,"" Trump said during a rally here Friday.

If (Clinton) was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter.""Abedin adds that it was Clinton's ""idea"" to hold the Clinton Foundation meeting in Morocco and said it would be problematic for Clinton to pull out at the last minute.""It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months.
