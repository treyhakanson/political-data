""The most infuriating thing about the craziness on the other side,"" she added, ""is it's keeping us from talking about important stuff.""Trump was rocked Wednesday night with a spate of allegations by women who said the Republican presidential nominee had touched them inappropriately. RELATED: Trump faces more groping allegations Trump has denied all the allegations. His lawyer has asked for a retraction from The New York Times for their reporting.""It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all,"" said Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, in response to The New York Times.The allegations came days after The Washington Post unearthed a video from 2005 in which Trump can be heard talking about kissing and groping women without their consent.Hillary Clinton's campaign called the reports ""disturbing"" and said they ""suggest that (Trump) lied"" during Sunday night's debate, when he insisted that the comments on the 2005 video never turned into action.Holton, meanwhile, isn't going there. On Thursday, she said voters ""occasionally"" ask her about the more sordid aspects of the campaign. ""I've just declined,"" Holton said of her response to those voters.

Last week, they announced the National Use of Force Data Collection pilot study that will ""evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology used to collect the data and the quality of the information collected"" and will include the largest law enforcement agencies including the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Agency and US Marshals, according to a Justice Department press release.""Accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations,"" Lynch said. ""In the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.""   The data collection efforts are also an attempt to close a gap in an existing law passed in 2014 called the Death in Custody Reporting Act. The DCRA made it a requirement for law enforcement agencies to submit data about people who died during an interaction with law enforcement or in their custody. Law enforcement agencies could also be fined by the attorney general for not reporting these incidents. But the law did not require the same reporting for non-lethal uses of force interactions.The DCRA law required reporting of lethal interactions between law enforcement and civilians beginning on fiscal year 2016, which began September 30, and the attorney general has already notified federal law enforcement agencies of their obligation to report. The Justice Department expects the final proposal of the National Use of Force Data Collection program to be issued in early 2017 and soon after will implement the pilot data collection program.The announcement comes after several police shootings have sparked a national discussion about lethal police force and calls for federal scrutiny of local police departments and their practices."

Even on issues where most Republicans agree with Obama -- namely, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal -- GOP congressional leaders have downplayed the potential for action.On many issues, Obama will be faced with a choice between deploying his executive powers -- a tactic he's used frequently -- or leaving some of his unfinished business for his successor.Overseas, Obama confronts knotty diplomatic and military quandaries that he hopes to straighten out for the next commander in chief. But there's little doubt the global flash-points that he's struggled to contain will persist well past next year.""I think the President is approaching the final 100 days the way that approached the previous seven-and-a-half years or so, which is seeking to make the most of every remaining opportunity,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Wednesday. He said he doubted Obama was even aware he was crossing the 100-day mark.Lame-duck dilemmasObama hopes to capitalize on the lame-duck session of Congress to complete at least one major outstanding issue: his stalled nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Republicans, who have resisted bringing Garland up for a vote over the past year, could conclude the moderate appeals court judge is more acceptable than whatever nominee Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump puts forward should they win.Remember Merrick Garland? Supreme Court nominee waitsClinton hasn't said definitively whether she would reappoint Garland or select her own nominee, leaving the confirmation process post-Election Day unclear. Republicans, who have insisted the next president should pick the ninth justice, risk political backlash if they decide to embrace Garland in the lame duck. The same is true for another controversial nomination pending: Obama's pick to be the first US ambassador to Cuba in more than 50 years.And it's true as well for TPP, which both Clinton and Trump have said they'll reject if elected. With Congress avoiding a vote on the plan before Election Day, Obama has remained optimistic for action once lawmakers learn their fates in November.""After the election, I think people can refocus attention on why this is so important,"" Obama said in Asia during a trip in September.White House officials also say movement on criminal justice reform -- long the priority of a ideologically diverse group of unlikely allies -- is likely during the lame duck. Proposals include altering harsh sentencing laws and returning some rights, including voting rights, to convicted felons.""It's a remarkable coalition of groups both on the left and on the right that have really come together to push this for a variety of different reasons,"" said White House counsel Neil Eggleston in an interview last week. ""We continue to think and are working hard to get it done in the lame duck.""How Mitch McConnell won the SCOTUS fight (for now)Eggleston said the spate of commutations for non-violent drug offenders will continue apace as Obama works around Congress to instill fairness into the system. Presidents typically scale up their use of pardon and clemency powers in the final months of their administrations.Obama also faces perhaps his most disappointing unfulfilled promise as he wraps his term: the prison at Guantanamo Bay, whose population has been winnowed to 61 from the hundreds who were detained there at the beginning of Obama's presidency. A White House plan to transfer some prisoners into American prisons was rebuffed by lawmakers, who would need to alter current law to allow transfers onto US soil.At the White House Wednesday, Obama acknowledged at least some of his remaining tasks would likely become jobs for his successor.""We've done a lot of work together, but we know we've got more work to do,"" Obama said during a reception for Hispanic Heritage Month. ""We've known all along that we weren't going to get everything done during one presidency.""Looking for blank slates A daunting range of national security challenges still confront Obama as he enters the final chapter of his presidency. Responding to the latest -- a US intelligence determination that Russia is likely trying to meddle in the presidential contest through hacking -- will add to Obama's punch list in his final stretch in office.The US is mustering a ""proportional response,"" the White House said this week, without specifying specifically what's in store for Moscow. Likely options include financial sanctions or legal action through the Justice Department. But even after Obama makes his move, Russia's provocations aren't likely to cease.Obama still hopes to reach an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end suffering in Syria, where the Russians have sided with Bashar al-Assad to crack down on opposition fighters. He has little time to find a solution before Aleppo, Syria's besieged second city that's under partial rebel control, falls completely to the regime.In Iraq, Obama is preparing for an offensive to liberate Mosul from ISIS by sending 600 more US troops to help train Iraqi forces. It's a mission that's not likely to be complete by the time Obama leaves office on January 20.Russia's role in US election under growing scrutiny And administration officials are still holding out the chance Obama could offer a parting stab at brokering peace between Israel and the Palestinians, either by laying out a framework for talks or supporting a UN Security Council resolution spelling out details of an agreement.Obama is due to travel abroad once more as president, to Peru for a meeting of Asia Pacific leaders. It's likely additional countries are added to his November itinerary to form a farewell tour. Obama could always choose to make a final secret visit to Iraq or Afghanistan as well."

She told the Times Trump at one point lifted up an armrest on a flight and grabbed her breast and tried to put his hand up her skirt.""The guy in the seat across the aisle could see. And I kept thinking, maybe the stewardess is going to come and he'll stop, but she never came,"" Leeds told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview that aired Wednesday.When asked by Cooper how long Trump touched her, she responded, ""I would say it was just about 15 minutes"" and he touched her ""wherever he could find a landing spot.""Trump faces more groping allegationsTrump has denied that Leeds' account of events ever took place and an attorney for the GOP nominee demanded a ""full and immediate retraction and apology"" from the Times. He has threatened to sue the newspaper.Leeds said she decided to tell her story after Trump denied to Cooper during the second presidential debate that he had ever kissed or groped women without consent. She told her story to friends and family for the first time when Trump announced his candidacy for president last year.""I didn't start telling my story until a year-and-a-half ago when it became apparent he was making a serious run for the presidency,"" she said. ""Over the year and the half that I've been telling it, it doesn't change it at all. It still infuriates me when I think about it. But it was a long time ago.""Leeds also said she's seen Trump again since the incident -- once at a gala in New York City in 1981. ""He looks at me and says, 'I remember you, you're the woman from the airplane?' Now he used another word. ... it's obscene and I don't want to go there,"" she recalled.""He was using a derogatory term,"" Cooper asked. She nodded.She said the reaction she has gotten after her account published on Wednesday in the Times has been overwhelming.""I am amazed at the reaction,"" she said. ""I am not responding, I am not looking at emails I don't recognize, I know that there are people that this is a hot button issue for them and they're angry, but I'm not going to wallow in that.""Ivanka Trump returns quietly to campaign trail, faces no questions about allegations against her dadShe also said that she had no connection with Hillary Clinton's campaign, except a time she donated $5 for a campaign button.  ""I really hope by Monday all of this has blown over,"" she said. ""But I also hope that anybody and any woman who has a story to tell, that they get an opportunity to get it off their chest and get an opportunity to express their outrage. That maybe it'll start a dialogue and we'll make some progress on this issue. Because we're all in this together, men and women.""Leeds story was one of two in the Times report published Wednesday night that Trump touched them inappropriately, allegations that were swiftly followed by a similar claim in People magazine.The Times reported that Leeds and Rachel Crooks each had encounters with Trump in which he groped or kissed them without their consent. Crooks alleged her incident occurred in 2005.People Magazine published a report later Wednesday night by one of its writers, Natasha Stoynoff, in which she alleged that she had been physically attacked by Trump at Mar-A-Lago while she was on assignment in December 2005 writing a profile of his first anniversary with his wife, Melania.Trump spokesman Jason Miller responded: ""It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all."""

Yes, absolutely,"" Res told CNN's Alisyn Camerota in an interview on ""New Day."" ""He's a blatant sexist.""""I saw him be aggressive in business, and throw his weight around and use the fact that he had power. And I think sexual assault and sexual harassment are really about the abuse of power -- 'I can do this to you because I am who I am' -- I do think it went to his head. So much else went to his head that it does make sense to me that he would do something like that,"" Res, who is supporting Hillary Clinton for president.Res' comments come amid a deluge stories about Trump, with multiple women alleging various degrees of sexual misconduct. Trump has denied all the allegations. His lawyer has asked for a retraction from The New York Times for their reporting and threatened a lawsuit.""It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all,"" said Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, in response to The New York Times.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Res' comments.Res spent nearly two decades working with Trump, from the late 1970s to the mid-90s, and she described witnessing his personal treatment of women deteriorate as his business success mounted. Conway avoids commenting on Trump's beauty pageant bragging""I worked for him a while ago, and when we started out he was respectful of women,"" Res said, pointing to the moderating influence at the time of Trump's mother and his then-wife, Ivana. ""He respected and listened to us, and I never saw him comport himself in such a way that, you know, you would turn around and say, that was sexist.""""As time went on,"" she said, ""he became more and more forceful. He said women were chasing after him and women were following him. And women wanted to have sex with him and then at a point in time he said that he was spending so much time off having sex with so many women that his business went down. He blamed his brother and his executives for the crash of his business.""Res recounted the story of a meeting she attended with Trump and an architect as an example of how Trump's attitude had regressed. ""We had a meeting with an architect once which was really shocking to me. Out of nowhere, he started talking about the women in Marina Del Rey, and how they're not like the women in Beverly Hills, they have to work harder so their bodies -- he described their bodies as being tighter and stuff like that. The architect and I looked at each other and we didn't know where this came from,"" Res said. ""At the time, I thought, he is having this breakdown because his empire is falling apart and maybe, you know, it's just a temporary thing. But, obviously, it got worse.""But Res hasn't always been so critical of her boss. Camerota asked the former Trump employee to explain why she wrote in her 2013 memoir that Trump was ""the least sexist boss I ever had.""""That's an honest statement,"" Res said. ""He treated me like the men -- he yelled at the men and cursed at me like he did. But he respected me, so that was not sexist.""But Res said that recent developments from the 2016 presidential campaign have caused her to revise her view of him. ""Based on what I know now, and what I saw of his comments in writing and in the press and the things that he said to Howard Stern, I could never say that he wasn't a sexist because he is such a blatant sexist. I would retract that statement,"" she said.And Res also made the point that times have changed since she worked for Trump. She said that much of the behavior that might give her pause today, she dismissed at the time.""Don't forget, I was in construction. That's such a sexist business. A lot of stuff went right past me. I didn't think about it. I spoke to some women that worked there at the time and I was reminded of things that he did and the way he looked at women. He did leer at women, no question about it. He even leered at me once at a black-tie dinner. I wore this low-cut dress and he was you know, staring down at me,"" Res said. ""And you know, I took it in my stride. I didn't say, 'oh, my god, he's doing this.' It was just, well, he never saw me like this. I was always in construction clothes or business clothes. And I just took it in my stride.""Trump threatens to sue New York Times over sexual harassment reportCorey Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager and current CNN contributor, appeared later on New Day and pointed to portions of Res' comments as evidence of Trump's good character.""What Barbara Res just said was she never saw this. She thinks that it's true, but she spent 18 years working for Donald Trump and in her own book she praised Donald Trump and she never saw any of this take place in the workplace,"" he told Camerota. Lewandowski has said he believes Trump, who has denied any misconduct.""I think his record in the business industry shows the respect that he does have for women when he takes people like Barbara Res, women who were never involved in those types of industries and put them in leadership positions,"" he said.Res also explained why she is supporting Clinton for president.""First of all, everyone knows he has no experience. I mean, the idea that he would be president is just ridiculous. I have other developers I worked for who were just smarter than he is -- and I wouldn't vote for them for president either. And I mean, you need to have some experience and some knowledge of government,"" she said.""But the worst thing about Trump and the reason not to vote for him, is his temperament,"" she said. ""He flies off the handle, and he attacks viciously. You know, it's like shooting someone and having a nuclear bomb come back at you."""	Ex-Trump exec on assault allegations: 'I do believe it'

Gingrich was referring to an exchange in hacked emails released by WikiLeaks that show a Clinton spokeswoman making a critical remark about Catholics.The New York Times on Wednesday reported on explosive new allegations in which two women publicly accused Trump of groping them. One of the incidents allegedly took place in the 1980s.Trump has vehemently denied the allegations and is threatening to sue the Times. People magazine has also published a reporter's claim that she was physically attacked by Trump in 2005.Gingrich told CNN he has spoken to Trump about how he should handle the recent allegations made against him, saying Trump should focus on immigration and contrast his positions with Clinton. However, he said he ""does not know yet"" if the GOP nominee has taken his advice.The former House speaker also said Thursday that, if elected, Clinton would appoint ""anti-religious bigots to the Supreme Court.""""The truth is, on the American left, the one bigotry that is acceptable is against Christians,"" Gingrich said on Fox News. ""There's a whole bias here, which also tells you what Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court justices will be like. These are anti-religious bigots who are determined to impose left-wing values using the power of the government.""""If she picks three or four justices, she will permanently move us to the left,"" Gingrich said.Gingrich's remarks come as the latest batch of hacked emails from WikiLeaks show Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri making off-color remarks about Catholic Republicans during a correspondence with Center for American Progress senior fellow John Halpin. In the email, Halpin writes that 21st Century Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch and NewsCorp Chairman Robert Thomson, who are both Catholic, are attracted to the faith because of ""systemic thought and severely backward gender relations.""Palmieri responded: ""I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable, politically conservative religion -- their rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelical.""The Trump campaign has denounced the comments and has called on Clinton to fire those involved in the emails.

This year, Hillary Clinton may well designate her most popular surrogate the starter, the reliever and the pinch-hitter, too.On Thursday, the first lady deployed a profoundly personal rebuke of Donald Trump's sexually aggressive boasts, delivering the most powerful censure to date of the GOP candidate's cavalierly-expressed views toward women.Michelle Obama denounces Trump for 'bragging about sexually assaulting women'It was the second time this year Obama has captured her audience and driven home an emotionally-felt message in a way no other surrogate -- or, for that matter, Clinton herself -- has been able. After carefully honing an apolitical air of authenticity over the past eight years, in part by actively avoiding the harsh spotlight of campaigning, the first lady is disbursing her capital with withering force in the final 26 days before Election Day, aiming to convince the women and minority voters who helped propel the Obamas into the White House to show up one more time.Her voice quaking with fury, the first lady said Thursday that Trump's comments about using his celebrity to grab and grope had affected her powerfully, occupying her thoughts since the tape emerged late last week.""I can't believe I'm saying a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,"" Obama said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire.""I've listened to this, and I feel it so personally,"" she said. ""And I'm sure that many of you do, too -- particularly the women. The shameful comments about our bodies. The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman. That is cruel. It's frightening. And the truth is, it hurts.""The speech came only a day after the first lady marked her girls' education initiative at the White House, insisting the US should serve as a model to other countries for its treatment of young women. Her remarks on the campaign trail were as much a message to men as they were to women, amounting to a reminder that decency still exists, even as public discourse rapidly devolves.""To dismiss this as everyday locker room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere,"" she said. ""The men that you and I know don't treat women this way. They are loving fathers who are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed to this kind of vicious language about women.""Trump's moment of reckoningTaken together with her convention speech earlier this summer, the first lady has now delivered the two most stirring addresses in support of Clinton's campaign -- and against Trump. Her now-famous utterance at the Democratic National Convention -- ""when they go low, we go high"" -- has become the Clinton's de facto slogan, appearing on bumper stickers and becoming the candidate's own response to Donald Trump's smears.Watch Michelle Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention""Once again, she gave a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election, but about who we are as Americans,"" Clinton said later Thursday. ""And we cannot let this pessimism, this dark and divisive and dangerous vision in America take hold in anybody's heart. We have to keep lifting up this campaign.""Mrs. Obama has hit the trail at a more aggressive pace than her husband, who's been constrained by a presidential schedule from making appearances more than once or twice a week. Her stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia provide a veritable map of the areas Clinton's campaign needs to defeat Trump.The first lady has benefited from a longtime insistence that she's not interested in seeking higher office herself, a vow that draws disappointed groans from crowds who would eagerly support another Obama campaign. A detachment from political ambition has distinguished her message from her husband, who is relying on a Democratic successor to carry on his legacy. And it separates her from Hillary Clinton, whose waded into fraught policy battles during her own term as first lady in the 1990s, and began a campaign for the US Senate before she departed the East Wing.With 100 days left, Obama looks to check some boxesMichelle Obama's remarks Thursday were a divergence from the first lady's usual stump script, which is derived from the well-received convention speech she delivered in July. The race back then was a bitter slog, but hadn't yet deteriorated into the mud-fest it's become in the final stretch.A 10-minute address that incorporated both the history-making nature of her husband's presidency and the history-making potential of Clinton's was among the best received speeches of the three-day event. Afterwards, the purple signs bearing her name were the most sought souvenir for delegates wistfully watching the Obama era end.In her spate of appearances so far this month -- all in fiercely contested battleground states -- the First Lady has lambasted Trump for his longstanding prodding of the President about his birth place, his penchant for tweeting vitriol at the smallest perceived slights, or his complaints about his microphone at the first presidential debate.It's a role the first lady hasn't entered lightly. Michelle Obama has spoken openly about her distaste for political vitriol and often recalls asking why her husband wanted to expose himself to the barbs of political life at all. That view was only reinforced during 2008's ugly primary battle with Clinton, to whom she's warmed after watching her service as secretary of state.""She always had to be convinced there was a clear purpose and reason for her to go out on the campaign trail,"" said Kate Andersen Brower, author of ""First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies"" who covered the Obama White House for four years.""To see her today it's clear she was emotional, even in tears at one point. I'm not surprised the Clinton campaign didn't have to nudge her in this direction,"" Brower said. ""I've never seen a first lady be so passionate in a speech like this before.""That ardor, Mrs. Obama said Thursday, has come as a surprise even to her.""I can't stop thinking about this,"" she said. ""It has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted."""	Michelle Obama: The Clinton surrogate that could finish off Trump
