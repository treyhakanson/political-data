A recent analysis by independent watchdog CharityWatch found that the Clinton Foundation actually spent 88% of its budget on charitable programs in 2014.Pence was probably counting only grants the Clinton Foundation has awarded to outside charitable groups. According to the foundation's tax forms, the foundation reported total revenue of almost $149 million, and awarded external grants worth a total of nearly $9 million -- or about 6 cents on the dollar. He was not counting the charitable work conducted by the Clinton Foundation's own programs.Clinton's immigration plans will bankrupt Social Security""Hillary Clinton wants to give Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through citizenship. Won't this bankrupt the program?"" A question to Donald Trump from ""Pete from Nashua"" at a New Hampshire town hall last week. ""Well, let me tell you. You've heard that, and most people didn't even believe it. But that's true."" -- Trump's answer.This is an even bigger one.Under the comprehensive immigration reform bill that was passed by the Senate, and which Clinton supports, undocumented immigrants are given the opportunity over time to become citizens by first paying a fine, a fee and passing a criminal background check and therefore gaining what is known as ""provisional status.""While in this category, these immigrants are barred from collecting any ""retirement, welfare, health, disability public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit."" Having gained provisional status, immigrants can apply to become a permanent legal resident which will open up a number of federal program to them -- but not Social Security and Medicare. In order to be eligible for those programs, individuals will have to show that they have worked for 10 years after becoming a permanent legal resident.During all this time, immigrants will have to pay taxes that go into the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.There also are other ways that undocumented immigrants contribute to Social Security and Medicare.The Social Security Administration's chief actuary estimated there were about 3.1 million undocumented immigrants using fake or expired Social Security cards to obtain jobs in 2010. As a result, payroll taxes were deducted from their paychecks.The actuary estimated that in 2010 undocumented immigrants contributed $12 billion annually -- and about $100 billion over a 10-year period -- to the Social Security trust fund through these taxes. And, unless they get permanent resident status these immigrants cannot get Social Security benefits. A similar phenomenon exists for Medicare. Meanwhile, the actuary said the US-born children of undocumented immigrants will have an even greater positive impact on the Social Security system by becoming workers whose taxes help prop up Social Security as the country's population ages.There is no question that undocumented immigrants would, if they are granted legal status, gain access to federal benefits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. But when it comes to Social Security and Medicare, these immigrants are more makers than takers.We rate Trump's agreement with the idea that they will bankrupt the system as false.Mike Pence lied during the vice presidential debate when he repeatedly denied things he and Trump have actually said ""Well, he never said that."" -- Pence defending Trump at the vice presidential debate.During the debate, Tim Kaine repeatedly challenged Pence to defend things he and Trump have said during the campaign.There is no polite way to say this, but, in response, Pence lied by denying that Trump had uttered the words Kaine was attributing to him. On issues ranging from abortion to nuclear weapons to immigration to admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pence denied that Trump had said things that the businessman had indeed said. News organizations, including CNN, called him out on this.  Kaine exaggerates on the Iranian nuclear deal""She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot,"" Kaine said, describing Clinton's role in the Iranian nuclear deal.It's an exaggeration to say that the deal negotiated between Iran, the United States and European powers ""eliminated"" the Iranian nuclear weapons program.Even the White House, which points to the deal as one of President Barack Obama's signature achievements, says the agreement simply increases the amount of time it would take Iran to build a bomb -- should it decide ignore the deal's provisions -- from two to three months to about a year or more. Also, the restrictions on Iran's nuclear programs lapse in 15 years. Inspectors monitoring the country's nuclear weapons program would stay in the country beyond that so Tehran, presumably, would not be able to develop a nuclear bomb in secret. But it still could develop one.Gary Johnson believes there is an equivalency between the hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians killed by Bashar al-Assad and civilians killed by US forces in other actions in the war on terror During an interview with The New York Times, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson was asked whether there was a moral equivalency between the US and Syria. Johnson sarcastically replied, ""Well no, of course not -- we're so much better than all that. We're so much better when in Afghanistan, we bomb the hospital and 60 people are killed in the hospital.""Now Johnson may sincerely believe this, and so, technically, this may not be considered a deliberate lie. But it is so breathtakingly bizarre it belongs on our list.The Pentagon's report on the bombing of the Doctors without Borders hospital in Kunduz that killed 42 people last year laid out a series of errors by US military personnel that led to the tragedy. Although officials from the relief agency termed the bombing a ""war crime,"" the Pentagon determined that no military personnel would face criminal charges. Still, few would compare that attack -- and even others that have inadvertently killed thousands of civilians in Afghanistan -- with the systematic targeting of civilian populations by the Assad regime. Nearly half a million civilians have been killed since 2011, according to one estimate.One might be tempted to give Johnson a pass since he is a minor candidate who will not be elected president this year. But he is on the ballot and does command some support, albeit it is shrinking, probably because of comments like this one.We have the smallest Navy since 1916, Pence said at the vice presidential debateThis one again? It has been a hardy perennial of Republican attacks on the Obama administration for what many GOP critics say is the gutting of the nation's military. Yet putting forth the idea of an impotent navy by comparing it to the fleet of World War I has been debunked many times.Sure, technically it's true. There are 273 active ships in the US navy today, the lowest number since 1916, when there were 245 ships active. But the ships of today are exponentially so much more powerful as to make the comparison laughable.Take, for example, the Ohio-class ballistic submarine. These underwater behemoths measure nearly two football fields in length. Each sub carries at least 20 Trident II, D-5 ballistic missiles with a range of more than 4,600 miles. The missiles are each tipped with four or five nuclear warheads that can be individually targeted to different locations hundreds of miles away from each other. The destructive force of these warheads range from seven times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima to 30 times more powerful than that device.   An Ohio-class ballistic submarine could single-handedly obliterate London, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Berlin, Moscow and at least 80 more of Europe's largest cities -- with hours of each other, according to Steven Pifer, an arms control expert at the Brookings Institution.That's just one ship. The Navy has 14 of them. Bill Clinton's explanation of the problems with Obamacare doesn't make sense""But the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies."" -- Bill Clinton on why he thinks Obamacare is a ""crazy system."" First of all, companies with 50 employees or less -- that's more than 90% of all small business -- are exempt from the law's requirement that they provide health insurance for their workers. The ""Secretary of Explaining Things"" doesn't quite explain how companies are getting killed by a law they don't have to comply with.If they already have cut-rate health insurance plans that do not meet the minimum standards set down by the Affordable Care Act, small businesses can keep them until the end of next year -- unless they make ""major changes"" to them. This provision has caused headaches for some small business. But if the law is so burdensome, why is it that the rate of small businesses dropping their health insurance plans is about the same as it was before the enactment of Obamacare?As for people who buy insurance, either from the Obamacare exchanges or on their own, but have too high an income to qualify for federal subsidies, they are, indeed, getting hurt. But, using census data, the Commonwealth Fund calculated that group amounts to about 3.2% of all people under the age of 65 who have health insurance. Is 3.2% of the health insurance market enough to label Obamacare a ""crazy system""?   Trump says the US Border Patrol is allowing undocumented immigrants to ""pour"" across the border so they can voteThis just sounds like Trump heard what he wanted to hear.Here is the exchange that took place Friday morning at a roundtable on border security between Trump and Art Del Cueto, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing agents. The subject was why undocumented immigrants had been allowed to cross the border.Del Cueto: ""I spoke to several agents in my sector who are in charge of processing. And the problem that we're seeing reflected through us as a voice is that some of these individuals that we've apprehended with criminal records, they're not, they're checking their records, they see that they have criminal records, but they're setting them aside because at this point they are saying immigration is so tied up with trying to get the people who are on the waiting list to hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected.""Trump: ""Why?"" Del Cueto: ""So they can go ahead and vote before the election."" Trump evidently saw an opening. ""They're letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote,"" he said.Well, not quite. First of all, what Del Cueto seems to be saying is that manpower from the border patrol was being directed from checking criminal records of undocumented immigrants to helping to process the citizenship applications of legal immigrants in time to allow them to vote. Secondly, Trump's claim that immigrants are pouring across the border ""to vote"" is just not true.The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged that there has been a surge of applications -- as there often is in the months leading up to a presidential election -- from immigrants who want to cast their ballots. However, a spokeswoman for Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security, noted that immigrants have to prove they have lived in the US for five years as permanent legal residents before they are allowed to vote. That would make it kind of hard for undocumented immigrants to cross the border in order to cast ballots for -- or against -- Trump.   Kaine overstates the negative things Trump and Pence have said about Mexican immigrants""These guys say all Mexicans are bad,"" Kaine, criticizing Trump and Pence at the vice presidential debate.From the proposal to build the wall on America's southern border to the statement that many illegal immigrants are rapists, Trump has not been kind to Mexicans.When he first announced his campaign for the presidency last year, he did say, ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best ... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."" But he did add this, almost as an afterthought, ""And some, I assume, are good people.""When Trump visited Mexico in August, he said Mexican-Americans are ""just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular hard-working people. I have such great respect for them and their strong values of family, faith and community."" Kaine's statement is just plain wrong since it is way too all-encompassing."	Reality check: The week in whoppers	['Pence', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	['abortion']

I have grown to learn that the words of others cannot effect the value of my self worth or define the content of my character,"" Zucker wrote.Trump was talking with Bush on a bus outside of the soap opera ""Days of Our Lives,"" and the pair noticed Zucker, who was waiting to escort them onto the set.""I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,"" Trump said.The Republican nominee later called the comments ""locker room banter"" in a statement before issuing a video apology.The sad irony of what could propel the first woman into the White HouseZucker offered an implicit rebuke of Trump's response to the tape, saying, ""How we treat one another, whether behind closed doors, locker rooms or face to face, should be done with kindness, dignity and respect.""Trump's comments, particularly his boastful language about sexual assault, has thrown his party and the entire political race into chaos, and ignited a conversation about sexism and violence.Seizing on this theme, Zucker closed her statement: ""Unfortunately, there are too many people in power who abuse their position and disregard these simple principles and are rewarded for it.

Kelly Ayotte saying she was rejecting Trump and would write in Pence for president -- Planned Parenthood quickly jumped on the attack. ""Trading Trump's violent language for Pence's devastating policy proposals is a horrifying substitution. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have been partners in the same agenda -- and that's what we have to reject,"" Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said in a statement.A campaign spokesman for Pence said Saturday he would ""not engage in hypotheticals"" over questions of Pence's record.In Congress, Pence was at the forefront of a conservative effort to block any federal funds from going to Planned Parenthood because the organization -- which provides women with cancer screenings, counseling services and tests -- also provides abortions. In 2011, as he prepared to run for governor of Indiana, Pence told MSNBC that ""of course"" he'd shut the federal government down if congressional Democrats didn't include the defunding of Planned Parenthood in negotiations to approve a spending bill and avert a shutdown. ""I think the American people have begun to learn that the largest abortion provider in the country is also the largest recipient of federal funding under Title X and they want to see that come to an end,"" Pence said then. When he campaigned for governor in 2012, Pence largely avoided talk of any hot-button social issues, including same-sex marriage and abortion. But as governor he has not shied away from those issues, notably stumbling in the polls after he signed a ""religious freedom"" bill last year. That measure allowed businesses to decline services to same-sex couples if they cited religious objections. After days of intense national pressure -- including a push by the state's businesses to repeal the measure -- Pence backtracked and approved a ""fix"" that said the law could not be used as a tool to discriminate.Then, it was his cratering support among Republican women that helped pull Democrat John Gregg to a stunningly close rematch with Pence in the race for governor this year.As he pushed for tougher abortion restrictions this year, Pence said that he was fighting to protect unborn life. He signed legislation this spring making Indiana only the second state in the nation to ban abortions in cases where women seek the abortion after learning the fetus has a disability.""By enacting this legislation, we take an important step in protecting the unborn, while still providing an exception for the life of the mother. I sign this legislation with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families,"" Pence said in a statement. But that bill quickly drew a snarky campaign by women protesters called ""Periods for Pence"" -- including a woman inviting Pence to her appointment with her gynecologist, an update from one woman about her cramps and other personal details about their periods."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/donald-trump-2016-election/index.html	"The move reflects a sense within Trump's family that Priebus is being too negative and the fallout from Trump's tape may not be as bad as it seems. It comes as RNC sources have made clear they're waiting to see how Sunday night's debate goes to determine whether they will continue to work with and for Trump to get him elected. It is entirely possible the RNC may cut ties and focus on down ballot races because there could be a revolt among Republicans demanding the party not spend resources on a losing battle, according to the source. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a CNN political commentator, trashed Priebus on Sunday night before the debate.""Not only is he weak, he is a failed leader,"" Lewandowski told CNN's Erin Burnett.Meanwhile, Trump's alliance with another key supporter -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- appears in question. The sad irony of what could propel the first woman into the White HouseChristie did not accompany Trump's family and other close advisers on his campaign plane to St. Louis the debate with Hillary Clinton. A Trump campaign source told CNN's Jim Acosta Christie had issues to attend to in the state, but very much looks forward to watching the debate on TV this evening.But his absence is notable, since Christie had taken the reins of Trump's debate preparation and was at Trump's town hall Thursday in New Hampshire -- an event that advisers planned to familiarize Trump with a style he hadn't practiced. The splintering of Trump's support comes as the GOP nominee grapples with the fallout of a 2005 video in which he bragged before an ""Access Hollywood"" interview that his star status allows him to be sexually aggressive with women. In a Facebook video posted in the early Saturday morning hours, Trump apologized for the remarks -- but also signaled that he plans to attack Hillary Clinton over her handling of Bill Clinton's infidelities in Sunday's town hall-style debate. Trump throws GOP into chaosTrump's 2005 remarks, and what many saw as an insincere response, led to a revolt Saturday within GOP ranks, as more than two dozen high-profile figures -- including the 2008 Republican nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, and 15 other senators -- said they no longer supported their party's nominee. The Republican National Committee on Saturday put a temporary pause on its direct mail operations to determine whether it needs to change its message and other get-out-the-vote efforts, a top RNC official told CNN Saturday.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/presidential-debate-what-to-watch/index.html	"Republicans -- including vice presidential nominee Mike Pence -- are criticizing Trump for his vulgar comments about advances he has made toward women that came to light Friday. And an ever-growing list of senators and top GOP officials want Trump replaced on the ticket.Trump insists he won't leave the race, and he and allies (those that remain, at least) indicate he'll go on the attack against Clinton.Trump eyes debate to rescue faltering campaignThere's one thing on everyone's mind Sunday night in St. Louis at the town hall debate co-moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper. Here's what to watch: The tape -- what will Trump say? Soon after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape became public on Friday, Trump released a statement that read, in part: ""I apologize if anyone was offended.""That wasn't sufficient. Hours later, Trump released a video message: ""Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,"" Trump said, looking into the camera.He made a brief appearance Saturday on Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower, and a couple of calls to newspapers vowing to stay in the race. But this will be his first live appearance and one that guarantees follow-up questions.Although Trump has apologized, he has not yet addressed serious concerns raised by the hot mic video. Most notably, Trump's suggestion that he made aggressive advances toward women -- including the comment that he would ""grab them by the pussy"" -- has raised grave new questions about whether he touched women without their consent.This is Trump's chance to convince Americans that he is sincere in his apology and that he can be trusted as commander in chief. If he can do that, as well as score points on his core issues of trade and security, he may be able to survive.What will Trump say about Bill Clinton?After the first debate, Trump congratulated himself for refraining from bringing up Bill Clinton's ""indiscretions.""""I'm really happy I was able to hold back on the indiscretions in respect to Bill Clinton. Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. When pressed by Bash on what he would have said, Trump responded: ""Maybe I'll tell you at the next debate."" It now appears that Trump may do exactly that on Sunday.The GOP nominee has already given two indications that he is preparing to target the former president -- and the Clintons' marriage -- on the debate stage.Immediately after the ""Access Hollywood"" video was released, Trump said in a statement: ""Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close.""In the video message hours later, Trump capped his curt apology with this: ""Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary Clinton has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimated his victims.""""We will discuss this more in the coming days,"" Trump added.And he retweeted two tweets from Juanita Broaddrick, the Arkansas nursing home administrator who alleged that Bill Clinton had raped her in 1978. Clinton has denied the allegations, and there was never any legal action against him.The strategy of dredging up Clinton's extramarital affairs, such as those with Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers, enjoys minimal support within the Republican Party, and top GOP leaders are wary of going down this path. Given the timing, it could also be interpreted and dismissed as desperate.What does Hillary Clinton say?Clinton has kept a low profile all weekend, staying in New York for debate prep, and so this will be the first time she responds in person to the Trump tape.In recent weeks, the Democratic nominee had already adopted highlighting Trump's past remarks about women as a major strategy, aimed at hammering home the point that Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president. The Clinton campaign has featured Alicia Machado, for example -- a former Miss Universe whom Trump has made disparaging comments about -- in online ads, and facilitated Machado sharing her story with the media.Clinton may be less keen on addressing her husband's extramarital affairs if Trump decides to go there.Asked last month whether she feels any obligation to object to a spouse's indiscretions being brought up in the campaign, Clinton simply answered: ""No."" Clinton faces questions on her speechesThe Trump bombshell Friday came at roughly the same time the Clinton team was dealing with problems of its own -- WikiLeaks posted thousands of hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, that appear to include excerpts of Clinton's private speeches to Wall Street companies. Those excerpts could validate what some of Clinton's critics have said all along: that the Democratic nominee is out of touch with the middle class.In one 2014 speech, Clinton appears to acknowledge that she is ""kind of far removed"" from the struggles of everyday Americans -- comments that could haunt her in Sunday's debate and on the campaign trail.""My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing,"" she said in the remarks. ""And now, obviously, I'm kind of far removed because the life I've lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy, but I haven't forgotten it.""With all the attention on Trump, the excerpts haven't gotten much attention. But figure Clinton will have to explain her reasoning for those comments Sunday.Trump's first real town hallThroughout the 2016 campaign, Trump has largely stuck to a campaign method that he's most comfortable with: large rallies.Even during the primary season, when presidential candidates typically prioritize retail politics and small gatherings that allow maximum hand-shaking and baby-holding, Trump mostly steered clear of intimate campaign settings.That means that the GOP nominee will head into Sunday night a novice in town halls -- a format that will expose the candidates to questions from audience members and require extra agility and grace. His lack of practice with the format could hand him a significant disadvantage.Even at an event that the Trump campaign billed as a ""town hall"" in New Hampshire Thursday, the format was such that the nominee didn't interact with audience members (the questions were read out loud, instead, by moderator Howie Carr), and answered softball questions for just over 30 minutes.The prime-time event will be co-hosted by Cooper and ABC's Martha Raddatz, but the real wild card is the audience members who will grill Clinton and Trump.Past town hall debates have produced famously awkward moments, including John McCain referring to President Barack Obama as ""that one,"" and George W. Bush prompting the audience to bust into laughter with a raise of the eyebrows and a head nod at ex-Vice President Al Gore.The debate also has the potential to produce some raw interactions between voters and the candidates.At a town hall-style event in Haverford, Pennsylvania, last week, a woman told Clinton that she had lost two sons -- one died from gun violence and another had committed suicide, she said.As a campaign volunteer hugged the woman, Clinton responded: ""Thank you for being so brave."""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/presidential-debate-highlights/index.html	"Trump's campaign was in free fall when he entered the debate hall Sunday night, reeling from the revelation of a 2005 video in which he spoke of women in lewd and sexually aggressive terms. The video sparked a dramatic rebuke of Trump, with dozens of Republicans in Washington and around the country saying the billionaire should step aside and let his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, lead the GOP ticket.The icy tone was set early when decades of tradition eroded as Trump and Clinton declined to shake each other's hand.A scorched earth debate, on The Daily David ChalianTrump fought back in the only way he knew how -- throwing out a battery of vicious counter punches. He vowed to prosecute Clinton if he is elected, and then throw her in jail. With her husband and daughter in the audience, Trump branded Bill Clinton a serial abuser of women hours after appearing alongside several women who allege the former president assaulted them.CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claimsTrump seemingly dismissed the significance of the vulgar language he was caught on tape using toward women a decade ago, apologizing for his conduct but repeatedly saying his remarks were just ""locker room talk"" that did not reflect his real character. Clinton, however, said that incident did provide a true picture of Trump's character. She spoke of her years fighting Republicans on policy but said she never questioned their fitness to serve as president until now.""Donald Trump is different,"" Clinton warned.In the process, it seemed as if American politics changed in the course of one nasty night. The once sacred tradition of a presidential debate -- where candidates typically trade barbs over their vision of the country's future instead of personal humiliations -- exploded into something quite chilling. Trump glowered, interrupted, and prowled the stage at Washington University in St. Louis, calling Clinton a ""devil"" and ""liar"" with ""hate in her heart."" The performance likely electrified his fiercely loyal supporters but may have done little to widen his appeal among more moderate swing state voters.A CNN/ORC poll found 57% of debate watchers thought Clinton won compared to 34% who thought Trump came out on top. The poll only represents the views of people who watched the debate and has a slight Democratic advantage compared to CNN polls of all Americans.Clinton didn't take Trump's bait, staying calm when he declared ""Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacks those same women."" She didn't take the bait, repeating first lady Michelle Obama's philosophy articulated at the Democratic convention: ""When they go low, we go high.""Pacing the stageTrump paced the stage for much of the debate, which was moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC's Martha Raddatz. He frequently interrupted Clinton and had trouble standing still while she spoke, sometimes appearing in her camera shot. He lost his composure at one point after a fierce exchange with Clinton about her emails, accusing the moderators of not addressing the issue even though Raddatz had asked a question about it.Trump looms behind Clinton at the debate""Nice, one on three"" Trump said, claiming that the moderators were biased against him. Hours earlier, Trump made a surprise appearance with women who have in the past accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual advances. The women later attended the debate as members of the audience.During the debate, Trump came across as more serious, prepared and less prone to losing his cool than in the first presidential debate two weeks ago when he was seen as the clear loser. Clinton was less dominant than in the first debate and sometimes less effective in parrying Trump's attacks in an encounter far more frosty and bitter than in their first clash. But no other presidential candidate in history has faced the personal buzzsaw that Trump represented on Sunday night.And Trump did not just aim his fire at the Clintons. He took a swipe at Pence, who declined to go out in public and defend his running mate after the emergence of the video on Friday. Trump slapped down Pence's statement during last week's vice presidential debate, when the Indiana governor said the US should be prepared militarily to target Syrian government assets to help alleviate the siege of the key city of Aleppo.""He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree,"" Trump said.After the debate finished, Pence tweeted he was ""proud to stand"" with Trump and congratulated him on a ""big debate win."" And Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Dana Bash that Pence and Trump spoke after the debate.Syria was one of the few foreign policy items tackled during the debate. While Trump was far more polished in attacking Clinton's liabilities such as her email server and the weakest aspects of her record as secretary of state. But he often struggled when the debate turned to in-depth policy questions.He suggested he would align himself with some of America's most hostile enemies, including Russia and the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to fight ISIS.""I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS,"" Trump said. ""Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy."" Watch all the times Trump called the moderators unfairObama administration officials have repeatedly said Russia and Syria are not focusing on ISIS but are instead targeting the moderate opposition, some of which are backed by the US, and defenseless Syrian civilians.Clinton, meanwhile, branded her rival as outside the American mainstream and unfit to be president.""He never apologizes for anything to anyone,"" Clinton said, hammering Trump for his treatment of the parents of a Muslim solider killed in Iraq, his disparagement of a judge with Mexican heritage, for his mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter and his birtherism crusade against President Barack Obama.Perhaps the most stunning moment of the debate occurred when Trump threatened to use the power of the American government to investigate Clinton over the private email server she used as secretary of state.""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation. There has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it,"" Trump said.Clinton replied: ""it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.""Trump hit back: ""Because you'd be in jail.""The nastiest lines from Sunday's debateThe exchange was remarkable, even in an election campaign that has repeatedly redefined the scope of acceptable political discourse. Eric Holder, President Barack Obama's former attorney general, responded on Twitter: ""So @realDonaldTrump will ORDER his AG to take certain actions. When Nixon tried that his AG courageously resigned. Trump is dangerous/unfit.""Asked by one of the undecided voters in the town hall style debate audience to find something she admired about Trump, Clinton mentioned his family, who she said had inherited their father's drive.""His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald,"" Clinton said of his family, who attended the debate as did her husband, daughter and son-in-law.Trump admitted to some grudging respect for Clinton's resilience.""I will say this about Hillary: She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She's a fighter,"" Trump said.The night ended with a tepid handshake that was missing at the outset before the rivals retreated to the embrace of their families to lick their wounds.

""This is as close to a media-created coup de tête"" as it gets, Gingrich told CNN on Sunday. ""This is almost equivalent of a lynch mob. You have all these people running amok.""Gingrich, who was traveling overseas when the Trump tape first surfaced on Friday, said the media has failed to pay equal attention to the newly unveiled Wikileaks documents appearing to show excerpts of Clinton's private speeches. Gingrich said he has been bombarded with questions about Trump's latest controversy -- but little about the Wikileaks dump.""When I look at all the different notes I've gotten today -- all of it is about Trump,"" he said. ""Not a single one says, 'gee -- you think that some of the things that Hillary Clinton said in secret are really bad and make it hard for her to win?' ""Gingrich also expressed displeasure at Republicans who have called on Trump to leave the presidential race.""The last few days, I've been watching people who are normally adults running around in circles,"" he said.With regards to the second presidential debate Sunday night, Gingrich said there is no one that can help Trump but himself.""He's got to get through tonight basically by himself. He has to reach inside and do what he thinks is necessary and be the best version of Donald Trump that he can be,"" he said."	Gingrich: Media 'lynch mob' over Trump tape	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-women-2016/index.html	"When Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination, it was hailed as a barrier-breaking moment for women. Young and old supporters watched her acceptance speech in Philadelphia with tears streaming down their cheeks, describing themselves as witnesses to history.But the sweeping stagecraft of the #ImWithHer convention now seems like a quaint memory. With the emergence of the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape featuring Donald Trump bantering about unwanted advances and actions that would constitute sexual assault, the 2016 conversation about women moved straight into the gutter.""One of the most disturbing things about this election is just the unbelievable rhetoric coming from the top of the Republican ticket,"" President Barack Obama said Sunday, noting he wouldn't repeat the language because ""there are children in the room.""The 2005 tape has thrown the Republican Party into disarray, shattering the fragile alliance of GOP support around him, as dozens of top lawmakers and officials announced they could not stand behind what they viewed as sexist and misogynistic comments. His taped apology, many of them said, was not enough.Now it's up to Trump to use Sunday's debate in St. Louis, co-moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper, to try to rescue his flailing campaign.We really don't know yet what the true political fallout will be of Friday's bombshell report on the tape, which was published by The Washington Post. But we know that it came on the heels of a horrific two weeks for Trump during which he flubbed his first debate performance, engaged in a Twitter-shaming feud with a former Miss Universe and defended the notion that he may not have paid federal taxes over an 18-year period.What to watch in the second presidential debateIn short, Clinton was on the upswing. She was inching up in critical battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, areas that Trump had once hoped would be his firewall.She was also consistently leading (by double digits) Trump among what may be the most critical demographic in this presidential election: white, suburban, college-educated women.But it's also worth remembering that Clinton remains a deeply flawed candidate. Her dominance among women in polling often masked the deep reluctance I hear from women who were supporting her on the campaign trail.Some of the most fascinating conversations were with the many young Democratic women supporting Bernie Sanders who were offended by the suggestion that Clinton's gender should be a factor in who they voted for. The response I often heard, particularly from millennial women, was: ""Aren't we past that?""Clinton is widely distrusted and disliked. Many women say in interviews they do not feel they can relate to her.But she has been paired with a rival in Trump who has said more offensive things about women than any nominee in recent memory. And that may be Clinton's saving grace this year in a race that for a time looked as though it might be very close.Kaine: Expect voters to ask Trump about vulgar remarksSure, Clinton's election as president might be a historic first, but the force driving many women to the polls will be their disgust with Trump.The ""Access Hollywood"" tape -- where Trump boasted about popping Tic Tacs before kissing random strangers, and groping attractive women by their genitals because you can do anything as a star -- was really a bookend to a campaign that began with his exchange with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, who asked him during the first GOP primary debate to defend his past descriptions of women as ""fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.""Many Trump supporters fiercely defended him, brushing off his critical comments about women as being part of his show biz persona, the kind of behind-the-scenes banter one would expect to hear at a Miss Universe pageant. ""Men at times talk like that,"" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday on ""State of the Union,"" while admitting that what Trump described in the video constituted sexual assault.New revelations emerged Saturday after CNN's Kfile reviewed hours of newly uncovered audio of demeaning conversations Trump held over a 17-year period with radio shock jock Howard Stern. The topics discussed included his daughter Ivanka's physique, having sex with women during their menstrual cycles, threesomes, and checking out of relationships with women after they turn 35.From the beginning, Trump adeptly framed his campaign as a revolt against ""political correctness,"" which meant no apologies for his past comments about his antagonists, like Rosie O'Donnell, or his critiques of the form and figure of women like former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.Trump voters stay loyal: 'I am not voting for him to be pope'As the press explored the long historical record of Trump on tape, the campaign at times felt like a flashback to the ""Mad Men"" era, particularly in the midst of the dramatic demise of Fox News Chief Roger Ailes, a close friend of the real estate magnate who went on to advise his campaign.Trump used words and phrases on the campaign trail that no one had heard before from a politician. Political taboos were to be mocked and broken. The premium was on shock value, and his crowds loved it. Every time pundits predicted Trump's comments would lead to his demise, he proved them wrong. But this time, members of Congress have threaded their statements of condemnation of Trump with mentions of their wives, daughters, sisters and mothers.The 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape has brought us into unchartered territory. It's the place where you wonder whether Trump's reign as ""Teflon Don"" might be over.

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/mercer-family-trump-donors/index.html	"The most prominent donor families behind Trump -- the Mercers, Ricketts and Adelsons -- on Saturday gave no indication they would ditch the GOP nominee, despite the endless string of mass defections by senior Republicans caused by his latest scandal: the emergence of a decade-old video in which Trump callously spoke about a married woman with whom he had tried to have sex. In a remarkable and lengthy statement, the generally reclusive Rebekah and Bob Mercer vociferously defended Trump, who they have dedicated millions to supporting through a super PAC and retain enormous influence.""Donald Trump's uncensored comments, both old and new, have been echoed and dissected in the media repeatedly in an effort to kindle among his supporters a conflagration of outrage commensurate with the media's own faux outrage,"" the two Mercers said in a statement, first reported by the Washington Post. ""Can anyone really be surprised that Mr. Trump could have said to Mr. Bush such things as he has already admitted saying? No. We are completely indifferent to Mr. Trump's locker room braggadocio.""And then they went after Bill Clinton -- and his long history of infidelity and alleged misconduct.""The same media that resolutely looked away when the most powerful man in the world, a sitting U.S. president with multiple violent sexual assaults to his credit, snared an impressionable young intern in his web and ruined her life, now expects us to gasp with revulsion at Mr. Trump's irreverent comments,"" they said. ""Those among the politcal elite who quake before the boom-box of media blather do not appreciate the apocalyptic choice that America faces on November 8.""That view was mirrored -- perhaps not as colorfully -- in an email late Friday night from Foster Friess, an evangelical megadonor, to his list of supporters. Friess did not specifically reference the new videotape, but sent his fans a list of policies where he found more alignment with Trump than Clinton.""The most relevant point is the importance of ceasing the distracting discussion of what she did and what he said and move instead to ask whose policies are in our personal best interest,"" he wrote. ""We can remove the uncivil nastiness of emphasizing candidates' personal behavior which will not affect our lives compared to the policies implemented.""A pair of other prominent GOP donor families, the Adelson and Ricketts families, made no moves Friday or Saturday to distance themselves from Trump, even as many of the politicians they support did exactly that. Adelson is directing at least $25 million to pro-Trump efforts organized by the Ricketts family, a recent infusion of cash that arrived when Trump was at a high point in the polls.Trump's roster of financial supporters was already weak, in part due to his previous comments on everything from immigrants to trade policy. But Trump has made significant progress in recent weeks as the presidential horse race narrowed -- only to risk that all with this weekend's lewd remarks.There has been no massive donor exodus so far, according to Republican fundraising sources, but new dialogue is unfolding. Republican sources say one option now under consideration is ending the joint fundraising agreement between the campaign and the Republican National Committee, part of a strategy to allow the RNC to focus its fundraising exclusively on downballot races. It would also give donors opposed to Trump a way to continue to support the party.But the Ricketts-led and Adelson-funded nonprofit, 45Committee, is not changing its plans or strategies going forward, according to a source familiar with its plans.Both the Adelson and Ricketts families were heartened by the addition of Mike Pence to the ticket, who carried deep relationships with Republican donors and has proven to be an effective fundraiser. But the initial fraying between Pence and Trump on Saturday could send a signal to donors to stay away.That signal is not being sent yet, though: On Saturday evening -- even as he scrapped public campaign events -- Pence arrived in Rhode Island for one event: a high-dollar fundraiser.Also Saturday, at least one Democratic donor said recent events had energized him to give more: Facebook titan Dustin Moskovitz, who said ""the events of the past few weeks"" encouraged him to invest $15 million more this cycle."
