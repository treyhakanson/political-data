The outfit is the symbol of the Facebook group Pantsuit Nation, which has become a safe space for Clinton supporters who face antagonism from family or friends. Plus, the pantsuit is a subtle way to make a statement within the bounds of not wearing candidate paraphernalia to the polls, which is restricted.Latest 2016 election resultsDonald Trump supporters, on the other hand, are bringing out a trademark accessory of their own: the ""Make America Great Again"" hat.The slogan harkens back to an idealized past that resonates with many voters. The hat, like the pantsuit, has become a symbol in and of itself.Floridian Becky MacKenzie said she has a personal reason for supporting Clinton and wearing a pantsuit on Election Day.""This is important to me because I'm living with cancer and repealing Obamacare would limit my options,"" she said.MacKenzie sees the pantsuit as a sign of empowerment and solidarity, and said that the response to her outfit has been positive so far.""It wasn't too long ago that women couldn't wear pants on the Senate floor,"" she said. ""Look at us now!""Kate Albano from Georgia also took note of the symbolism of her outfit. Her pantsuit not only expresses solidarity with the pantsuit movement but also showcases white, a color the suffragettes used in the early 20th century.""I am a woman in a corporate job, and I see so many parallels between what Hillary Clinton is experiencing and what all women experience in their professional lives,"" Albano said. She said the white pantsuit is a small way to express gratitude for Clinton's attempt to crack the ultimate glass ceiling."

I'm going to remember them,"" Huckabee said Tuesday morning during an appearance on Fox News. ""And I hope every other Republican remembers them. Don't ever ask me for your vote again because you're done."" While polls show GOP voters overwhelmingly support Trump, many Republican elites have been reluctant to back the real estate mogul. 2016 exit pollsSome, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, pledged to vote for Trump, even while disavowing some of the GOP nominee's most controversial comments and positions. Sen. Ted Cruz initially declined to endorse Trump, with whom he engaged in a bitter campaign during the Republican primaries. But Cruz ultimately came home, citing his promise to back the party's nominee.Huckabee has stood in stark contrast to that group of Republicans, serving as one of Trump's most faithful surrogates since ending his own White House bid in February. His daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has also served as a senior adviser on the Trump campaign.The former two-term Arkansas governor, who also ran for president in 2008, said Tuesday on Fox that ""some of the even most reluctant Republicans are coming around"" to Trump. He suggested there is a legion of secret Trump voters -- a popular theory among many Republicans -- who avoid public expressions of support for the GOP nominee out of fear of being labeled racist. Huckabee also offered some anecdotal data that was unfavorable to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.""I'm telling you, wherever I go, I don't meet people who are for Hillary,"" he said.

Erwin was a tail gunner in the 781st Bombardment Squadron and flew 25 missions during World War II.Erwin stumbled a bit when he shook the man's hand, so another voter asked election officials if the veteran could go to the front of the line so he wouldn't have to wait so long, his daughter, Janine Erwin Johnson, told CNN.

The Durham County Board of Elections had requested a voting extension of 90 minutes county-wide after technical issues at several precincts earlier in the day forced election officials to switch to paper roll books from the electronic voter check-in system.Earlier Tuesday, Democracy North Carolina, a nonprofit group, sued to extend hours in Durham County, which has a significant African-American population. The state elections board earlier extended voting in one precinct in Columbus County, a small county in the southeastern corner of the state. The county asked for 45 minutes but the state board allowed only 30 minutes extra voting time.""As a result of these events, voting in Durham County was interrupted at multiple sites for at least one hour,"" Democracy North Carolina said in a statement.By state rules, all voting locations in the county have to be affected for an extension of voting hours. The county has brought in 60 additional staff to work on providing more data to the state on how much the voting has been affected, Durham County Board of Elections spokesperson Briana Khan said.At least five precincts in North Carolina had to switch to paper roll books earlier in the day. The move came ""out of an abundance of caution,"" according to Patrick Gannon, spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections.Longer wait timesThe ""glitches"" in the check-in software forced the precincts to switch to paper poll books to check-in voters, but no votes cast will be affected, Gannon said.The error, however, did cause longer-than-expected wait times at the polling locations, according to the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP.""Number one: We demand that they fix this glitch,"" Rev. Dr. William Barber, president of North Carolina NAACP, said in a statement obtained by CNN. ""There were no glitches in early voting. Why now and why in a heavy black voting area?""Thirty-seven percent of registered voters in Durham County are black.According to Khan, the state board of elections is helping the county officials print extra poll books and get them to the affected precincts. The county signed a new contract last year to use a new e-voting system designed by VR Systems. A spokeswoman for VR Systems declined comment about the problems in Durham County.Gov. Pat McCrory, who is running for re-election Tuesday, told CNN that he had spoken to election officials and that they had it under control.""I want the votes counted as quick as they can in all counties in North Carolina,"" McCrory said. ""I just talked to the elections board supervisor and said that I want every vote to count, and every vote will count.""""We have our lawyers going to locations,"" Barber said. ""They also must encourage people not to leave because the problem is with system not the people.""Barber told CNN that the group has lawyers throughout the state and that they are not ruling out legal action on any voter suppression issues. Issue began early TuesdayIn past elections, the county had used paper roll books to check in voters, but switched to electronic check-in in October 2015, according to Khan.The issue began around 6:45 a.m. ET Tuesday and all locations had a paper backup, Khan said. She said that the county board of elections had not heard reports that any wait times were longer than 45 minutes.""We were having sporadic problems just getting all of our computers up at one time. One would go up and the other would drop off line,"" said Glenn Reynolds, a precinct judge, who said problems began as soon as people began voting at his site. He said the system that they use to check voters in and verify their information was not consistently working.At least one precinct in Durham County ran out of authorization to vote forms that all voters must fill out before they vote, the Durham County Board of Elections confirmed. Precinct 31 was out of the forms that all voters must sign to before casting a ballot for about an hour and a half Tuesday morning before more forms were delivered.The N.C. NAACP said the polling location turned away at least 45 people in one hour because of the lack of forms. However, county election officials stressed that while some voters did voluntarily choose to leave because of the wait, no voters were turned away. "	N.C.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/nevada-voting-lawsuit-donald-trump/index.html	"The Trump campaign said Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria kept polling locations open two hours beyond their designated closing times.Clark County saw its record for single-day early vote turnout shattered Friday when 57,174 people cast their ballots, according to data from the Nevada secretary of state's office, as Hillary Clinton and Democrats sought to build up a prohibitive advantage over Trump before Tuesday in the key state. Trump's lawyers asked for an order to have the pertinent early vote ballots -- those cast after the designated polling hours Friday -- not to be ""co-mingled or interspersed"" with other ballots. Judge Gloria Sturman, of the District Court for Clark County Nevada, ruled from the bench, saying Gloria was already obligated by state law to maintain the records that the Trump campaign is seeking.""I can't obligate him to do something he is already obligated to do,"" Sturman said, later adding, ""This is Election Day. He has other things to be doing.""Dan Kulin, a spokesperson for the county, told CNN that no early voting stations extended their closing times. They did, however, process voters who were in line at closing time to allow as many people to vote as possible.  Judge warns Trump campaign about internet trollsTrump's campaign also sought information about the people who were present at the sites in dispute -- a request Sturman angrily shot down, expressing her frustration with Brian Hardy, a lawyer for the campaign. ""Do you watch Twitter?"" she asked. ""There are internet trolls who could get this information and harass people who just want to help their fellow citizens vote.""""Why would I order them to make available to you information about people who work at polls when its not already a public requirement to do so. So that those people can be harassed for doing their civic duty?""She added: ""I'm just puzzled how you think you will use this evidence anyway."" Donald F. McGahn II, Trump's campaign attorney, said that the suit was filed to preserve records and that the county attorney made clear in open court that the records would be preserved. McGahn said that ensuring that records are persevered is standard business.Nevada key to both partiesNevada's six electoral votes may be critical Tuesday night, and the Senate race is key in terms of the balance of power. Nevada's Republican Party chairman, Michael McDonald, told a Trump audience in Reno on Saturday that polling locations were kept open late so that a ""certain group"" could vote.""Last night, in Clark County, they kept a poll open 'til 10 o'clock at night so a certain group could vote,"" McDonald said in introductory remarks at a Trump rally. ""The polls are supposed to close at 7. This was kept open until 10. Yeah, you feel free right now? You think this is a free and easy election? That's why it's important.""At that rally, Trump suggested that the polling location's extended closing time to allow voters to cast their ballots was a sign of a ""rigged system"" pitted against his campaign.""It's being reported that certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring democratic voters in. Folks, it's a rigged system. It's a rigged system and we're going to beat it. We're going to beat it,"" Trump said.""From the polling, it appears that Nevada is so close that the Trump campaign thinks it's worth challenging any violation in voting protocol,"" said Robert Lang of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ""The numbers that came in could represent several thousand people across the four precincts, which could determine who wins the electoral college vote or change the Senate race. Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyist and professor at the University of Texas Law School, questioned what Trump's campaign got as a result of the suit.""The real question is whether the Trump campaign truly wanted an order from the district court, or whether the point was simply to begin to make a record around which the result in Nevada might be challenged after the fact,"" Vladeck said. ""If the former, it failed miserably. If the latter, it seems like a lot of wasted effort if, as the court ruled, state law already required all of this information to be preserved.""Hillary Clinton's campaign praised the judge's ruling.""We're pleased the judge swiftly denied what was a frivolous attempt to disenfranchise voters in Clark County and a desperate response to the record turnout we're seeing in Nevada and across the country. Every voice needs to be heard in this election and both campaigns should be working to ensure that every American will have easy access to the ballot box,"" said Clinton campaign spokesman Glen Caplin."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/trump-election-day-accepting-results/index.html	"Trump has for the past month railed against what he has called the ""rigged system"" — warning of voter fraud, accusing the media of colluding against him, and signaling multiple times that he may not accept the outcome of the election if he loses. His rhetoric has led many to question whether he will concede the election Tuesday night should he not emerge as the victor. Appearing on AM Tampa Bay on 970 WFLA, Trump was asked if he'll contest the results if they are close.""Well if I think there's something that was wrong,"" Trump said. ""Did you notice, when I brought this up a few months ago, Obama, and others said, 'oh, this is the foundation of our country' but eight years ago, he was was basically saying that Chicago is rigged. I don't know if you saw that clip. But he talks up, like, 'oh, this is the foundation how dare he question the foundation' and all of this. Oh, give me a break. What' going on in Philadelphia and Chicago and St. Louis and lots of others, for years it's legendary OK, talked about for years. They have a clip of Obama basically saying that Chicago elections are rigged. And I say to myself, 'can you believe that?'Trump was referring to a 2008 video of then-Senator Barack Obama talking about Republican and Democrats who have tried to ""tilt"" elections in their direction and discussing ways to investigate vote fraud and give voters more access to cast their ballot.Trump added, ""So no, if I think everything's on the up and up, that's a lot different, and we can only see what happens, I hope it's going to be very fair, I think we're going to do very well.""In a different interview Tuesday morning, Trump said he ""wants to see what happens"" before accepting the results. ""I want to see what happens, you know, how it goes as per our previous little chat,"" Trump said on Newsradio 610 WTVN. ""You know, you want to see. You hear so many horrible stories and you see so many things that are wrong. So we'll take a look. Certainly I love this country and I believe in the system, you understand that.""

The state doesn't know how many calls were made, but complaints have come in from throughout the state, Atkins' spokeswoman Molly Woon said Monday.""We're trying to figure out who's behind it and if there's anything illegal going on,"" Woon said.The state Democratic Party blamed Republicans, alleging they were sending calls to nonafilliated and Democratic voters and therefore were trying to suppress their votes.""For the Oregon Republican Party to tell 'active voters' that they're 'inactive voters,' and thus may not qualify to vote, is no small error and could clearly interfere with an active voter's perceived right to vote, and their belief that they can vote. This is clearly voter suppression,"" state Democratic Party chair Frank Dixon said.The state Republican Party said it has issued some of the calls, but that they are intended only to alert previously registered Republicans that their registration may have fallen inactive.State GOP Chairman Bill Currier objected to the way Atkins, a Democrat, and the state Democratic Party has characterized its efforts. Currier accused Atkins herself of trying to suppress Republican votes, saying she's urged voters to ignore the calls.""We are deeply concerned that the secretary is actively discouraging registered Republicans who happen to be of inactive status from obtaining a ballot,"" Currier said in a news release late last week. ""Her job is exactly the opposite -- which is to help these voters in any way possible.""Callers have reported differing language, suggesting that not all the calls are the same, Woon said. The state GOP also said it is not the only one sending messages. ""Scores of other groups are making thousands of calls, though,"" the state GOP said on Twitter.The Republicans said their phone message, in part, said: ""Voter registration records have been reviewed in your county and there is a possibility that you or someone in your household may have had their voter registration marked inactive. If you have not received your ballot yet, this may be the reason. The Oregon Republican Party wants you to be able to vote in next Tuesday's election.""Some other messages, whose origins are unclear, say more emphatically that the recipient's voter registration is inactive, Woon said.""The concern is that there are people we're hearing from that are in fact registered voters,"" and that they are worried that their vote won't count when they turn it in, Woon said.Oregon is one of three vote-by-mail states -- there are no polling places on Election Day. Registered voters receive ballots by mail -- though they can pick up ballots at county election offices if they're away from their address. They have until 8 p.m. local time to drop their ballots at various drop boxes.Oregon election resultsAtkins' message to voters is if they received a ballot by mail, they are properly registered, and they need not worry that their vote won't count, Woon said.The Oregon GOP took its argument to social media. Brian Halvorsen, who says he is exploring a Green Party run for the Oregon legislature, tweeted that it wasn't surprising that the Oregon GOP ""would try to suppress the vote."" And the state's official GOP Twitter account responded: ""Hey Brian, explaining to inactive voters how they may cast a ballot is not suppression. Strange you need that explained."""

What seemed like his constant self-destructive approach helped to support this thought. What helped to break this idea for me, what finally won me over, was watching how hard he's been kicking Hillary, Bill, and the media in the teeth,"" the staunchly conservative artist told CNN in an email Friday.Sabo's art has taken the streets of Los Angeles by storm for years during the 2016 campaign, infuriating and often shocking residents of the largely progressive city. The Louisiana native's art first gained national attention when Sabo depicted Texas politician Wendy Davis as ""abortion Barbie"" and later, for portraying Ted Cruz as a tattooed, cigarette-smoking bad boy, who was ""blacklisted"" by the Washington establishment -- an image that has become iconic during the 2016 election.Sabo was called racist and homophobic by some, including those offended by his decision to use the N-word in his art, but he said he enjoys the diversity in Los Angeles and said that his artistic decisions do not make him a racist.""I'm an artist. I take it upon myself to use every word at my disposal and that doesn't make me a bigot,"" Sabo said. ""And if I do use that word in a very harsh way, I don't use it any differently than Chris Rock did in the mid '80s.""At first glance, the bombastic and far from politically correct artist, might seem like the artist embodiment of Trump. But Sabo said he is far from it because Trump is not a true conservative.August 29Sabo initially dismissed Trump as a ""Democrat,"" whose ""self-destructive"" behavior on the trail is going to guarantee Clinton the White House.He told CNN in August that while a politically incorrect, anti-establishment message is something the Republican Party needed, he would have wanted a true conservative like Cruz to be the messenger.Sabo lamented Cruz's loss in the primary, hailed the Texas senator's refusal to back Trump and vowed to ""write in Cruz"" in Election Day.""I think (Trump) makes sense in a lot of things that he says, but you really, one of the biggest problems I have about Trump is he's a man without a core,"" Sabo said, ""So you really don't have much of an idea as to what he's actually going to do.""September 16Amid backlash over Clinton saying that ""half"" of Trump's supporters fit into the ""basket of deplorables,"" Sabo briefly took a trip on a Trump Train, making campaign swag with the label ""The Deplorables"" to defend Trump supporters. ""This design is doing well and no, I'm not on the Trump Train. I just got a day pass,"" Sabo said.September 24After months of refusing to back the Republican nominee and following his combative speech at the Republican National Convention in July, where he urged conservatives to vote their ""conscience,"" Cruz endorsed Trump in September.When asked about Cruz's decision to back Trump, Sabo was beginning to have a change of heart but he was not ready to back Trump himself. He said that this election is ""a s--- sandwich,"" but conservatives like Cruz and himself ""just have to sprinkle enough sugar on it to choke it down"" because with the prospects of a Clinton presidency, ""too much is at stake.""October 19Following the final presidential debate, Sabo said that he doesn't know whether he will still write in Cruz on Election Day or bite the bullet -- or in his case the ""sandwich"" -- and vote for Trump.""If by some miracle Trump needs my vote I'll take a bit out of that s--- sandwich and vote for him because I see Hillary is too big a threat to our democracy,"" Sabo, who will be voting in California, said. ""If he gets trounced along the way then I'll write in Cruz as a protest vote,"" he said.November 2Trump spent much of October defending himself against claims of sexual assault that surfaced following the release of a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" video, in which Trump is caught on a hot mic bragging about his ability to grope women because of his star power.But he also unleashed on Bill Clinton, slamming the former President's past sexual indiscretions, inviting Clinton accusers to the second presidential debate and accused the Democratic presidential nominee of bullying her husband's accusers.He also relentlessly attacked the Democratic presidential nominee over news that the FBI is looking into new emails related to her use of a personal server during her time as secretary of state.""It no longer mattered that I didn't see him as a true Republican or conservative.

New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler raised the letter on the call, which was scheduled as a periodic update for members on the state of the race, according to the source, and pressed the leadership to give their assessment of the political impact. Few believed that Democrats could win back the majority because of the small number of competitive districts, but some had renewed hope last month when some polls gave Clinton a double-digit lead""The fact is we had a momentum going with Hillary's campaign,"" Pelosi said. She explained to her colleagues that the FBI's announcement helped Republican voters ""come home."" As a result, the chances for Democrats to flip the balance in the House was weakened as Trump narrowed in on Clinton.  ""A couple of points nationwide has an impact on our races,"" she said.Politico first reported on the conference call on Monday.House Democratic sources indicated to CNN that the letter did alter the trajectory in some states, especially where Clinton had built up a lead, that was helping down ballot candidates. One of these senior Democratic aides told CNN that the intense focus after the Comey letter could have put as many as a dozen Republican seats thought to be competitive out of reach for the party.  Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chair of the House Democrats' campaign arm, told those on the call that he didn't have any ""direct data"" about the fallout of the Comey letter, but stressed, as he has all year, ""we are tied to the national environment.""   Lujan also criticized Comey's handling of the investigation, saying the release of the unexpected letter coming just 11 days before the election ""was unacceptable.""South Carolina Democratic Rep Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat, told Democrats on the call that Comey's letter ""had a tremendous adverse impact with our standing with independents.""Pelosi signaled that Democrats are unlikely top pick up as many seats as some were predicting just a couple of weeks ago, saying, ""we would be in a better place (without the letter) and in the manner he did it.""House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a radio interview on Monday that he felt ""very good"" that Republicans would maintain a ""strong majority"" in the House of Representatives after Tuesday's elections.Pelosi reported that she spoke with Clinton on Sunday, saying ""I thanked her for her leadership and courage on behalf of our caucus.

On Sunday, Comey said they'd reviewed the emails and wouldn't change their earlier recommendation reached this summer against criminal charges for Clinton, but Democratic leaders said Tuesday it remains to be seen if the damage was already done.Pelosi told reporters at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters that Democrats' ability to win back the majority of the House depended on Clinton performing well in the final stretch of the campaign, but said ""when her numbers narrowed so did that prospect for the House and for the Senate."" She said because the Senate has fewer races, ""hopefully they can sustain it.""RELATED: Control of Congress up for grabs TuesdayPressed whether Comey was personally responsible for tilting the election away from congressional Democrats, Pelosi again pointed to his letter as the leading reason her party could fall short, saying, ""we'll see,"" but added, ""he certainly made it more of an obstacle, but we hope to overcome it. But it's difficult."" Few Democrats believed that they could pick up the 30 seats they needed to take control of the House, but earlier this fall when Clinton's lead over Donald Trump entered double digits some believed a wave election could put enough candidates in a position to reach that threshold.Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico, the chair of the House Democrats' campaign arm, said the impact of the letter was being felt in ""more than a handful of races across the country"" and pledged to release details Wednesday.The House Minority Leader said the release of Comey's letter came as polls showed a majority of Republicans saying the election was rigged and it was ""like a Molotov cocktail just thrown into a very explosive arena. He shouldn't have done that.""As to whether Comey could remain in his position, Pelosi said she had a ""high regard"" for him serving in ""other capacities.""  She didn't directly say he should step down from the FBI, but said ""it might be just too hot in there,"" saying that ""if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen, and he obviously was feeling a lot of heat from Republicans.""Wearing a white pant suit with a purple necklace and heels, Pelosi told reporters she was donning ""suffragette colors"" to mark the election of a ""the first woman president of the United States, Hillary Clinton.""RELATED: Hillary Clinton's 'Pantsuit Nation' suits up for Election Day"	Nancy Pelosi: Comey's letter 'like a Molotov cocktail' hurting Democratic gains	['Pelosi', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
