Robert Leese told CNN. ""This is why they continue to seek ways to contest our advantage in the air through the development and proliferation of new weapon systems.""""To maintain this advantage, the Air Force must not only develop new systems of our own, but continue to upgrade the capabilities of our legacy systems like the F-15,"" he said.While the current initiative to update the F-15 with new technology dates back to 2002 with the development of its advanced radar system, the Air Force says the process has been a gradual one, with work on the modern radio and infrared targeting programs beginning just this year.""The process to upgrade these planes is currently being evaluated and capabilities are being developed and tested,"" Boeing spokesman Randy Jackson told CNN.While the F-15 will still lack the stealth capability of the F-22, upgrades in radar technology, infrared search and track, and electronic warfare capabilities will significantly improve its ability to detect, target, and engage enemy aircraft at a tactical advantage, according to the Air Force.And the new high-tech mission computer and upgraded radio communication tools will not only allow the F-15 to better complement and communicate with its F-22 partner on the battlefield, but are also designed to support future technology as it is developed.""The fourth generation F-15 has an unmatched record of success in the air-to-air role, and provides the critical additional capacity needed to augment and supplement the F-22 force in support of today's air superiority mission sets,"" Maj. Leese told CNN.""As the Air Force continues to review our future force structure over the coming year, balancing operational effectiveness with current budget limitations, we expect the F-15 to play a critical role in the defense of our nation for the foreseeable future,"" he said. The various upgrades will finish installing between 2024 and 2030, according to the Air Force. "	Air Force investing $12B in F-15s

Here's a look at some of the key ways Karimov's death could affect the US.AfghanistanA onetime Soviet official, Karimov had led Uzbekistan since before that country's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, making him one of the longest-serving rulers in the world.After achieving statehood, Uzbekistan wanted independence from Russia and sought out relationships with the West. But there was ""a certain level of disinterest"" on the part of the US, Olga Oliker, the director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.It wasn't until the 9/11 terror attacks, when Washington was trying to gain the cooperation of countries near Afghanistan during its fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban, that US-Uzbekistan relations became an important element of American foreign policy.Karimov backed the US-led intervention in Afghanistan, as he also saw the Taliban and al Qaeda as Uzbekistan's enemies. He previously backed the Northern Alliance, which had fought the Taliban during the 1990s and were key allies in the US operation to oust the Taliban. Karimov let US forces use Uzbekistan's airspace and Karshi-Khanabad airbase to support operations in Afghanistan, with which it shares an 85-mile-long border. But in 2005, Karimov kicked the US personnel out after the George W. Bush administration condemned a violent crackdown by Uzbek security forces against protesters in the city of Andijan. The State Department's 2015 human rights report on Uzbekistan said security officials reportedly killed ""at least 187 unarmed civilians"" in an event that has been described as the biggest attack on demonstrators since Tiananmen Square in 1989.Despite the closure of the base, Karimov allowed the US to move equipment through Uzbekistan, which enabled the US to avoid the more problematic Pakistan-to-Afghanistan supply route.CounterterrorismDuring Karimov's reign, Uzbekistan faced a series of terrorist threats, most prominently the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). The US designated the IMU a foreign terrorist group in 2000 and the organization has since allied itself with al Qaeda and the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. Although the IMU carried out a series of car bombs in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent in 1999, the group has largely been confined to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.But any instability in the wake of Karimov's death could leave a vacuum to be exploited by the IMU, which, according to the State Department, seeks to overthrow the Uzbek government and has declared allegiance to ISIS.Approximately 500 citizens from Uzbekistan have traveled to Iraq and Syria as foreign fighters, according to the Soufan Group, a security consultancy. A citizen of Uzbekistan was one of the terrorists that carried out the June ISIS-linked attack on the Istanbul international airport that killed more than 40 people. The former US Ambassador to Uzbekistan, John Herbst, believes groups such as IMU will attempt to exploit the transition but doubts they'll be successful. He called Uzbekistan's security services the best in Central Asia. Some analysts believe Karimov exaggerated the threat of terrorism, using it as an excuse to crack down on the opposition and maintain his authoritarian regime.""The government used security concerns related to terrorism as a pretext for the detention of suspects, and potentially used it to prosecute religious activists and political dissidents,"" according to a State Department report.US-Russian relationsUzbekistan is often seen as one of the more independent former Soviet states in Central Asia. Some countries in the region have opted to join Russian-led organizations and would-be rivals to the European Union and NATO, such as the Eurasian Economic Union and Collective Security Treaty organization. Uzbekistan is not a member of either, even as Russia maintains military installations in three of Uzbekistan's neighbors: Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.Karimov ""wanted to make sure the Russians didn't get too much influence in the region,"" Oliker told CNN.Herbst agreed, noting that unlike many of its neighbors, Uzbekistan was able to purge Russian agents from its military and security institutions, which helped cement its independence. Oliker said Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely hoping that a more pro-Russian leader comes to power, saying it was possible that a new Uzbek leader with limited support might seek Moscow's backing as Russia ""will have no qualms"" about supporting a leader who participates in crackdowns.Putin was quick to offer his condolences to Uzbekistan upon learning of Karimov's death.""It is difficult to overestimate the contribution of Islam Karimov to the establishment of relations of strategic partnership between our countries,"" Putin said via a statement published on the Kremlin's website.""There's no question Moscow would like a much closer relationship with Uzbekistan than it (had) under Karimov,"" Herbst said. But he assessed, ""There's a good chance"" that Karimov's successor continues the same independent policies, noting that most Uzbek elites share Karimov's views.Oliker also thinks the situation is likely to be relatively calm in the immediate future as Karimov's health has been poor for some time and a transition plan is likely in place. She said it's even possible that a new leader might liberalize the economy and other elements of society in a bid to attract Western investment and support. Uzbekistan's economy is heavily dependent on energy and cotton exports, as well as remittances from millions of workers abroad in places like Russia.As the most populous of the former Soviet states in Central Asia, Uzbekistan has long sought to be the region's leader and maintain its autonomy, a course of action likely to continue for the time being, despite the death of the only independent ruler the country has ever known.""We have always had differences on human rights. I don't think those are going away,"" Herbst said, before adding that the US is interested in a stable, secure and geopolitically independent Uzbekistan, China in recent years has also increased its presence in Central Asia with major investments in infrastructure and energy, and while Karimov welcomed the money, he kept the Chinese at arm's length.""He was suspicious of everybody,"" Herbst said."

""We are dedicated to fostering a bipartisan foreign policy and we will devote ourselves to this effort now and after the election.""Obama to bid farewell with Asia pivot in fluxPolitico first reported earlier Friday about the prospect of the two former diplomats backing Clinton.Kissinger, a former national security adviser and later secretary of state to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, and Shultz, who served President Ronald Reagan, join other notable Republicans who have so far refused to fall behind their party's standard-bearer. Why Republicans oppose Trump and why?Neither of the two Presidents Bush, as well as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have endorsed Trump.

Most recently, Mylan, the producer of EpiPen, has come under sharp scrutiny for raising the cost of the lifesaving tool that relaxes muscles in the midst of a severe allergic reaction by 500%.Clinton, according to an aide, will create a new ""drug-pricing consumer response team"" that would look to target ""unjustified, outlier price increases in long-standing, life-saving treatments.""The team, according to Clinton's plan, will ""monitor price increases"" and have the authority to intervene in the drug market by ""supporting alternative manufacturers that enter the market and increase competition, to bring down prices and spur innovation in new treatments.""The group, which will be made up of federal public health officials, patient advocates and independent experts, will also be able to approve importation of similar drugs from ""developed countries with strong safety standards"" and penalize drug companies who hike prices.""Over the past year, we've seen far too many examples of drug companies raising prices excessively for long-standing, life-saving treatments with little or no new innovation or R&D,"" Clinton said in a statement Friday. ""It's time to move beyond talking about these price hikes and start acting to address them.""Clinton added that Americans deserve medications ""without being burdened by excessive, unjustified costs"" and that she is ""ready to hold drug companies accountable when they try to put profits ahead of patients, instead of back into research and innovation.""Clinton has been animated by drug price surges since she launched her campaign in 2015.In October, Clinton called for a federal probe of Turing, a company that raised the price of Daraprim to $750 a pill from $13.50 after it acquired the drug, and got into a spat with CEO Martin Shkreli.Clinton accused Shkreli of price gouging and mentioned him in stump speeches. The biotech CEO, who faces two counts of securities fraud and various conspiracy charges for another company, responded to Clinton with ""lol"" -- laugh out loud.Clinton first weighed in on Mylan raising the price of EpiPen's in August, calling the increases ""outrageous.""""Over the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%,"" she said.

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-interview-notes/index.html	"Clinton told the FBI she ""could not recall any briefing or training by State related to the retention of federal records or handling classified information,"" according to the bureau's notes of their interview with Clinton. The documents indicate Clinton told investigators she either does not ""recall"" or ""remember"" at least 39 times — often in response to questions about process, potential training or the content of specific emails.Much of the report reiterated what FBI Director James Comey testified in open hearings before Congress, including that more than six dozen email chains contained classified information at the time they were sent and that there appeared to have been hacking attempts on her server, though there is no evidence they were successful. Still, the report added fuel to the criticisms of Clinton and the narrative that her team acted ""extremely careless,"" as Comey said.GOP nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans have stepped up their attacks connecting the emails to questions over whether Clinton gave preferential treatment to donors to her family's foundation. The release of the documents Friday comes as Clinton's lead over Trump has been cut in half since her post-convention bounce last month, according to CNN's Poll of Polls released Thursday.The bureau is making the information public in response to numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, including from CNN. ""Today the FBI is releasing a summary of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's July 2, 2016 interview with the FBI concerning allegations that classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on a personal e-mail server she used during her tenure,"" the agency said in a statement. ""We also are releasing a factual summary of the FBI's investigation into this matter.""Presidential campaign ramifications  The publication of the FBI report is likely to give a new burst of political life to the controversy over Clinton's private server. The episode plays directly into Republican claims that Clinton is dishonest, abhors transparency and lacks the ethical standards required of someone who sits in the Oval Office. It also allows Trump's campaign to suggest to voters that they will be setting up a repeat of the cycle of scandals, controversy, and investigations that dragged on through the entire presidency of Bill Clinton and which tainted Hillary Clinton at the same time.""Hillary Clinton's answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these documents, I really don't understand how she was able to get away from prosecution.""Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, meanwhile, called the release a ""devastating indictment"" of Clinton's honesty and judgment.Clinton's campaign, however, said it was ""pleased"" by the release.""While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case,"" Clinton's national press secretary Brian Fallon said in a statement. 'Oh s***'The FBI report also provided detail on mass deletions of Clinton's email server by the company maintaining her server, Platte River Networks, after the existence of it came to light.  According to the investigation report, top Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills told a PRN worker whose name was redacted in December 2014 that Clinton wanted her email to only be retained for 60 days, and instructed him to reset the retention policy on her email account.But the individual told the FBI he realized that he had failed to do so until after The New York Times published its bombshell story revealing Clinton's private server and email use, prompting an ""'oh s***' moment.""""In a follow-up FBI interview on May 3, 2016, (name redacted) indicated he believed he had an 'oh s***' moment and sometime between March 25-31, 2015, deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the PRN server and used BleachBit to delete the exported .PST files he had created on the server system containing Clinton's emails,"" the report stated. The mass deletion occurred after the March 2, 2015, Times story and after a March 3, 2015, preservation order from the House Benghazi Committee to retain and produce documents related to her email accounts.Mills had sent this request to PRN and this individual on March 9, 2015, and under repeat questioning by the FBI, the individual admitted he was aware that the request existed and meant he shouldn't disturb the files on PRN's server.Both Mills and Clinton told the FBI they were not aware of the mass deletion that March.Colin PowellOne of the findings revealed in the report is that former Secretary of State Colin Powell ""warned"" Clinton that her emails could become government record in 2009.According to the report summarizing the FBI's investigation, Clinton emailed Powell just after inauguration in 2009 about his use of a BlackBerry as secretary of state. ""Powell warned Clinton that if it became 'public' that Clinton had a BlackBerry, and she used it to 'do business,' her emails could become 'official record(s) and subject to the law,'"" the report stated. ""Powell further advised Clinton, 'Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.'"" But the FBI said Clinton described her understanding of Powell's comments as saying that work-related emails would be official record, adding ""Powell's comments did not factor into her decision to use a personal email account.""Before it became public, interest in the contents of the report had intensified after it was reported that Clinton told the FBI a conversation with Powell recommending she use private email helped convince her to do so.Powell repudiated the idea that he shares any responsibility for her choice in the following days, however, and Clinton told CNN's Anderson Cooper last month that she takes full responsibility. ""I've been asked many, many questions in the past year about emails. And what I've learned is that when I try to explain what happened it can sound like I'm trying to excuse what I did,"" she told CNN. ""And there are no excuses. I want people to know that the decision to have a single e- mail account was mine. I take responsibility for it. I've apologized for it. I would certainly do differently if I could.""Powell rejects Clinton email defenseUse of mobile devicesThe report also described the way Clinton used her BlackBerry mobile devices. Clinton has cited her desire to use a single BlackBerry as part of her motivation to use a personal email address.Clinton's aide Huma Abedin told the FBI that Clinton often would use a new BlackBerry for a few days before returning to an older model because of her familiarity, according to the report.The FBI found that 13 different mobile devices were used with her two known phone numbers, and thus may have sent emails with her private account.After Clinton switched to a new device, the previous incarnation would often disappear, and a former Bill Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, said he could recall two times he destroyed the old device either by breaking it in half or hitting it with a hammer.The findings also noted that Clinton stored her BlackBerry in a desk drawer in her office, which was not authorized. Her office was in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), and thus the use of mobile devices in the office was prohibited.The former Assistant Secretary of State for State Diplomatic Security Service Eric Boswell told the FBI that he ""never received any complaints about Clinton using her personal BlackBerry inside the SCIF."" According to Abedin, Cooper and another person whose name was redacted from the report, there were personally owned desktop computers in the SCIFs in Clinton's homes in Washington and Chappaqua, New York. Clinton had stated to the FBI she did not have a computer of any kind in the SCIFs in her residences. Abedin and Clinton said the former secretary of state did not use a computer and primarily used her BlackBerry or iPad for checking emails.Handing of classified informationThe notes revealed that Clinton relied heavily on her staff and aides to determine what was classified information and how it should be handled. ""Clinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,"" the FBI notes said. ""She relied on State official to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address.""Clinton was also asked about the (C) markings within several documents that James Comey testified before Congress represented classified information. The emails that were sent and received from her server containing these markings became the subject of intense debate on the Hill, as her critics seized on them as evidence that she mishandled information.But Clinton told the FBI she was unaware of what the marking meant.""Clinton stated she did not know and could only speculate it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order,"" the interview notes stated. The former secretary of state said she did understand when an email was marked ""confidential"" at the top, and ""asked the interviewing agents if that was what 'c' referenced,"" according to the notes. The confidential label had been placed there by the FBI after the fact. She also said she didn't ""pay attention to the 'level' of classified information and took all classified information seriously.""The interview also addressed a 2011 email in which Clinton said she hadn't received talking points from her aide, Jake Sullivan. He responded that there were issues sending the document through secure fax. ""If they can't,"" Clinton replies, ""turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure.""That email had been the fuel behind speculation that Cilnton had demanded her aide send classified information through a nonsecure channel by removing markings. But Clinton told the FBI that she understood the request as routine. ""Clinton thought a 'nonpaper' was a way to convey the unofficial stance of the US government to a foreign government and believed this practice went back '200 years,'"" she said, according to interview notes. ""When viewing the displayed email, Clinton believed she was asking Sullivan to remove the State letterhead and provide unclassified talking points. Clinton stated she had no intention to remove classification markings.""Fallout from Comey's remarksComey in July took the unprecedented step of announcing in a press conference the FBI's conclusion that there was not enough evidence to merit a criminal prosecution, before handing over his findings to the Justice Department.Anticipation for FBI's release on Clinton investigationThe DOJ followed that recommendation and decided no prosecution was merited. After Comey testified about the decision before Congress, members requested access to his agency's report. Last month, the bureau gave members of Congress access to the notes, as well as notes from interviews with other Clinton staff and aides, but kept that version of the report classified. Comey testified that no transcript of the interview exists, only the notes taken on it. Clinton was not under oath. The FBI's release Friday did not include the notes of interviews with Clinton's aides. "	FBI releases Hillary Clinton email report, interview notes

""I'm the one that sat down with the New York Times reporter and one of the questions that she asked, did you submit questions to the Trump campaign beforehand. And yes, I didn't see anything wrong with it. I never lied about, tried to be deceitful about it,"" he told CNN's Carol Costello on ""Newsroom.""""In the past I have done things for the White House, done an invocation about a prayer about a year ago when Vice President Biden was in town, and before I even did the prayer they asked me to submit what I was going to pray.

And they were questions that I feel African-Americans need to know.""But the church leader said that in light of The New York Times report, he had changed some of his questions and has some undisclosed inquiries. ""I have questions that they don't know about, no one knows about. I changed them after that came out. Let me make something very clear: there was no coercing with the Trump campaign and myself to try to give him an upper hand on these questions.""The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN on the report in The Times.Rapper Rhymefest to Donald Trump: Come to ChicagoJackson also said that the Trump campaign would not have a role editing the final cut of the interview, disputing an assertion in The New York Times report. ""That is not true. Then it would be tainted, and would not be good. This has never been discussed with me.""The pastor also suggested Trump would have an informal meeting with members of the congregation.""So he's going to stay for the service after the interview. And then if he greets the congregation, as we do with all politicians or all visitors if he wants to say, 'Hey, I'm Donald Trump, I'm glad to be here' -- and it's not going to be an interview or speech to the congregation.""Hillary Clinton's campaign used the Times report as a sign of the Republican presidential nominee ""ducking questions.""""After 14 months of neglecting us, Donald Trump is once again dodging substantive conversations and ducking questions about the issues that impact our community,"" Marlon Marshall, a Clinton aide, said in a statement.

According to the report, Clinton said ""she did not pay attention to the 'level' of classified information and took all classified information seriously.

She recalled many conversations about future strikes ""that never occurred.""The former secretary of state said she thought drone strike information classification ""depended on the context,"" noting it was an important tool but ""frequently in the press.""Hundreds had her addressClinton said it was well known she used that email address: ""At least a hundred, if not several hundred State employees"" had that contact info.Yet some State employees said they did not know her actual address since she appeared merely as the letter ""H"" in the sender field of the email. And ""the majority"" of Clinton's aides interviewed by the FBI, including her most senior staffers, did not know of the home server until it became publicly reported or after Clinton left the State Department. Skirting FOIA rules?Clinton said she did not have conversations with anyone ""with regard to using the server to avoid"" Freedom of Information Act regulations. Clinton denied that avoiding FOIA rules was a reason for setting up the system.Sidney Blumenthal's roleClinton's correspondence with confidante Sidney Blumenthal has drawn particular scrutiny. But Clinton said that while Blumenthal is a ""prodigious"" writer, she said the information he provided was ""sometimes accurate and sometimes not.""Removing markingsRegarding an email asking an aide to remove markings, Clinton said she was directing him to create talking points and ""had no intention to remove classification markings."" She explained she thought a ""non paper"" was a way to convey the unofficial stance of the US government to foreign governments.The 'oh s*** moment'Clinton's team had an ""oh s*** moment"" in late March of last year, according to the report.

""I don't think they are setting the best example,"" he said.DNC hackPutin responded to suspicion surrounding Russia's role in the DNC hack by arguing that ""there's no need to distract the public's attention from the essence of the problem by raising some minor issues connected with the search for who did it.""""But,"" he continued, ""I want to tell you again -- I don't know anything about it, and on a state level Russia has never done this."" The Russian leader weighed in on the revelations that resulted from the release of DNC data, showing that DNC officials appeared to favor Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign over primary rival Bernie Sanders. Putin noted that the leaks indicated ""specifically that the campaign headquarters worked in the interest of one of the candidates, in this case Mrs. Clinton, rather than equally for all of the Democratic Party candidates.""He suggested his administration wasn't savvy enough in the realm of American politics to think of attempting to influence the election.""To do that you need to have a finger on the pulse and get the specifics of domestic political life of the U.S. I'm not sure that even our Foreign Ministry experts are sensitive enough.""He also told Bloomberg that the complexity of modern hackers made it ""extremely difficult"" to definitively say who was responsible for the leak, and suggested that they can disguise their activities and ""leave their mark, or even the mark of others.""U.S. presidential electionThe Russian president maintained his neutrality in the race for president, but was sharply critical of both Clinton and Republican Donald Trump's rhetoric during the campaign.""They're both using shock tactics, just each in their own way. I don't think they are setting the best example,"" he said.Putin also said Clinton and Trump were being ""shortsighted"" by playing ""the anti-Russian card."" But he noted that both candidates are ""very smart people"" who ""understand which buttons you need to press,"" explaining that he viewed the attacks on Russia as ""part of the U.S. political culture.""  And Putin rejected a criticism, leveled by critics and opponents of Clinton, that the sale of a Canadian uranium mining company to a Russian company in 2013 was approved by the State Department under Clinton in exchange for a $2.35 million donation to the Clinton Foundation by the chairman of the company.   ""Does that mean we control the Clinton family? That's complete nonsense,"" Putin said."	Putin denies role in DNC hack, 'important' that information made public
