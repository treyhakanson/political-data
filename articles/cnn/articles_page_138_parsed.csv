Scott Walker, who has worked closely with Pence on the trail and played Democratic opponent Tim Kaine during debate preparations, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that Donald Trump's campaign wanted to absorb and react to insults Kaine would potentially throw, rather than respond with similar attacks. ""We knew, watching the tapes, that Sen. Kaine was going to spend his time detracting from the question,"" Walker told Tapper. ""They think in their focus groups that if they attack, they can win.""With Kaine increasingly stepping into the role of attack dog for the ticket, Pence has functioned as a calmer foil to his running mate.RELATED: Pence edges Kaine in VP debate instant pollWalker said if Trump learned from his running mate -- adopting a more even temperament and not falling into traps set by Clinton -- in advance of Sunday's second Presidential debate, the Republican presidential nominee would be more able to concentrate on issues Americans care about, such as the economy and immigration, instead of getting caught in a shouting match. ""What the debate prep helps you do is stay focused on who you are, what you believe in and not get stuck in things that are meant to sidetrack you,"" Walker said. ""That's part of the reason why I think it was successful that Mike Pence showed the kind of person he is, he showed his empathy, he showed his rational sense, he showed what it means to be a common sense conservative.""Pence defended during the debate his running mate's recent foreign policy comments, in particular Trump's stance on Russia's president Vladimir Putin and illegal immigration across America's southern borders.Walker said the Republican ticket wanted to concentrate its efforts on identifying specific individuals who had entered the country and committed illegal acts, unlike Clinton and Kaine, who he said painted illegal immigrants with ""a broad brush."" ""That was a point Mike Pence made over and over again,"" Walker said. ""That we're weaker in this world not just because of the president but because of Hillary Clinton's policies.RELATED: What Mike Pence said Donald Trump said vs. what Donald Trump really said"	Scott Walker: Mike Pence didn't 'take the bait' at debate	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]

It also lines him up more closely with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and his debate opponent, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, both of whom have advocated a Syrian no-fly zone.""The United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo,"" Pence said in reference to the besieged Syrian city.  ""I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is to immediately establish safe zones,"" Pence said at the first and only vice presidential debate, at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, ""so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas (and) work with our Arab partners in real time to make that happen.""It wasn't the only time Pence departed from his running mate's script on foreign policy issues or denied some of Trump's foreign policy pronouncements. Pence repeatedly criticized Clinton and Kaine for the drawdown of US troops in Iraq, blaming Clinton for failing to negotiate an agreement with Iraq that would have provided legal protections for US troops there. While the Obama administration was not successful in making such an arrangement, Pence didn't mention that the Obama White House inherited an agreement from President George W. Bush that required all US troops to leave Iraq by 2011 or that the Iraqi parliament had refused to grant US troops legal immunity if they stayed in the country.Moreover, in a 2006 interview with CNBC, Trump said he wanted to see Bush, then still president, ""get us out of Iraq, which is a total mess, a total catastrophe, and it's not going to get any better. It's only going to get worse.""Pence also denied that he or Trump had ever praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a better leader than President Barack Obama, though both have spoken positively of him and the Indiana governor told CNN's Dana Bash in September that he was a ""stronger leader"" than the current occupant of the Oval Office.In Asia, Trump advocated letting US allies deal with the threat of a nuclear North Korea on their own, even suggesting that longtime US partners like South Korea and Japan obtain nuclear weapons themselves. Kaine pounced on this at one point, saying that ""Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons."" Pence, for his part, outlined a position that didn't sound much like Trump's. The Indiana governor said that ""we need an effective US diplomacy to marshal the nations in the Asian rim to put pressure on North Korea,"" which is what the Obama administration and its predecessors have favored. The White House, however, has opposed a no-fly zone in Syria. The safe zone would be an area inside the country that the US and allied planes would defend from Syrian or Russian attack. It raises thorny legal problems, because doing so without the host country's permission means violating international law. And the possibilities for military escalation are very high if a US, Russian or Syrian plane were shot down. At this point, many military experts say a no-fly zone isn't possible.Trump has said that he would be willing to support a safe zone, but only financially. When asked whether the US should be involved in establishing safe zones, Trump told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" in October 2015 that he would ""help them economically, even though we owe $19 trillion.""In that same interview, Trump said he would ""love a safe zone for people."" ""What they should do is, the countries should all get together, including the Gulf states, who have nothing but money, they should all get together and they should take a big swath of land in Syria and they do a safe zone for people, where they could to live, and then ultimately go back to their country, go back to where they came from,"" Trump said.Clinton called for a no-fly zone in Syria in October 2015, soon after Russia entered the country and started a bombing campaign to help President Bashar al-Assad. ""I personally would be advocating now for a no-fly zone and humanitarian corridors to try to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air,"" Clinton said in an interview with Boston's WHDH. The White House has said a Syrian safe zone is off the table because of the enormous military commitment it would take to effectively enforce it and the ongoing responsibility of protecting its borders. Several Pentagon officials have told Congress that the costs would outweigh the benefits because it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation between US forces and Russia or Syria in the skies. President Barack Obama laid out some of the complexities of a no-fly zone in remarks he made in Germany in April. ""It's not a matter of me not wishing I could help and protect a whole bunch of people,"" Obama said. ""It's a very practical issue about how do you do it?  And who is going to put on a bunch of ground troops inside of Syria?  And how do you let people in? And who do you let in and who do you let out? And how is it monitored?""Obama said that after multiple talks about a possible safe zone with the Defense Department, ""It is very difficult to see how it would operate, short of us essentially being willing to (use) militarily take over a big chunk of that country."" Kaine has said that while he initially supported the administration's argument against safe zones, by December 2015, he had changed his mind. That month he told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that ""the absence of the humanitarian zone will go down as one of the big mistakes that we've made."""

The report, attributed to anonymous sources, said the State Department quietly protested the incident to Russian officials.The story also said one of the diplomats had been treated at a ""Western medical clinic"" - which Russia said was not true.  ""A probe conducted by Russia revealed that at the time no Americans had sought treatment at any St. Petersburg medical institutions,"" Ryabkov said. ""If, alternatively, they had just been boozing at a hotel bar, they have only themselves to blame.""He added that Russian investigators at the time responded ""promptly"" to information from the US Embassy, but that when they asked for ""more specificity to their complaints"" the Americans did not respond, not even to provide the names of the ""victims.""  While the State Department has declined to comment on the report, US officials have expressed concern generally over the treatment of American diplomats in Russia.""We remain troubled by the way our diplomatic and consular staff have been treated over the past two years,"" State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters this week.""We have raised our concerns at the highest levels,"" she added. ""In particular, the harassment and surveillance of our diplomatic personnel in Moscow by security personnel and traffic police has increased significantly. As we've said before, we find this unacceptable.""In his statement, Ryabkov also cited what he called a ""clear increase"" in the number of US attempts to ""recruit"" Russian diplomats posted in the US including ""threats against the well-being of family members.""Earlier this week, the US suspended ongoing talks with Russia over ways to achieve a lasting cessation of hostilities in Syria.Secretary of State John Kerry blamed the impasse on Russian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the regime's ongoing assault against the city of Aleppo."

CNN will air the event in its entirety on its networks as well as through a live stream on CNN.com. CNN Politics will host a live blog offering instant analysis and reaction as the debate unfolds at the top of the page.A CNN/ORC poll released Monday showed 12% of likely voters had never heard of Kaine or Pence. The poll also found 17% of likely voters had no opinion of Kaine and 16% had no opinion of Pence.There was little difference in these numbers compared to the CNN/ORC poll of likely voters taken at the beginning of the month, suggesting many viewers will be getting their first, and possibly only, formative glimpse at the two men competing to be first-in-line to the presidency.CBS' Elaine Quijano will moderate the debate. She is the first Asian-American to moderate a general election debate and the youngest in decades.The second-tier clash is scheduled to last 90 minutes, without commercial interruption. The debate commission said it will consist of nine, 10-minute-long segments. Quijano will open each segment with a question, giving the candidates two minutes to respond before wading into the issue further.

Daylin Leach, a Clinton supporter. ""I see with my own eyes the damage Donald Trump does when he talks about women and how they look.""""I'm so proud of you for asking that question,"" Clinton responded. ""You are right -- my opponent has just taken this concern to a new level of difficulty and meanness.""Clinton, who was on stage with her daughter Chelsea and actress Elizabeth Banks, criticized Trump for his disparaging comments about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado and her weight gain years ago. ""My opponent insulted Miss Universe. I mean, how do you get more acclaimed than that?"" Clinton said. ""Well, it wasn't good enough. We can't take any of this seriously any more. We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it. We need to ignore it.""RELATED: Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump 'contributing nothing to our nation'The former secretary of state told the 15-year-old that it was ""shocking"" to see women get called names and judged ""solely on the basis of physical attributes,"" before encouraging her to remember that women are ""more than the way you look.""The exchange was the latest example of Trump coming under fire for his remarks about women and their physique. The morning after the first general election debate last week, Trump said of Machado: ""She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem."" The New York businessman has also publicly mocked other women in the past, including comedian Rosie O'Donnell whom he called a ""slob"" with a ""fat ugly face.""Despite the candidate's struggles with women voters, the Trump team -- rather than play damage control using conventional political tools -- has encouraged its supporters to respond by dredging up the extramarital affairs of former President Bill Clinton. The question of whether Trump is a suitable role model for children also took center stage Monday night at the New Hampshire Senate debate. The state's Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is running for reelection against Democratic Gov. Maggie Hasan, was asked by the moderator whether she would point to Trump as a ""role model"" for kids. RELATED: Trump: 'I'm working for you now, I'm not working for Trump'""I think that certainly there are many role models that we have, and I believe he can serve as president and so, absolutely. I would do that,"" responded Ayotte, who has said she will vote for Trump but has not endorsed him.  Soon after the debate had concluded, Ayotte released a statement taking those remarks back. ""I misspoke tonight,"" Ayotte said. ""While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn't hold either of them as role models for my kids."""	15-year-old asks Clinton about Trump's comments on women	['Ayotte', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Only 16% of conservative Republicans and 13% of moderate Republicans say that ""almost all climate scientists"" agree that human behavior is mostly responsible for climate change, compared with 55% of liberal Democrats and 29% of moderate Democrats.Eleven percent of conservative Republicans and 19% of moderate Republicans say that scientists understand the causes of climate change ""very well,"" much lower than the 54% of liberal Democrats and 28% of moderate Democrats who do hold that view.Pew's findings also showed suspicion among Republicans toward scientists. Only 15% of conservative Republicans said climate scientists can be trusted ""a lot"" to give full and accurate information on causes of climate change, while 32% of moderate Republicans said they could be trusted. Seventy percent of liberal Democrats said that scientists can be trusted, along with 45% of moderate Democrats. Trump's position on climate change came into focus last week when his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said the candidate believes it is a ""naturally occurring"" phenomenon. ""There are shifts naturally occurring,"" Conway said on CNN.Studies have shown that around 97% of climate scientists believe climate change is likely a result of human activities.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/supreme-court-race-cases/index.html	"The justices have wrangled over how openly to talk about their differences. And now, as a new session begins, the court is delving into a set of racially charged cases in the explosive context of the criminal justice system.The disputes evoke some of the hostile rhetoric of the presidential campaign and real conflicts seen on urban streets: Slurs against Mexican-Americans. Testimony that black defendants are more dangerous than whites. A claim that police used racial epithets during an arrest then fabricated evidence.The cases could especially test a Supreme Court that has been trying to smooth over differences since the February death of Antonin Scalia and no Senate action on US Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland, nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed him.The cases also arise as individual justices have been speaking more pointedly about the state of race in America.In an interview soon after the July 7 killings of five Dallas police officers during a protest of police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg voiced distress.""We never realized what was the promise of the '60s,"" she said, responding to a question about recent killings. ""With all the equality legislation, the Fair Housing Act [of 1968], the Voting Rights Act [of 1965], Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964], we still live in a highly segregated society. Black communities and white communities. Black schools and white schools.""Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first and only Hispanic justice, has increasingly referred to racial divisions.""[I]t is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of [police] scrutiny,"" she wrote as she dissented in a June police-stop case. ""For generations, black and brown parents have given their children 'the talk' -- instructing them never to run down the street; always keep your hands where they can be seen ... all out of fear of how an officer with a gun will react to them."" Supreme Court starts new term with more questions than answersThe justices have been riven more broadly on race, in cases covering school integration plans, municipal hiring, voting rights and college affirmative action. In June, when Justice Anthony Kennedy voted for the first time to approve a university admissions program favoring minorities, he voiced new concerns about racial isolation and stereotyping. Chief Justice John Roberts dissented then and has been firmly on the other side of the issue. He has expressed skepticism for remedies intended to promote diversity or counter historic discrimination. In 2013, he won a narrow majority to limit the reach of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County, Alabama, dispute. In earlier cases, he referred to ""a sordid business, this divvying us up based on race"" and insisted, ""The way to stop race discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" Sotomayor turned that view against him as they tangled in 2014, saying, ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race.""Only Ginsburg joined her in that opinion, dissenting as the majority upheld a Michigan state referendum prohibiting racial preferences in government programs. Justice Clarence Thomas, the sole African-American on the court, has been on the other side of affirmative action, believing it violates the Constitution's equality guarantee and can be stigmatizing to minorities.Emerging against the backdrop of the presidential campaign and national controversy over policing, the new cases could inflame such tensions at the court. All involve legal questions that go beyond race and ethnicity. A dispute from Colorado, for example, pits a defendant's right to fair trial against a longstanding principle safeguarding private jury deliberations.The case began in 2007 when Miguel Pena-Rodriguez was accused of sexually harassing and attempted assault on two teenage girls in the bathroom of a horse-racing track. During deliberations, a juror known in the record as H.C. said: ""I think he did it because he's Mexican and Mexican men take whatever they want."" He also dismissed Pena-Rodriguez's alibi witness as ""an illegal.""After Pena-Rodriguez was convicted of sexual harassment, two jurors told defense lawyers about H.C., and his lawyers tried to use their statements to challenge the fairness of the trial. Denying the request for a hearing, the Colorado Supreme Court said H.C.'s comments, no matter how ""ideologically loathsome,"" did not merit an exception to jury deliberation secrecy. Two years ago, the Supreme Court foreshadowed this dispute when it reinforced the principle protecting deliberations but said in the opinion by Sotomayor that, ""There may be cases of juror bias so extreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been abridged."" The new case will be heard October 11. A long-running Texas appeal spotlights a psychologist's testimony during sentencing that Duane Buck, an African-American convicted of the 1995 murder of his former girlfriend and a male friend, was statistically more likely to commit future violent acts than a white defendant. Buck contends he was denied effective assistance of counsel; his lawyers had hired the psychologist to testify on his behalf. Lower courts ruled that Buck lacked the ""extraordinary circumstances"" needed to reopen his case. Five years ago when the high court rejected a separate appeal from Buck, two justices (Sotomayor and Elena Kagan) said his case was ""marred by racial overtones"" and should be reviewed. Three others justices (Samuel Alito, Stephen Breyer and Scalia) deemed the psychologist's testimony ""bizarre and objectionable"" but were among those rejecting Buck's petition. His new appeal will be heard Wednesday. When can citizens sue for 'malicious prosecution?'The third racially charged dispute also up Wednesday explores when a person may sue for ""malicious prosecution"" based on Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.The dispute traces to March 18, 2011, when Joliet, Illinois, police officers stopped a car for failure to signal a turn and pulled Elijah Manuel from it. Manuel's lawyers told the justices in a filing that an officer him pushed him to the ground and said, ""You remember me, street punk? Now I got you... ."" The officer used a racial slur on Manuel, who is African-American. Police found a bottle of pills that Manuel said were vitamins but that officers contended were illegal Ecstasy pills. Manuel said tests at the scene and in a police lab showed the pills did not contain controlled substances. Police claimed the opposite, leading to his indictment for unlawful possession. When Manuel's lawyer asked for a copy of lab results and it was clear the pills were not illegal, Manuel was released from jail on May 5, 2011. Manuel sued for ""malicious prosecution"" on April 22, 2013, possibly beyond a two-year statute of limitations. The case involves several procedural issues, but an overriding question is whether Fourth Amendment protection extends beyond an arrest, through arraignment, and can serve as the basis of a ""malicious prosecution"" claim. The Innocence Network, a decade-old consortium of 69 groups representing prisoners, emphasized in a ""friend of the court"" brief the possible consequences of Manuel's case for minorities: ""Those incarcerated as a result of police misconduct ... suffer extensive harm. Racial minorities, the poor, and the uneducated disproportionately suffer these effects."""

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/04/politics/reality-check-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-emails/index.html	"""When you have somebody getting a subpoena from the United States Congress to have your emails and all other information sent, and after -- not before -- after getting the subpoena, 33,000 are deleted and acid-washed. And nobody even knows what that means, acid-washed. It's a very expensive thing to do. Most people don't even know what it means. When you see something like that. And there's no crime. Everything's just wonderful.""The charge that Hillary Clinton and her staff deliberately destroyed material that had been requested by congressional committees is at the heart of charges from her critics that the Democratic nominee should face criminal prosecution.But is there any truth to the charges? Or more precisely, what did the FBI say and do about these allegations? Here's what we know, mainly from the bureau's summary of its investigation that the FBI provided to Congress.In July 2014, the State Department, having gotten requests -- but not a subpoena -- for documents from congressional committees looking into Clinton's action surrounding the killings of Americasn in Benghazi, Libya, requested that Clinton, who had stepped down as secretary of state 17 months earlier, turn over all work-related emails that she had kept on her private server. That task was handled by Cheryl Mills, who was Clinton's chief of staff at State, and Heather Samuelson, Clinton's personal lawyer. The two women had all copies of the 62,320 emails transferred from the server to their laptop computers where Mills and Samuelson -- mainly Samuelson -- reviewed them to determine which were work-related and which were personal. The task took months.After completing it in December 2014, Clinton's lawyers printed out 30,490 emails they deemed to be work-related and turned them over to the State Department. The other printed copies of the remaining 31,830 emails that the lawyers felt were personal were destroyed. Paul Combetta, of Platte River Networks, the Denver-based company that maintained the private server, was instructed by the lawyers to erase the copies that had been sent to their laptops. He did so using a program called BleachBit, not ""acid wash.""There were still emails on Clinton's server that she considered personal. However, at this point, Clinton decided she no longer wanted to keep any personal emails on her server that were older than 60 days. Combetta was instructed to delete those as well. He failed to do so, later claiming he forgot.At this point, no subpoena for her emails had been issued by any congressional committees.On March 2, 2015, The New York Times published an article headlined, ""Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept."" Two days later, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued a subpoena seeking any emails that might be related to the attack on the American compound there. On March 9, Mills sent an email to Combetta informing him of the request to retain the email records. Combetta later told the FBI that several weeks later, he realized that he had forgotten to delete the older emails as Mills had instructed him to do in December. Combetta destroyed what he believed to be the remaining old emails sometime between March 21 and the 31.Combetta, who could have been charged with obstructing an FBI investigation, initially asserted his 5th Amendment rights against self-incrimination. He was later given immunity for his testimony. Both Clinton and Mills told the FBI that they had not instructed him to delete the emails from the server after the subpoena had been issued. It is not clear from the FBI summary that Combetta contradicted that assertion when he was interviewed. What it is clear is that FBI Director James Comey said that the investigation did not find any evidence of obstruction of justice by either Clinton, Mills, Samuelson or any other Clinton aide.So were all of the nearly 32,000 emails (not 33,000 as Trump keeps asserting, but who's counting?) that were supposedly deleted gone forever? Well, the FBI was able to find more than 17,000 of them and determined that a ""substantial number"" are duplicates of emails that had already been turned over to the State Department. The State Department has reviewed about 15,000 of the emails and determined that more than 9,400 were purely personal and will not be released and that another 5,600 are probably work-related and will be made public in the weeks before the election.As a result, we find Trump's claim that Clinton and/or her staffers deliberately destroyed emails after they were subpoenaed to be false.

Obama was due to talk up his signature health law in Tampa, as well as stump for Clinton in Miami.It was the second time Obama has postponed a campaign event for Clinton; in July, his first appearance on the trail for the Democratic nominee was canceled after a nightclub shooting in Orlando. With five weeks to go until Election Day, Obama has made only two appearances for Clinton: his campaign trail debut in Charlotte in July, and a solo appearance in Philadelphia last month. He will make the case for Clinton in Ohio next week, at a Democratic dinner in Columbus and a rally in Cleveland.Other presidential obligations, including a week-long swing through Asia and the annual United Nations meetings in New York, have precluded further campaigning from the current Oval Office occupant, though he and his aides describe a president raring to make the case for Clinton.For Democrats, it's a reminder that relying on Obama to drive turnout and galvanize voters comes with a downside: the obligations and schedule inherent in his full-time job as president of the United States. While Obama is still set to campaign for his preferred successor more than any sitting president in recent history, the White House has maintained that his official duties must take priority.  Instead of campaigning for Clinton, Obama will take time Wednesday for a briefing on hurricane preparations at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington. And while he's expected to return to the campaign trail next week, Obama isn't likely to make it to Florida before the state's October 11 voter registration deadline.""We are hoping to be able to reschedule those events relatively soon,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Tuesday. ""But that will be determined by the impact of the storm and by other components of the president's schedule.""White House officials have said Obama would make one or two campaign appearances per week for Clinton in the first weeks of October. To allow for an intensification of his political efforts, his schedule nearer to Election Day has remained flexible, with no major foreign trips slated.He's also expected to cut television and radio ads for Clinton, and continue his intense fundraising efforts for Democrats. His next stop on the high-dollar circuit is his hometown Chicago, where he'll raise cash for congressional Democrats and the Clinton campaign this weekend.Obama is also expected to cast his ballot in Chicago, potentially as early as Friday, to highlight the early voting options for Democrats ahead of Election Day.Instead of Obama, it's his White House cohorts -- first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden -- who have taken on the bulk of the campaigning so far. Michelle Obama has delivered barn-burners in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia on Clinton's behalf, as well as taped a 30-second ad for the Democratic nominee. Clinton's campaign hopes the first lady can drive suburban women and minorities to the polls in November.Biden, meanwhile, has made stops in Florida and Pennsylvania to bolster Clinton's appeal among working class voters."
