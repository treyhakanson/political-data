More than 60,000 homes were damaged, officials said, and 13 people were killed.""I think anybody who can see just the streets, much less the inside of the homes here, people's lives have been upended by this flood,"" he added.The flooding has created political headache for the White House as critics blasted Obama for being too slow to visit the state. He spent the previous week vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, while Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, visited the state and handed out supplies. ""Tuesday's too late,"" Trump told Fox News this weekend. ""Hop into the plane and go down and go to Louisiana and see what's going on, because it's a mess.""The city's newspaper, ""The Advocate,"" originally criticized the President for not ending his vacation in Martha's Vineyard immediately to visit the region. But the editorial board praised his decision to come Tuesday.""We welcome news of President Barack Obama's planned visit to Louisiana today to survey flood damage, which should help to advance relief and recovery in the disaster area as a national priority,"" the editorial board wrote.Trump's visit was well-received by local officials, and for a moment it gave Trump a chance to reveal a presidential timber that he insists he has.""Because it helped to shine a spotlight on Louisiana and on the dire situation that we have here, it was helpful,"" said John Bel Edwards, the state's Democratic governor.CNN's coverage of the Louisiana floodingWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Air Force One defended the timing of the trip, saying the ""President is used to people trying to score political points even in situations where they shouldn't.""Earnest said that $120 million in aid has already been approved and is starting to be paid out to flood-impacted residents.Edwards, who greeted Obama when he landed Tuesday, had previously said that he hoped the President would wait a few weeks before making his visit to the state, given the entourage and Secret Service personnel that comes with presidential trips that would have strained resources while officials were coping with the floods. Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic opponent, said Monday that she too plans a trip to the flood site. Her campaign said in a statement that she would come to the state at an unspecified time in the future.""This month's floods in Louisiana are a crisis that demand a national response,"" she said. ""I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.""Next problem for flood-ravaged Louisiana: Population lossObama meets with families of slain copsObama also met Tuesday with family members of police officers killed in last month's Baton Rouge attack. Three Baton Rouge area police officers were killed last month when they were ambushed by a gunman. That gunman, Gavin Long, was shot and killed by police.The meeting, which lasted a little more than 20 minutes and happened at a firehouse near a Baton Rouge airport, also took place with the family of Alton Sterling, who was fatally shot by police officers in the city last month.Obama's vacation ended Sunday, and the White House has maintained that he has been regularly briefed by senior staff on the situation on the ground and top administration officials also were sent to the Louisiana. Yet his response has earned some comparisons to how George W. Bush handled another natural catastrophe in a Louisiana city, New Orleans, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Obama has traveled to disaster sites in recent years, touring communities in Oklahoma and Arkansas destroyed by tornadoes along with New Jersey towns hit by Hurricane Sandy.Misery in Louisiana: See the most severe areas of impact'Pretty tough to swallow'Residents such as Denham Springs' Todd Krichel are still grappling with the scale of the destruction. Krichel told CNN's Nick Valencia he had lost a classic car he had been holding onto for years, a motorcycle he had been working on since the early 1980s and a family Bible from the late 1800s in the deluge. ""I pulled in this street this morning and a wave hit me and it just, I broke down, you know (what) I'm saying,"" Krichel said outside his house. ""It just, all my friends, family all our friends on this street, look at it. ... And I pulled down there and it was pretty tough to swallow.""Although Krichel said he did not want to evoke politics, he agreed Obama should have visited the stricken area earlier.""I think it's great that Trump came into town to show his support. I think that's a good thing that he did that, to tell you the truth,"" he said.But while residents such as Baton Rouge's Marie Sibley pleaded to Obama ""to just help us,"" others like Albany's Catherine Murphy were less optimistic. ""There ain't nothing he can do for us that Louisiana ain't done for ourselves,"" Murphy said. ""I've got no help from the federal government. I ain't asking for help from the government. Baby, let me tell you my community has come through.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story included a photo that incorrectly identified Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter."

In the same interview, the Arizona Republican added that Bergdahl ""clearly deserted"" his post. Bergdahl is facing a court martial for charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy after he disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in June 2009. He was captured and held in captivity by the Taliban until a prisoner exchange in May 2014. In what he referred to as the ""McCain motion,"" lead defense attorney Eugene Fidell said that the comments by the senator not only create a more favorable landscape for military prosecutors but also fall under the category of ""unlawful command influence"" and could sway the opinion of the convening authority in the case, Army Gen. Robert Abrams, commanding general of Forces Command, the military official overseeing the process of bringing charges against Bergdahl.RELATED: US service member killed in AfghanistanThe judge, Army Col. Jeffery Nance, asked the prosecution whether McCain could have an indirect influence on the case because he is a member of Congress, which ultimately holds the purse strings for the military. The prosecutors promptly said no, because he is not part of the chain of command that reports to the convening authority on the case.McCain isn't the only politician to have spoken publicly about the case. On the campaign trail, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump frequently calls Bergdahl a traitor and ridicules America's negotiating team for releasing five Taliban prisoners in order to retrieve him. On Monday during the pre-trial hearing, Nance ruled that Abrams must testify on his own behalf Wednesday after the defense team filed a motion for him to be removed as the convening authority.RELATED: Audit reveals Army's trillion-dollar accounting gaffesDefense attorneys have said that Abrams should be removed because of ""substantial prior involvement"" in Bergdahl's case when Abrams worked for former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who was in charge of the Pentagon when the seized soldier was brought home.They also objected to Abrams not sharing letters he received from the public regarding Bergdahl. Instead of showing them to the defense, he had them put in a burn bag and destroyed.Fidell, the lead defense attorney, told media that Abram's destruction of the letters was ""detrimental to the defense"" and ""uncorrectable.""The letters ""span the spectrum of opinion,"" Fidell said. ""Some could have been hostile ... but we'll never know.""Prosecuting attorneys argued that the letters would have no impact on the trial since they were inadmissible pieces of public opinion."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/who-is-huma-abedin/index.html	"But Abedin is in the spotlight in the final days of Clinton's campaign.Newly discovered emails that FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers Friday could be pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Clinton's private email server were sent or received by Abedin, according to a law enforcement official.The new emails are part of an investigation into former congressman Anthony Weiner, according to top law enforcement sources. Abedin announced her separation from Weiner this summer.The FBI and the New York Police Department have opened preliminary investigations of allegations that Weiner exchanged sexually explicit text messages with a purportedly underage girl. Abedin, 41, is one of Clinton's longest-serving aides. She was Clinton's deputy chief of staff at the State Department and is currently the vice chairwoman of Clinton's presidential campaign. Freedom of Information Act requests from a conservative organization have made many of Clinton's staff's emails sent during her State Department tenure public, and Abedin was involved in many of the exchanges that have drawn scrutiny.Clinton Foundation becomes campaign issueIn one exchange when Clinton was secretary of state, then-Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band asked Abedin to facilitate a meeting between Clinton and the crown prince of Bahrain. In another, Band and Abedin emailed about job opportunities at the State Department for a person whose name was redacted. Abedin has been in Clinton's orbit since 1996, when she got a White House internship as a student at George Washington University. She has said she was hoping for a job in the press office, aspiring to be a journalist like her role model, Christiane Amanpour -- but she was assigned to work with the then-first lady's chief of staff. ""The rest, as they say, is history,"" Abedin said of the experience in an April ""Call Your Girlfriend"" podcast.Born in Michigan, Abedin spent the majority of her childhood in Saudi Arabia, returning to the US for college. Her parents were scholars -- her father from India and her mother from Pakistan. Abedin has worked closely with Clinton in practically all of her endeavors since the White House. She worked for Clinton in the Senate and worked for her Senate campaign. She was the traveling chief of staff, known as the body woman, for Clinton's unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign.State Department tenure controversialBut her time at the State Department has not only drawn controversy because of the emails later made public.  Abedin was also given special status as a contractor with State after she left her formal role with Clinton to consult as well for a company called Teneo, formed by a Clinton insider. She also worked with the Clinton Foundation. Emails shed light on relationship between State, Clinton FoundationJust before she left her official State post, a mysterious LLC was formed with ties to her. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican, has long demanded answers about Abedin's work with the State Department, criticizing her designation as a Special Government Employee. Abedin has answered Grassley's inquiries with a defense of her varied work as separate.  Personal life made publicAbedin hasn't only made the news for her work with Clinton. Abedin married Weiner, the former New York Democratic congressman, in 2010. Former President Bill Clinton officiated their wedding.At the time, the power couple was notable for Weiner's rising career and their Muslim-Jewish relationship. But in 2011, Weiner admitted to sending sexually explicit messages and pictures to women online, a scandal that effectively ended his political career. One picture accidentally appeared on his Twitter account. Abedin stayed with him through that scandal, and the couple had a son, Jordan Zain Weiner, later that year. During a failed run for New York City mayor in 2013, more explicit messages he sent came to light, originating from the time after his original scandal. New Weiner sexting allegations surface, couple separatingThat time, Abedin again stood by his side and gave remarks at a press conference.""What I want to say is I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him, and as I have said from the beginning, we are moving forward,"" she said in 2013, acknowledging ""horrible mistakes"" her husband had made. ""It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to a place where I could forgive Anthony. ... It was not an easy choice in any way, but I made the decision that it was worth staying in this marriage.""But in August, when another sexting scandal came to light, Abedin had enough and announced she would be separating from her husband. Sources close to Abedin told CNN that the couple had been estranged for some time, but said she was ""furious and sickened"" after The New York Post published a sexually suggestive photo of Weiner next to their 4-year-old son.Questions over Abedin's backgroundClinton's critics have seized on Abedin's Muslim and international background, with the New York Post making allegations this week about her association with an academic journal founded by her late father and run by her mother that examines issues related to Muslims living in Western societies. Abedin was listed on the publication's masthead for 10 years as an assistant editor, according to the Post.The Post called it a ""radical Muslim journal,"" but people familiar with it and the region describe the journal as scholarly, academic and nonpartisan, and said its content does not raise red flags.Clinton's campaign said Abedin had very little involvement with the journal.""She wasn't paid -- did little to no work,"" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in an email to CNN.Editor's note: This story was initially published in August. It has been updated.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Abedin's age."	Huma Abedin takes another reluctant turn in the spotlight	['Clinton', 'Jordan']	[]
3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/russia-hack-new-york-times-fbi/index.html	"The intrusions, detected in recent months, are under investigation by the FBI and other US security agencies. Investigators so far believe that Russian intelligence is likely behind the attacks and that Russian hackers are targeting news organizations as part of a broader series of hacks that also have focused on Democratic Party organizations, the officials said.   The Times said email services for employees are outsourced to Google. CNN requested comment from Google but didn't receive comment. The FBI declined to comment.Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said the company had seen ""no evidence"" that any breaches had occurred of the Times's internal systems. CNN's report didn't say that the Times internal systems were breached, but that reporters were targeted. ""We are constantly monitoring our systems with the latest available intelligence and tools. We have seen no evidence that any of our internal systems, including our systems in the Moscow bureau, have been breached or compromised,"" Murphy said.The breaches targeting reporters and news organizations are part of an apparent surge in cyber attacks in the past year against entities beyond US government agencies. US intelligence officials believe the picture emerging from the series of recent intrusions is that Russian spy agencies are using a wave of cyber attacks, including against think-tanks in Washington, to gather intelligence from a broad array of non-governmental organizations with windows into the US political system. News organizations are considered top targets because they can yield valuable intelligence on reporter contacts in the government, as well as communications and unpublished works with sensitive information, US government officials believe. The Times, in its report, disputed CNN's report that the Times was bringing in private cybersecurity investigators to assist. Law enforcement officials briefed on the matter earlier told CNN that the Times had indicated it was bringing in private sector cybersecurity consultants to investigate. Attention has grown on the hacks thought to be carried out by Russians since Wikileaks released a trove of emails stolen from the DNC in the weekend before the Democratic Party's convention to nominate Hillary Clinton for president. US intelligence officials say there is strong evidence showing Russian intelligence behind the DNC hack. The Clinton campaign has claimed the hack as proof that the Russians are trying to aid the election of Donald Trump."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/donald-trump-immigration-policy/index.html	"More than a year later, Trump, now the Republican nominee, is preparing to wade back into the heated immigration debate. This time, though, he appears poised to lay out a more nuanced immigration policy -- one that could roll back some of the unapologetically blunt proposals that helped carry him to victory in the GOP primaries.""There could certainly be a softening"" in his immigration proposals, Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity Tuesday night, ""because we're not looking to hurt people.""But the real estate mogul and his new campaign leadership have dodged questions in recent days about whether Trump will abandon the promises he made on illegal immigration that attracted Republican primary voters to his campaign in droves, notably his promise to deport all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US.Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college mapThat's fueling questions that Trump may be on the verge of a big flip-flop — something the candidate is denying.Here's a look at the various ways he's approached his trademark policy issue.Deportation policyWhile denying that he is ""flip flopping,"" Trump and his campaign have made it clear in recent days they are mulling what to do with the undocumented immigrants living in the US.""The first thing we're gonna do, if and when I win, is we're gonna get rid of all the bad ones. We've got gang members, we have killers we have a lot of bad people that have to get out of this country,"" Trump said Monday night on Fox News. ""As far as everybody else, we're going to go through the process.""His newly minted campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Tuesday morning on Fox News that the campaign wants ""to be fair to everyone"" and said the campaign is making sure not to ""rush through a speech let alone a plan.""""It's a very complex issue,"" Conway said.But Trump's calls to deport all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants were anything but equivocal as he campaigned for the Republican nomination.In the first month of his campaign, Trump vowed to deport all undocumented immigrants and then allow ""the good ones"" to re-enter legally.""We have a law. You're supposed to come in legally. I would get people out and I would have an expedited way of getting 'em back into the country so they can be legal,"" Trump told CNN's Dana Bash in July 2015.A month later, Trump said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that while those ""good ones"" could come back in through an ""expedited"" process, they must first be deported.""They have to go,"" Trump has said repeatedly on the trail. ""We either have a country or we don't have a country.""2016 candidate matchmakerTrump pressed on with his commitment to this plan at hundreds of rallies where his supporters frequently cited Trump's hardline stance on immigration as the rallying cry that drew them to Trump's unconventional candidacy.Trump continued to rise in the polls and -- despite repeated questions from the media about the financial cost of his plan and the need to deport immigrants whom he vowed to allow back into the country -- stuck to his controversial plan. ""We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way,"" Trump said in September on ""60 Minutes"" discussing how he would implement the deportation plan. ""And by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice. But not everything is nice.""In November, Trump explained he would deploy a ""deportation force"" to carry out his plans to detain and eject millions of people from the US and cited President Dwight Eisenhower's injection of manpower and funding to deport undocumented immigrants in 1954.Building the wallIf there's one illegal immigration prescription for which Trump has unwaveringly stood by, it's his pledge to build a wall on the southern border.While Trump has since specified that the wall would not stretch through areas of the border that already have natural borders, Trump has stuck by his promise, which has become a rallying cry at virtually all of his rallies.""And who's going to pay for the wall?"" Trump regularly asks his supporters at campaign rallies, to which the crowds respond, ""Mexico!""Donald Trump's reset: Can it last?Trump even forced a change in the Republican Party's official platform to call for the building of a physical wall along the border with Mexico.""That is why we support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry. The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic,"" the official GOP platform now reads.Trump, who earned the endorsement of the union representing about 16,500 border patrol agents, the Border Patrol Council, has also vowed to boost funding and resources to enforcement activities at the southern border. Trump has also vowed his wall will include ""a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall"" to allow immigrants to come into the US legally.Signs of changeWhile Trump remains stalwart in his promise to build the border wall and continues to decry the crimes committed by some undocumented immigrants living in the US, Trump has tweaked his rhetoric since becoming the Republican nominee -- suggesting potential changes to his deportation policy.In a June interview with Bloomberg, Trump rejected the characterization of his deportation plan as ""mass deportations.""""I would not call it mass deportations,"" Trump said, without hinting at whether he was rejecting the terminology or the policy.Instead, he added, ""We're going to get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here ... that I can tell you.""The inklings of change on that issue came just as Trump began to pivot away from his proposed blanket ban on Muslims entering the country. The billionaire has yet to refute that policy but has instead pushed for banning people from countries with heavy terrorist activity and where the US government cannot adequately vet visa applicants.O'Malley to Lewandowski: US isn't an 'only-for-white Americans sort of country'Trump was set to deliver a major speech on illegal immigration this week, but his campaign decided to postpone the address as it continues to craft its policy and the language to deliver it.Trump met Saturday with an advisory group of Hispanic supporters -- including businesspeople, politicians and community leaders -- and emerged vowing to ""come up with a fair but firm process"" for addressing the issue of about 11 million undocumented immigrants residing in the US. Trump even pointed Monday night on Fox News to the deportations of undocumented immigrants under both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama and said ""I'm gonna do the same thing,"" which, if true, would leave hardline anti-illegal immigration activists who have supported Trump thoroughly disappointed.Asked Sunday whether Trump was changing his mind on establishing a deportation force to round up the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the US, Conway, Trump's new campaign manager, responded simply, ""To be determined."""

The spike in rent, which was first reported by The Huffington Post, is a result of the campaign adding two more levels to its existing space, the campaign said Tuesday.""We calculated the rent based on the average rent per square foot in the area,"" the campaign said in a statement provided to CNN. ""Overall, we still pay over $40,000 less in rent than the Clinton campaign,"" the statement added. ""Also, Mr. Trump makes a personal contribution of $2 million per month to the campaign, obviously a much higher amount than rent."" Clinton's campaign is paying about $212,000 a month, according to the Huffington Post, in rent for its 80,000 square feet of office space in Brooklyn. Steven Cheung, Trump's director of rapid response, also told the Associated Press the ""expansion is in anticipation of more staff."" Nevertheless, Hillary Clinton's campaign pounced on the reports of larger rent payments. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said Tuesday that Trump ""has highly unusual expenditures, even in this campaign.""The 172 employees paid by the Trump campaign last month is dwarfed by the more than 700 paid staff on Clinton's campaign.""So, as an example, Donald Trump is renting space in one of his buildings to his campaign and the campaign is paying Donald Trump personally for the space,"" Kaine said during a roundtable in Lakewood, Colorado. ""Once he started to fundraise dramatically, he was self-funding for a while, but once he started to fundraise dramatically, he immediately tripled the rent payment that his campaign donors were paying him personally."" It isn't the first time that Trump's campaign has appeared to be working in concert with his business interests. Federal records have shown that Trump had directed almost a fifth of his campaign cash to companies to which he is linked.

Libertarian Gary Johnson gets 8% support, while Green Party candidate Jill Stein is backed by 3%. In a two-way race, Clinton leads Trump 55% to 36%. That's in line with other recent polling of Virginia conducted over a similar time frame (August 7-17 for the Roanoke poll). A Quinnipiac poll taken within the same stretch found Clinton leading by 12 points, 50%-38%, while Washington Post poll showed Clinton up 51% to 43%.Clinton performs better with her base than Trump in Virginia, as 91% of Democrats say they will vote for her, compared to 78% of Republicans who say they'll vote for Trump. Clinton's numbers have improved since May, while Trump's have declined over the same period. The former Secretary of State is winning Independents 43% to 25%. Clinton has also seen her favorable rating increase, though she still remains underwater -- 39% now say they have a favorable opinion of the Democratic nominee, and 45% say they view her unfavorably (up from 35%-50% in May). Trump, on the other hand, has seen his favorable rating remain at 23%, while the percentage of those saying they view him unfavorably grew from 56% in May to 63%.Additionally, Clinton leads Trump on a range of top election issues according to the poll -- likely Virginia voters give her the edge on the economy, terrorism, health care, and immigration, and she has nearly 40-point advantages on race relations and foreign policy. The Roanoke poll also surveyed likely voters on Clinton's VP pick, Tim Kaine, who served as governor of Virginia before winning one of the state's U.S. Senate seats. Fifty-two percent said they had a favorable opinion of Kaine, up big from 32% in January -- and well ahead of Trump's VP pick Mike Pence, who has a favorable rating of 24%, while 40% say they don't know enough to have an opinion.The Roanoke College poll was conducted between August 7 and 17, and sampled 803 likely Virginia voters.
