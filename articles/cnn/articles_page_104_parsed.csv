But Democrats, not surprisingly, were mum Friday. According to Tom Matzzie and Paul Begala, two Democratic consultants advising the 2008 polling effort by Progressive Media USA, it was simply an effort to test Obama's vulnerabilities in a potential general election against John McCain.Begala and Matzzie told CNN that the group also tested arguments against Clinton, a claim that is backed up by a separate hacked email available on WikiLeaks as Document ID 2187.""This is Campaigning 101,"" said Matzzie, an Obama supporter in 2008 who was the president and executive director of Progressive Media USA. ""You test the vulnerabilities of your candidate -- something (Republicans) should have done for Donald Trump.""The emails were published by WikiLeaks, which has now posted roughly 10,000 emails hacked from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Clinton's campaign has not confirmed the content or veracity of the emails. ""We're still not confirming whether or not any of the WikiLeaks documents are authentic and are therefore not commenting on their content,"" Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said.In a January 9, 2008, email to Podesta, Begala, Matzzie and two others, an analyst at Stan Greenberg's Democratic polling firm proposed asking voters for their reaction to 15 potential Obama vulnerabilities.The list of anti-Obama arguments included this one about the faith of Obama's father: ""Obama (owe-BAHM-uh)'s father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world's most populous Islamic country,"" an apparent reference to Obama's time in Indonesia.  Twelve percent of the poll respondents in 10 battleground states at the time thought that Obama's father being a Muslim and Obama growing up around Muslims was one of the top two reasons to vote against Obama.Progressive Media found that the most effective Republican argument against Obama was the notion that Obama favored raising taxes by ""$2 trillion."" Twenty-one percent of poll respondents said that the tax argument was one of the best reasons to vote against Obama.Matzzie said that the polling project developed over a two-month period. Originally, it was going to test John Edwards in addition to Clinton and Obama, but he was dropped after he failed to win the Iowa caucuses and his chances at the nomination evaporated.""It was pretty obvious Obama was going to be the nominee,"" Matzzie said. ""It was more important to understand attacks on him than it was two months earlier.""Begala, who is now a CNN political commentator and an adviser to Priorities USA, a pro- Clinton super PAC, tells CNN that this email was labeled ""McCain survey"" because ""it was designed to test attacks that might come in the general election.""Begala was hired by Progressive Media USA to advise the group.""We could not coordinate with either campaign, and worked to prepare to defend either candidate in the general election,"" wrote Begala in an email to CNN. ""Our entire focus was the general election. Both Obama and Clinton supporters were, at the time, concerned the eventual nominee would emerge wounded and vulnerable for the general election.""The group disbanded after the nomination fight was settled because Obama publicly urged his supporters to give money directly to his campaign not to independent political committees. Progressive Media USA received funding from George Soros, Steve Bing, the Service Employees International Union and others.In addition to gauging voter reactions to the Muslim faith of Obama's father, the polling team also proposed testing that Obama had described his former cocaine use as using ""a little blow."" The group also tested Obama's support for driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, his stance on gay adoption, and his 2007 decision to stop wearing an American flag pin.The group tested multiple potential Republican arguments against Clinton including that she ""flip-flopped"" on driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, that she ""pandered to anti-war radicals"" by cutting off emergency funds for the Iraq War and that she has taken ""more money from lobbyists and special interests than any other candidate.""""We were trying to simulate an election against McCain,"" Matzzie said. ""If you don't include negative questions about your own candidates in the polling, the research is worthless because no real election is like that."""

Stephens ordered voter registration to be extended until Wednesday in the 36 counties receiving assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Kellie Myers, an administrator for the state's 10th judicial district, told CNN.The North Carolina Democratic Party filed a lawsuit earlier Friday in Superior Court requesting an immediate hearing on the matter, Myers said.The original deadline was 5 p.m. ET on Friday. Voter registration in the rest of the state ended Friday as scheduled.""Our agency appreciates Judge Stephens' thoughtful consideration of this matter and will fully comply with his order,"" Kim Westbrook Strach, the executive director of the state's board of elections, said in a statement.At least 22 residents died in the state as major rivers hovered above flood stage in the storm's aftermath.A federal judge also agreed this week to extend voting registration in Florida until October 18 because of the impact of Hurricane Matthew."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/donald-trump-women-accuser/index.html	"(CNN) â€” Two additional women on Friday stepped forward to accuse Donald Trump of sexually assaulting them, the latest revelations to rock the GOP nominee's campaign.One woman alleged that Trump slid his fingers under her skirt in the early 1990s. Another, a former ""Apprentice"" contestant, said Trump grabbed her breast and kissed her aggressively in 2007.Kristin Anderson and Summer Zervos told their accounts separately.Anderson, now a 46-year-old photographer living in California, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she was sitting with friends at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s when suddenly a man put his hand up her skirt. Moments afterward, she said she recognized the man to be Trump. The two had not spoken or met before the incident occurred, Anderson said.She first made the allegations to The Washington Post, which reported her claim that Trump touched her vagina.""He just stuck his hand up my skirt. We just went off the rest of our night,"" Anderson said. ""I pushed him off and I moved away and I sort of didn't ponder it for that long ... He's (denying it) and there are a ton of women saying yes, and more will come out.""When asked if she thought it was assault by Trump at the time, she said no.""No, I didn't think of it that way, no. But assault in my mind meant something else. Hitting is assault. I was very unaware of mental abuse, manipulation, bullying, that is just straight-up bullying.""""Here's a man who thinks he can do whatever he wants. And deny it. And get away with it,"" she added.Zervos claims Trump kissed her twice on the lips during a lunch meeting in his New York City office. On a separate occasion in Beverly Hills, she alleges he kissed her aggressively and touched her breast.She later pursued a job within the Trump Organization and says Trump asked her to stop calling him.The former ""Apprentice"" contestant shared her story in a press conference that was organized by her lawyer Gloria Allred, a women's rights attorney and activist who has represented other women in high-profile sexual assault cases.CNN has not yet independently verified Anderson or Zervos' accounts. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement Anderson's account is a ""total fabrication."" ""It is illogical and nonsensical to think Donald Trump was alone in a nightclub in Manhattan and that the alleged incident and recognition of Mr. Trump went unnoticed by both the woman involved and anyone else in this 'crowded' venue."" Hicks also questioned the timing of Anderson's allegations.""Further, why is this just coming out now? She described the allegation as being 'inconsequential at the time,' but why then wasn't it consequential when Mr. Trump announced for President, or when he won the primary, or when he headlined the convention -- why is it just now, three weeks before election day, consequential? The answer is that this is clearly a political attack designed to tear down Mr. Trump.""Trump disputed Anderson's claim at a rally on Friday, calling her account ""nonsense"" and ""false,"" arguing that he rarely sits alone, even though Anderson never claimed Trump was sitting alone at the time of the incident.""I was sitting alone by myself and then I went wah to somebody,"" Trump said, motioning to his side as he attempted to re-enact Anderson's account of his behavior.Trump later responded to Zervos in a statement Friday, saying he ""vaguely"" remembered her.""When Gloria Allred is given the same weighting on national television as the president of the United States, and unfounded accusations are treated as fact, with reporters throwing due diligence and fact-finding to the side in a rush to file their stories first, it's evident that we truly are living in a broken system,"" Trump said.RELATED: Obama's simple Trump rebuff: 'Come on, man'The denial of Anderson's claim is similar to ones the Trump campaign has offered this week as other women have come forward this week to accuse Trump of kissing or groping them without their consent. CNN has not independently verified any of these allegations. The allegations, which have rocked Trump's presidential campaign, emerged days after audio of a lewd conversation in which Trump bragged in 2005 about kissing and groping women surfaced last Friday. Trump apologized for the words, but insisted in the second presidential debate Sunday that he never sexually assaulted women in the way he boasted about on tape in 2005. The women who have leveled allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump this week have all said the publication of the 2005 tape and Trump's denial in Sunday's debate prompted them to come forward.RELATED: Michelle Obama: The Clinton surrogate that could finish off Trump""A girlfriend of mine told me about (the video),"" Anderson told CNN, adding, ""I watched the video and I thought, 'That's horrifying.'"" Anderson's allegation is similar to the story of Jessica Leeds, who told Cooper -- as well as The New York Times in a story published Wednesday -- that Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt during a flight in the early 1980s.Zervos said Trump ""grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me again very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast"" during an encounter in Beverly Hills, when she met with him in 2007.She continued, ""I pulled back and walked to another part of the room. He then walked up, grabbed my hand, and then walked me into the bedroom. I walked out. He then turned me around and said, 'Let's lay down and watch some telly telly.' He put me in an embrace and I tried to push him away. I pushed his chest to put space between us. I said, 'Come on man get real' ... He repeated my words back to me, 'Get real,' as he began thrusting his genitals.""She was a former contestant of season 5 of ""The Apprentice"" and continued to see Trump as a ""possible mentor"" after she was ""fired"" from the show.Trump denied these claims in his statement and said Zervos had contacted him as recently as April.""To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I've conducted my life. In fact, Ms. Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on April 14th of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California,"" Trump said. Later Friday, the Trump campaign released what it said was the April 14 email, in which Zervos purportedly writes that she is ""the only former Apprentice who operates a business where Mr. Trump's supporters can walk in, express their admiration for him and inquire about my experience ... We hire a diverse crew and embrace anyone who is honest while working hard. Mr. Trump is cut from the same cloth.""The Trump campaign also released a statement from a man identifying himself as first cousin of Zervos. The man, John Barry of Mission Viejo, California, was quoted by the campaign as saying, ""Ever since she (Zervos) was on ""The Apprentice"" she has had nothing but glowing things to say about Mr. Trump"" and ""converted her friends and our family to become Trump supporters.""That was followed by a statement from Allred that described John Barry as ""a huge Trump supporter"" and a former employee at Zervos' restaurant who has ""expressed hostility and ill will toward Summer.""Allred said also that three people corroborated that Zervos had told them in the past ""what she alleges Mr. Trump did to her.""The news conference was the first time Zervos has spoken to the press about her allegations against Trump. Allred said that she's been contacted by more women accusing Trump of sexual advances.""Many more women have contacted me. Will they be coming forward? I can't answer this question at this time,"" Allred said.A People Magazine reporter wrote a story alleging Trump began kissing her without her consent in 2005 when the two were alone for an interview at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She was reporting an article on his one-year wedding anniversary to his wife, Melania.Trump has forcefully denied all of these allegations and has argued that they are part of a conspiratorial effort to sink his campaign."	2 additional women accuse Trump of sexual assault	['Cooper', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""What he has made clear is that was talk, regrettable talk on his part, but that there were no actions and that he categorically denied these latest unsubstantiated allegations.""""Just stay tuned, I know that there is more information that is going to be coming out that will back his claims that this is all categorically false,"" the Republican vice presidential hopeful said. Pence made a similar claim in another interview Friday morning on ""Fox and Friends.""""He's categorically denied these, and there will be more evidence coming out that supports, you know, his position on this,"" Pence told Fox News.""What evidence is coming out?"" host Ainsley Earhardt asked.""Well, the campaign is working on bringing that information out,"" Pence responded.Though he repeatedly declined to share that information, Pence pressed the case throughout the morning interviews that the allegations against Trump -- a spate of which have emerged in media reports this week -- are a false attempt to smear Trump and help the Clinton campaign. ""We are simply not going to allow the slander and lies emerging from the Clinton political machine -- and being propagated in the media -- to distract from the real issues affecting the American people,"" Pence said on CBS.On Fox, he repeated the charge. ""The American people see all of this effort by many in the national media to distract from the failed policies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.""Trump has denied all the claims against him. They have not been independently confirmed by CNN.Asked if there was a ""red line"" Trump could cross that might cause him to leave the Republican ticket, Pence demurred. ""We're in this campaign and we're in it to win,"" he said.Pence then praised Trump's performance in the second presidential debate, saying Trump showed ""humility"" and ""heart"" and ""focused that national presidential debate on the issues that really affect the American people at home and abroad.""Pence also lightly criticized his former colleague, current House Speaker Paul Ryan, for his public break with Trump after the release of the controversial ""Access Hollywood"" tape featuring Trump talking about women in sexually aggressive terms. ""Paul Ryan is my friend, but honestly, I would like to see Republican leaders supporting the Republican nominee for president of the United States,"" Pence said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""What's encouraging to me is despite the fact that some Republicans have decided to go in a different direction, the overwhelming majority of leaders and Republicans are standing with Donald Trump as the next president of the United States.""And on ""CBS This Morning,"" the governor forcefully responded to a question about Russia's suspected role in recent political hacks, highlighted by WikiLeaks, that have roiled the 2016 election -- and which his running mate has downplayed, prompting criticism. ""Oh, I've condemned Russia for any potential involvement or compromise of the cybersecurity of this country, whatever their motivations are. But candidly, the involvement of any foreign government in American politics should be troubling to the American people."""

""Some of you have inquired about a book interview in which I was asked how I felt about Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players who refused to stand for the national anthem,"" Ginsburg said. ""Barely aware of the incident or its purpose, my comments were inappropriately dismissive and harsh. I should have declined to respond."" Kaepernick and other athletes at all levels have been refusing to stand for national anthem to protest racial injustice and police violence against African-Americans.Friday marks the second time in recent months the 83-year-old Ginsburg has issued a statement regretting comments she made to reporters. Last July, Ginsburg issued a statement saying she regretted remarks she made to CNN and other news outlets criticizing presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. In an interview with Joan Biskupic, CNN's legal analyst and Supreme Court biographer, Ginsburg had extensively criticized Trump as a"" faker."" ""On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised and I regret making them,"" Ginsburg said then. ""Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future, I will be more circumspect.""        Of Kaepernick, Ginsburg told Couric, ""I think it's a terrible thing to do, but I wouldn't lock a person up for doing it. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act."" Kaepernick, said Tuesday it was ""disappointing to hear a Supreme Court justice call a protest against injustices and oppression 'stupid, dumb.'""""I was reading an article and it refers to white critique of black protests and how they try to de-legitimize it by calling it 'idiotic, dumb, stupid,' things of that nature, so they can sidestep the real issue,"" he told reporters Tuesday, according to the San Jose Mercury News. ""As I was reading that I saw more and more truth how this has been approached by people in power and white people in power in particular.""Her comments surprised some of her legions of fans who have dubbed the justice ""the Notorious RBG"" for her work on the Supreme Court on issues such as gender discrimination, gay marriage, abortion and affirmative action. After the interview with Couric, the authors of the ""Notorious R.B.G Tumblr,"" a site dedicated to Ginsburg, posted  a comment saying they ""respectfully"" disagreed with her remarks regarding athletes' ""peaceful protest.""It is rare for a member of the court to issue a statement of regret, and it comes as Ginsburg launches a book tour for ""My Own Words"" a collection of her speeches and opinions."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/yemen-us-role-in-war/index.html	The latest twist comes in Yemen, where this week a USS warship launched Tomahawk cruise missiles into Yemen.According to a Pentagon spokesperson, the missiles targeted radar sites in Houthi-held territory, sites the US claims were being used to launch missiles toward a different American warship (the USS Mason) in two separate incidents earlier this week. Neither incident caused any damage, according to the Pentagon, as the missiles fell into the water.Independent verification is hard to come by in the Yemeni war. It's unclear who, if anyone, fired the missiles from Yemeni soil. The Houthis strongly reject the accusations, saying that they didn't fire any missiles at US warships. They claim the entire episode is meant as a distraction, to draw attention away from the horrible toll the war is taking on innocent civilians.  According to the UN, an average of 13 Yemeni civilians are killed every day by Saudi-led airstrikes. In the most recent example, a double-tap airstrike killed more than 150 people and injured hundreds more who had gathered at a funeral service.The lack of independent, verifiable information notwithstanding, the US airstrikes still are a significant development. It marks the first time the US has directly targeted and attacked sites inside Yemeni territory using its own missiles from its own warships.It effectively makes the United States an active combatant in the war. The US had until now limited its role to providing intelligence, coordination and logistics to the Saudi-backed bombing campaign, plus providing airborne fueling tankers to enable Saudi jets to refuel in mid-air. Since the war began, the United States also has agreed to sell Saudi Arabia more than $22 billion worth of weapons, some specifically earmarked to replace those that have already been dropped on Yemen.Until now, Yemen has effectively been the Middle East's second biggest proxy war (with Syria being the first), pitting Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries against Yemen's Houthi minority and its Iranian backers.  READ: Yemen, the forgotten warNow that the US is directly involved, it raises some difficult questions: Does this mark a turning point, with the US prepared to take on a more active, long-term combat role? How will it affect its relationship with the Saudis, after the State Department recently implied it would cut off funding if the Saudis didn't take stronger measures to avoid civilian deaths?What happens if Iranian ships are targeted in international waters, and they choose to retaliate in the same fashion?  If the US pretext for launching missiles strikes into Yemen was on the grounds that it was an act of self-defense, could that provide a justification for Iran to do the same? All of these are troubling prospects. 	Analysis: US missiles just made the war in Yemen even more complicated	[]	[]

""We know that Hillary Clinton is the worst, most horrifying and certainly lethal poison known to man. If we vote for Hillary Clinton, we will die in excruciating agony.""""With Donald Trump, we know we're going to get shot. We just don't know where.""Less than one month out, Thatcher is undecided.The struggle to accept Trump as the leader of the Republican Party is no more challenging anywhere in America than it is here, where roughly 60% of Utahns are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.For so many, Trump offends their moral compass. Hillary Clinton offends their political compass. They are each, at the same time, the worst person in the world.""He represents the 1980s ethos of materialism and greed; he is vulgar,"" said a high-ranking Republican staffer who requested anonymity because he works for many elected officials and didn't want to be seen as speaking for them. ""He's filled with self-centered pride, which is modern-day idol worshiping.""Everything he does is the antithesis of being Mormon.""Institutions line up against TrumpNowhere in the nation does voters' distaste for both candidates feel as palpable. Voter registration tilts three-to-one in favor of Republicans. Still, the Salt Lake City Tribune endorsed Clinton.Meanwhile, The Deseret News, a newspaper owned by the LDS church, called for Trump to drop out of the race, adding that it does ""not believe Trump holds the ideals and values of this community.""The church strongly denies that the paper's op-ed is the official position of the institution, which remains neutral in political elections, but the message was clear: Mormons might want to think twice about the foul-mouthed real estate mogul.Utah hasn't voted a Democrat into the White House since 1964, and yet, the Democrat this year is tied for the lead here. Barely half of all voters say they'll vote for either of the major party candidates.The Kim Jong Un of American politicsA few miles up Route 15 in the quiet hills above the suburb of Bountiful, David Irvine is moving into his condo.""Donald Trump strikes me as the Kim Jong Un of American politics,"" the 73-year-old attorney said. ""He's volatile, he's temperamental, he is not capable of controlling anger. In that position (president), those seem to me to be vital characteristics.""Irvine looks like a sophomore-year political science professor. His bow tie suits him. He is a lifelong Republican and was once upon a time a county GOP chairman and state lawmaker.For Irvine, morality trumps politics -- so Clinton trumps Trump.It's not just Trump's personality that irks the lifelong Utah resident, but the cornerstone position of Trump's campaign -- his hardline stance on immigration -- is a belief that offends Irvine's Mormon heritage.""The history of Mormons in Utah is one of persecution, one of being hunted down,"" he said. ""That's a long, tragic story.""""There are a lot of people in Utah who are members of the Mormon faith, the Mormon Church, who are undocumented immigrants from who knows where. When Mr. Trump says, 'Deport them all. Build a wall. Tear up families. Kick them out. They're all criminals. They're all rapists. They're terrible, terrible people,' that's a really broad brush that I think most members of the Mormon Church, and many, many other faiths, find to be terribly, terribly offensive.""Morality vs. politicsWho is to say whether moral judgments should take precedence over political ones, or vice-versa? It's two faiths competing. Neither is remotely unimportant; neither can be dismissed.""The church's own scripture, and teachings from the church leaders would suggest that one of the things that's paramount to consider when you are choosing a candidate is their morality -- their personal morality -- their level of honesty; that they need to be a good person, a good human being,"" said Quin Monson, a political science professor at Brigham Young University in Provo.Monson isn't just a professor -- he's Mormon and has voted for Republicans his entire life, a streak that will end on November 8.""Every time (Trump) chooses to interact publicly, he almost can't help but interact in a way that I think many Mormons, if not most Mormons, would find troubling and antithetical or opposite of who they are, who they are at least taught to be,"" he said.Monson will vote for Clinton or for third-party candidate Evan McMullin, who is surging in the polls here, but who is on the ballot in less than a dozen states.""I'm more confident than ever before that Donald Trump will lose Utah,"" Monson said.'I am not electing an ecclesiastical leader'Kathleen Anderson lives a bit further up in the Bountiful hills from David Irvine. A lifelong Republican as well, she's the president of the Utah Federation of Republican Women.Unlike Irvine, she has a Trump yard sign -- a new one because the first was vandalized with spray paint.Anderson's family converted to the LDS church when she was seven years old, and she calls it ""a good fit"" for her. She's more forgiving of Trump's style and moral compass than other Mormons.""Donald Trump probably does not espouse all of my values,"" she said. ""However, I am not electing an ecclesiastical leader at this point. I'm electing a leader for this country who can right policies that have gone astray.""Anderson knows other members of her faith are morally repulsed by Trump.""Some people might find him vulgar, offensive, greedy. Many other qualities that are reprehensible.""But, she said, ""I think to hold everyone to the same standard is incorrect and unfair. I was most likely raised with a different set of values than Donald Trump was.""""When we make a mistake, we very much want other people to grant us mercy, or grace, or forgiveness,"" Anderson said. ""When they do, we are so appreciative of that. Yet, it is so easy, it appears, for people to not extend that same grace or mercy, or forgiveness, to someone else who has made a mistake. Rather, we pass this judgment, and I don't think that judgment is always fair.""The agonyBack at the state capitol, Thatcher sounds like he is already in excruciating agony.""Voting for Hillary Clinton, to my mind, is morally repugnant,"" he said. ""Voting for Donald Trump, in my mind, is morally repugnant. And I am still not sure which one's worse.""But will Trump hold off Clinton and win?""50-50,"" he said."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/vulnerable-republicans-2016-election/index.html	"Collapsing under the weight of his past behavior, the Republican nominee's campaign is going out with a flash bang, sending shock waves across the political galaxy.Republican concerns now center on whether his fiery explosion will leave behind a black hole -- dragging the party's top leaders and aspiring stars into a post-Trump oblivion. RELATED: Obama's been thinking about outer space, tooHere are eight Trump allies and boosters at risk of seeing their future plans erased and legacies tarnished by the collapsing candidate:1. Texas Sen. Ted CruzIn a parallel universe, Ted Cruz can be seen teeing up a 2020 run under the banner of the GOP's loyal opposition. Trump had trashed his wife and taunted his father, suggesting Rafael Cruz was pals with JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. An endorsement seemed rather unlikely. Trump said as much.Cruz, too, seemed to reject the idea out of hand, first calling Trump ""utterly amoral,"" then, after refusing to back the nominee this summer, by telling the Texas delegation at the Republican National Convention he would not ""come (to Trump) as a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'""But the gravitational pull -- toward power and a candidate rising in the polls -- was too strong. On Sept. 23, days before the first presidential debate, Cruz announced that after ""many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience,"" he would back Trump. Trump promptly plummeted in the polls as his campaign became consumed by a deluge of disturbing scandals. Cruz considered rescinding his endorsement, but didn't.2. House Speaker Paul RyanThe most powerful elected Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, has painted himself as a most reluctant endorser.He withheld his backing for months, finally bowing in June. But Trump would soon be consumed with the controversy surrounding his  attack on an American judge of Mexican descent. Ryan described the nominee's words as the ""textbook definition of a racist comment.""But the endorsement remained, both as a means of protecting and appeasing his down ballot Republicans colleagues. Even now, with Trump mired in accusations of sexual assault after being heard bragging about similar actions in a 2005 video, Ryan remains onboard -- even as he refuses to further defend Trump and tells his members to ""do what's best for you and your district.""For Democrats faced with a Ryan presidential run, the attack lines write themselves.3. RNC Chairman Reince PriebusWhat could have been! Reince Priebus entered the 2016 cycle one general election win away from leaving his post with Republicans running both chambers of Congress and the White House. He may walk away now, if current polls hold, as the overwhelmed ""Kenosha political operative"" who got caught flat-footed as the Trump Train barreled over his party and plans for a more inclusive GOP.For nearly 16 months, Priebus has sought to manage and moderate Trump. He even got him to sign a loyalty pledge. But the party apparatus was fundamentally unprepared to cope with Trump -- or his appeal to a constituency that had, with the chairman's apparent blessing, been served so much red meat for so long that it could hardly be faulted for demanding an even bloodier cut.4. GOP VP nominee and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Pence's vice presidential debate performance went down well with Republicans, who briefly recalled the benefits of supporting a more traditional candidate. Then came the tape -- and Pence's opportunity to bail. Instead, the Indiana governor put out a harshly worded statement, said he was praying for Trump and his family, and dropped off the radar, emerging again a day later to renew his vows to the nominee.Pence has described himself as a ""Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,"" but history will recall another loyalty -- to Trump.5.  Texas Land Commissioner George P. BushThe son of Jeb Bush, George P. was elected Texas land commissioner in 2014 -- a stepping stone, many believe, to higher office.  But his decision this summer to endorse Trump -- who built his campaign first on defaming Mexican immigrants like Bush's mother, Columba, and then on humiliating his ""low energy"" father during the primary debates -- will raise serious questions going forward.So what made him think it was a good idea? In a bit of cosmic irony, one report suggested Bush, who didn't endorse until after the GOP convention, was taken by the reaction to Cruz's refusal to endorse Trump at the RNC. 6. New Jersey Gov. Chris ChristieBridge scandal issues notwithstanding, Christie's background and reputation as a federal prosecutor earned him a place on any Republican president's shortlist for US attorney general.But rather than holding off until 2020, when he could launch another White House run and further build his national credentials, Christie became one of the first establishment figures to join forces with Trump.For his trouble, the increasingly unpopular New Jersey governor has been publicly mocked by his new boss and made himself radioactive as a future political appointee. Even as he made it clear earlier this week that he had no interest in defending Trump's comments about women or his attacks on Bill Clinton, Christie again pledged his loyalty.7. Florida Attorney General Pam BondiThe twice-elected Florida attorney general is a prolific fundraiser who was touted as a potential gubernatorial candidate in 2018. She ruled out that run, but was generally regarded as a ""rising conservative star"" with a toehold in one of the country's swing states. But soon after hitching her star to Trump, Bondi's political operation came under scrutiny for accepting donations from the real estate magnate while it considered -- and ultimately decided against -- bringing a case against his Trump University.Florida is an interesting place, so Bondi's Trump connection is hardly a death knell, but any future endeavors will be met with an implicit layer of suspicion.8. Former New York City Mayor Rudy GiulianiRemember ""America's Mayor""?Rudy Giuliani refashioned himself into a national security guru after 9/11, a badge he mostly maintained through scandal and a failed presidential campaign in 2008.But his time on the stump with Trump has brought out the former New York City mayor's dark side -- culminating in a series of pained and painful appearances in which he sought to defend some of Trump's ugliest rhetoric.The attorney general's office might have been a possibility for Giuliani under President Trump, but those dreams are nearly dashed and his post-9/11 legacy, a longtime meal ticket, is at risk of being swallowed up by this fall's presidential implosion."	8 Republicans sent into distant orbit by Trump's 2016 odyssey	['Trump', 'Pence', 'Paul', 'Christie', 'Cruz']	[]

Peterson ruled from the bench Thursday but only posted an eight-page written order several hours later.The order comes after VoteRiders, a voting rights group, sent a volunteer to 10 different DMVs across the state and received inconsistent information from state officials about the requirements of the law including one who erroneously said that the legal situation is ""kind of up in the air right now.""RELATED: SCOTUS takes up 2002 civil rights lawsuit against high-ranking federal officialsWhile Peterson said he did not think he had the authority to suspend the law, he ordered the state to take several actions to train its officials and communicate the law's requirements to the public. The state, for example, is required to file a proposed one-page informational sheet by noon Friday that ""clearly and succinctly"" explains the process behind obtaining the voter credential. Officials must also revise the DMV website to better explain the process. Peterson said his order ""will provide reasonable assurance that those without an acceptable voting ID can get one without undue burden."" A spokesman from the state did not respond to an email requesting comment.

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/trump-women-accusers/index.html	"At the second presidential debate, CNN's Anderson Cooper posed a pointed question to Donald Trump in regards to the leaked 2005 Access Hollywood video that caught him saying of women that he felt entitled to ""grab them by the pussy.""""For the record, you're saying you never did that?"" Cooper asked.Trump, downplaying his remarks as ""locker room talk,"" denied he had ever kissed or groped women without consent. ""No one has more respect for women than I do,"" he added.His denial, though, has opened the floodgates for women who are now accusing him of sexual harassment spanning from groping on planes to unwanted advances in the Trump Tower. The presidential candidate has strongly denied wrongdoing, going so far as to threaten lawsuits against media outlets who published new claims. For some of the women, they felt compelled to speak out against Trump after hearing him tell Cooper that he had not groped women without their consent. Here's what they have said so far:Jessica LeedsWhen it allegedly happened: Around 1980Where it allegedly happened: On a planeWhat she said: Jessica Leeds, a 74-year-old Manhattan resident, told The New York Times that Trump inappropriately touched her ""like an octopus"" during a flight from Connecticut to New York. According to Leeds, a flight attendant upgraded her to first-class, escorting her to an open seat next to Trump. Once they were airborne, Trump raised the seat divider, grabbed her chest, and attempted to move one of his hands up her skirt, she said.What Trump said: Trump told a the Times reporter asking about the incident that ""none of this ever took place"" before calling her a ""disgusting human being."" One of his attorneys Tuesday morning demanded an immediate retraction and an apology from the paper. High-ranking sources in the Trump campaign tell CNN's Brian Stelter and Dylan Byers the campaign has started drafting a lawsuit.Mindy McGillivrayWhen it allegedly happened: 2003Where it allegedly happened: The Mar-a-Lago ClubWhat she said: Mindy McGillivray, a 36-year-old Palm Springs, Florida, resident, told the Palm Beach Post that Trump groped her 13 years ago when she was assisting a photographer hired to work a concert at the club.  ""This was a pretty good nudge. More of a grab,'' she said. ""It was pretty close to the center of my butt. I was startled. I jumped.'' What Trump said: Like with the New York Times, Trump campaign sources have told CNN's Brian Stelter and Dylan Byers the campaign is drafting a lawsuit against the Florida newspaper.Rachel CrooksWhen it allegedly happened: 2005Where it allegedly happened: Outside a Trump Tower elevatorWhat she said: Eleven years ago, Bayrock Group receptionist Rachel Crooks greeted Trump outside a elevator in the building where they both worked. She said she attempted to be cordial to one of her company's business partners. But after saying hello and shaking hands, she claims Trump kissed her on her cheeks and then on the mouth. ""It was so inappropriate,"" she told the New York Times. ""I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.""What Trump said: Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, called The New York Times article ""fiction"" on Wednesday night. ""For the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,"" Miller said in a statement, which reacted to both claims. ""To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election.""Natasha StoynoffWhen it allegedly happened: 2005 Where it allegedly happened: The Mar-a-Lago ClubWhat she said: During an assignment to cover Trump's one-year wedding anniversary to his wife, Melania, People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff claims the now-presidential candidate pushed her against a wall, started ""forcing his tongue"" down her throat, and physically attacked her during a tour of the place. ""Now, I'm a tall, strapping girl who grew up wrestling two giant brothers. I even once sparred with Mike Tyson. It takes a lot to push me. But Trump is much bigger -- a looming figure -- and he was fast, taking me by surprise and throwing me off balance,"" she wrote. What Trump said: Trump's campaign, which has not responded to CNN's request for comment, told People that the incident never happened. ""There is no merit or veracity to this fabricated story,"" a spokeswoman said.AnonymousWhen it allegedly happened: 2010Where it allegedly happened: Trump Tower What she said: According to CNN's Erin Burnett, Trump suggested her friend, who was with him in a Trump Tower boardroom, take some Tic Tacs. Then he leaned in to kiss her on the lips, which caught her off guard. ""I was really freaked out,"" the woman later told Burnett. After that, Trump invited her into his office alone. He told the woman she was ""special"" and proceeded to give her his cell phone number. ""I ran the hell out of there,"" the friend told Burnett.What Trump said: The Trump campaign has not responded to CNN's request for comment.Temple TaggartWhen it allegedly happened: 1997Where it allegedly happened: Shreveport, Louisiana and later at Trump TowerWhat she said: The former Miss Utah claims Trump gave her a non-consensual embrace and kissed her on the lips during a rehearsal for the Miss USA Pageant. The beauty contestant was 21 at the time, and Taggart says the behavior was repeated later during a meeting at Trump Tower. ""I felt awkward, and I just remember in my mind going, 'what does he think this is,'"" she told CNN's Burnett. ""Like, I'm thinking he's married. This is awkward for me. He's much older. This is not at all what I came here for. So, to me, it was like I hope he knows that I'm here for business. I'm not here for anything other than business."" What Trump said: ""I don't even know who she is,"" Trump told NBC News. ""She claims this took place in a public area. I never kissed her. I emphatically deny this ridiculous claim.""Kristin AndersonWhen it allegedly happened: Early 1990sWhere it allegedly happened: A Manhattan nightclubWhat she said: Today Anderson is a photographer, but back then she was an aspiring model. She told the Washington Post she was sitting on a couch and talking to friends when, as the Washington Post describes it, ""his fingers slid under her miniskirt, moved up her inner thigh, and touched her vagina through her underwear."" She didn't know Trump, but says she recognized him instantly when she pulled away. CNN has not independently confirmed the claim.What Trump said: ""It is illogical and nonsensical to think Donald Trump was alone in a nightclub in Manhattan and that the alleged incident and recognition of Mr. Trump went unnoticed by both the woman involved and anyone else in this 'crowded' venue,'"" said Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, who said it was a ""political attack designed to take down Mr. Trump.""Summer ZervosWhen it allegedly happened: 2007Where it allegedly happened: The Beverly Hills HotelWhat she said: A former Apprentice contestant, Zervos said Trump first kissed her during a meeting in New York, but she was still interested in getting a job at The Trump Organization. She met Trump for dinner in Los Angeles and says that she was escorted into a room next to where he was getting dressed. Zervos claims he later kissed her ""very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast."" Zervos said she still had dinner with Trump and later called him to inquire about getting a job. She made the allegations during a press conference with the attorney Gloria Allred. CNN has not independently verified this claim.What Trump said: ""I vaguely remember Ms. Zervos as one of the many contestants on The Apprentice over the years,"" Trump said in a statement. ""To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I've conducted my life. In fact, Ms. Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on April 14th of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California.""Cathy HellerWhen it allegedly happened: 1997Where it allegedly happened: Trump's Mar-A-Lago ClubWhat she said: Heller, now 63, says she met Trump at Mar-a-Lago almost 20 years ago during a Mother's Day brunch, she told The Guardian newspaper. Heller said she had been introduced to Trump by her mother-in-law. She says Trump ""took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,"" without her consent. She said Trump held her in place and kissed her. The Guardian reported that it spoke to a friend who Heller told about the incident and a relative who witnessed part of it. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Heller's claims.What Trump said: Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump's campaign,  said in a statement there was ""no way"" Heller's account is true. ""The media has gone too far in making this false accusation,"" Miller said in a statement. ""There is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on Mother's Day at Mr. Trump's resort. It would have been the talk of Palm Beach for the past two decades. The reality is this: for the media to wheel out a politically motivated Democratic activist with a legal dispute against this same resort owned by Mr. Trump does a disservice to the public, and anyone covering this story should be embarrassed for elevating this bogus claim."" Jill HarthWhen it allegedly happened: 1992-1993Where it allegedly happened: A Manhattan nightclub and later at Trump's Mar-A-Lago ClubWhat she said: Harth and her then-boyfriend, George Houraney, entered into a business venture with Donald Trump which included holding an event at one of the real estate magnate's Atlantic City casinos. Donald Trump made unwanted sexual advances towards her, including groping her under her skirt on two differentÂ occasionsÂ in 1992 and 1993 during their initial meetings, according to Harth's lawyer, Lisa Bloom. What Trump said: Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement to CNN: ""Mr. Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth. These 24 year old allegations lack any merit or veracity, as evidenced by her repeated requests for employment, attempts to seek out Mr. Trump, and her support of Mr. Trump's candidacy.""Â  The Trump campaign has shared emails from Harth, the last one from January of this year, in which she thanks Trump and offers up her support for his presidential run.Â  Jessica DrakeWhen it allegedly happened: 2006Where it allegedly happened: In a hotel suite at a charity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, NevadaWhat she said: Drake, an adult film performer and director, What Trump said: The Trump campaign issued a statement that said in part: ""This story is totally false and ridiculous. The picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her. This is just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate who just today is number one in three different polls."""
