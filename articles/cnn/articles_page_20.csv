Most demonstrations have been peaceful but some led to arrests and incidents of violence.The advisory did not specifically mention Trump but said the unrest began after Tuesday's elections.""Sometimes the protests turn violent and criminal while protesters (are) detained by security forces,"" the ministry of foreign affairs said Saturday, adding that ""racists and xenophobic incidents increased in USA.""""Considering the risks, we advise our citizens living and traveling to US to follow local media, to follow the warning of our embassy in Washington and American security forces, to stay away from protests, to increase their security in work space and to apply to local security when there is a racist or xenophobic attack while keeping calm,"" the statement added.The President-elect initially dismissed the protestors on Twitter, calling them ""professionals"" incited by the media. He eventually called the demonstrators a ""small group"" with passion for America.

But, he told the Wall Street Journal, ""I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that.""In an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that aired later Friday, he specifically talked about the need to continue coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.""Yes, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets,"" Trump told Leslie Stahl. Trump also said he'd try to keep the measure that allows young people to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.""We're going to very much try to keep that. It adds cost but it's very much something we're going to try to keep,"" Trump said.   Trump's openness to compromising on Obamacare, however, was complicated Friday by a shift in the official positions listed on his website.The Washington Post reported that Trump has revised his health care agenda to steer it more in line with Republican Party orthodoxy.The paper said the presidential transition website has been edited to now include allowing health care workers to not perform acts that would violate their religious or moral beliefs and to ""protect innocent human life from conception to natural death.""The paper also said the website omits Trump's call to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from other countries where they are sold at lower prices.Prosecuting ClintonDuring the second presidential debate, Trump interrupted Hillary Clinton by threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate -- and convict -- the Democratic nominee over her use of a private email server.His campaign rallies were also marked by chants of ""Lock her up"" as supporters clamored for Trump to jail his opponent.Speaking to the Journal, however, Trump seemed to be less committed to the idea. ""It's not something I've given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform,"" he said.Earlier in the week, top Trump surrogates Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie also seemed to back away from the idea.Muslim banTrump drew outrage last year when he called for a ""shutdown"" of Muslim immigration to the US. He later amended the plan, calling for ""extreme vetting"" and a shutdown on immigration from countries compromised by terrorism, but he never refuted his original policy and in July called the new iteration of his plan an ""expansion"" of his original Muslim ban.Appearing on Capitol Hill Thursday to discuss his legislative agenda, Trump was asked by a reporter if he would ""ask Congress to ban all Muslims from entering the country.""Trump appeared to hear the question but walked away after thanking everybody."	Is Donald Trump already walking away from campaign promises?

Potential presidents needed their checks, their favor, their blessing. Republican and Democratic moneymen were minor celebrities and major kingmakers, coasting through 2014 and 2015 with full confidence that their already privileged positions in American society were about to grow even more advantaged.Their egos were shattered months ago. But it was Tuesday when their robes were stripped and powerlessness exposed.Take Michael Vlock.""Until you repudiate Trump, you have lost me,"" the Connecticut investor wrote to Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus in an email this past June, shared with CNN. ""The damage that Trump has done and continues to inflict on the party and its future is incalculable.""Priebus did indeed lose one of his most generous donors. No matter. Trump won the White House and Republicans held on to the House and Senate.Almost all players, Republican and Democrat, acknowledge that their dollars had a far more limited impact than they themselves had predicted at the campaign's starting gun. What has perplexed the nation's political financiers, according to more than a dozen interviews with leading players, is what 2016 has signaled — if anything — about the changing country. Some, including loyalists to Trump and Bernie Sanders, argue that they have crafted the new normal, pooh-poohing the rich as self-important and — in a painful indictment of the entire big-money world — proven to be powerless. A high-wattage, carefully cultivated super PAC? No need, they say. Have a real movement, and watch the money bloom eternal.The other train of thought — often from the spurned corps of professionals who have, at some point, been cast as the elite bogeymen: Trump is a self-financed, larger-than-life aberration that tells us next to nothing about how money will rule in the post-Trump era. Super PACs, attack ads and the luxury fundraising circuit? How the game is played — now and forever.High time to be a donorEven when aspiring candidates were being almost laughably coy about their presidential intentions in 2014 and 2015, there was one group of Americans with whom they could tell it straight: mega-donors.After all, this was now the second presidential cycle since the Supreme Court paved the way for billionaires to give seven- and eight-figure checks to affiliated super PACs. Candidates could thoroughly prepare to capitalize on the new rules — and they did. Behind the scenes, Republicans and Democrats carefully dispatched operatives to favored groups, which for the first time were enmeshed within their political infrastructure.Donors have always been literally the lifeblood of a campaign, but now, the thinking went, their opinions and checks were more consequential than ever, worrying good-government reformers. At ritzy private conclaves in Utah's Watasch Mountains, Florida's Atlantic coast and Southern California's Sonoran Desert, the hopefuls twisted arms and vied for hearts, knowing that the favor of any one man in the room could place them on a path to the most powerful job in the world.""There a bunch of Democrats who have taken as the talking points that the Koch brothers are the nexus of all evil in the world,"" bellowed Ted Cruz in January 2015, before a ballroom of Koch donors in that California resort. ""Let me be very clear: I think that is grotesque and offensive.""Cruz wasn't the favorite of the donors, however. It was someone who moved within their circles for decades, with a moderate vision, cool temperament and an insatiable drive to stockpile as much cash as humanly possible into his warchest: Jeb Bush.In order to execute what associates called a ""shock-and-awe"" fundraising drive, Bush spent the first half of 2015 promising that he wasn't an official candidate, allowing him to fundraise directly for the PAC that would raise $100 million in a six-month period.Bush, of course, lost. And the Right to Rise juggernaut has now emerged as the poster child for donors' impotence.""Money absolutely has a weakened influence if you're running against a billionaire reality TV star,"" said Charlie Spies, the super PAC's attorney, who counsels many of the party's major givers. ""In the remote chance that you're not in the exact scenario, you would rather have the money.""Breaking all the rulesMeanwhile, another presidential candidate was doing something far, far different.""I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers. Puppets?"" read one @realDonaldTrump tweet.Then, a few months later: ""Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!""And a few months after that: ""I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!""With aplomb and daring, Trump insulted three of the Republican Party's most illustrious benefactors — even misspelling Ricketts — and whether it was on Twitter or before donor-filled debate auditoriums, it was clear Trump was reveling in it.To rivals gasping for air time, teetering on the bring of financial collapse, and begging donors for just one more check, it was infuriating. As Trump poked every major giver in the eye — putting up $45 million of his own money to run a skeletal primary campaign — Trump rivals found themselves more dependent than ever on those same donors.""For him, did money matter as much? No,"" said Jeff Miller, who managed Rick Perry's chronically underfunded 2016 bid. ""If we had more money, could Rick Perry have been more successful? Yes.""Perry and the other 16 candidates seeking the presidency went to war over what is still a fairly concentrated list of mega-donors. Bundlers recalled hard sell after hard sell by Republicans seeking exclusive commitments, and if their candidate dropped out, there was no grace period before vulture finance operations swarmed and asked them for their Rolodex.It was nice to be in the driver's seat, donors said at the time. But after parting millions to a series of outside groups in 2012 and insisting on little accountability in return, donors like those who pledged to Perry eyed something else this cycle. I've been successful running my own company, many of these titans of industry thought. So, why can't I fund and run my own super PAC?Across the political spectrum — whether it was Democratic environmentalist Tom Steyer or maverick independent Michael Bloomberg or reliable Perry energy benefactor Kelcy Warren — donors took things into their own hands, starting personalized super PACs that tested their political savvy and gave them unprecedented control over their own dollars.They weren't unilaterally successful — one network crafted by Cruz was particularly cumbersome and criticized — but their creations reflect an exaggerated self-reflection among the moneyed class: they think they're political pros, too.""If the donors hadn't known if they had that degree of influence, maybe they wouldn't have given the money in the first place,"" said Stefan Passantino, the lawyer who set up the suite of super PACs for both Perry and Cruz.But Trump remarkably escaped largely unscathed from those super PAC ad machines. It's a decision some donors now say they regret.It wasn't until about 10 days before the Iowa caucuses that paralyzed donors — split across about a half-dozen top-tier contenders -- realized the damage Trump could do in the upcoming nominating contests. Donors — led by the Ricketts family — frantically came together and formed Our Principles PAC, though the roster of major givers never crossed into double digits.By the time Trump had bull rushed to Florida — anti-Trump money was flowing, and the week before the March 15 primaries saw more than $10 million in television advertising against the frontrunner there.Trump won the state by 18 points.Our Principles donors like Vlock say there just weren't enough donors willing to run the anti-Trump advertising campaign that he deserved.""I certainly sleep better at night for it. Am I disappointed in the outcome? Of course I am,"" said Vlock. ""Am I pissed? Yeah. Am I ever going to support people who aggressively supported or campaigned with Donald Trump? Absolutely not. Never.""The $27 dollar revolutionIf the Republican primary is a story about how big donors can't subvert the will of the people, the Democratic primary is a story of how a different type of donor can reflect it.Trump didn't raise small-dollar money during the primary. A candidate with Trump-like enthusiasm did: Sanders.Gravely intoning against super PACs and Citizens United to massive crowds across the country's liberal meccas, Sanders discovered something that reformers have long maintained exists under the surface -- that campaign-finance reform can be not just a winning issue for politicians, but a fundraising tool of its own.And improbably, Sanders — with virtually no fundraising events, limited outside spending and a on-edge relationship with party leadership — came close to matching the vaunted Clinton machine dollar for dollar, reaching parity on television during some weeks and even out-raising her during some months.Sanders would raise $231 million when all was said and done, $134 million of which came from small donors.""We do not represent the interests of Wall Street or the billionaires class or corporate America,"" he said before 28,000 people in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, just a few subway stops away from those banks. ""We don't want their money. We're going to do it a different way.""But Sanders fans and rivals alike are skeptical over-drawing conclusions: no one is suggesting that a modern presidential candidate could forgo super PACs entirely moving forward and just focus on hard dollars. Few folks say it is time to ditch fundraisers, which have been a bedrock of the hustings for a century. And as Sanders loyalists stress, there have not been many candidates like Sanders, who was so willing to sacrifice money on the table in order to remain ideologically consistent.  And after all, Sanders lost.""There is the capacity for small-dollar donations to completely shift how campaigns are run,"" said Michael Whitney, the whiz behind Sanders' online money operation.Sanders campaign, though, did at least offer the beginnings of another model for the presidential candidates over the future.As Sanders bellowed about how Clinton had disqualified herself from the presidency with a super PAC, the eventual Democratic nominee's supporters were taking advantage of big-money politics in an unprecedented show of force.The success of Priorities USA, according to political players on both sides of the aisle, reflected a new reality in campaigns: Four years after Obama belatedly and tepidly dove into super PAC politics, Democrats this cycle finally embraced the new super PAC landscape, insisting that there was no contradiction between their call to overturn Citizens United while simultaneously funneling record-setting amounts into their own groups.By the end of the campaign, Priorities had raised more than any other super PAC ever, capitalizing on the new wild west of fundraising in a way that made Republicans look like the skittish big-money players.Despite drama between rival factions at the beginning of the cycle, Priorities settled into a largely drama-less groove that Trump super PAC officials would later envy. Fundraising was heavily dependent on just about a dozen billionaires, but flowed at a constant drumbeat. And nearly every day, it seemed, Priorities had a new television ad backed by their fortunes — many of which played highlights of Trump's most disparaging comments.Democrats expected to need about $1 billion to support her via Priorities, the campaign and the Democratic National Committee — a threshold they reached in no small part because they thought Republicans would match them dollar for dollar.But at Clinton's low points in the race — or, at least, when she wasn't running away with the race -- Priorities was dogged by questions about its effectiveness given its enormous advantages. Questions peaked during the early summer, when Trump stubbornly remained competitive despite a one-sided onslaught on television. ""How did they not bury him?"" asked Carl Forti, a veteran Republican super PAC ad maker with American Crossroads.In the days leading up to Clinton's humbling defeat, some of Priorities' biggest givers were reluctant to project much confidence, signaling that even they were unsure that their millions of dollars made an iota of difference.""You always have doubts,"" said Dan Abraham, who gave nearly $10 million to Priorities. ""You spend your money. You do the best advertising you can. And you hope for the best.""Priorities sped through 2015 stockpiling as much cash as possible, expecting to need to begin advertisements in December 2015 or the first two months of 2016. Cash couldn't be spent on a primary — after all, they needed every dollar to cut out the knees of Jeb Bush, Scott Walker or Marco Rubio in the autumn of 2016. They expected to know their likely opponent by the end of the year.""As soon as the nominee was established on the Republican side, there was going to be an onslaught of spending coming from conservatives,"" Anne Capara, the executive director of Priorities, said she thought. ""Obviously those were two things that didn't happen.""Winning on the cheapTrump, who claims to be worth upwards of $10 billion, declined to put more than $65 million of his own money toward his bid.He also did not start truly fundraising until late May — and made little effort to assuage his party's traditional givers, who rewarded him with an unprecedented rejection even after he became the nominee.And he refused to authorize a single super PAC — and waited until weeks after the nominating conventions to begin his own advertising on television, even though Clinton had raked him across the coals for three months.Trump essentially offered a test case for political scientists eager to inject a field experiment into the middle of a presidential campaign: How much can a presidential candidate raise if he started from a standstill six months before Election Day?Some donors, like Vlock, never came around — and threatened to punish Republicans who enabled Trump's rise. Another wide swath reacted cooly, perhaps voting for him in the privacy of a voting booth, but certainly not bundling hard dollars.And then there were the Republicans who Trump charmed as he trekked from Aspen to Napa Valley to Lake Tahoe, winning over checkbooks with his willingness to affix his signature to everything and listen to donors' advice on anything.In private, Trump could work a room with the best of them.But the holdouts remained costly, donors now say, freezing tens of millions of dollars in certain states. There was one thing that saved his campaign — one that not even the most bullish Republicans expected.""Trump was able to on his own salvage his deficit based on those $65 contributions and that's something that surprised him as much as anybody,"" said Brian Ballard, who ran Trump's fundraising operation in Florida. ""Without it, Trump would've been going to his wallet a lot deeper or not able to compete.""A wildly successful small-dollar operation was Trump's saving grace, offering Republicans a model for fundraising that veterans said they had never before proven possible. Despite his enormous financial disadvantage, Trump was improbably able to keep the advertising war close in the race's final weeks.Some outside groups popped up to help Trump on their own. Sheldon Adelson eventually put forward $25 million on his behalf, but in the last month of the campaign, when ad rates had risen through the roof. (Republicans now think it may have made a difference.)Yet the fact is that the Republican Party's two most powerful donor networks snubbed him: the American Crossroads network spent fortunes on ads to hold the Senate, and the Koch network that Trump mocked maintains it saw real payoff from their early 2016 TV push in Senate races -- not on Trump's bid.""What we saw for sure this cycle is you can spend a whole lot of money and not get anywhere,"" said Mark Holden, the head of the Kochs' political operation.In Trump's orbit, a similar deep skepticism for paid media reigned. Peter Thiel, Trump's main donor ally in Silicon Valley, didn't give to Trump because he ""didn't even think that Trump needed my money.""And on that question — Charles and David Koch, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump were all right. He didn't.""When I first started at all, money was used hardly at all for advertising. Then it got to the point where it was used only for advertising,"" recalled Peter Kalikow, a fellow New York real estate magnate who is close with Trump. ""You can't make a guy who is not good, good. I don't care how much money you spend on it."""	The year that money won nobody nothing
3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/politics/trump-protests-key-demands/index.html	"From New York to Atlanta to San Diego, thousands of people have taken to the streets. The protests have been largely peaceful, but some have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, police described one as a riot after vandals threw objects at officers and damaged cars.Protesters are raising a range of concerns as they take to the streets. But they seem to be standing together on several key points.Here are five things they're pushing for:1. 'Dump Trump'Many demonstrators have used ""Dump Trump"" as a rallying cry. What does that mean exactly? It's a slogan that first gained traction as some Republicans pushed for the party to cut ties with Trump. But now that the election results are in, it's taking on a different meaning. For some, it's a catchy way to sum up their rage about the President-elect. But others are taking things a step further, signing an online petition and writing letters to members of the Electoral College, asking them not to vote the way their states did at the polls.  Could that happen? The Internet rumor debunking website Snopes.com describes the prospect as ""extremely, extremely unlikely,"" noting that it would be ""wholly unprecedented in American history and would require a sudden and drastic change in the United States' political traditions.""The Electoral College itself has also become a focus for some protesters, since Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election.2. Build bridges, not wallsTrump made immigration a focal point of his campaign, and it's a key issue for many protesters who are against Trump's vows to deport undocumented immigrants. ""I'm out here for my undocumented friends,"" protester Spencer Smith, 19, told CNN in Atlanta.At protests in Miami, demonstrators held signs that said, ""build bridges, not walls,"" taking aim at Trump's oft-touted plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.Is there any chance the wall plan could come off the table? Don't hold your breath, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, one of Trump's advisers on immigration, told CNN affiliate KWCH this week.""There's no question the wall is going to get built,"" Kobach said. ""The only question is how quickly will it get done and who pays for it?""Whether or not Trump heeds protesters' calls, building a wall along the border may be harder than it sounds.3. Making a statementSome protesters say they know Trump will take the reins January 20, but they want to make it clear that they're not happy about the election results -- and they're not going to be quiet about it.Protesters in Iowa this week had two main goals, said Rachel Walerstein, who attended protest in Iowa. First, they wanted to let people know that rhetoric-fueled violence against people of color, immigrants and LGBT people won't stand, she said. ""The second is to make a statement of political instability to render it difficult to govern, and in particular, to make it impossible for Trump to implement his policies in the first 100 days,"" she said. ""For me, it's important to make these statements known and visible.""""It's mostly to raise awareness,"" said Dalina Aimée Perdomo, who also joined protests in Iowa City this week and said she felt angry and disappointed that her state had gone with conservative choices at the polls. ""We gathered to share how we felt and how our families felt.""Trump has slammed protesters as ""paid professionals,"" but later praised their passion on Twitter.4. Trump should denounce the divisive things he's said ""He needs to really address all the divisive, hateful things he's said in the past and recant them, denounce them,"" protester Nick Truesdale told CNN in New York on Friday.Trump told The Wall Street Journal this week that he doesn't think his rhetoric on the campaign trail went too far. But he also said he wanted people to come together, according to the newspaper.""I want a country that loves each other,"" he told the Journal this week. ""I want to stress that.""Others have called for Trump to denounce an upcoming KKK parade scheduled to celebrate his victory in North Carolina.Trump himself hasn't spoken out publicly about the event, but the North Carolina Republican Party condemned it.5. 'Not my president'Across the country, protesters have been waving signs that say ""not my president."" Organizers of a protest in Atlanta said their message is simple. ""We do not respect the fact that Trump is president of the United States,"" they wrote on Facebook.""No to Trump and no to any future leaders who prey on our fear and lie to us plainly, be they dressed as friends or foes. No to a president that wants to ban all Muslims. No to a president who calls Mexicans rapists,"" the Facebook invite for an Atlanta protest says. ""No to rape culture. No to a president that not so subtly romanticizes white supremacy and mourns its loss though we all know it has been alive and well. No to leaders who propagate the destruction of our environment."""

Now, with a president-elect who promised to deport the undocumented, the fear of deportation is more real than ever.  But dreamers, named for the failed DREAM Act, which had proposed a multistep process to permanent residency, are dealing with those fears in different ways. Four dreamers in different states share with CNN their reactions to Donald Trump's win and their hopes for the future.They are only sharing their first names for fear of deportation.Itzel from San FranciscoItzel, 22, says she is undocumented and unafraid. She is ready to put up a fight to stay in the United States and says that perhaps what this country needed to wake up was exactly what it got: President-elect Donald Trump.""Had Hillary won, the Band-Aid would have continued masking all of our issues. And with Trump's presidency it takes the mask off and it exposes the reality of what it's like to live in fear in the United States,"" Itzel says. ""I think that more people are going to be united against this hateful, racist, sexist, homophobic person.""Itzel was only 4 years old when her parents brought her to the United States. This is the country she knows and the community she has lived in all her life.  She says that when Donald Trump won the election her family started text messaging her, asking whether presidents had the power to deport en masse.Itzel says she hopes that her family and people around the country turn their fears into action.""It's not just about undocumented people, it's also about the black community, the transgender community, any disenfranchised community, the working-class folks,"" Itzel says. ""I think that we are going to be united more and are going to change that fear to reaction.""As for those who voted for Donald Trump and support his divisive rhetoric, Itzel says:""I don't have anything negative to say to them other than I feel very sorry for them. I hope they have love in their hearts to be able to live peacefully because it must really be terrible to live in a hateful manner.""Estrella in Grand Junction, ColoradoEstrella, 32, says her three children are afraid of Trump.  But it was her 5-year-old who took the fear most to heart.""He said he knew he [Trump] was a bad man who wanted to take away his mom and his dad,"" Estrella says her son told her.Her son was referring to a common fear children of undocumented parents feel: The idea that their parents will be deported while they are at school. Estrella says she had to calm her son down before taking him to school Wednesday, by reassuring him that she wouldn't allow Trump to hurt him or his family.Estrella is an undocumented immigrant, who benefited from Obama's 2012 immigration executive action.Like many dreamers, she was brought to the United States illegally by her parents, in her case when she was 1.Her fear is that Trump will use the power of the pen to undo Obama's executive action on immigration.""I am in limbo; but this is my home and we are not going anywhere. I grew up here. This is my country.  This is where I've been all my life. And this is my kids' home. This is their birthright. They are US citizens. This is their country,"" Estrella says.As a community organizer of a nonprofit, she says she is calming the fears of other immigrants in her community.  And while she feels that Trump's win is a setback, she believes it's a time for immigrants to maintain hope and for children like her 10-year-old daughter to stand up for her rights.""I told her, 'If anyone says anything to you just remember your rights. Remember who you are. Remember where you came from and educate them. Be positive and educate those who are ignorant, those who don't understand the system and don't understand the country,'"" Estrella says.Rosa in ChicagoRosa, 22, says she feels a triple threat after Trump's win because she is Mexican, a woman and a lesbian.""I feel like it's a bad dream,"" Rosa said. ""I feel there are so many things and so many people against me and what I believe in and what I am and it's just very hard.""Rosa was 9 months old when her parents brought her to the United States illegally.  She lived in the shadows until she obtained a work permit under Obama's 2012 immigration executive order.  The first thing she did, she says, was get a job.She says it would be difficult for a President Trump to deliver on his promise to deport the millions of undocumented people in the United States, including her and her parents.  But the fear of deportation, she says, is very real.  So much so, her parents are thinking about self-deporting and so is she.""I would also consider going with them, too, because they are all we have.  I'm not going to stay here by myself,"" Rosa says. ""We are all concerned and scared.""Cesar in New YorkCesar, 33, wants to find common ground with Trump supporters and figure out a path forward for everyone in the country.""We want to ask people who voted for Trump to just understand that we also struggle, that we struggle with the same things. That we are not the culprits of their woes. We are not the group to blame for inequalities,"" Cesar said.Cesar was born in Guatemala and was brought by his family to the United States when he was 11 years old. He studied philosophy, human rights and theology in college and finished a year of law school. He received a work permit under Obama's immigration executive order and hopes that Trump supporters see that immigrants contribute to society just like everyone else.""Although the platform Mr. Trump ran was very much against immigrants and Latinos, we do contribute.  We pay our taxes.  We work to make this country great,"" Cesar says.When Trump won the election, Cesar says that the worry of deportation escalated in Latino communities.  The fear is very real, he says.""We are all afraid of that possibility, because come January if his [Trump's] policies are enacted, people fear for their safety, parents fear for their children and children fear for their parents,"" Cesar says.But Cesar is still hopeful. He believes that dialog with Trump supporters could help unite the country.""I think that there is a lot more that unites us other than the hateful rhetoric that carried the election,"" Cesar says.Living in limboIgnacia Rodriguez, an immigration policy advocate at the National Immigration Law Center, says  the deportation fears that dreamers are feeling are real and justifiable.Those who took advantage of Obama's executive action and were entered into the ""Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program"" only have temporary work permits, which will eventually expire, she says. When that happens, they are back to being undocumented and vulnerable to deportation. It could happen even sooner if Trump and his future administration decide to do away with the program. The future of their status in the United States, she says, is in the hands of the President-elect and Congress.President-elect Trump's camp did not respond to a request for comment."

That's exactly the wrong question, Wolf,"" Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""Wolf"" when asked whether the Vermont senator would vie for the Democratic presidential nomination in four years.

Previously, it was called the ""Million Women March on D.C.""As of Saturday, the page had more than 44,000 individuals who said they were going, with more than 121,000 people saying they were interested.Fontaine Pearson, one of the march's organizers, said in a phone call that the march is not a protest against Trump or the legitimacy of the election, but said it is to shed light on women's issues, including sexual assault and workplace discrimination. ""We're strong, but this has been a very difficult election for a lot of women,"" Pearson said, also noting that she had seen interest from individuals on both side of political aisle. Essie Labrot, who lives in West Hartford, Connecticut, said in a phone call she is ""definitely going.""Labrot said she has been involved in local and state democratic politics and was a Hillary Clinton supporter, but said this was more than just election politics. ""It's a little more personal for me,"" Labrot said. Labrot said she is attending to ""show solidarity to women, minorities, and everyone who is going to participate.""""We're still here, and we will be watching,"" Labrot said.  The page's description says it is a ""inclusive march"" for ""everyone who supports women's rights,"" and has multiple additional groups set up by state that are coordinating travel to D.C. for the march. Pearson said the march is part of a broader grassroots movement that she hopes will allow more action at state levels. The event's conception comes in light of Trump's White House victory, which has sparked protests in major cities across the United States. Trump was widely criticized during the campaign for remarks he made in a 2005 tape in which he bragged that he could grope women and get away with it. Soon after, several women came forward alleging that Trump sexually assaulted them.Clinton won the female vote with 54% of women voting for her, but Trump still garnered 42% of women voters, despite 70% of voters saying Trump's treatment of women bothered them. ""There's a real hunger for this,"" Pearson said. "	Tens of thousands plan women's march on Washington
