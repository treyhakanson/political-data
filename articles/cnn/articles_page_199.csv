Poll after poll has shown voters were unsatisfied and willing to consider another option. Making sure to stress these facts constantly, Johnson presented himself as the most plausible alternative. But Johnson hasn't caught fire -- a CNN/ORC poll found a third of likely voters said they did not know who he was -- and now an embarrassing moment on live TV could be his ultimate downfall.  ""If it is kissing my chances goodbye, so be it,"" Johnson told Fox News' Neil Cavuto of the incident.Johnson's day began on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" where the Libertarian was about what he would do to resolve the crisis in Aleppo, a Syrian city at the heart of the nation's civil war. Johnson responded, ""What is Aleppo?""The questioner, Mike Barnicle, said, ""You're kidding."" And Johnson confirmed, no, he was not kidding. Gary Johnson: 'What is Aleppo?'The gaffe was instant fodder for cable news and a hit online. It signaled a weakness for Johnson on foreign policy and underscored the perceived novelty of his campaign. Moreover, it came as the race has briefly focused on national security. Johnson released a mea culpa later in the day in the form of a statement, admitting, ""I blanked.""Later in the morning, he appeared on ABC's ""The View.""One of the questions: ""If someone had a gun to your head would you vote for Hillary or Trump?""""I would let it go off,"" Johnson responded.Asked about being a possible Ralph Nader-like spoiler, Johnson said, ""Well, I genuinely believe that I have the opportunity to win at this point.""National support laggingJohnson and allied Libertarian groups have have stepped up their efforts, fundraising and ad purchases. But as of yet, his breakout has failed to materialize. His polling is all over the place. The latest CNN/ORC poll found Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld securing 7% support among likely voters. But a Quinnipiac University poll of swing states released Thursday has him at 15% in North Carolina and 14% in Ohio. He was also clearly a factor in Florida, where Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were tied at 43% and Johnson commanded 8% of likely voters.In the face of recent polling, Johnson campaign spokesperson Joe Hunter told CNN the campaign would try to get into Ohio and North Carolina, but said there would be no change in strategy for the campaign in the face of the ""Aleppo"" comment.Those state numbers are enough to have a major impact on the election between Clinton and Trump, but he needs 15% nationally to qualify for the presidential debates beginning later this month.This is a relatively large increase from his position in 2012, when Johnson first ran for president and captured about 1% of the popular vote, but it is a far cry from anything approaching viability. The Commission on Presidential Debates -- which Johnson, along with Green Party nominee Jill Stein, sued -- has an established threshold of 15% support among an average of five national polls to qualify for the debates. Johnson made clear from the outset his goal was to secure an invitation.Asked by Fox News' Chris Wallace in late August about what exclusion from the debates would mean, Johnson said, ""I would say game over."" The first debate is September 26, the cutoff point for the qualifying period is looming and short of a stunning upset, Johnson will not be on the stage.CNN's Political Prediction Market, a game in partnership with a company called Pivit that uses polls, player input and other factors to predict where the election will go, has also indicated dwindling chances for Johnson.The market's assessment of any third party candidate's chances of making the debate stage has cratered over the past few weeks, dropping from 48% to about 3% as of mid-Thursday.Republicans aren't flockingJohnson failed to break out from obscurity when he ran for president in 2012. But when he accepted his party's nomination in May, he said this time was going to be different.Outside of the contempt many people had for Trump and Clinton, Johnson would have Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, at his side. He pitched Weld as more than a running mate, but essentially an equal and said they planned to form a ""co-presidency"" should he win the White House. Though this seemed to have been bourne out of Johnson's genuine admiration for Weld, it also lent seriousness to his candidacy. Weld had once been a significant Republican fundraiser and had a connection to a man who had followed in his footsteps, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Romney has been perhaps the most outspoken voice within the Republican Party against Trump, and his endorsement could have been a major boon to the Johnson/Weld ticket.But his endorsement never came. He told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in June that he would have supported Weld for president, but that he didn't know enough about Johnson and was turned off by his former third-party challenger's enthusiasm for marijuana legalization.Johnson said he eventually spoke with Romney, and in August said he did not expect Romney's support.Romney did come through for the ticket at least once, however. In a tweet on Tuesday, Romney said he hoped Johnson and Weld would get to join the national debates.In a statement after the tweet, Johnson said he was ""gratified"" Romney had joined those calling for his party's inclusion in the debates.""He's probably ruing what he wrote,"" Johnson said on Fox Thursday afternoon."	Did Gary Johnson miss his chance?

Though the moderator, Matt Lauer, has faced criticism for spending so much time on the issue, her responses also underscored the challenge she faces in moving on.Trump and his campaign made clear Thursday they wouldn't back away from the candidate's performance at the forum. Trump continued to deny claims that he backed the Iraq War, pointing to an interview he gave with Esquire magazine in August 2004, over a year after the war started, when he said that the conflict was a mess.However, in an interview with Howard Stern in September 2002 before the war began, he was asked whether he supported the idea of an invasion.""Yeah, I guess so,"" Trump replied.CNN's Jeremy Diamond asked Trump on Thursday about his comment in March 2003 that the recent invasion looked ""like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.""The billionaire replied: ""You know what I meant.""Meanwhile, GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence backed Trump's comments in which he suggested Putin was a better leader than President Barack Obama -- despite the fact the Kremlin strongman is accused of domestic repression and of seeking to check US power abroad.""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,"" Pence said in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash at the Reagan Library in California.RELATED: Trump praises Putin, pans US generals as Clinton pivots from emailAnd as Trump faced criticism about Putin comments, the GOP nominee gave an interview to Larry King's program on RT, a Kremlin-backed cable news channel.Trump demurred questions about whether Russia, which has been accused of being behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee, is trying to influence the US election.""It's probably unlikely,"" Trump told King. ""Maybe the Democrats are putting that out. Who knows?"" Another presidential candidate -- Libertarian hopeful Gary Johnson -- also spent Thursday trying to bounce back from a jaw-dropping moment in which he blanked on a question about how he would mitigate the carnage in the Syrian city of Aleppo.""What is Aleppo?"" Johnson asked during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""Clinton had her own shaky moments at the forum. She was plied with questions about her private email server, seemed defensive and unwilling to abide by time constraints on her responses.For Clinton, the challenge ahead is deciding whether cloaking herself in the conventional mantle of experience and sobriety distinguishes her from Trump but might not jibe with public anger at the Washington establishment.She described herself at the forum as offering ""steadiness. An absolutely rock steadiness"" mixed with ""strength to be able to make the hard decisions.""She sought to move forward on Thursday as the popular website Humans of New York published interviews in which Clinton spoke candidly about perceptions that she can sometimes come off as ""cold or unemotional,"" describing her struggle to control her emotions without seeming ""walled off"" and speaking in personal terms about what it's like to campaign as a woman.""Sometimes I think I come across more in the 'walled off' arena,"" she said. ""And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility. I don't view myself as cold or unemotional. And neither do my friends. And neither does my family. But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can't blame people for thinking that."""	What Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton taught us at last night's forum
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/hillary-clinton-stronger-together/index.html	"Addressing a largely African-American congregation here, Clinton said, ""I've made my share of mistakes"" -- and deliberately chose not to once utter Donald Trump's name.""Humility is not something you hear about much in politics, is it? But you should. None of us is perfect,"" Clinton said. ""I have learned to be grateful not just for my blessings but also for my faults -- and there are plenty.""Clinton's 30-minute speech, coming two months out from Election Day, demonstrated her campaign's efforts to inject more of the Democratic nominee's personal touches into the election narrative and get beyond the intensely negative headlines that have dominated the news. Clinton will look to draw attention to some of her policy platforms in the coming weeks by delivering a series of ""Stronger Together"" speeches around the new book that she and running mate Tim Kaine published this week, Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's spokeswoman, said Thursday.The speeches will speak to both what animates Clinton -- faith, children and families -- and how she will work to impact the economy and push national service. The push to get to a more positive message began Thursday with the speech in Kansas City. Clinton rarely touches on the issue of her faith and how it motivates her to serve. ""It would have been easier to follow many of my law school classmates to a high-powered New York law firm, but the call to service rooted in my faith was just too powerful,"" she said.While Clinton didn't mention Trump directly in Kansas City, there were allusions to him, including his questioning of President Barack Obama's American citizenship.""We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his business, who traffics in toxic conspiracy theories like the lie that President Obama is not a true American,"" Clinton said. ""If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can he serve all Americans?""And the speech was not entirely devoid of contentious politics. Clinton addressed gun control, criminal justice reform and economic equality during her remarks.Concerns about Clinton's unfavorablesClinton's second ""Stronger Together"" speech will be in California on Tuesday, Palmieri said.Palmieri said the four speeches (with the possibility of adding more) would be ""more about her than about him"" in an effort to ensure that ""what is at the core of Hillary"" is not lost in the coverage of ""the controversial things that he says.""Top Clinton aides worry that her responses to Trump's attacks have helped sullied her popularity numbers. An ABC News/Washington Post poll out late last month found that 56% of adults now view Clinton unfavorably. Sixty-three percent said the same about Trump, but what concerns Clinton's campaign is that her number is up 6% since early August.To combat that, Clinton's aides think the former secretary of state needs to take more about herself in personal terms and about her policies.""My experience is that we believe we have to work extra hard to make sure the positive notion of what she wants to do breaks through given the amount of interest that there is in what he says,"" Palmieri said. ""So we recognize the reality of the cycle that we are living in and that we have to put more effort in doing that.""One step in doing this: Having Clinton speak in softer, more humanizing formats such as the blog Humans of New York.Clinton sat down with the blog late last month and in comments published on Thursday, the former secretary of state expanded on perceptions that she can sometimes come off as ""cold or unemotional,"" describing her struggle to control her emotions without seeming ""walled off.""The comments come as Clinton's campaign is hitting NBC and Matt Lauer for the way he handled the 2016 ""Commander In Chief Forum"" in New York City Wednesday night. Upset over his lack of fact-checking of Trump, the Clinton campaign sent a fundraising email to their supporters hitting Lauer.Clinton's speeches will focus on laying out what is in the new Clinton campaign book, which has become a bit of a prop for Clinton on the campaign trail. In her first in-flight gaggle, Clinton held the book as a prop and she has mentioned it at a series of events since then.The book retails on Amazon for $10.98 and the campaign has said the proceeds will go to charity. When asked Thursday which charity, Palmieri said, ""Not the Clinton Foundation."""	Clinton talks humility and faith -- and less Trump

Kennedy, who has served as US ambassador to Japan for three years, said that America's history of reconciliation is crucial in preserving peace and opportunity, something which resonated with her last year, the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. ""I met the widow of the destroyer captain who sank my father's [patrol torpedo] boat and it was really just an incredible [meeting],"" she recalled. ""There she was, this older lady in a wheelchair.

Read Comey's full memo""At the end of the day, the case itself was not a cliff-hanger; despite all the chest-beating by people no longer in government, there really wasn't a prosecutable case,"" he said in the memo. In recent weeks, Comey has met with groups of former FBI agents as part of his routine visits to field offices around the country. In at least one recent such meeting, according to people familiar with the meeting, former agents were sharply critical of the FBI's handling of the Clinton probe and particularly the decision to not recommend charges against Clinton. Comey gave the meeting participants a similar answer about the case not being a cliff-hanger. Comey said he briefly considered holding the documents until after the Labor Day holiday, knowing that the Friday afternoon release would likely prompt criticism. He also said more document releases are coming. ""I almost ordered the material held until Tuesday because I knew we would take all kinds of grief for releasing it before a holiday weekend, but my judgment was that we had promised transparency and it would be game-playing to withhold it from the public just to avoid folks saying stuff about us,"" Comey said.  ""We don't play games. So we released it Friday. We are continuing to process more material and will release batches of documents as they are ready, no matter the day of the week,"" Comey said.He concluded the memo by writing, ""Those suggesting that we are 'political' or part of some 'fix' either don't know us, or they are full of baloney (and maybe some of both).""On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan criticized the FBI's handling of the matter, accusing the bureau of playing politics with the release.""It's like the most buried time you could ever put out a story. I'm surprised. I can't believe that they would do what is such a patently political move. It makes them look like political operators versus law enforcement officers,"" Ryan said in a radio interview with WRJN's Glenn Klein."

I think it would create real damage to the reputation of the House in the long term.""House Republican leaders are discussing several options as potential penalties, including voting on a resolution that condemns the sit-in or leveling fines for rule violations, according to a senior GOP leadership aide familiar with the discussions.During the protest in June, dozens of House Democrats sat on the floor in the well, chanted and yelled when Republicans attempted to move onto legislative business, actions which are breaches of floor decorum.

John Lewis, D-Georgia, the civil rights icon who was beaten by police in the 1965 march in Selma, Alabama, was one of the leaders of the effort, which gained national attention. Democrats demanded that the House vote on a bill that would deny gun sales to individuals on a government ""no fly list"" designed to flag potential threats to airlines. They also urged action on legislation requiring background checks for gun purchases. Several Democrats involved in the protest also used mobile phones to broadcast their demonstration using streaming social media apps after the official cameras that film floor business, which are controlled by the GOP majority, were turned off when the chamber went into recess.   Despite the high-profile protest, Democrats failed to secure votes on any gun measures.After the episode, which forced GOP leaders to abruptly cancel business for the week and start a scheduled recess early, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was troubled by the precedent it set and told reporters that he and other leaders were investigating with administrators and considering what type of penalties they might impose.McCarthy said Tuesday he has spoken with several Democrats about the episode and that they admitted they broke rules and understood there would be consequences.Lawmakers seek to stall $1B arms sale to SaudisRep Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, told CNN he hadn't spoken with any GOP leader, or heard from any Democrat who had, but defended the sit-in.""Almost every member thinks to themselves we made a point that we need to consider bipartisan legislation sponsored by (GOP Rep.

He attempted to make the case that Clinton and her aides ""knowingly destroyed evidence and covered up their actions"" after they used hammers to destroy at least two of Clinton's used cell phones.""People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach -- nobody's even ever heard of it -- their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton aides' use of a software named BleachBit to expunge traces of deleted emails.""Can you imagine if I, or somebody else, did that?"" Trump asked the several thousand supporters gathered to hear him speak in Greenville, North Carolina.The FBI investigated Clinton's personal email use and while FBI director James Comey called Clinton's handling of classified information ""extremely careless,"" he recommended no charges in the matter. The Justice Department followed the recommendation and did not pursue charges against Clinton or any of her aides.The Justice Department's decision didn't stop Trump from arguing that Clinton is guilty of federal crimes, and his supporters agreed, repeatedly chanting, ""Lock her up! Lock her up!""Trump, Clinton open campaign season sparring on national security""No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive, massive crimes,"" Trump said.The Republican nominee also slammed Clinton for telling the FBI that she did not know what the letter ""C"" represents in the classification system, just two days after he said in a tweet that the marking ""stood for CLASSIFIED,"" which is incorrect.Trump correctly noted on Tuesday that the ""C"" marking means a document is ""confidential,"" a lower level of classification.Trump's attacks on Clinton came as the two traded barbs Tuesday on national security and the other's competence to serve as commander-in-chief.While Trump argued that ""virtually every decision she's made has been a loser,"" Clinton, the former secretary of state, accused Trump of being unqualified and unprepared for the power and responsibilities of the Oval Office.""We are going to work with our allies, not insult them.

After spending months out of the public eye -- primarily fundraising for his wife's campaign -- the former President has used a series of campaign events to call Trump hypocritical for claiming that the Clinton Foundation is a pay-to-play scheme while the Republican nominee's foundation was fined by the IRS for donating $25,000 to a political group supporting Pam Bondi's 2014 reelection bid.""President Clinton has decided to stand up against Trump and the cynics driving a political agenda,"" an aide said. Trump's donation came days after Bondi's office said it was weighing an investigation into allegations of fraud against the scandal-ridden Trump University. No investigation was ever opened, and Bondi denies any connection between that decision and Trump's donation. In North Carolina on Tuesday, Bill Clinton said that he got ""tickled the other day when Mr. Trump called my foundation a criminal enterprise."" ""He made a political contribution to the attorney general of Florida who at the time had her office investigating Trump University,"" Clinton added. ""And mysteriously, the investigation vanished."" Hillary Clinton's campaign has been trying to draw more attention to the controversy surrounding Trump's foundation, routinely noting a disparity in coverage between the two foundations. What they have found: Bill Clinton, whose own foundation has drawn political criticism, may be their best messenger. Bill Clinton's spokesman said refuting Trump in the battle over the foundations was personal for the former world leader. ""For the last 15 years, the work of the Clinton Foundation and the people who rely on it have been President Clinton's life,"" said Angel Urena, Clinton's spokesman. ""So when someone who doesn't know the first thing about philanthropy tries to bring the Clinton Foundation into his political sideshow, President Clinton is going to stand up for it."" For years, the Clinton Foundation has drawn intense scrutiny from journalists, right-wing watchdogs and candidates like Trump, who described the charity a ""vast criminal enterprise"" last month and has called for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's connection to the foundation. Clinton's aides have tried to push back against these attacks and charity watchdog organizations have rated the Clinton Foundation highly this year. Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary has permanently fixed one tweet to the top of his account: Charity watchdog declares to CNN that @ClintonFdn is ""one of the great humanitarian charities of our generation."""

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/politics/rodrigo-duterte-obama-laos-meeting/index.html	"A foul-mouthed outburst cost the new leader of Washington's key Pacific ally a chance to meet President Barack Obama in Laos on Tuesday. Duterte blasted Obama as a ""son of a bitch"" and warned he would not tolerate any violation of Philippines sovereignty he said such a question would entail, after which the White House canceled their planned parley. While the nasty spat is not yet likely to damage the enduring relationship between the United States and the Philippines, and the countries' strengthening military cooperation in the shadow of China's rise, there is reason for Washington to be concerned.'Unpredictable' leaderThe unpredictable new man in charge in Manila introduces an unwelcome element to an already tense region and is casting a late second-term cloud over painstaking effort by Obama to intensify relations between the allies.More broadly, Duterte's anti-Americanism and haphazard diplomacy is worrying Washington's allies in the region. He has pledged not to bring up South China Sea territorial disputes in multilateral summits, moving closer to the position of Beijing that all parties should hold one-on-one talks with China that exclude the United States.And that is likely to end up being a problem for the next US president. The new occupant of the Oval Office will face a regional policy challenge dominated by the assertive Chinese President Xi Jinping, who would leap at the chance to weaken US influence.White House cancels meetingDuterte and Obama had been due to meet for talks on the sidelines of a regional summit in Laos. But the Filipino leader lashed out when asked by reporters how he would respond if Obama asked about human rights violations committed in his fearsome war on drugs gangs.""I am a president of a sovereign state. And we have long ceased to be a colony of the United States,"" Duterte said, paraphrasing how he would address Obama. ""Son of a bitch, I will swear at you.""The new Philippines president did not just obliterate the rules of behavior of the international leader's club with his remarks. He aimed a vulgarity at the President, which the White House could not stand for. Hence the meeting's cancellation.""It was the right decision by President Obama. This was an offense against President Obama personally, but it was also an offense against the office of the Presidency of the United States,"" Nicholas Burns, the State Department's former third-highest official told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday.In a sign however that both sides want to limit the fallout from the showdown, a White House official told CNN that Obama had a ""brief discussion"" with Duterte before the ASEAN gala dinner in Laos on Wednesday. ""The exchange consisted of pleasantries between the two,"" the official said. Donald Trump of the Philippines?Duterte has been dubbed by some commentators as the Donald Trump of the Philippines, but even the US billionaire's often fiery rhetoric pales in comparison to the statements that regularly escape the lips of the former mayor of the city of Davao, who was elected in a landslide in May.The White House clearly wanted to send a signal in its rebuke of Duterte that loose talk and bluster does not cut it on the international stage. Whether officials also had in mind someone closer to home who has made inflammatory statements on foreign policy -- the Republican presidential nominee -- was not clear.""I think it was our judgment that given the focus and attention on President Duterte's comments leading into the meetings here we felt that didn't create a constructive environment for a bilateral meeting,"" Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security advisor told reporters in Laos.Apparently prompted by the US move, Duterte quickly backtracked on Tuesday, saying he did not mean to insult Obama but was addressing a reporter.But this was not the first time he's directed offensive language at American officials. In August, he called US ambassador to Manila Philip Goldberg a ""gay son of a b****"" and said Secretary of State John Kerry was ""crazy.""RELATED: Duterte's gay slur strains close US-Filipino ties Though Duterte's quick retreat after the White House reprimand showed that the US still can call shots in the relationship, it gave Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence an opportunity to attack Obama for squandering US ""credibility"" in the world.But the administration has more to worry about than the political impact of Duterte's diatribe. That's because it can never be quite sure what he will do next.""There has been a lot of concern primarily because I don't think there is a lot of understanding of the Philippine President or any way to predict what he is going to do,"" said Rodger Baker, vice president of strategic analysis at Stratfor, a geopolitical intelligence company. ""It is that uncertainty that is causing the concern.""While the defense relationship, which is set to see US forces deploy to five bases in the Philippines to provide muscle to Obama's Asia pivot strategy, is not currently at risk, it could be seriously buffeted by a hostile president in Manila.Anti-American attitudes?Some analysts believe that Philippine leaders' remarks represent a long-present streak of anti-Americanism that is inseparable from his worldview -- a scenario that suggests this week's controversy will not be the last of the Duterte era.""This is a guy that came in already with a deep-seated suspicion of the United States,"" said Prashanth Parameswaran, associate editor of The Diplomat magazine and a Southeast Asia specialist.""He is trying to craft what he calls an independent foreign policy for the Philippines. That is a very different line from where the (previous) Aquino administration was in when they came in. The relationship with the US was seen as very significant.""There are undertones in the US relationship with the Philippines that do not exist in other alliances Washington maintains in Asia. The United States claimed the archipelago from Spain following a war in 1898, so sovereignty issues are particularly acute. Even after independence, Washington kept a vast garrison in Subic Bay in the Philippines until being ordered to leave in 1992.Duterte's recent offer to hold bilateral talks with Beijing on South China Sea claims has also scrambled the geopolitical game in the region, since it may complicate Washington's efforts to build a united front of allies opposed to Beijing's position.These developments are especially dismaying to Washington since an international court in The Hague ruled against China's territorial claims in the South China Sea in July, saying Beijing had infringed the sovereignty of the Philippines. READ: Has the South China Sea ruling set scene for next global conflict?The case, which pre-dates the current administration in Manila, was seen as a turning point in the South China Sea controversy -- but Duterte's unilateral approach could water down its impact.War on drugsWashington and Manila may also be on a collision course over human rights issues related to Duterte's war on drugs.Since he took office, more than 1,900 people have died, including at least 700 in police operations. The carnage has sparked alarm among human rights groups, which have complained about a wave of extrajudicial killings.Sooner or later, the situation is likely to cause trouble in Washington when members of Congress are asked to continue supporting US military aid to the country.The United States is also interested in ensuring that the current dispute does not harm anti-terror cooperation with the Philippines set up to hunt Al-Qaeda linked groups after the September 11 attacks in 2001 has been scaled back.While the direction of US-Asia policy remains in doubt in the new administration, the next White House will face a delicate task in managing Duterte.Manila is due to hold next year's ASEAN summit, and a festering showdown with the president -- and a continuing riot of death in the anti-drugs purge -- could make it difficult for a President Clinton or a President Trump to attend.""The more optimistic read would be, it's still early days, this is a president who is just over two months into his presidency,"" said Parameswaran. ""It will take a while for Duterte to find his footing on foreign policy, so the expectations for the relationship need to be dampened a little bit."""
