""First and foremost, I should do whatever I'm asked to do,"" Clinton said. ""That is, if Hillary wins I'd be both a former president and a spouse. So I think I should make those roles as consistent as possible by saying to the president and the senior advisers, whatever you want me to do, I will do. I should do that."" He said he's been lucky to lead the Clinton Foundation since departing the White House himself in 2001. Now, Clinton said, ""I should serve. I've had a wonderful life for the last 15 years, and this is the longest I've ever had a job."" Clinton said he'd like to be used to solve problems like Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, Native Americans' need to diversify their economies and coal countries' transition to a green economy.""There are lots of things I could do. I'd like to be sent to all these places that have been left out and left behind,"" Bill Clinton said. ""I believe this country is so close to being able to really grow again in a way that lifts everybody.""Clinton also said he's heard suggestions he should play the traditional role of ""first lady"" -- helping to accomplish a full transformation of gender roles by performing tasks like choosing White House china. ""If they asked me to do it, I'd be happy to do it,"" Clinton said. ""But I'd recommend we stick with what we've got and save the money."""	Bill Clinton on White House role: 'Whatever I'm asked to do'

A shadow campaign pushing rumors that Clinton is hiding a grave illness to protect her White House aspirations has existed for years, but only found a voice and high-profile champions during the last few months of this general election contest. Even as Clinton took a brief leave from the stump -- she is set to resume travel on ThursdayDonald Trump, who has considerably been less open about his health, was mostly restrained in the aftermath -- though he did couch his well wishes with some goading analysis, saying on Monday: ""I just see what I see -- the coughing fit was a week ago, so I assume that was pneumonia also."" Or not. Facts have rarely gotten in the way of dubious suggestions about Clinton's health. In a letter released Wednesday, her physician made a point of stating that the candidate ""is in excellent mental condition."" Here -- quite apart from any legitimate concern stemming from her recent illness -- are a few of the more ludicrous and resilient theories:Whatever might be wrong, it's now being covered up by ... a body double!In the aftermath of the Sunday incident, web sleuths turned up a series of images they believe show the Clinton campaign used a ""body double"" to reassure the public and trick the press. Collected under the hashtag, #HillarysBodyDouble, photographs of the candidate before and after she fell ill are being compared, as features like her nose, ears and fingers are plotted side-by-side for examination and debate. ""Shocking claims are coming forward about a body double and who really emerged from (daughter) Chelsea's apartment [on Sunday],"" blared the right wing Madworldnews.com. The writer goes on to ask: ""Was it (longtime Clinton impersonator) Teresa Barnwell outside Chelsea's apartment yesterday, hired to salvage Hillary's campaign as it was imploding after the collapse?""Barnwell responded to the suggestions -- spreading across social media -- that she had stood in for Clinton with a tweet of her own.""I'm in Los Angeles today,"" she wrote. ""Not in NYC!""Clinton is sick ... because someone, perhaps a Russian agent, is poisoning herDr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist whose role in highlighting the aftereffects of head trauma on former NFL players was dramatized by Will Smith in a recent film, weighed in with his own theory on Sunday night. ""I must advice (sic) the Clinton campaign to perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton's blood,"" he tweeted. ""It is possible she is being poisoned.""Omalu is, on the face of it, a more credible source and discerning eye, but, though a doctor, he has not examined Clinton. Rather than expand on his medical reasoning, he followed up a little less than an hour later with a cryptic tweet: ""I do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. With those two all things are possible.""Though Putin's government has been implicated in the 2006 poisoning death of a former KGB operative in London, there is no evidence -- and nothing in any of Clinton's medical notices, provided by her physician -- to suggest anything of the sort is at play here.Clinton has suffers from post-traumatic 'dysphasia' The bulk of the most prominent healther conspiracies center on Clinton's December 2012 concussion, suffered after she fainted while sick with a stomach virus. Clinton's injury caused her to postpone planned testimony on the Benghazi attack, leading right-wing skeptics to accuse the then-secretary of state of coming down with a ""diplomatic illness"" -- or faking it. Those whispers died by the end of the month, when doctors discovered a blood clot in the vein behind her right ear during a follow-up exam. Clinton was treated with blood thinners and she testified to Senate and House committees a few weeks later, on January 23, 2013.Multiple currently circulating theories attach themselves to the 2012 fall, including one pushed by Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson, who in August offered matter-of-factly that Clinton was suffering from dysphasia, a neurological disorder that complicates speech and language comprehension due to brain trauma or disease.""What's new are the other reports of the observations of Hillary Clinton's behavior and mannerisms,"" Pierson said during an appearance on MSNBC, after being asked why the campaign was indulging the rumors. ""Specifically with what you just showed in those previous clips, as well as her dysphasia, the fact that she's fallen, she has had a concussion.""Meanwhile, a Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel -- who himself has noted that he is ""not a neurologist"" -- pushed a similar line. ""I saw the same video you saw, and I'm wondering about a word called 'aphasia,' where you're searching for words, you suddenly lose those words, and that can be the sign, again, of some kind of traumatic brain injury or the after-effects of a concussion,"" he said on pro-Trump commentator Sean Hannity's show. Brain damage, seizures, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseaseThe list of purported maladies goes on. Karl Rove, the former top adviser to President George W. Bush, suggested in 2014 Clinton had been ""wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury,"" while assorted right-wing sites and Twitter trolls have suggested she is prone to seizures -- a belief that sprung a new theory claiming a Secret Service agent's flashlight was really an ""an auto-injector with Diazepam."" Other have mused that she could be suffering from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.The conservative Powerline blog featured an anonymous letter on Sunday, from who it described as a ""prominent internist,"" suggesting Clinton's pneumonia was related to Parkinson's: ""I raise this second possibility,"" he wrote, ""because of Hillary's history of neurological illnesses (blood clot in brain, concussion), hints raised on the internet in Wikileaks documents and by others that she may have a neurological disease like Parkinson's, and her by now well documented history of recurrent coughing fits. This second possibility is that she has an aspiration pneumonia.""The first possibility, stated at the top, was that she simply had contracted the illness, like any other ""healthy person living her usual life.""Others, if you feel like further plumbing the depths of ungrounded theories, include: Lupus, HIV and ""imminent heart failure"" event -- only months away."

2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-deplorables/index.html	"The political firestorm over the Democratic nominee's use of the word to demean half of her rival's supporters might seem like another of the bizarre spats that trivialize presidential races. But the controversy has turned into one of those rare campaign moments when strategists for each candidate are happy to trade fire on the same ground.""We have the support of cops and soldiers and carpenters and welders and accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation,"" Trump said in Iowa Tuesday. ""My opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.""But the Clinton campaign -- struggling to move past damaging video showing the Democratic nominee stumbling and wobbly over the weekend -- is hardly in a defensive crouch on the ""deplorables"" comment. Instead, the plan is to turn the tables on Trump with the implicit accusation that if anyone is deplorable, it is him.A new campaign ad features footage of Trump warning that anyone with a low opinion of its citizens is unfit to lead the nation -- then uses a torrent of his inflammatory statements about Mexicans, women, African-Americans, the disabled and Muslims, to condemn the GOP nominee out of his own mouth.With Clinton off the trail as she recovers from pneumonia, prolonging the ""deplorable"" meme also has the virtue of keeping campaign conversation away from controversies that the campaign has more trouble finessing -- like her email server or its patchy disclosure about the state of her health.Both sides have solid reasons to want this controversy play out.The ""deplorables"" saga represents a passport for each campaign to reach the distinct coalition of voters they need most to win November's election.For Trump, Clinton's dismissal of many of his supporters as racists, xenophobes, sexists, Islamaphobes and bigots is a gift that allows him to recreate his victorious GOP primary persona of a champion of blue collar Americans demonized by patronizing East coast political elites.It's exactly the kind of posture the billionaire New Yorker needs to electrify white, working class voters in the swing states in the industrial Midwest, where he must outperform recent GOP nominees to win an Electoral College majority.The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, knows its best hope of victory is maximizing the Obama coalition from 2012 -- especially young people, minorities and single women -- exactly the kind of voters likely to be most horrified by such a dire picture of the Trump coalition and the man who leads it.""This is not a mistake on Clinton's part. She is looking up at the polls, they are tightening and there is an enthusiasm gap in favor of Trump,"" said Ford O'Connell, a GOP strategist who is not affiliated with the Trump campaign. ""She is engaging in what some would argue is a high-risk strategy to gin up support among voters who just might not turn out.""O'Connell added: ""Turnout is the biggest issue for her. The map is the biggest issue for Trump.""While Trump has enjoyed his best few weeks of the general election campaign, pulling into a margin of error race with Clinton in national polls and trimming her lead in swing states, the mathematics of the race are still formidable for him.In simple terms, he needs to win all of the states Mitt Romney captured in 2012, then add Florida, Ohio and Iowa. Then he needs to peel at least one big Democratic state out of Clinton's electoral column. His best bets look like rust belt heartlands Michigan and Pennsylvania.Trump's rhetoric since Clinton's remark suggests a strategy of fusing his anti-trade, America First message, attacks on Clinton's ""deplorables"" jab in a bid to win over blue collar and middle class voters in the Midwest.The Trump campaign is blitzing out the message through fundraising solicitations, TV appearances and a new ad slamming Clinton for ""viciously demonizing hard working people like you.""Clinton's comments, are ""typical of the elite politicians. and if you don't agree with them then somehow you're a deplorable person,"" Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said on CNN's ""The Lead"" with Jake Tapper.But keeping the word ""deplorables"" in circulation forces senior members of Trump's team onto a tough political spot when asked about people with extreme views who have voiced support for his campaign.For example, GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence had to explain at a Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday why he had passed up a chance on CNN on Monday to slam former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, as ""deplorable.""Pence said he and Trump had repeatedly disavowed Duke, but added, ""I'm also not going to validate the language that Hillary Clinton used to describe the American people.""Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Tim Kaine, pounced.""If you cannot call out bigotry, if you cannot call out racism, xenophobia, if you can't call it out and you stand back and you're silent around it you're enabling it to grow,"" he said Tuesday.President Barack Obama conducted the most artful demonstration of Clinton's response to the ""deplorable"" saga at a rally in Philadelphia Tuesday, that showed the importance the campaign attaches to thwarting Trump's attempt to position himself as the savior of regular Americans.""He's not offering any real policies or plans, just offering division and offering fear,"" Obama said, slamming Trump's ""dark, pessimistic vision,"" playing into Clinton's original argument that her rival is beyond the political pale.Then, the President launched into savage mockery of Trump's self image as a blue collar billionaire who can put Rustbelt voters in play.""He spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could,"" Obama said. ""He wasn't going to let you on his golf course. He wasn't going to let you buy in his condo. And now suddenly this guy is going to be your champion?"""	Why 'deplorables' spat is here to stay

However, this batch doesn't appear to have any damaging emails regarding the DNC.This is the latest attack from the hacker that goes by ""Guccifer 2.0"" -- earlier hacks from this source led to the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in August, after released emails revealed a bias for Hillary Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic nomination fight.Interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile warned in a statement against downloading the data because it could contain ""malware,"" and said there's ""one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that's Donald Trump.""""Not only has Trump embraced Putin, he publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign,"" Brazile said in a statement.

""My culture is a very dominant culture. And it's imposing, and it's causing problems. If you don't do something about it, you're going to have taco trucks on every corner,"" Gutierrez told MSNBC's Joy-Ann Reid.Last week, treating Gutierrez's warning as a challenge of sorts, the USHCC created the initiative ""Guac the Vote."" Its aim -- mobilizing taco truck owners to encourage its customers to register to vote, and park their trucks outside polling sites on Nov. 8.""The idea of taking the taco trucks is not even a Mexican or Hispanic symbol -- it's an American symbol,"" said Chamber spokesman Pablo Manriquez. ""The hope is that we're going to be able to deliver quite a few trucks to quite a few polling centers.""Trump's campaign did not immediately respond for comment to this story.What Donald Trump has said about Mexico and vice versaManriquez said he's not sure how many taco trucks there are in the country -- but he believes its in the thousands -- and there's no recent data that shows how many election centers there are in the United States. Data in 2004 shows that there were 113,754 polling places, according to a report by the US Election Assistance Commission.In July, the USHCC endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president, which was a first for the normally nonpartisan group.""Hillary Clinton will be America's first American small business president. She grew up in a small business. She understands the challenges of small businesses. And throughout her campaign, she's engaged our organization and our business owners all over the country,"" the group's president, Javier Palomarez, told CNN's ""New Day"" at the time.Immigration has been a hot topic in this election after Trump mentioned Mexican immigrants in his June 2015 campaign announcement.""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" Trump famously said. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""Since then, Trump has faced criticism for his comments about building a border wall and having Mexico pay for it, as well as accusing a US-born federal judge of Mexican heritage, Gonzalo Curiel, for being biased about presiding about a Trump University case.Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Aug. 31 in Mexico City, to discuss his comments about Mexico paying for the border wall Trump has pledged to build if he is president. Peña Nieto reiterated his response that Mexico would not pay for such a wall. "	Latino group hopes to troll Trump with taco trucks on Election Day

According to Bardack, ""The remainder of her complete physical exam was normal and she is in excellent mental condition.""Bardack added that Clinton ""is recovering well with antibiotics,"" including Levaquin, which she was told to take for 10 days.""My overall impression is that Mrs. Clinton has remained healthy and has not developed new medical conditions this year other than a sinus and ear infection and her recently diagnosed pneumonia,"" Bardack wrote in a letter released to the media. ""She is recovering well with antibiotics and rest. She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as president of the United States.""Only borderline highSpeaking to CNN's Jake Tapper, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said Wednesday's disclosures were ""pretty similar"" to information released by her campaign last year. He noted that Clinton's triglycerides jumped from 69 last year to 159, but he speculated that that could be ascribed to whether she ate before blood tests.Triglycerides are a type of fat of found in blood, and as triglyceride levels increase, so does heart disease risk. Even though Clinton's triglycerides count jumped from 69 to 159, that's only borderline high. ""Normal"" levels, according to Harvard Medical School, are less than 150. ""This is certainly not a release of medical records by any means. This is very similar, in some ways, to what we got in July of last year,"" Gupta said.Bardack wrote last year that while Clinton suffered a scare in 2012 following a concussion, she was now in good health.""Mrs. Clinton is a healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies,"" Bardack wrote.The 2015 health statement says the blood clot, also known as a thrombosis, that Clinton suffered between her brain and skull following a fainting spell and concussion in late 2012 is completely resolved.Clinton, according to the letter released Wednesday, takes the blood thinner Coumadin and thyroid medication.Bardack also wrote on Wednesday that Clinton is ""up to date"" on her vaccinations and has normal mammogram and breast ultrasound.Clinton's blood pressure of 100/70 and she has a heart rate of 70, according to Bardack. Her lab testing, the doctor added, was ""normal.""Questions about Clinton's healthAfter Clinton's doctor released a letter about the former secretary of state's health in 2015, her campaign did not intend to release more information about their candidate. That changed Sunday after Clinton left a 9/11 memorial ceremony early and video caught her nearly collapsing and having to be helped into her van as she left. After Clinton stopped by her daughter's apartment -- and told the media that she was feeling better -- Bardack evaluated Clinton at her home in Chappaqua, New York, and the campaign later told the media that Clinton had pneumonia.As a result, Clinton canceled three days of events in California and Nevada and is set to return to the campaign trail on Thursday in North Carolina.Questions about transparency and the medical health of both Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump have dominated the political world for days, in part because Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday but withheld the information from the media and even some of her top aides.Trump surprised people on Wednesday when he discussed some medical information on ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" including the results of a recent physical exam.Jesse Lehrich, a foreign policy spokesman for Clinton, swiped at Trump Wednesday over his call last month for the candidates to release more medical information.""OK, your turn,"" Lehrich tweeted, linking to a page on Clinton's campaign website that displayed letters from Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine's doctors.Kaine in 'excellent health'The Democratic vice presidential nominee is in ""overall excellent health,"" congressional attending physician Dr. Brian Monahan wrote in a letter released by the Clinton campaign Wednesday.Kaine, who works out three times a week, is not on medication. His only surgery was a molar teeth extraction. The Democratic vice presidential candidate has a family history of maternal breast cancer and his paternal grandfather had prostate cancer. Monahan called the review of his family history ""remarkable."" His general physical and mental health examination was ""normal,"" Monahan added.The Virginia senator, 58, had a normal metabolic profile, urinalysis and complete blood count, but Monahan recommended he increase his Vitamin D intake with a supplement.  Republican vice presidential hopeful Mike Pence declined to respond to reporters Wednesday in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, when asked if he planned to release his medical records. Marc Lotter, a Pence spokesman, later said the Indiana governor will release information from a recent physical ""quickly.""""He's always intended to do that,"" Lotter told reporters.Nagged by coughWhile on the campaign trail, though, Clinton has dealt with a nagging cough. She suffered a two-minute coughing fit during an event in Cleveland last week, which she blamed on allergies -- and wryly put it on the shoulders of Trump.""Every time I think about Trump I get allergic,"" she joked in front of the crowd.The coughing also cut short an in-flight gaggle earlier this month, and Bardack wrote on Wednesday that Clinton takes allergy medicine to combat the issue.Clinton's health has also been subject to speculation from Trump and his top surrogates and supporters. The claims routinely cite selectively edited videos of public events to advance claims she's suffered seizures and is in poor health.There is no credible evidence to support any of these claims.Clinton has sought to dismiss the suggestions. During an appearance last month on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" Clinton called the GOP claims about her health a ""wacky strategy"" and opened a jar of pickles to show her strength.""I don't know why they are saying this,"" she said. ""I think on the one hand, it is part of the wacky strategy, just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you."""

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made waves last December when he proposed a temporary ban on all Muslims immigrating to the United States. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has said that she would like to see the number of Syrian refugees accepted into the United States increase from the Obama administration's goal of 10,000 a year to 65,000 refugees.Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson stumbled when asked what he would do about the humanitarian crisis facing the city of Aleppo, Syria, as a result of the nation's ongoing civil war.
