In early March he paid tribute to its ""very good work for millions of women"" while also keeping up a threat to cut off federal funding to the organization if it continues to offer abortion services.That stand puts Trump partly at odds with Republican orthodoxy, which is consistently critical of Planned Parenthood over abortion services it provides. It's a long way from the group's work in its founding on October 16, 1916. Then American contraception activist and nurse Margaret Sanger opened America's first birth control clinic in Brooklyn, New York.Planned Parenthood fast factsAt the time women in many states did not yet have the right to vote. And various family planning measures were illegal in the United States at the time -- the Comstock Laws outlawed the use of contraceptives and abortifacients. Despite police raid on Sanger's clinic, and her own arrest, she founded the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau and the American Birth Control League. The two family planning organizations would join forces to become the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Today the nonprofit organization provides women, men and teenagers a wide range of medical services, including sexual education, contraception options, STD screenings, as well as tests and treatments for cervical cancer and other forms of cancer. Various Planned Parenthood clinics also provide abortions to patients. Abortion fightsWhile controversy over birth control has hardly subsided, the abortion debate has only intensified. Since the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade decision that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, Planned Parenthood has been at the center of litigation around the issue. In June, by a 5-3 vote the Supreme Court struck down a Texas abortion law, which critics contend would have shut down a large number of women's health clinics in the Lone Star State -- with 5.4 million females in the state of reproductive age.That followed criticism of Planned Parenthood in 2015 after an anti-abortion group released undercover online videos, which it said depicted the nonprofit selling fetal organs for profit, in violation of medical ethics. Shortly after the release of the videos, Republicans began a push to defund the organization. During an often-contentious four-hour committee hearing, House Republicans accused Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards of spending $40 million on ""lavish"" priorities, including hosting pricey parties, flying first class and spending more time fundraising than focusing on women's health care. Richards denied all the charges and pushed back, defending her organization's work. Funding for Planned Parenthood nearly led to a government shutdown in fall of that year and continues to hold up unrelated legislation on Capitol Hill. And those are only the latest defund efforts. In 2007 then-Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana became the first lawmaker to call for a cutoff of Planned Parenthood's federal funds due to its abortion services. As Indiana governor and now Trump's vice presidential nominee Pence has continued the criticism. Mike Pence has his own woes with womenThe embattled organization was thrust into the spotlight once again in November 2015 when a gunman opened fire at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, killing two civilians and one police officer. Longtime criticismThough the abortion issue has sharpened criticism of Planned Parenthood its long faced jabs over services its mission.""I think it's been a very long, hard struggle over the course of the past century,"" said American University professor Elizabeth Sherman. ""Ever since Margaret Sanger, ever since the early part of the 20th century, Planned Parenthood has been on the forefront of saying these services should not only be legal, but they should be available.""At its century mark the organization is often playing defense. ""For many people, Planned Parenthood is the only place they can turn to,"" says Dawn Laguens, executive vice president for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group's political arm. ""Planned Parenthood may be the only place they can go in their community, or the only place that offers the screening or birth control method they need."" Anti-abortion forces see it differently, arguing other organizations provide many of the same services a pregnant woman might seek. ""There are about 3,000 pregnancy centers in the country where she can go to get help, and it might be immediate health such as baby clothes, maternity clothes, and medical help,"" says Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee.""When it comes to other health care services, there are several thousands community health centers around the country that are pretty much funded by tax dollars that can provide the same services,"" Tobias said. ""Planned Parenthood is in the abortion business. Some of the other stuff they do is just a sideline.""However, proponents of Planned Parenthood claim these alternatives do not provide the same kind of reproductive care it does. ""Too many of the 'options' provided by anti-abortion groups simply don't provide the same kind of care -- the lists of 'alternatives' provided include things like dentist offices and nursing homes,"" Laguens said. ""The truth is that people vote with their feet -- and 2.5 million of them chose Planned Parenthood health centers each year.""Political actionThose kind of debates are central to many 2016 political races, in which Planned Parenthood is playing an increasingly active role. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Votes are running a $30 million 2016 electoral effort aimed at the presidential race and Senate contests. The two groups are targeting Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire and Wisconsin, with the hopes of helping secure a Clinton win, and getting Democratic Senate candidates across the finish line.Under Richards -- daughter of the late Democratic Texas Gov. Ann Richards -- for the first time in its history, the organization endorsed a presidential candidate -- Clinton -- in the primaries."	Planned Parenthood turns 100 years old

There's his state-of-the-art software that pools the responses collected at thousands of doorsteps each day. And there's his sprawling network of activists, working outside the party system but fiercely committed to the vision pitched by their titan of industry.Steyer, a hedge fund manager whose main focus is fighting climate change, has none of that. But quietly, in neighborhoods like Milwaukee's Hispanic south side or in its working-class Polish suburbs, Democrats are replicating the fundamentals of the massive and powerful network assembled by GOP billionaires Charles and David Koch.Steyer spent $75 million in 2014 -- more than anyone else in the country -- on television spots. Democrats lost nearly every race. This year, armed with $60 million, Steyer and Democrats are copying the Kochs' strategy -- beginning with saying yes to issue-based canvassing, and no to gauzy ad buys.  ""What they must have observed as well,"" Steyer said in an interview, is that television ""has a very ephemeral impact.""This activity is critical if the Democrats are going to keep the White House and win back the Senate. Here and in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, Koch groups are working overtime to get Republicans to vote despite the fact Donald Trump is scaring some of those people away -- and opinion polls show their efforts are working.Steyer's vehicle: A new super PAC called For Our Future, which is trying to crack a chronic problem for Democrats: how to convince a seemingly endless cadre of niche Democratic interest groups, each with their own field programs, to work together. It's a question of trust as much as it is coordination.The Koch brothers and their donors funded a battery of complementary non-profit groups, such as the Libre Initiative for Latinos, Generation Opportunity for millennials and Americans for Prosperity, their flagship program. Similarly, Steyer and the dozen unions who are funding For Our Future issue grants to their own army of distinct organizations: Voces de la Frontera, a Hispanic community group; NextGen Climate, Steyer's environmentalist network; or the AFL-CIO, the massive federation of trade unions who have long been a bedrock of Democratic organizing.For Our Future is by no means as politically mature and or tactically proficient as the decades-old Koch network. The scale, though, impresses even Koch officials: For Our Future claims 900 paid canvassers -- just a few hundred less than the entire Koch network -- and knocked on their four millionth door of the cycle this weekend. And the organizing principles are nearly identical.Challenges in the Latino communityWisconsin, where Trump visits Monday, is a ripe target for these new organizing tactics by Democratic-oriented groups. The Badger State has gone Democratic in presidential races from 1988 on. But it's still at least a second-tier battleground state with electoral map targets by the Trump and Hillary Clinton campaigns still in flux. And there's a competitive Senate race in Wisconsin, too, as Republican incumbent Ron Johnson aims to stave off a return attempt by former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold. For Our Future was making a particularly aggressive push via canvasses and City Hall press conferences in recent days -- ahead of the opening weekend for early voting here in Milwaukee, when Democrats hoped to rush in low-propensity voters.Some of those targets: Latino voters, who dominate Milwaukee's south side. That's where Andrea Gomez, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and Maria Ornelas, a recently laid-off manager at a dog-treat factory, paced for $15-an-hour a modest neighborhood home to the Mexican Independence Day parade and taco trucks parked alongside sedans.Few voters on a recent afternoon expressed any excitement about Clinton -- and many seemed downright dour about two uninspiring options, even if they had a special resentment for Trump.""She's the only one we have left,"" said Maria Ortega-Villa, as her two toddlers hugged her legs.""The best choice we have right now?"" Ornelas asked, leaning down to speak with the kids in Spanish.""I guess,"" she replied.Neither Gomez nor Ornelas has much experience canvassing -- Gomez found the group circuitously through campus politics. Ornelas merely needed a job. And they rarely pitched Clinton with full fervor, passing up opportunities to sway the undecided and merely asking them to fill out a half-page ""pledge cards"" in which they commit to vote.Donned in Voces de la Frontera t-shirts and toggling quickly between English and Spanish, the canvassers present no connection to the big-money super PAC that funded their efforts.A low-tech labor effortNot 10 miles away, another Democratic group linked to the exact same super PAC executed a wildly different canvass operation.The tech was even more rudimentary for John Jacobs as he drove in a minivan from door to door in a quintessential Polish neighborhood, West Alilis, famous for its Christmas season decorations. He and his team hit doors on Saturday on behalf of the AFL-CIO — and they, too, had only a limited idea about how their work fed into the grand For Our Future plot.They did not have even basic tablets like Gomez or Ornelas -- they were using pen and paper to code responses, which some volunteer would painstakingly scan in later that night. They had no fancy literature, just black-and-white one-pagers on computer paper, which Jacobs would scribble on when leaving a ""I missed you"" note. There language was that of the labor movement when greeting a voter at a door -- frequently someone they knew personally from the union world.""We've got to rebuild stuff, you know?"" said Brandon Jeske, a Clinton supporter coming to the door as his two kids bathed.""Infrastructure,"" Jacobs, an electrician for 22 years, nodding knowingly. ""Being an ironworker, you know that.""To Jacobs, it is ""old-fashioned."" To groups like the Kochs, it is antiquated.Their Republican role-modelsAn hour north along Lake Michigan in the suburb of Sheboygan, Republican activists executed what Democratic activists aspire to.Armed with an iPad and a 10-year-old sidekick who rang the doorbells, Americans for Prosperity organizer Kayle Gabrielse bounced quickly from house to house, reading carefully off a script tested by Koch leadership and filing her data instantly back to headquarters. Unlike the Voces canvassers, Gabrielse is a veteran -- she has been doing paid canvass work since 2011.That's why while Wisconsin AFP head Eric Bott acknowledges some similarities between their tactics, he isn't worried about For Our Future. His canvassing science, he is certain, is more fine-tuned than the late-to-arrive forces on the left.""It's never a turnkey operation,"" Bott said. ""I don't judge them to be a threat.""One instructive example: deciding which network to use for their iPads' data service. They initially used AT&T, but discovered connection problems years ago -- so they switched to U.S. Cellular in remote western Wisconsin, and to Verizon for more populated areas.  But even with Bott's more sophisticated operation, the message from the top still matters, and the Republican ticket is likely to lose in Wisconsin on Election Day. Trump touches down for a rally here in Wisconsin on Monday, but the is now trending badly away from him. And that was true even before a spate of allegations of sexual assault enveloped Trump's candidacy -- which is expected to tear into Trump's numbers with suburban women in places like Milwaukee's collar counties, even though no voters brought it up over three canvasses last week, and groups on both side of the aisle are steering clear.""I'm not sure it rearranges our priorities, but it rearranges our expectations,"" Steyer said. ""Every single piece of evidence is just throwing a little more gasoline on fire... and then it just becomes a bonfire.""Steyer's vision: Liberals UnitedFor Our Future is effectively a clearinghouse for its partners, a bank account, a data repository and a conflict mitigation expert all at once. Its goal is to run the closest thing there can be to a coordinated campaign among outside groups, cutting turf so that a unionist doesn't have his door-knocked by a bilingual immigration activist, and so that a Mexican-American family isn't door-knocked by by a pipefitter.Or worse: A target Democrat who is greeted at the door by both just days apart, wasting valuable time on someone who has already been canvassed. Democrats here say that was a real problem in previous cycles, even though unions tried to coordinate when preparing for battle against Scott Walker in 2011 and 2012.""He lit a fire under the people to say: 'Hey we need these unions. There's a reason they're trying to crush us',"" recalled electrical worker Dean Warsh, 46, as he drank Pabst Blue Ribbons and flipped brats for the post-canvassing lunch rush at his hall.The problem dates back to Citizens United: Before that 2010 decision, labor unions could only canvass their own members -- and only by their own members -- creating an orderly, even if restrained, volunteer Democratic field operation, where each union knew exactly who one another was targeting.But then suddenly, the rules changed. Unions could contact anyone they sought. And each group had an incentive for their own paid canvassing operation -- especially since they could now hire from outside their ranks.""If everybody had pursued an independent strategy of funding their own organization in different places, then that would have been chaotic,"" explained Mike Podhorzer, the longtime political director of the AFL-CIO.The unions, without the cash to canvass the much-expanded voter universe, could try to pool their war chests and do as much canvassing as that money would take them. Then Steyer -- and his $20 million -- showed up.""It is a deeper engagement, certainly, than a 15- or a 30-second ad,"" said Steyer, who has not given a single dollar to Priorities USA, Clinton's television-centered super PAC this cycle. Steyer said he still expects to surpass the $75 million he gave in 2014 -- but through field-program spending. ""It is building something with a different trajectory. It doesn't end on November 8.""Tension between the various constituencies persist, with members overheard at a union hall here dissing laborers from other trades. And the conflict between union partners and Steyer's environmentalist faction -- which exploded into a high-profile fight as soon as For Our Future was created -- has not dissipated.And if labor could cohesively organize anywhere, it would be here in Wisconsin, where the wounds of the Walker labor battles remain raw (at least one union hall bathroom features a ""Scott Walker Urinal Target"" sticker). But those screaming matches similarly motivated the Kochs, who are personally close with Walker and placed one of their original AFP chapters in the Badger State in 2005.Add in the lack of any substantial presidential advertising -- Trump just began a small television buy last week, the first by either candidate -- and Wisconsin politics this cycle is placing a particular premium on the nuts-and-bolts organizing that both labor and the Kochs are prioritizing nationwide.But after this cycle? Despite their similar tactics -- and their promises to hold politicians accountable after Election Day -- the Kochs profess a confidence that their influence in politics will not budge.""It'd be smart if they could pull it off,"" Bott said back at AFP headquarters in Sheboygan. But he's already wondering whether his rivals might pack up shop: ""Are they going to be in Wisconsin in January?"""	Democrats eye their own Koch-style machine

He has pledged to choose from among those 21 when making Supreme Court selections, in a move that has earned him praise from conservatives, including his former rival in the Republican primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.Asked on the Dom Giordano program on 1210 WPHT Philadelphia radio whether Trump was the superior candidate on issues like the Supreme Court, the Arizona senator replied, ""Uh, first of all, I don't know, because I hear him saying a lot of different things.""Later in the interview, McCain used the opportunity to make the case for fellow Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is locked in a close battle to retain his Senate seat in Pennsylvania. McCain promised that Republicans would be ""united against any Supreme Court nominee"" put forth by Clinton.""I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,"" McCain said. ""I promise you. This is where we need the majority and Pat Toomey is probably as articulate and effective on the floor of the Senate as anyone I have encountered."" A spokesperson from McCain's Senate office later clarified his comments on opposing a Clinton-nominated justice.""Senator McCain believes you can only judge people by their record and Hillary Clinton has a clear record of supporting liberal judicial nominees,"" said McCain spokesperson Rachael Dean. ""That being said, Senator McCain will, of course, thoroughly examine the record of any Supreme Court nominee put before the Senate and vote for or against that individual based on their qualifications as he has done throughout his career."" Asked in the radio interview about the decision to un-endorse his party's nominee the day after a 2005 audiotape leaked to the Washington Post wherein Trump could be heard describing how he forces himself on women, McCain said, ""It's not what he said, my friend, it's what he said he did.""

Clinton leads Trump 44% to 29% in a five-way race among likely voters in Virginia. Libertarian Gary Johnson received 11% support, while independent candidate Evan McMullin garnered 3% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein received 2%. By contrast, President Barack Obama carried Virginia over Mitt Romney by about 4 percentage points in 2012, and by about 6 percentage points against John McCain in 2008.Growth in Clinton's lead was driven largely by a collapse in support for Trump across a series of demographic categories, including Republicans, women, younger voters and military families. Clinton has also made gains with independent voters as Johnson lost ground, in the wake of several high-profile foreign policy gaffes. GOP sources: Trump still competing in VirginiaThe new CNU poll shows that Clinton's lead over Trump expanded from a 7-percentage point lead she held in early October, when another poll found Clinton leading Trump 42% to 35% in the state at the time. The CNU poll also broke down each candidate's support by geographic region, and found Clinton with a large lead in vote-rich northern Virginia (55% to 21%), the tidewater region (42% to 25%) and the Richmond area (47% to 27%), while Trump maintains a heavy advantage in the state's more rural southwest (48% to 27%). The Christopher Newport University poll of Virginia was conducted between October 11-14 and surveyed 809 likely Virginia voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 points. Colorado, Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio In a series of Quinnipiac University polls released Monday, a shift of independent voters to Clinton helped buoy her into a lead over Trump in Colorado, Florida and Pennsylvania, and into a tie with Trump in Ohio.In Colorado, Clinton leads Trump 45% to 37% among likely voters, with Johnson at 10% and Stein with 3% support. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.In Florida, Clinton leads Trump 48% to 44%, with Johnson at 4% and Stein at 1% support. This survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.In Pennsylvania, Clinton leads Trump 47% to 41%, with Johnson at 6% and Stein at 1% support. This survey has a margin of error plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.And in Ohio, Clinton and Trump are tied with 45% support, while Johnson has 6% and Stein has 1%.

6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/mike-pence-2016-election-donald-trump/index.html	"Trump undercut Pence on foreign policy in the middle of a presidential debate. The two members of the GOP ticket aren't on the same page on the concerns Trump is fueling about the election being ""rigged."" They point fingers in different directions on WikiLeaks. Pence may be out of sync with some Trump voters as well, as seen with an exchange where Pence rejected a call about needing a ""revolution"" if Clinton wins.As a result, Pence's role on as Trump's chief spokesman and defender has been undercut, making the Indiana governor's task of soothing Republican concerns about the GOP nominee even more difficult. ""I think it makes Pence look foolish,"" said Katie Packer, a Republican strategist who was a top aide on Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign but is now a fierce Trump critic. ""He clearly has no influence or sway with his candidate and they are on different pages completely,"" Packer said. ""Pence knows the importance of having confidence in the voting process. He is also smart enough to understand that elections are conducted at the municipal level, so widespread rigging can't really happen -- something that Trump seems to not understand.""Pence's spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The Indiana governor's role on the ticket is to help uneasy Republicans become comfortable with the idea of Trump in the White House -- and to do that, he's talked tough about Syria, blamed Russia for the hacks of Democratic operatives' email accounts and tamped down talk that the integrity of the electoral process can't be trusted. Then, in each case, Trump undermined him. Trump's rejection of Pence's suggestion in the vice presidential debate that the United States should be prepared to use military force against the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria came in the most public setting possible: the second presidential debate, with 65 million people watching. ""He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree,"" Trump said, dismissing the Indiana governor. Later, it was Pence's job to clean up their dispute. He said on CNN that debate moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC ""just misrepresented the statement that I made in my national debate, frankly."" However, that assertion was inaccurate: Raddatz had repeated virtually word-for-word Pence's comment from the vice presidential debate. The two also disagreed on Russia's role in the hacking of Democratic operatives' emails, including the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Trump said in the second presidential debate that Clinton's campaign was only blaming Russia because it was an easy political foil. ""She doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking,"" Trump said. ""Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.""But on Sunday, Pence directly contradicted Trump's skepticism, acknowledging that American intelligence officials say the evidence points to Russia. ""I think there's more and more evidence that implicates Russia,"" the Indiana governor said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""The most glaring example of the differences between the two comes on the message that Trump has most focused on driving in recent days: that the election is rigged -- not just by media bias, but by voter fraud.Pence on Sunday told ""Meet the Press"" moderator Chuck Todd that the GOP ticket ""will absolutely accept the result of the election."" ""Look, the American people will speak in an election that will culminate on November the 8. But the American people are tired of the obvious bias in the national media. That's where the sense of a rigged election goes here, Chuck,"" he said. However, at the same time, Trump was in the middle of a tweetstorm sowing doubt about the legitimacy of the 2016 race. ""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,"" he wrote. Pence, though, stuck to his media bias script, refusing to touch Trump's claim of voter fraud happening on a massive scale -- a claim he hasn't backed up with any evidence. Instead, he sought to mimic Trump's messaging -- without personally embracing the GOP nominee's real argument.""There's a lot of talk about rigged elections out there today, and I have no doubt the national media is trying to rig this election with their biased coverage in Hillary Clinton's favor,"" Pence said in Mason, Ohio, on Monday. ""I've said it before; I'll say it again. All right?""He argued that voter fraud is a problem Trump supporters should guard against -- without actually asserting, as Trump has, that it's likely to happen. Instead, Pence nudged Trump backers to volunteer as election monitors. ""Voter fraud cannot be tolerated by anyone in this nation because it disenfranchises Republicans, Independents, Democrats, conservatives, and liberals in America,"" he said. ""And so I encourage you, demand that our public officials are upholding the integrity of the vote, but do all you can to respectfully participate in the process and ensure the outcome -- the outcome we can all be proud of.""White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sought to drive a wedge between Pence and Trump over the issue of voter fraud Monday, noting that Pence has expressed confidence in the voting system. ""Presumably those governors have confidence in the ability of their states to manage these elections fairly,"" he said.Pence responded later in Columbus, Ohio -- sticking with his assertion that Trump supporters should volunteer as election monitors. ""Well, the President's press secretary doesn't speak for me,"" Pence said. ""They're not worried about it because they deny it's happening. I'm not worried about it because I know the American people aren't going to let it happen.""Revolution coming?It all comes after a memorable exchange at a Pence event in Newton, Iowa, last week. A woman who identified herself as Rhonda raised the prospect of starting a ""revolution"" with Pence, who urged her to back down. ""Our lives depend on this election. Our kids' futures depend on this election and I will tell you just for me, and I don't want this to happen but I will tell you for me personally if Hillary Clinton gets in, I myself, I'm ready for a revolution because we can't have her in,"" she said emotionally.Pence shook his head a little, saying: ""Don't say that.""He added: ""There's a revolution coming on November 8. I promise you.""She pressed him: ""What are we going to do to safeguard our votes? Because we've seen how the Democratic Party is just crooked, crooked, crooked.""Pence reminded the woman that elections are administered at the state level and said if people are concerned about voter fraud, they should volunteer to be poll watchers.""I truly do believe it is -- the right to vote is a sacred right that was won and was protected by these men and women in uniform and for our part we defend it by maintaining the integrity of the system,"" he told the crowd.The integrity of the system is exactly what Trump was trashing on Twitter Monday morning.""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" he wrote. "	Mike Pence: On his own

Trump suggested Saturday that his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has been ""getting pumped up"" with performance-enhancing drugs. He challenged Clinton to take a drug test before the final debate next week. Is Trump right that ISIS fight should be secret?""I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate,"" Trump said during a rally in New Hampshire. ""Because I don't know what's going on with her, but at the beginning of her last debate, she was all pumped up at the beginning, and at the end it was like, huff, take me down. She could barely reach her car.""Trump continued: ""A lot of things are going on, folks. A lot of things. I think she's actually getting pumped, you want to know the truth? She's getting pumped up,"" Trump said Saturday. ""She's getting pumped up for Wednesday.""The Clinton campaign responded to Trump's comments by saying the Republican nominee is trying to depress voter turnout by his ""shameful attempts to undermine an election weeks before it happens."""

I'm thrilled to reunite with my family.""His case drew sympathy in the United States and abroad, thanks in large part to his critically acclaimed memoir, ""Guantanamo Diary."" Based on more than 400 handwritten pages he shared with his lawyers, the first-person account recounted harrowing tales of beatings, sensory deprivation and starvation.Slahi was detained by Mauritanian authorities in 2001 and transferred to Guantanamo Bay from Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan in 2002 under suspicion of being a member of al Qaeda. He was accused of recruiting three September 11 hijackers and involvement in other terror plots in Canada and the United States. Slahi admitted to traveling to Afghanistan to fight in the early 1990s, when the United States was supporting the Mujahedeen in their fight against the Soviet Union. He pledged allegiance to al Qaeda in 1991 but said he broke ties with the group soon after.He was never charged and his lawyers said there was very little evidence against him. In ""Guantanamo Diary,"" he described long days in isolation, chained to the floor in agonizing positions, often deprived of food and sleep in extreme temperatures. The book spent several weeks on The New York Times' best-seller list and led to several petitions calling for his release that earned more than 100,000 signatures, according to the ACLU.After the book was published in 2015, the Pentagon pointed to reports by the Armed Services Committee and the Department of Justice that found that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had signed off on such treatment as special interrogation techniques.""We are thrilled that our client's nightmare is finally ending,"" said Nancy Hollander, one of Slahi's attorneys. ""After all these years, he wants nothing more than to be with his family and rebuild his life. We're so grateful to everyone who helped make this day a reality.""With Slahi's release, 60 prisoners remain in Guantanamo, the Department of Defense said. Nineteen of them have been cleared for release, according to the ACLU."	'Guantanamo Diary' author Mohamedou Slahi freed

And the best jobs are going to go to the people that are the best educated whether in India or China or anywhere in the world.""The graduation rate is up about 1 percentage point from the 2013-2014 school year which saw graduation rates at 82.3%. The graduation rate has raised about 4 percentage points since the 2010-2011 school year, which was the first year all states used a consistent measure of high school completion, according to the White House.Education Secretary John King on a conference call with reporters Monday said that credit for the graduation rates ""goes to teachers and families and students in their school community"" but also pointed to investments made by the administration in technology and early education as factors.
