These moves, first reported by Buzzfeed, are just the latest step in their effort to turn the state blue.McMullin surge threatens to squeeze Trump's already narrow path to victoryClinton's campaign has organized a Mormons for Hillary group in the state and opened an office in Salt Lake City earlier this year.The former secretary of state's opening salvo in the Beehive State was an op-ed published by the Deseret News, a paper owned by the Mormon church.Clinton nods to the church's history of persecution in her op-ed, noting that other Mormons have compared Trump's comments to ""when Missouri Gov. Lilburn Boggs singled out Mormons in his infamous extermination order of 1838"" and ""President Rutherford B. Hayes' attempt to limit Mormon immigration to America in 1879.""To the surprise of both Democrats and Republicans in the state, polls show a tight race between Trump, Clinton and McMullin.A Y2 Analytics poll, published first by the Deseret News last week, found both Clinton and Trump at 26% among likely Utah voters, with McMullin at 22% and Libertarian Gary Johnson at 14%.McMullin, a Mormon, was a late entrant to the presidential race and has focused on Utah, where he was born. It's one of the few handful of states where the former CIA employee will be on the ballot in November.Clinton has yet to visit Utah as a candidate and aides have said that there are currently no plans for her to visit the state. Clinton's campaign is also not on the air in Utah."	Clinton keeps up pressure on Trump by adding staffers in Utah	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.""He added that a ""simple phone call"" to major news outlets ""gets them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking ever.""In the last two weeks, at least 10 women have come forward accusing Trump of inappropriately touching them. Their allegations came after a 2005 videotape surfaced of Trump bragging about being able to grope women and get away with it.Trump often threatens to file lawsuits without actually doing so. Earlier this month, he threatened to sue The New York Times when it published assault allegations against him, but nearly two weeks later, he has declined to follow through.Trump went on to suggest Saturday that Hillary Clinton's campaign was behind the women's allegations.""It was probably the (Democratic National Committee) and Hillary's campaign who put forward these liars with their fabricated stories,"" he said. ""But we'll probably find out later through litigation, which we're so looking forward to.""Asked about Trump's claim, Clinton, speaking to reporters aboard her campaign plane Saturday night, simply said, ""That's just not accurate.""Trump accusers respondLisa Bloom, who represents Jill Harth, who has accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances on her on two separate occasions in the early 1990s, replied to Trump on Twitter Saturday afternoon.""If Trump sues accusers we then have subpoena power to require not only Trump but all his enablers to appear for depositions. A field day,"" Bloom said as part of a series of tweets.Cathy Heller, who alleged last week that Trump kissed her without her permission in Florida 20 years ago, told CNN, ""I hope the threats do not deter others who have something to say.""Temple Taggart, who has also accused Trump of kissing her without her consent, told CNN she wasn't surprised by Trump's threat. ""Regardless, it's still disappointing to think that Mr. Trump lacks enough humility and decency to simply come clean and admit his part in all of this rather than attempt to conceal the truth and silence his accusers by threatening a lawsuit,"" Taggart said.Gloria Allred, the women's rights attorney who is representing three of Trump's accusers, predicted Trump's threat wouldn't deter other women from coming forward. ""If Mr. Trump thought that such bullying tactics would silence his accusers and prevent other women from coming forward, he will be sorely disappointed. Women will not be intimidated into silence by Donald Trump,"" Allred said during a news conference in Los Angeles Saturday."	Donald Trump says he'll sue sexual misconduct accusers	['Trump']	[]

The system is rigged against Trump,"" said Buchanan, adding that the media's reaction to the Republican presidential candidate's words have been ""hysterical.""""What do they think he's going to do? He's going to march on Washington as the head of Coxesy's army? Is he going to burn down the capital or something? What explains this panic over a simple comment?""Buchanan, a former Republican presidential candidate, also accused the press of administering ""the most savage beating I've ever seen by the media against a candidate.""""Trump made a statement about rapists when he came down that elevator. It's been repeated 10,000 times. Hillary Clinton has called half of Trump supporters racist, sexist, homophobes, irredeemable. Which of those two quotes has CNN used more often?"" Buchanan argued.This didn't go down well with Smerconish, who chided him for conflating media bias with a rigged election.""Voters on the right and left want to have faith in the electoral system,"" Smerconish insisted.""You're setting the stage for people to wake up on November 9 and question the legitimacy if it's Hillary and if she's won fair and square. That's not right,"" the CNN anchor added.""If you think that Trump has a fair deal in this election ... you're not watching the same media the rest of America is,"" retorted Buchanan. He added: ""I think I know who you're going to vote for, Michael. I think the other viewers do as well.""""I don't think so, Patrick,"" replied Smerconish, adding, ""that's why there are curtains on that ballot booth.""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/22/politics/paul-ryan-speaker-election-republicans/index.html	"House GOP members traditionally vote on top leadership positions the week following the election, but a bloc of members are arguing that vote shouldn't happen until December, after Congress deals with a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown and addresses other business. ""We really should delay those leadership races for further on in December, or at least late November, to give all the newly elected members of Congress the chance to get to know people,"" North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows told CNN in a phone interview on Friday.Members of the Freedom Caucus are reaching out to other factions inside the GOP conference in an effort to demonstrate broader support across the ideological spectrum for postponing the vote, which is slated for mid-November, barely a week after Congress returns and digests the results of the presidential race.Ryan faces intense blowback after he told House GOP members he would no longer defend Donald Trump following the release of the video tapes that captured the billionaire businessman making vulgar statements about women in 2005.  The speaker's move was followed by fierce criticism from the GOP nominee himself, who called Ryan ""very weak"" and ""ineffective,"" and from other Trump allies who question whether he should remain speaker.Oklahoma GOP Rep. Jim Bridenstine threatened to pull his support for Ryan last week because he wasn't strongly backing Trump. And the dust-up over Ryan's strategy to solely focus on down-ballot races and to essentially ignore Trump has other House Republicans angry and accusing him of essentially conceding the presidential race.  Tennessee GOP Rep. Scott Desjarlais said in a statement to CNN, ""it's hard to find a Paul Ryan fan in my district.""Meadows caused a stir on Thursday when he told WAAV radio in North Carolina that some constituents are questioning the party loyalty of Ryan and said there will be discussions after the November 8 election about what the leadership team will look like going forward. But on Friday, he ruled out a run for the post, telling CNN, ""I have no desire nor plans to ever run for speaker. That's not where I see myself.""Asked for reaction to Meadow's comments, Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said Thursday, ""Speaker Ryan is fighting to ensure we hold a strong majority next Congress, and he is always working to earn the respect and support of his colleagues.""Fox News anchor Sean Hannity floated Meadows name, along with House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan, as possible replacements for Ryan. But Meadows noted that he's never talked to Hannity and said he wasn't suggesting a challenge when he made the comment on Thursday, but was just discussing the dynamic he's hearing about from voters in his state.  He said he speaks frequently to Jordan, and said the Ohio Republican is not considering a run for a leadership post and no one else is circulating names of other potential challengers.Jordan's spokesman, Darrin Miller, told CNN, ""he is focused on his own race and helping Republicans up and down the ticket.""Meadows, who made a national splash when he made the first procedural move on the House floor that ultimately led former House Speaker John Boehner to step down, said there are ""zero talks"" to try any procedural move on the floor to oust Ryan. But asked if he'll back Ryan in the GOP conference election, the North Carolina Republican said, ""there's no race at this particular point"" and said he didn't see any need to discuss the issue ""before there's actually candidates."" He said the only discussions he's heard about are for the contest for the job to run the House GOP campaign committee to replace current chairman Greg Walden.""For us to focus on anything other than the presidential race or our own races would not only be premature but would be a waste of energy right now because we don't know what the landscape is right now,"" Meadows said.But even if conservatives aren't putting the plans together to back an alternative to Ryan right now, the effort to try to force leaders to delay the date of the leadership election effectively helps them do that by allowing more time to rally around a challenger.The details of the letter making the case for more time are still being finalized, but Ryan and other leaders began hearing about the idea of sliding the leadership elections to a later date several weeks ago.  At his last press conference before the congressional fall recess, the speaker said he expected the vote to happen at the same time it does after every election. Officially, the House GOP conference Chair, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, sets the date for the leadership election."

It added that it will instead focus on down-ballot races to preserve Republican majorities in Congress.Trump has occasionally mentioned LGBT Americans as a presidential candidate, most notably in the aftermath of the attack on a gay Orlando nightclub in June and his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in July. In that speech, The Washington Blade noted, he became the first GOP nominee to positively mention LGBT rights in that setting.""As Mr. Trump spoke positively about the LGBT community in the United States, he concurrently surrounded himself with senior advisers with a record of opposing LGBT equality, and committed himself to supporting legislation such as the so-called 'First Amendment Defense Act' that Log Cabin Republicans opposes,"" Log Cabin Republicans said.A message left with Trump's campaign seeking response was not immediately returned.Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has been criticized for his support of a law that would have allowed businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers in the name of religious freedom.The group criticized the Republican Party in July for not backing a pro-LGBT platform.""There's no way to sugar-coat this: I'm mad as hell -- and I know you are, too,"" Gregory Angelo, president of the Log Cabin Republicans, said in a fundraising email at the time. ""Moments ago, the Republican Party passed the most anti-LGBT Platform in the party's 162-year history.""The platform expressed opposition to same-sex marriage, a lack of support for allowing transgender people to use the restrooms of their choice and support for conversion therapy, Angelo said.The group, however, left open the possibility Saturday that it could eventually support Trump.""Should Mr. Trump become our nation's next President, Log Cabin Republicans welcomes the opportunity to work with his administration to ensure the advances in LGBT freedom we have fought for and secured will continue,"" the press release said. ""Until and unless that happens, our trust would be misplaced."""	Top LGBT Republican group declines to endorse Donald Trump	['Trump']	['gay']
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/22/politics/demographics-georgia-purple/index.html	"Alberto and Keisha Mosqueda moved from Virginia to Georgia about two years ago, so this will be their first presidential election as residents of the Peach State. It's people like them who could change the historically red state purple: new residents who vote Democratic, and conservatives who say they can't bring themselves to vote for the Republican candidate.As Alberto Mosqueda gets into his morning routine and turns on the news, the first thing he sees is Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaking at Thursday's charity dinner with Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival.""You can tell everyone is just looking at him like, 'Man, just end this,'"" Mosqueda says.Alberto Mosqueda says he considers himself a conservative. He didn't vote for President Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012. He says he isn't totally ""with her,"" to use Clinton's campaign slogan, but is voting for her anyway.""I definitely feel each have their own agenda. You have the Republican candidate -- I definitely (feel) he's out there ... just to show he is the man. ... A lot of arrogance. And then you have the Democrat candidate who (you) just feel she has a hidden agenda; its always been about just what's best for her,"" Mosqueda says.If it weren't for Trump, Mosqueda says, he would have probably voted for the Republican candidate instead of Hillary Clinton.With fewer than 20 days until the election, voters in Georgia are already casting their ballots, and Clinton is hoping to pull out a win in a state that has voted red since 1996.A poll released Friday by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows Trump and Clinton are deadlocked in Georgia, with Trump leading Clinton 44-42% among likely Georgia voters, which is within the poll's margin of error.Although Mosqueda, who is Latino, says he's voting for Clinton, he says he's still not sold on what she represents. Clinton's email controversy and her role with Benghazi are the two main subjects that Mosqueda says concern him. ""Being a military guy, you take all of that into account -- Benghazi especially, the emails and security, and all that. They're just direct breaches and direct violations of ... the simple things that they teach you even as a lower enlisted guy in the military,"" he says.But he says he can't bear to vote for Trump, especially with his comments on Latinos.The Mosquedas say they are taking this election extremely seriously, especially on topics like immigration reform, tensions between the United States and Russia and repealing Obamacare.Keisha Mosqueda, who is African-American, says Clinton knows more about the issues and that there's nothing Trump can say for either one of them that will change their mind.She says she usually votes Democrat and that now, her vote is guided by what she wants the future to look like for their 5-year-old son, Solomon.""I'm very concerned about him in the future (being) a minority male. That's something that's just always on my mind,"" Keisha Mosqueda says.Solomon might not yet understand the importance or effect of his parents votes could have in Georgia, but what does know is the color he plans to vote for.""Blue,"" Solomon says."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/22/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-america/index.html	"""Hillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change. And she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters,"" the Republican nominee said Saturday, 10 minutes into a speech billed by his senior aides as his ""closing argument"" in the presidential race.Trump's remark came as he argued that an outsider was needed to come into Washington and shake up the system, arguing that ""we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.""But his accusation that Clinton is running against all Americans is the latest in a long line of escalating attacks against Clinton, whom he has previously called ""the devil"" and said he would seek to jail should he be elected president.A message left with the Clinton campaign seeking response to Trump's comments was not immediately returned. But Christina Reynolds, a Clinton spokeswoman, called Trump's speech -- in which he also threatened to sue women who have accused him of sexual impropriety -- ""full of conspiracy theories.""""Today, in what was billed as a major closing argument speech, Trump's major new policy was to promise political and legal retribution against the women who have accused him of groping them,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""Like Trump's campaign, this speech gave us a troubling view as to what a Trump State of the Union would sound like -- rambling, unfocused, full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media and lacking in any real answers for American families.""Trump's served up the biting remark in a speech just 17 days from Election Day and following two weeks during which his campaign's chances of victory have plunged dramatically on the heels of the release of a 2005 tape in which Trump bragged about being able to grope and kiss women without their consent. Nearly a dozen women have since accused Trump of doing just that.Trump now faces a steep climb to victory, with most national and battleground state polling showing Clinton in the lead.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/donald-trump-gettysburg-speech-first-100-days/index.html	"Trump began his remarks here near the site of President Abraham Lincoln's ""Gettysburg Address"" by urging the country to follow Lincoln's example to ""heal the divisions"" the US now faces. But he quickly slipped into his combative rhetoric, slamming a ""totally rigged"" system and raging against establishment politicians and the media for seeking to sink his campaign.He slammed Hillary Clinton as an insider politician and accused her of ""running against change"" and ""all of the American people.""Hillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change. And she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters,"" Trump said.And before getting to what he would seek to accomplish in the first 100 days of his presidency -- which campaign aides said Friday evening would be the focus of his speech -- Trump went on to again attack women who have accused him of sexual assault or misconduct, saying, ""every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign"" and vowing to sue them after the election is over.Finally, 15 minutes later, Trump pivoted to his plan for the first 100 days of his presidency should he be elected in terms of ""measures,"" ""actions"" and legislative bills -- terms that gave his policies a more concrete and realistic flair.""I am asking the American people to dream big once again. What follows is my 100-day action plan to make America great again,"" he finally said, calling it ""a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American people.""Trump offered no new major policy announcements, instead mostly reiterating key plans of his presidential campaign and offering sparse new details.He promised to propose a constitutional amendment to impose congressional term limits, vowed again to begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 90s and announce his intention to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and promised to take a tough approach to countries like China that he believes are abusing free trade laws.He promised to cancel out every ""unconstitutional executive action"" enacted by President Barack Obama, cut federal funding to ""sanctuary cities,"" begin deporting undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes in the US and ""suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.""And that litany of proposals -- and several more -- is only what Trump vowed to accomplish on his first day in office, raising questions about the number of executive orders he would need to sign in order to uphold his promises.        Trump said his priorities would be to tackle corruption in Washington, protect American workers through protectionist trade measures and prevent illegal immigration and terrorism. He proposed up to 10 bills addressing those issues that he said he would work to pass in this first 100 days in office.As he laid out a bill to ""end illegal immigration,"" Trump offered up new details on how he would look to disincentive undocumented immigrants from crossing into the US, calling for a two-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for those who illegally re-enter the US and a five-year minimum sentence for those with prior felony convictions, multiple misdemeanors or two or more previous deportations.Currently, there is no mandatory minimum sentence, but undocumented immigrants who seek to re-enter the US can face up to two years in prison and those with felonies can face up to 10 years in prison.Trump also called for a hiring freeze on all federal employees -- except military and public health and safety officials -- as part of his ""six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington,"" though he did not say how long the freeze would last. The Republican nominee has also previously called for a freeze on new federal regulations and repeated Saturday that he would require federal agencies eliminate two federal regulations for every new one.'A time of division'While Trump opened his remarks by recognizing a former Republican president Lincoln's leadership ""at a time of division like we've never seen before,"" Trump quickly abandoned that hopeful tone in favor of blistering attacks on the media and establishment politicians in Washington, and once again cast doubt on the US democratic system by arguing that there could be rampant voter fraud on Election Day, despite evidence to the contrary.Trump accused the FBI and Department of Justice of having ""covered up"" Clinton's ""crimes"" given the Justice Department's decision not to pursue criminal charges after investigating Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.Christina Reynolds, a Clinton campaign spokeswoman, said Trump's speech presented a ""troubling view.""""Today, in what was billed as a major closing argument speech, Trump's major new policy was to promise political and legal retribution against the women who have accused him of groping them,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""Like Trump's campaign, this speech gave us a troubling view as to what a Trump State of the Union would sound like—rambling, unfocused, full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media, and lacking in any real answers for American families.""Trump also accused the ""dishonest mainstream media"" of being ""a major part of this corruption,"" accusing the press of fabricating stories to make him look ""as bad and even as dangerous as possible,"" before complaining about the media's insufficient coverage of the crowd sizes at his rallies.Trump took his complaints further, promising action to prevent AT&T from buying Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, which he argued would concentrate too much power in one company. And he also slammed Comcast's purchase of NBC.""We'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like it,"" he vowed. ""They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter.""As he sought to draw a heavy contrast with Clinton, who is leading Trump in most recent national and battleground state polls just over two weeks from the election, the Republican nominee urge voters to ""dream big once again"" and take a chance on his unconventional -- and controversial -- candidacy.""I'm asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been that central ingredient in the American character,"" he said."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/donald-trump-general-james-cartwright/index.html	"""We just had a four-star general, highly respected, Gen. (James) Cartwright, heard what happened yesterday. Could go to jail for five years because he supposedly told a lie to the FBI. And I don't know that it was even a lie. I don't know,"" Trump said at his last of three campaign rallies on Friday.Cartwright, a retired Marine Corps general, pleaded guilty on Monday to a charge of making false statements to federal investigators following an investigation into whether he leaked classified information to a reporter. Trump has pounced on the case to argue there has been a double standard in the FBI and Department of Justice's prosecution of such cases, citing the Justice Department's decision over the summer not to file criminal charges in the case of Hillary Clinton's private email server.But Trump on Friday took his criticism of the federal criminal justice system a step further by suggesting that Cartwright may not have actually lied to federal investigators.That suggestion flies in the face of Cartwright's guilty plea in federal court and comes on the heels of Trump arguing that the presidential election is ""rigged"" and rejecting the US intelligence community's conclusions that Russia has been behind a series of hacks of Democratic officials' emails -- all comments that could erode public trust in key US government institutions.""So you are pleading guilty because you are, in fact, guilty?"" US District Court Judge Richard Leon asked Cartwright in court on Monday.""Yes, sir,"" Cartwright answered under oath.Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about why Trump was questioning Cartwright's guilty plea or whether he was suggesting federal officials coerced Cartwright into admitting guilt.But Trump's remarks Friday evening fit a familiar pattern that the GOP nominee has increasingly laid out in recent weeks as his campaign has undergone its most tumultuous period.Beyond suggesting that the election is ""rigged,"" Trump has repeatedly argued there is an establishment conspiracy looking to sink his campaign, warned his supporters about voter fraud on Election Day -- overstating those extremely rare occurrences -- and refused to pledge to abide by the results of the presidential election, even if he should lose.""I will look at it at the time,"" Trump said at the GOP debate on Wednesday after he was asked whether he would concede the election should he lose.Even as he sought to clean up that response the next day by saying he would ""accept a clear election result,"" Trump continued to cast on the legitimacy of the results by saying he was reserving his ""right to contest or fie a legal challenge.""And as he's been pressed in recent weeks over the hacking of Democratic officials' emails, which US officials have said Russian intelligence services are responsible, Trump has refused to accept that conclusion, instead saying he was not convinced Russia was responsible and suggesting it could even be ""a 400-pound man."" Those remarks come even as Trump has received two classified intelligence briefings from US officials.Trump's criticism of the FBI predates the Cartwright case.The Republican nominee has for months alleged that the heads of the FBI and Department of Justice colluded with the Clintons to save the former secretary of state from prosecution, rather than accepting the Justice Department's decision.But the Cartwright case has provided Trump with fresh fodder to continue to do so.""What happened to the FBI, I don't know,"" Trump said during the debate on Wednesday. ""We have a great general, four-star general ... going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI, one lie. She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress and to the FBI. He's going to probably go to jail ... and she gets away with it and she can run for the presidency of the United States?""While Cartwright pleaded guilty to a charge that carries a maximum five-year prison sentence, his plea agreement states that he should face no more than six months in prison."
