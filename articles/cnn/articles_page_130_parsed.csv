""Carr's comments seemed to contradict remarks made by Trump during the forum in which he denied there was any connection between the two events. ""They were saying this is practice for Sunday,"" Trump said. ""This isn't practice. This has nothing to do with Sunday.""The forum, which was billed by the campaign as a town hall, featured a two-minute countdown clock, which Carr said Trump somewhat observed.  Chris Christie, Trump's debate coach, also attended the event. ""There was a countdown clock on the floor,"" Carr told Lemon. ""He ... was actually paying more attention to the clock than I thought and he actually delivered some of the answers in less than two minutes.""The questions at Thursday's forum were hand chosen by Carr, who is a Trump supporter. In Sunday's town hall in St. Louis, half the questions will come from uncommitted voters. ABC's Martha Raddatz and CNN's Anderson Cooper will moderate that event."

""They need someone who will stand with them, not another Washington politician who talks about their safety and votes to undermine it.""But in the mid-1990s, Ross found herself in a different position, urging the North Carolina courts to impose a lenient sentence on a 13-year-old who sexually assaulted his 23-year-old neighbor -- with the victim's 20-month-old son watching in the same room. The state Supreme Court rejected Ross' push, sentencing Andre Green to life in prison for what it said was a ""heinous"" crime.The two-decade-old case, which has received scant public attention until now, is surfacing as the Democrat finds herself in a surprisingly close race against Republican Sen. Richard Burr -- a contest that could now determine the next Senate majority. Before spending 10 years in the state House, Ross was a top attorney for a decade with the North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, a liberal group advocating for individual's constitutional rights. And over the course of four years, Ross made a proactive public and private push to urge the state courts to try Green as a juvenile, something that the state Supreme Court said could have set him free within four years time. In her friend-of-the-court brief, Ross acknowledged the brutality of the crime and said Green should be punished.But she argued that if the Supreme Court upheld Green's conviction, it would create a bad precedent on transferring juveniles to the adult court system. She said doing so with Green would serve ""no broad utilitarian goal.""  Green was indicted just two months before a new state law was set to take effect removing mandatory life-time sentences for first-degree sexual offenses. Since the state had also just lowered the age from 14 to 13 where juveniles could be tried as adults, Green would be the first and only 13-year-old in the state sentenced to life for a first-degree sexual offense -- something critics like Ross believed amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.""Andre admittedly committed a grave crime, but he is not a street hardened, calculating and experienced and vicious criminal, deserving of life imprisonment at age 13. He could have benefited from five years of rehabilitative services in the juvenile court system,"" said the brief, which was signed by Ross and two other attorneys. ""This case is simply one of the least suitable from going over to adult court.""But the court disagreed, upholding his conviction on charges of a first-degree sexual offense, burglary and attempted rape for what it called a ""highly vicious"" crime.""The cruelty of the attack, its predatory nature toward an essential stranger, defendant's refusal to accept full responsibility, his difficulty controlling his temper, his previous record and his unsupportive family situation all suggest defendant is not particularly suited to the purpose and type of rehabilitation dominant in the juvenile system,"" the court, in a 4-3 ruling, said.Ross declined to be interviewed about her views on the case. But in a statement Friday, Ross told CNN that Green ""needed to be locked up.""""I have worked to protect women and families my entire career and have personally supported rape survivors,"" Ross said in the statement. ""As I said at the time, this rape was a violent crime and the perpetrator needed to be locked up. I know how important it is for justice to be served in these tragedies and of course violent criminals should be put behind bars.""Ross' campaign argued that the candidate had long pushed for stricter penalties for sex crimes. Officials cited her push for minimum prison sentences for adults who commit sex crimes against children, her effort to bring the state into compliance with the Violence Against Women Act and cosponsoring legislation to bolster law enforcement efforts to track domestic violence.Asked about the Green case, Helen Hare, a senior communications adviser for the Ross campaign, said research shows that children sent to adult prisons may ultimately ""undermine public safety.""""ACLU's engagement in the case in no way disputed the survivor's clear need for justice,"" Hare said. ""Instead, it raised a serious question about a scenario in which any child as young as 13 could be tried as an adult and sentenced to life in adult prison, without so much as the application of clear, objective standards across cases.""Gruesome crime and an 'unsuccessful' rape attemptAccording to court documents and the police report reviewed by CNN, Green broke a glass door to enter his neighbor's home in the middle of a rainy night in 1994, after stalking her for six weeks. She immediately called 911, but Green - who was large for his age, standing at  roughly 5-foot-10, 180 pounds -- ripped the phone out of the socket. He swung at her with a broomstick, which broke apart after it hit a golf club she was using to defend herself. Green punched the woman upwards of 15 times, tore off her clothes and used his fingers to penetrate her, while performing oral sex on her. The victim accused Green of penetrating her ""once or twice"" with his penis, according to court documents. He only stopped when the police arrived, running out the front door of the house -- despite threatening to ""rip her insides out,"" the records say. She was badly injured and bruised, while her son who witnessed the attack, she said, was emotionally scarred.In her amicus brief to the state Supreme Court, Ross contended that Green came from a broken home, had no criminal past and had a very low IQ -- and would benefit from years of rehabilitation through the juvenile system. The brief argued that Green ""unsuccessfully"" attempted to rape the victim. ""Andre, a borderline retarded child of thirteen with no previous criminal history, broke and entered into the victim's home and upon being discovered by the female victim, attempted, unsuccessfully, to rape her,"" Ross' brief said. ""When confronted by police, Andre confessed the crime.""Ross and attorneys said in the brief that they believed that the attempted rape is a serious crime and that Green should be punished.""But when it is committed by a borderline retarded 13-year-old with no previous criminal record, the child's best interest in this situation needs to be fully and completely assessed before the transfer decision is made,"" the brief said. It added that he was transferred to adult court in a manner ""totally lacking in fundamental fairness,"" they argued.In 1994, the Justice Department used the term ""unsuccessful"" in characterizing attempted rape cases, something lawyers cited as well in court.A five-month windowSoon after Green was indicted in 1994, Ross urged the ACLU Legal Committee to consider helping the teen's cause, making the case in a private memo about the implications for trying him as an adult. She also petitioned an appeals court that year in an attempt to argue against trying Green as an adult, while also working directly with Green's defense attorney to discuss strategy, according to memos reviewed by CNN.And part of her argument centered on the fact that Green's crime occurred in a five-month window -- in between the time the state lowered the age to 13 for juveniles to be tried as adults and right before the removal of mandatory life-time sentences for first-degree sexual offenses.Ross had a sympathetic North Carolina justice in Henry Frye, who dissented from the majority opinion by saying that a life sentence for Green amounted to ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. He also said it was unfair for Green to be subject to such a stiff offense right before the law removing the mandatory life sentences took effect.But in the majority opinion, the court flatly disagreed.""The fact that defendant was the only thirteen-year-old who chose to commit this heinous offense and thereby suffer the otherwise uniform and acceptable punishment prescribed is due to his own timing and nothing more than happenstance,"" it said."

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/election-2016-polarized-cities-crowdpac/index.html	Green Bay, Wisconsin tops the list of most polarized cities in America according to an analysis by Crowdpac. The Silicon Valley start-up ranked more than 300 cities, in which, there were at least 1,000 political donations since 2008 by looking at campaign contributions at the local, state and federal level to determine how big the ideological divide is. The findings reveal that some regions of the country, including the conservative South, are more polarized than others. Of the top 100 cities, more than half, 53%, were in the South, compared with 30% in the West and 17% in the Midwest. None of the 100 most polarized cities were located in the Northeast. Texas is home to the largest number of highly-polarized cities. Of the top 100 cities, 18 are located in the Lone Star State. Texas is also home to five of the top 10 most polarized cities. The country's least divided area appears to be in the San Francisco Bay area, according to Crowdpac's analysis of political contributions. Berkeley, California had the lowest score on the scale. Albany and Oakland, which are right next door to Berkeley, were the next least divided. San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Richmond, California, were also near the bottom of the list. Areas in the Northeast, including around Boston, were also well represented in the least divided side of the list. Crowdpac gave each of the cities a polarization score, calculated by analyzing donors' pattern of political contributions over time. The more polarized a city is, the higher the score. Cities were ranked based on the widest gap between conservative and liberal donors who live there.	The 100 most polarized US cities	['Cruz']	[]

""There's nobody that has more respect for women than I do.""Hillary Clinton's campaign has seized on Trump's most infamous public statements, using them in a host of TV advertisements aimed at different groups of voters. In one ad, shots of young girls assessing their appearance in front of a mirror are interspersed with clips of Trump insulting various women over the years.""She's a slob,"" he can be heard saying in the spot. ""She ate like a pig.""Polls have shown Clinton with wide leads among female voters, including white and college-educated women, a group that GOP nominee Mitt Romney won over President Barack Obama four years ago.In his interview Wednesday, Trump dismissed the notion that he has had to work at dialing back his tone in order to win over some of those voters.""It's not a question of trying,"" he said.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/politics/presidential-debate-dnc/index.html	"To deliver what the DNC is billing its ""closing argument"" of the 2016 election, it will launch a surrogate-led bus tour through more than 20 states. It will begin Sunday in St. Louis, the site of the highly anticipated second debate between Clinton and Donald Trump. The tour will aim to hammer home both President Barack Obama's legacy as well as Clinton's vision. Borrowing from the campaign slogans of both Obama and Clinton, the bus tour will be billed ""Forward Together.""While the DNC is still developing its full lineup of surrogates, celebrities and activists, civil rights leader and former presidential candidate Rev. Jesse Jackson and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill will hit the road on Sunday with DNC interim chair Donna Brazile. The sheer number of well-known officials backing Clinton has given the Democratic nominee an important advantage over Trump, whom few of his party's well-known politicians have fully embraced. This summer, the lineup of speakers and attendees at the Republican convention -- and the decision by many prominent GOP officials to skip the event altogether -- was in stark contrast to the Democratic gathering. The DNC tour will feature two buses. One will travel around Midwestern states before driving to the West Coast, while the second bus will kick off in Ohio next week and eventually end up in Florida (the final number of states and trajectory of the buses are subject to change).The Forward Together tour will focus its efforts on voter registration and early-voting, mirroring the Clinton campaign's strategy in the homestretch of the election. Its primary targets will include middle-class families, women, millennial voters and minorities. ""We're hitting the road and taking our message to as many cities and towns as we can, helping Democrats win up and down the ballot from the White House to the courthouse,"" Brazile said in a statement."

Mike Pence for his. ""He came on too hot,"" Durbin said. ""And I noticed that and Tim is a great fella and a good friend of mine. And I thought Gov.

I don't think it's gonna change the presidential race one vote.""Durbin went on to agree with the host that Pence struggled to defend what he called Donald Trump's ""indefensible"" positions, but argued that how Kaine looked away from the camera might have affected the audience's impression of his sincerity.""Here was Kaine kind of turned away from the camera, slightly, talking off into space,"" Durbin said. ""Here was Pence looking at the camera. Those little things make a difference in the impression on the audience as to your sincerity.

I have the hotel here, I will tell you I'm going to take a look at it because so many people here are talking about it. I'll take a look at it, and the next time you interview me, I'll have an answer,"" Trump said.Asked a follow up about concerns the repository would hurt tourism, Trump again sidestepped.""No. 1 is safety and it is a little too close to major population, so I will take a look at it and I will have an opinion,"" the Republican presidential nominee said.Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, the retiring Senate minority leader who has fought Yucca his entire Senate career -- and whose political machine will be critical in deciding next month's winner here -- jumped on Trump's lack of a direct answer.""Trump told us we pronounce our state wrong; then he refused to take stance on Yucca,"" Reid tweeted. ""It's pronounced Nev-AD-a and Yucca Mountain is dead.""Yucca Mountain was intended to be the long-term solution for storing commercial nuclear waste currently being stored at sites throughout the country. Beginning with studies in the 1980s and what was known as the ""Screw Nevada"" bill that cemented Yucca as the only site to be considered, the plan has been fought in Congress, courts and administrative agencies. The Obama administration -- and Reid -- have stopped any progress, but given that there is still no solution to the nuclear waste issue, there is no guarantee a Yucca closure will be permanent.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in January told the Las Vegas Sun that ""Yucca should be off the table."" She added a call for ""a continuing science-based effort to try to figure out what to do about nuclear waste."""
