But now, polling has the state at a dead heat, and Republicans are working hard to turn it red for Donald Trump.The outcome of those efforts is critical to Trump's path to the presidency, and Republicans admit they can't win the White House without Iowa. Officials on the ground are optimistic. The path to victory is right here in this map""We are ready for change and Mr. Trump brings that change,"" said Eric Branstad, who is running Trump's Iowa campaign.Branstad, the son of Iowa's longtime GOP governor, Terry Branstad, says he sees first hand that Trump is reaching beyond the traditional Iowa GOP base.""I have gone to Republican rallies my entire life. I should know everybody when I go in there,"" Branstad told CNN during an interview at the Iowa headquarters Trump's campaign shares with the Republican National Committee. ""We are seeing new voters like we've never seen before.""This year, Branstad says seeing support for Trump in areas of the state that have gone blue in past presidential cycles. ""What we're seeing is that Mr. Trump's message in eastern Iowa is resonating,"" he said. ""And you take eastern Iowa and Republican rich western Iowa -- we're going to put those together and we're going to win on November 8.""Some Iowa voters will have cast their ballots long before Election Day. Early voting has already been underway for over a month in Iowa, which in the past has given Democrats a head start that leads to their victory. ""I mean literally hundreds of times I've had Republicans tell me, 'No, I want to vote on Election Day.' You know, and for them it's tradition that they've grown up with,"" said Jeff Kauffman, Iowa's Republican Party chairman.This year Iowa GOP officials are trying to bank more early votes to better compete. At a Trump rally in Cedar Rapids last week, volunteers walked around with clip boards giving out information on how to cast early absentee ballots, encouraging Republicans not to wait until Election Day.So far Republicans are doing better than they did in 2012, but are still lagging with 33.9% of the early vote compared to 43.2% from Democrats.Clinton is working hard to win Iowa in these final days, too. The day of Trump's Cedar Rapids event, Clinton had her own just hours earlier down the road, followed by an evening rally in Des Moines.  For Democrats, this year the challenge is that Iowa has never been Clinton country. Her stunning loss in the 2008 Iowa Democratic caucuses was the beginning of the end of that campaign, and her 2016 win against Bernie Sanders was a struggle.Iowa Democratic Party chairwoman Andy McGuire says she takes solace in the fact that poll numbers earlier this fall showing Trump up in Iowa have tightened to a neck-and-neck race.  Trump, Clinton battle for New Hampshire  ""I was disappointed when we saw that Trump was doing well, but now we're a toss-up state which is what we thought we were before,"" McGuire told us in an interview at a get out the vote event in Des Moines. She insists Sanders voters, mostly millennials at Iowa's college campuses, are coming home to Clinton, and notes they're doing well with women.              ""It's a great coalition. It's made of really every kind of group,"" she said.Iowa Democrats argue voters are fired up -- especially against Trump. ""They do not want someone who's not fit to be president. And they're gonna vote for Hillary Clinton,"" said McGuire.Democrats also insist their get-out-the-vote operation is superior, and that will be what pushes Clinton over the finish line in Iowa. ""It is a toss-up state. And it is gonna come down to that organization, and I think that's what's gonna get us the win,"" said McGuire.                    Republicans admit their grassroots organization in 2012 in Iowa and other battleground states was lagging, but point to efforts the Republican National Committee made to build new modern technology -- including a phone app for volunteers to record voter contacts -- technology Democrats had been far ahead with in the Obama years.Clinton hopes early vote will seal Nevada victoryStill, Republicans say what will drive their vote more than anything else is enthusiasm and especially opposition to Hillary Clinton. In Iowa, like in many battleground states, the race could come down to the difference between organization -- and enthusiasm.""You know, I will give Hillary Clinton one compliment. She has made the environment wonderful for Republicans,"" said Kauffman, the Iowa GOP chairman.And with Iowa squarely in the must-win category for Republicans, the question now is whether their efforts and all that enthusiasm will be enough for Trump to win Iowa's six crucial electoral votes."

1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/fbi-comey-election-2016-clinton-trump/index.html	"Hillary Clinton's supporters were already fuming after FBI Director James Comey revived the specter of her email scandal in the tense final days of the presidential election, a move that played right into Donald Trump's hands.But their frustrations -- and suspicions -- intensified Tuesday when the FBI suddenly released redacted files about its 2001 probe into President Bill Clinton's pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich. In an election hinging on voter perceptions of character and trustworthiness, the move revived memories of yet another political fracas surrounding the Clinton family. That leaves the FBI in an unprecedented position: very publicly at the center of a presidential race one week out from the election. The apolitical agency's actions over the past four days are leaving the FBI exposed to arguments from Democrats -- and some Republicans -- that it is improperly intervening in the fight between Clinton and Trump. And it ensures that Comey, who was once a registered Republican and contributed to GOP nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney, will remain in the spotlight for the remainder of the campaign.Hillary Clinton's challenge: Shift focus back to Trump""It's another very puzzling development. We are in the final stages of an important presidential campaign,"" Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic congressman from New York who supports Clinton, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" ""Because of the FBI's actions, we are talking about emails, Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old pardon.""He continued: ""That doesn't make any sense and it undermines the integrity of the democratic process. The FBI and the director owe the American people an explanation as to what is going on.""No political motiveThe FBI sought to make clear there was no political motive around the sudden appearance of the Rich documents, saying they were released in line with procedures relating to Freedom of Information Act filings.""These materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI's public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures,"" the statement said.But before the statement, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon questioned the timing of the release — nearly 16 years after Bill Clinton left the White House but only seven days before the election involving his wife.""Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s?"" Fallon tweeted.Comey, the most powerful FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover, has long been seen as someone who plays it by the book. But the recent controversy has moved the FBI deeper into the partisan crossfire where his legendary predecessor operated for half-a-century.The new review of emails potentially tied to Clinton's private server won't likely be finished before Tuesday's election.Paul Ryan avoids talking Trump as he stumps for a GOP White HouseBut it's not just the email issue that is infuriating Democrats. The FBI's refusal to comment on several pending investigations into prominent members of Republican nominee Donald Trump's orbit is also causing waves.Democrats want to know why Comey notified Congress about the new email situation but won't spill details of investigations into alleged Kremlin ties of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and former foreign policy advisor Carter Page.Legal and intelligence considerations may prevent Comey from revealing those details.But that reality is unlikely to placate Democrats who are watching Clinton's lead over Trump ebb in national polls.'This needs to stop'""This needs to stop. Director Comey has called for transparency, but has now withdrawn from public view,"" Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement. ""The American people need to know why he decided to withhold information about Russian interference while reigniting email hysteria without any substantiation. He needs to clean up this mess.""The FBI has been conducting multiple investigations that include allegations of connections between Russia and the Trump campaign or people who support his candidacy, according to CNN sources. None so far have yielded proof of criminal connections between the Russian government and the Republican nominee or his campaign.Former CIA acting director Michael Morell, a Clinton supporter, vigorously criticized Comey, his former colleague in the intelligence community, over his actions on the email situation.""I think he was trying to protect his organization,"" Morell said in an interview with David Axelrod for his ""The Axe Files"" podcast. ""But as (former Attorney General) Eric Holder wrote in The Washington Post over the weekend in response to Comey's actions, people make mistakes. And I think (Comey) made a series of terrible mistakes here.""Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook also laid into Comey. On CNN's ""New Day,"" he complained of a double standard operating for Clinton and Trump.""We just want fairness,"" Mook said. Comey ""thought it was perfectly fine for the FBI to send a letter to Capitol Hill about information they had never looked at and say, 'Hey, we have some information, Republican Chairmen.'""But GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, dismissed suggestions that Comey had parachuted into the final stage of a presidential race to play politics.'Known for his integrity'""When it comes to Jim Comey, I have known him for 20 years,"" McCaul told Blitzer. ""He has always been known for his integrity, a straight shooter ... he is not a partisan guy, you have had Republicans mad at him and now Democrats.""And one prominent Democrat, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, warned the Clinton campaign's attacks on Comey could backfire.""I wouldn't do that,"" Rendell said on 1210 WPHT Philadelphia radio. ""Again, you know, I'm not running the campaign by any means, but I wouldn't do that.""Rendell, however, allowed that ""the more that comes out about this, the stranger it is,"" he said. ""Like the agents had this material or knew about the existence of the material at the beginning of October and didn't tell the director until the end of October. That makes no sense at all.""Amid the political turmoil, Comey came face-to-face with some of his critics Tuesday, including former attorneys general Holder and Michael Mukasey, at a memorial service for former prosecutor David Margolis at the Great Hall of the Justice Department.No one mentioned the current storm swirling around the FBI.But Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and several other speakers noted the department's ideals of pursuing the rule of law no matter which political party is in power. "	The FBI keeps showing up in this election	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'McCain', 'Wolf', 'Hill', 'McCaul', 'Paul', 'Lynch']	[]
2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/election-2016-hip-hop-vote-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/index.html	"The unbalanced force in this case is Donald Trump, whose name for years was invoked to signify wealth and power in hip-hop lyrics, but who is now driving artists who had supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders back toward Hillary Clinton.Enthusiasm for Sanders during the Democratic primary drove energy away from Clinton, often putting her on the defense over issues like criminal justice reform, her ties to Wall Street and her position as a longstanding leader in the Democratic establishment. Rappers like Lil B, who backed Clinton as early as 2014 in an anthem dedicated to former President Bill Clinton, jumped ship to rally behind the Vermont Senator, who consistently won the majority of young voters throughout the primary. But now a very public, impassioned and often bitter rejection of Donald Trump from the hip-hop community, has been driving energy back to Clinton. ""I will be voting for Hillary yes!!! If not bernie then her,"" Lil B texted CNN earlier this month. ""Even tho I am republican cuz im a businessman but my views and heart are democratic and for the people.""That's not a universal opinion in the hip-hop community. Diddy, who led the ""Vote or Die"" campaign in 2004, criticized Clinton in September and said that until she directly engages with the black community, people need to ""hold"" their votes. But Charlamagne Tha God, who co-hosts one of the most popular hip-hop radio shows in America, told CNN that with Trump as the GOP nominee, people ""can't afford"" not to vote for for the Democrat.Hip-hop's attitude toward both Trump and Clinton has undergone an incredible evolution this year; Trump has gone from being an object of respect to a pariah in rap lyrics. Clinton, who has been much less of a presence -- a peripheral character -- has become a subject of songs in her own right.CHECK OUT:  Our CNN Politics original series, where artists #GetPolitical What new lyrics tell us about 2016An in-depth review of thousands of hip-hop lyrics found 318 mentions of Trump between 1989 and 2016 and 101 mentions of Hillary Clinton or the Clintons as a couple, from 1993 thru 2016. The latter figure excludes the prolific references to Bill Clinton alone or references to Monica Lewinsky.Those numbers take into account an uptick in mentions over the past year. There were a total of 83 songs by 70 different artists that came out between 2015-2016 mentioning Trump and the vast majority of the lyrics condemn the Republican nominee and his politics. Meanwhile, the review identified only 18 songs by 17 artists -- 8 in 2015 and 10, so far, in 2016 -- that mention Clinton.""These guys who come out against Trump are not coming out pro-Hillary,"" hip-hop educator Omekongo Dibinga told CNN. ""A lot of the rappers, when Obama was running, they were actively Obama.""When YG released ""FDT,"" which stands for ""F*** Donald Trump,"" in March, the self-proclaimed ""non-political"" rapper quickly rose to become one of rap's most outspoken Trump critics.But when asked if he plans on voting for Clinton, YG said that he might not vote at all because he doesn't even know ""if our votes count.""""Out of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, I would rather Clinton be president but just overall, I would rather Obama have a third term,"" YG told CNN in August.Compared to the hip-hop community's full-throated and raw endorsement of Obama in 2008 in songs like Jeezy's ""My President (is black),"" the embrace of Clinton is tepid at best.Read: Jeezy reflects on Obama and criminal justice reformClinton supporter and former South Carolina state Representative Bakari Sellers argues that 2016 and 2008 are incomparable because Clinton can't compete with the first black president.""Hillary Clinton is not as symbolic as Barack Obama,"" Sellers said, ""but what is very symbolic is that rap and hip-hop -- the reason it exists -- it tells the pain that these communities come from, and there's no better example of that pain than Donald Trump.""Some examples of positions that put Trump at odds with the vast majority of the hip-hop community: In 2012 Trump became the most prominent voice in the birther movement, questioning Obama's birthplace and the authenticity of his birth certificate and he still insists that the Central Park Five are guilty. And in 2016, Trump slammed the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement, accused civil rights groups of instigating some killings of police officers, called for more cops on the streets and vowed to investigate the group if he becomes President.While she rarely factors into their lyrics, some of hip-hop's biggest names including Beyoncé, Kanye West, Jay Z, Snoop Dogg, Jeezy and most recently, Chance the Rapper, backed Clinton as early as 2014.Los Angeles rapper Ty Dolla $ign, who raps, ""I don't f*** with Donald Trump, he don't like us,"" in the 2015 remix of ""Blasé,"" said that while ""nobody is excited"" about Clinton, she has his vote.""Hillary, yeah, she lied about a couple of things, but wouldn't you rather have somebody who lies like every single human being instead of a racist?"" he told CNN.Trump's fall from hip-hop grace The first mentions of Trump begin in 1989 when the rising celebrity billionaire had already become a household name. Trump Tower in New York City and Trump's casinos in Atlantic City were powerful symbols of the Trump empire and were frequented by many rappers. Rapper and singer Lizzo cautioned that artists like to rap about money and ""Trump"" is an easy word to rhyme with, so a Trump mention is not necessarily a sign of respect for the man, himself, but respect for what he has.Nevertheless, mentions of the billionaire businessman have been overwhelmingly positive until he declared his bid for the presidency in June 2015.In DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince's 1989 song ""Numero Uno,"" Will Smith raps, ""Cause you're gambling just like craps at Trump,"" and in the duo's 1989 song, ""I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson,"" Smith raps, ""Me and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City."" In the 1994 song, ""211,"" Master P raps, ""Put more cash in my pockets than Donald Trump.""At the time, Trump was making appearances on shows like ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" and was hanging out with hip-hop moguls like Diddy and Russell Simmons.While Trump the businessman was largely free from scrutiny, Trump the politician has been passionately rejected, most recently in songs like Run the Jewels' ""Talk To Me"" and Eminem's ""Campaign Speech.""YG's anti-Trump anthem offers a direct reflection on the progression of Trump's symbolism in the hip-hop community over the years:""Me and all my peoples, we always thought he was straight. Influential m****f**** when it came to the business. But now, since we know how you really feel, this how we feel — F*** Donald Trump,"" YG raps.Jeezy went from rapping, ""Richest n**** in my hood, call me Donald Trump,"" in the 2011 song ""Trump,"" to dissing Trump as a rich businessman who doesn't care about people in an interview with CNN.""I was in the Trump Towers looking for some shower gel,"" Nicki Minaj raps in the 2011 song, ""New York Minute (remix)"", before backing Clinton in 2016 and calling Trump's campaign ""hilarious"" and ""childish.""Rick Ross, who rapped about Trump and his brand nine times since 2008, came under fire for his 2015 lyrics in ""Free Enterprise,"" where he raps, ""Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman.""And Mac Miller, who famously hailed Trump's status and power in the 2011 song ""Donald Trump,"" slammed him as a ""racist s** of a b****,"" who wants to ""make America white again.""In an emotional letter to his ""old friend"" Trump last December, hip-hop entrepreneur Simmons lamented the end of their friendship and urged Trump to ""stop fueling fires of hate.""Hip-hop legend KRS-One told CNN that while Trump ""was a friend to hip-hop in his early days"" and ""was closer to the urban community"" in the 90s, things have changed.""When we say, look, Donald Trump was a friend to hip-hop back in the day, so was Bill Clinton. It doesn't mean that because he was a friend to hip-hop back in the day, that the same Bill Clinton wasn't at the lead of this mass incarceration of African Americans today,"" KRS-One said.Mass incarceration haunts ClintonOver the last 25 years, hip-hop artists have expressed mixed feelings towards Hillary Clinton, ranging from affection and loyalty, to skepticism, cynicism and distrust.The first mentions of Clinton came out in 1993, when Bill Clinton began his first term as President. Early lyrics show that issues like criminal justice reform began to haunt the Democratic nominee early on and continued through 2016.""Talkin' to the commander-in-chief of the army Mr. Bill Clinton and the bird Hillary/ Wrap up the war/ Wrap up the war on the brutality/ I want to see more happy people,"" Prince Ital Joe raps in the 1993 song, ""Happy People.""Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham/ Cause I can tell you now it's gonna turn out rotten,"" Ice Cube raps in the 2008 song, ""Stand Tall."" And in the 2016 song ""Let Me Know,"" The Game raps, ""Trump and Hillary both cons/ Backstab us like the bullets in back of LaQuan.""But perhaps the most direct and impassioned rebuke of Clinton comes from Tef Poe, a St. Louis rapper, who became one of the most outspoken activists following the police shooting death of Michael Brown and the unrest that followed in Ferguson.Tef Poe admonishes the Democratic nominee in the 2015 song, ""Hillary,"" and declares that he will withhold his vote.""Hillary Clinton still tellin' lies on the channel ... so Democrats never did ride for me .... we don't want no more Bill Clinton hand-me-downs,"" he raps.Karen Civil, a hip-hop media entrepreneur and author, says that while what happened in the past is ""an unfortunate situation,"" Clinton is now ""taking accountability"" by meeting with activists and engaging with rappers like Pusha T on solutions.""I can't fault her for things she did ten years ago but I can applaud her for things she's doing now,"" Civil, who hosted several rallies for Clinton, said. Lizzo, who prefers Clinton ""a million times"" over Trump, expressed more cynicism in the political system.""The country was already racist no matter who's going to be the head of it,"" she said. ""... Really, it's just like choosing which mouthpiece would you rather hear this policy that's already taking place.""Jay Z to headline concert for Hillary ClintonPandering vs. reaching outFrom being accused of pandering after telling ""The Breakfast Club"" that she always carries hot sauce in her purse (something Clinton has been known for over the years), to mispronouncing Beyoncé's name, Clinton's efforts to reach out to the hip-hop community have sometimes backfired.Charlamagne Tha God, who interviewed Clinton on the ""The Breakfast Club"" twice, accused the Democratic nominee of ""pandering to black people in the worst possible ways."" He confronted her for mispronouncing Beyoncé's name, criticized a tweet in which she wished African Americans ""Happy Kwanza"" and joked about the time she dabbed to ""Trap Queen"" on ""Ellen.""""The planet is collapsing, economies are crashin', and Hillary Clinton is dabbin',"" Chris Webby raps in the 2016 song, ""Dapiff (Freeverse Series Episode 4).""Meanwhile, Rich the Kid raps, ""Hillary hit the dab, Ima vote,"" in the 2016 song, ""Rich the GOAT.""""One of my cautionary tales to Hillary Clinton was please do not pander,"" Sellers, who was instrumental in making ""The Breakfast Club"" interview happen says, ""Because your history with the African American community is what we want to build on.""Lizzo said that doing the ""whip and the nae nae to appeal to a demographic sort of feels condescending,"" but even if Clinton's efforts are ""for vanity's sake,"" they are better than Trump's lack of initiative.Bill Clinton boost expires, Obama boost kicks inA previous analysis of songs that came out prior to Clinton's presidential run, found that some of the most positive references to the Democratic nominee are ones in which she is tied to her husband.Bill Clinton became known as America's first black president, based in part on a Toni Morrison essay and his cultural connections with African Americans. Civil said that for some older black voters, like her father, the Bill Clinton boost is still in effect. But in the age of ""Black Lives Matter,"" younger voters don't share that same nostalgia for the 90s, they don't remember Clinton playing the saxophone on Arsenio Hall and to them, he was never the ""first black president."" ""Obama shattered that whole thing about Bill Clinton being that first black president,"" Dibinga said. ""I think Bill Clinton's time has passed.""In Atmosphere's 2016 song, ""When the Lights Go Out,"" Slug raps: ""By the time you hear the song I'll be signing it from down at the county jail, still filled to the maximum, so F*** bill Clinton with his saxophone.""But as the Bill Clinton boost expires for America's youth, the Clinton campaign has leaned on President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, who is arguably Clinton's most effective surrogate, repeatedly to campaign for the Democratic nominee in key battleground states.Michelle Obama: The Clinton surrogate that could finish off TrumpIn a fiery September speech delivered at his final Congressional Black Caucus dinner as President, Obama told black voters that he would consider it a ""personal insult"" to his legacy if they don't vote for Clinton.Civil, who said she is often asked why she avidly backs Clinton, cited her love for the Obamas.""Nobody can ever be Barack Obama. Barack Obama was our first black president,"" she said, but added that ""(Clinton) is going to continue on the legacy that Obama started."""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/donald-trump-ancestry-scotland/index.html	"It may surprise many to learn that Donald Trump, having campaigned so fiercely on the issue of curbing immigration, is himself the son of an economic migrant.Half of Donald Trump's DNA is Scottish. His late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born and raised on the remote and beautiful Scottish Isle of Lewis, before leaving as a 17-year-old for the United States to work as a domestic servant in 1930.CNN traveled to the far-flung island to trace Trump's roots, how his mother's origins may have shaped the presidential candidate, and how he is viewed there today.No strong affinityThe Isle of Lewis lies at Britain's most northwesterly edge, as far from Scotland's capital Edinburgh as Edinburgh is from London.The weather is often harsh and unrelenting; the wind whips your ears constantly. All that lies between the island and America are 3,000 miles of churning Atlantic waves.Amid a trove of birth, death and marriage certificates, local genealogist Bill Lawson talks us through Trump's family tree, which yields surprisingly tangible links to the US businessman-turned-politician. ""Donald"" is a name that repeatedly appears in the family and one ancestor was known as ""Red John"" for the distinctive-colored locks that were passed down to Trump.But for all these superficial connections, there is no strong affinity between the island and its residents and the divisive candidate today.'No interest in island roots'At his mother's former home, now home to his relatives, there is no hint of support for his presidential bid, no signs celebrating a son of the isle made good. The relatives who still live here aren't interested in speaking to CNN or other media outlets about their cousin, who once made a fleeting visit here, on his only trip as an adult to the island.""There is a strong perception in the islands that Donald has no interest whatsoever in his island roots,"" says Malcolm Maclean, an arts and heritage consultant on Lewis.The property mogul has only ever come to the island twice -- once as a 10-year-old, and again, on a brief side-visit during a business trip to Scotland in 2008. While he has played up his Scottish heritage, most locals feel he has little in common with them. For them, he is the antithesis of Lewis's collective history.Related: In the shadow of Trump's wallTrump's ancestors suffered in ""The Clearances"" -- a tragic, decades-long period of upheaval in Scotland, during which greedy landlords forced families from their homes. Two branches of Trump's family were forced from their homes in this way, becoming refugees in their own country -- the Macauleys forced from their homes in the west of the isle, the Smiths further south.You might expect some of that traumatic family history, a defining experience for Trump's ancestors, to have embedded itself into his outlook. But with Trump, who has railed against the notion of the US accepting refugees, that does not appear to be the case.""Donald has shown no evidence whatsoever of any interest, or even awareness of that background,"" says Maclean.The distrust of property barons and the fear of losing one's home runs deep on the island, permeating the residents' collective conscience. ""I think people to this day in the Highlands and islands have a deeply skeptical attitude to landlordism,"" says Maclean. ""It has a very negative history in this part of the world.""Yet today, Trump lives by the very trade that saw his family and hundreds of thousands of other Scots uprooted, thrown from their humble homes often with just the clothes on their backs, forced to start over. Trump could not have turned his back on those roots more if he had tried.Related: Melania Trump's American DreamTrump's maternal family treeTrump's mother, Mary Anne Macleod, was the product of generations of fisherman and farmers. She was born on Lewis in 1912, the youngest of 10 children.They lived in a thatched-roof, one-room cottage known as a ""black house"" on a croft -- a small agricultural landholding.Life in the tiny one-street village of Tong -- a few miles from Stornoway Harbor, at the time the only link to the outside world -- was precarious.In a good year they had just enough; in a bad year, life was even harder.""A small, narrow croft could feed one family of children, but if they wanted to get married and have children, where are they going to go?"" explains Lawson. ""They had to go somewhere.""So in 1930, aged 18, Mary Anne set out for the US to find a job in domestic service, as a number of her elder sisters had done.Due to the legacy of the clearances, says Maclean, ""there was a whole generation looking for a new life.""""She was categorically an economic migrant, her whole generation were,"" he says.While many who left typically planned to earn money for a few years before returning home, the realities of crofting made that difficult, explains Lawson.""It wasn't that easy to come home. There was nowhere to come home to in most cases as somebody else was in the house with the croft,"" he says.In Mary Anne's case, she never moved home. Six years after leaving for America she married Fred Trump, a real estate developer whose livelihood didn't go over well with some on the island.Trump's island traitsIn his 2015 book ""Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America,"" Trump suggests his Lewis roots are strong. He says he ""got religion"" from his mother, whose faith was founded in her upbringing on the island.Mary Anne ""would certainly have come from a strong religious background,"" says Rev. James McIver of the Free Church of Scotland. ""The church was very foundational and central to the community."" But, he says, the gambling businesses that form a significant part of Trump's business empire would not gain the approval of many of the island's faithful today. ""I would say his lifestyle nowadays would be regarded here today in those respects as an immoral one."" But perhaps there are some traces of Trump's Lewis roots to be found in the island's most famous son.The Protestant work ethic, says Maclean, would have been a formative influence on Trump's mother. ""She would be very accustomed to hard work,"" he says. ""Crofting, at that time in particular, was subsistence farming.""Related: Confessions from the campaign trailA far cry from Trump's business activities, certainly, but even his staunchest detractors could not deny the businessman's work ethic.And perhaps there's another legacy of his mother's island upbringing.Local man Derick Mackenzie set up the Facebook support page ""Isle of Lewis supports Trump for President."" (While Lewis has a population of 18,500, the site has mustered only 127 ""likes."")He sees something very relatable -- and admirable -- in the man running for president.""There is an expression you hear: 'Lewis straight talking',"" says Mackenzie. ""It's a kind of honesty... This kind of not being concerned with what people think. They will give it to you between the eyes.""Perhaps Trump owes more to the island than just the hair."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-events/index.html	"On Tuesday alone, Hillary Clinton's campaign hosted more than 10 events around the country with  big-name headliners hitting Florida, Wisconsin, Colorado, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina and Ohio, where President Barack Obama pushed early voting.Donald Trump's side is no less busy, but his bench is shorter, with the nominee, his family, and running mate Mike Pence doing the bulk of the work. Trump alone is on pace to hit four states in three days, with four stops in Florida alone. His son, Donald Jr., was in Iowa on Tuesday, and his children will be hitting Michigan later in the week. So what does it all mean -- what do these breakneck itineraries tell us?Actually, quite a bit.The campaigns' decisions right now offer a unique insight into how they view the race to 270 electoral votes -- they tell us about the states still in play and the demographics of voters the campaigns see as key to victory. In the final days of this increasingly tight contest, both Clinton and Trump will be thinking about where to deploy their precious human resources. And the places they choose to visit can be just as telling as those they skip.Clinton's deep roster of surrogates allows her to defend precious blue states like Colorado and Wisconsin while simultaneously keeping leading figures focused on battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio. Trump doesn't have the same star-studded lineup to stump for him in places he can't be.Here is a detailed at look at where Trump, Clinton and their most dedicated allies will be directing their attentions over the coming days. Team ClintonHillary ClintonTuesday, November 1: Clinton campaigned outside Tampa, Florida -- a state in which she had already spent two of the past three days. Her weekend travels took her to Daytona Beach and Miami, where she appeared onstage with Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony at a ""Get Out The Vote"" concert.Tampa, Daytona Beach and Miami offer distinct demographic opportunities and challenges. Tampa is in Hillsborough county, often the most hotly contested counties in the state, while Daytona Beach -- where Clinton made a pregame appearance at a Bethune‑Cookman University football game -- has a sizable African-American population. Miami, of course, offered a chance to run up the score, especially among Latino voters, in the Democratic stronghold.How hip-hop turned on Trump and settled for Clinton in 2016Wednesday, November 2: Clinton heads to the normally deep-red state of Arizona. Both its senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, oppose Trump (McCain after some hedging) and polls show the state's 11 electoral votes within reach. But this stop, like Trump's planned foray into Wisconsin, could also be a ploy designed to set the other side on its heels -- forcing them to spend resources on defending a traditionally Republican state. Thursday, November 3: Clinton hits North Carolina with Sanders, which means one thing: Get the kids to the polls. Sanders was and remains a popular figure with left-leaning, younger Democrats, so anytime you see him on the schedule, expect that it's part of a plan to whip up millennial voters.Friday, November 4: Clinton appears with hip hop star Jay-Z in Ohio, where early voting is underway and Clinton needs to run up a big margin in cities like Cleveland, with its considerable African-American and youth vote.Saturday, November 5: Clinton will end the day in Philadelphia, for a concert headlined by Katy Perry -- another move to get the youth vote off the couch and enthused and help appeal to professional, highly educated women in the city and suburbs. (Trump is making a similar play by sending wife Melania Trump to speak in the Philadelphia suburbs this week.)President Barack ObamaTuesday, November 1: Obama hits Columbus, Ohio, home to Ohio State University and more young voters the Clinton campaign needs to keep the incumbent's coalition intact.Obama's final mission: Help Clinton close the dealWednesday, November 2: Then to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and the University of North Carolina. Again, the goal here is to get out students and the highly-educated voters that tend to live in and around college towns.Thursday, November 3: The President then heads to Miami, Florida, a vote-heavy metropolis where he will appeal to the diverse cohort we now commonly refer to as the ""Obama coalition."" Miami-Dade County delivered more than 6-in-10 of its votes for him in a narrow 2012 statewide contest.Vice President Joe BidenTuesday, November 1: Biden hit Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday -- another chance to appeal to the white, working-class vote that has been resistant to Clinton yet looks at the vice president as one of their own.Wednesday, November 2: Then it's on to Tampa -- at the center of swinging Hillsborough County. Then it's on to Palm Beach and its population of seniors, a group with which Biden has always performed well.Vice presidential nominee Tim KaineTuesday, November 1: Kaine was in Wisconsin, playing defense in a state Democrats haven't lost in decades. Wednesday, November 2: It's off to Iowa, where the native Midwesterner -- Kaine was born in Minnesota and grew up on the Kansas City area -- will try to make some inroads in a state that Trump has consistently led in the polls.(Update: This visit has been canceled following an ambush that killed two police officers in Iowa early Wednesday.)Thursday, November 3: A day after Clinton, Kaine is set to visit Arizona (Phoenix and Tucson) himself -- another example of the Democratic ticket having the resources to put a sustained effort into an unlikely state.Former President Bill ClintonTuesday, November 1: With the nominee nearby, Bill Clinton made three stops in southern Florida on Tuesday, including events in Florida City and Immokalee. Both cities are minority-majority, a good play for Bill Clinton, who remains extremely popular among African Americans, a community that early-voting estimates suggest may not be turning out for the Democratic nominee in as strong numbers as in previous cycles.Wednesday, November 2: Clinton heads back north a day later, with two stops scheduled in Iowa. (Update: This visit has been canceled following an ambush that killed two police officers in  Iowa early Wednesday.)Chelsea ClintonTuesday, November 1: The former first daughter visited Aurora, Colorado.Wednesday, November 2: Boulder and the University of Colorado is on the schedule for Wednesday, another play to get out the youth vote -- in this case, that mostly means mailing in their ballots -- in a state most polls show Clinton leading comfortably.Then it's off to play some more defense in Oshkosh and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a state where Clinton has a strong but not unbreakable hold.Thursday, November 3: Another day in Wisconsin, this time with at a coffee shop Milwaukee, not far from Marquette University.Friday, November 4: Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth WarrenTuesday, November 1: A busy day for Clinton's former primary rival, who stumped for her in Plymouth and Hanover, New Hampshire, before heading up to Portland, Maine.Wednesday, November 2: Warren is expected to join phone-banking efforts in Carson City and Reno, Nevada, as the Silver State goes down to the wire.Meanwhile, Sanders will continue on his mission to burnish Clinton's liberal credentials, especially with young voters, of which there figure to be a few on hand at his visit to Western Michigan University. He'll also be in Traverse City, Michigan, before finishing the day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Over the coming days, he will also make appearances in Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and California.Team TrumpDonald TrumpTuesday, November 1: Gaining in the polls, Trump took his anti-Obamacare message to friendly crowds in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania -- a blue state that, if turned, could swing the election in a hurry. Trump also held a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Wednesday, November 2: A busy day in battleground Florida will likely see Trump stops first in Miami, then up to Orlando and Pensacola.Thursday, November 3: Before leaving the Sunshine State, Trump will look to shore up his base in Jacksonville, which like his latter two rallies on Wednesday, is farther north and in a more traditionally Republican leaning region. After that, Trump heads to North Carolina, another state where he could be gaining ground, for visits to Concord and Selma.Vice Presidential nominee Mike PenceTuesday, November 1: A full day in Pennsylvania. After joining Trump for the Obamacare speech in King of Prussia, Pence set off for another rally in Youngwood, a borough in the more Republican-heavy western part of the state about an hour outside Pittsburgh. Pence is often dispatched to more traditionally conservative areas, where he has a credibility that Trump does not.Wednesday, November 2: Another busy day for the Indiana governor, who will first try to match voices with Clinton in Arizona. Pence will be in the GOP stronghold of Mesa, launching a rearguard action in one of the reddest cities in the country. But after that he's scheduled to kick up some dust in New Mexico, a traditionally reliable blue state -- is it a feint or does the campaign see a path there? They're saying the polls are closer than we might expect. Pence finishes in Loveland, Colorado. Melania TrumpThursday, November 3: The prospective first lady is expected to give a speech in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric TrumpTuesday, November 1: Trump's eldest son visited two Hawkeye State colleges, where he spoke to crowds at Iowa State University in Ames and at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls.Wednesday, November 2: More higher ed for Trump Jr., when he'll visit Michigan and Grand Valley State University in Allendale.Like her brother, Ivanka Trump will also be in Michigan at a separate event on Wednesday, part of the campaign's offensive in another state expected -- for now, at least -- to go blue on Election Day.Friday, November 4: Eric Trump will follow his older siblings to Michigan for an appearance at the end of the week. There are no details available yet about his or Ivanka Trump's events.(Note: These dates and places for the candidates and their surrogates subject to change.)"

And in Wisconsin and a handful of other states, they actually can, legally.""A lot of things have happened over the last few days,"" Trump said, after hammering Clinton over her use of a private email server in light of the FBI's review of newly discovered emails that may be tied to that investigation.""This is a message for any Democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and are having a bad case of buyers' remorse -- in other words you want to change your vote -- Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake,"" Trump said. ""We'll make America great again.""The Republican nominee also encouraged voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and nearby Minnesota who have already voted to ""change your vote to Donald Trump.""Wisconsin voters who have already cast their ballot can change their vote as many as three times before Election Day, per Wisconsin law. Early voters in neighboring Minnesota can also change their early ballots, and dozens of cheered earlier during the rally when Trump asked how many attendees lived in Minnesota.While Michigan and Pennsylvania do not allow early voting, residents of those states who cast absentee ballots can change their votes if they vote in person on Election Day.More than 24 million people have already voted in 38 states, either via early voting or absentee ballot.Trump's pitch to the sliver of voters who may be regretting their vote for Clinton came as he warned, without evidence, that Clinton would face a multi-year investigation as president should she be elected as a result of the new information discovered by the FBI. The FBI is still reviewing the new emails found in a separate investigation to determine if they are relevant to the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server.""She is likely to be under investigation for many years, probably concluding in a very large scale criminal trial,"" Trump said, offering no evidence to support his claim.FBI Director James Comey publicly announced last Friday that the FBI was reviewing the newly discovered emails, drawing heavy criticism from Democrats, three former US attorneys general from Democratic and Republican administrations and former Justice Department officials because of the proximity to Election Day. ""It's a total breach of protocol,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Tuesday on CNN's ""New Day."" ""Now that he's opened the door, now that he has weighed into this election, we're saying let's get all the information out there. Let's get the information out on Hillary Clinton that he supposedly might have. Let's get the information our on Donald Trump. The voters are smart and can figure it out."""

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/trump-american-independent-party-california/index.html	"That's because in the nation's most populous state, Trump is not only the Republican nominee but also the nominee of the American Independent Party, a political party that traces its roots to the late 1960s, when Alabama Gov. George Wallace ran for president on a platform supporting racial segregation. ""We think of [Trump] as our battering ram,"" Markham Robinson, the secretary of the American Independent Party, told CNN. ""We don't like the way things are going in the country or in the Republican Party.""  This is the first time in 76 years that a candidate for president has appeared on the California ballot as the choice of two parties -- it has not happened since 1940, when Wendell Willkie was nominated for president by the Republican and Townsend parties. The Trump campaign, for its part, says it's not associated with the American Independent Party. ""Mr. Trump is the Republican Party nominee for president,"" Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller told CNN. ""He's a Republican. That's the party line he's running on. He urges people to vote Republican -- and to vote for him -- this fall.""Trump's nomination by the American Independent Party underscores his appeal to a group of self-described ""refugee Republicans"" who think today's GOP has gone soft, but it could also come with a political downside for Trump as he tries to broaden his appeal in the final days before the election.""The danger for Trump [in this nomination] is that it re-enforces something that is already baked in: that there is this element of Trump support that is 'alt-right' -- that comes from people like David Duke,"" said David Axelrod, a CNN senior political commentator who was a top adviser to President Barack Obama and is now the director of the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics. ""This has hurt Trump with white-college educated voters; it makes them uncomfortable.""How Trump got on the ballotTrump did not seek the nomination of the American Independent Party and did not have to take any formal steps to accept it. According to Sam Mahood, the press secretary for California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D), California law permits one party to nominate the presidential candidate of another party and to have that choice reflected on the ballot. California election code does not require a presidential candidate who is already on the ballot to consent to receiving the nomination of a another qualified political party.The American Independent Party has not spoken to Trump personally, Robinson said, but the AIP was in touch with Trump California state director Tim Clark in August as soon as it nominated the New York businessman for president.""[Clark] welcomed our nomination,"" said Robinson. ""We offered to discuss communications strategy but he never took us up on that.""""We certainly have never gotten something from the Trump campaign saying they disapprove,"" Robinson added.How the American Independent Party was createdThe American Independent Party of California was created in 1967. The following year, it nominated Wallace for president after the Democrat's pro-segregation policies were rejected by the mainstream of the national Democratic Party.In his 1963 inaugural address as governor of Alabama, Wallace promised: ""segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."" On June 11, 1963, Wallace captured the national spotlight when he attempted to block two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, from enrolling at the University of Alabama. As the 1968 nominee of the American Independent Party, Wallace targeted disaffected white voters and won the five states of the Deep South while capturing 13 percent of the popular vote. Today, the American Independent Party of California rejects the suggestion that it adheres to a racist worldview. ""We are no longer segregationist,"" said Robinson. ""Yes, we are states' rights and people's rights. But segregationists were often racists and this party is extremely anti-racist,"" he added, pointing to the party's 2008 decision to nominate arch-conservative Alan Keyes, an African American, for president.  As of September, more than 456,000 voters in California were registered with the American Independent Party. That's only 2.5% of the state's total -- but it represents more voters than all of the other minor parties in the state combined. In April, the Los Angeles Times conducted a survey and reported that a majority of voters who had registered with the party said they had done so in error. According to the Times, voters were confused by the use of the word ""independent"" in the party's name and thought they were registering as political independents when they checked the American Independent Party box on voter registration forms. The party rejects the findings of the Los Angeles Times survey. The AIP believes both major parties have supported big government, open borders, and a decline in national sovereignty. But it sees Trump as different from most Republicans. ""We are more in favor of the wall than Trump is,"" said Robinson. In addition to his hardline stance on immigration, the American Independent Party is drawn to Trump's stances on rewriting America's trade deals, bringing corporate cash back to the United States, ""draining the swamp"" in Washington, and rebuilding the military while forsaking foreign interventions. One notable disagreement between Trump and the AIP is his proposal, spearheaded by daughter Ivanka, to create a child-care tax credit. The AIP opposes existing government entitlement programs and does not want to see the creation of any new ones. While rejecting the party's previous support for racial segregation, Robinson said the American Independent Party has grown more conservative than it was in the days of Wallace when it comes to government's role providing public services. ""We are against public schools,"" said Robinson. ""We are against any program that takes from one group and gives to another."" Dan Schnur, the director of USC's Unruh Institute of Politics, thinks that Trump and the Republican Party would be wise to distance themselves from the AIP. ""For a party that needs to expand its base, being associated with [the party of George Wallace] is something you would think [the GOP] would want to avoid,"" said Schnur, a former Republican who worked for Sen. John McCain's 2000 campaign for president and is now a political independent. What happens if Trump wins?The likelihood of Trump defeating Hillary Clinton in California is extremely remote given that the state has consistently voted Democratic for president since Bill Clinton's first run in 1992, but since Trump is on the ballot representing two parties, the question must be asked how electors would be chosen should he win. Jim Brulte, the chairman of the California Republican Party, tells CNN that he rejected a request from the AIP to appoint a common slate of 55 electors to the Electoral College. The California Republican Party and the American Independent Party ultimately appointed two separate slates of electors.The AIP worries that the Republican Party's refusal to appoint a common slate of electors could render the presidential contest in California ""invalid.""That's because you don't really cast a vote for president -- you really are voting for a slate of electors pre-registered by party with the Secretary of State who support a particular candidate. In the extremely unlikely event that Trump were to win the popular vote in California, the AIP worries that there would be no way to ascertain which slate of electors--the Republican slate or the American Independent slate--the people were intending to select. Both slates cannot be selected because California is limited to 55 votes in the Electoral College.Brulte, the GOP state chair, said California Republican Party lawyers looked at the issue and concluded that it would not pose a problem.""I spend my time building the Republican Party,"" said Brulte. ""I don't spend time thinking about the other parties and how they do their party building."""	Donald Trump is American Independent Party nominee	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Clark', 'Obama']	['creation']

In October, Trump's attorneys filed documents seeking to block all references to Trump's campaign rhetoric -- including his tweets, speeches and advertisements -- as well as media reports about him published during the campaign on the grounds that such citations could unfairly sway the jury, but the plaintiff's attorneys shot back in court filings Tuesday.  ""Trump wants to rig the deck by hiding from the jury his own words,"" the plaintiff's lawyers wrote.The lawyers who brought the class-action suit further argued Trump's comments leading up to the primaries and general election have covered a wide array of topics, and that excluding all of this content would amount to broad immunity.""Donald Trump's dizzying array of objectively false, contradictory and self-defeating statements have left him so flummoxed he is demanding that the court create a new category of immunity to protect him from himself,"" they wrote. ""Trump's representations, acts (or lack thereof), and credibility will be among the most important issues for the jury to determine.""The plaintiff's attorneys said they have no intentions to politicize the case, but they argued that instances in which they say Trump flip-flopped on issues relevant to Trump University are appropriate evidence at trial. They wrote in documents filed Tuesday that Trump has admitted he did not handpick instructors for the venture's programs, a key point of contention in the case.Lawyers for Trump argue that statements made during the election cycle by and about the Republican nominee have no relevance to the trial and that any reference to them ""carries an immediate and irreparable danger of extreme and irremediable prejudice.""They say the jury should judge those statements at the ballot box, not in the courtroom.Trump has repeatedly mentioned Trump University litigation on the campaign trail, such as when he called federal judge Gonzalo Curiel a ""hater"" and questioned his ability to fairly preside over the class-action suit.In May, Trump tweeted that Curiel is ""totally biased against me"" and said he should have easily won the case.In a separate filing Tuesday, Trump's lawyers sought to specifically block at trial the inclusion of a CNN interview with a former instructor, James Harris. Harris previously told CNN his main job wasn't to teach real estate but was to convince people to sign up for the real estate seminars, some of which cost tens of thousands of dollars.Trump University currently faces three civil lawsuits, including two class-action suits in California filed by former students and another brought by New York's attorney general."
