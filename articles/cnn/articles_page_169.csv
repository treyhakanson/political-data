Clinton said that young people she has spoken with to over the course of this campaign have expressed concerns about divisiveness and discrimination. ""Too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans, bullied; too many young women and men assaulted,"" Clinton said. Clinton emphasized efforts to promote affordable tuition and combat college debt. These topics were at the core of the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders -- the raspy, populist Vermont senator who proved to be formidable challenger to Clinton as he overwhelmingly won the support of young people and liberals. ""As you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up,"" Clinton said. The crowd broke out into cheers as Clinton continued: ""I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan."" In a speech that drew on her history as a young Democratic activist as well as personal anecdotes about her mother, Clinton openly acknowledged this obvious truth: that young people are disenchanted and disillusioned with the current political system.   ""I remember wrestling with the challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War,"" Clinton said. ""It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing is ever going to change.""Younger voters overwhelmingly backed President Barack Obama in 2012 -- giving him a 29 point lead over Republican nominee Mitt Romney, according to exit polls. In 2008, Obama easily outpolled Republican John McCain among -- 66% to 32%. But the enthusiasm that young voters -- including many first-time voters -- showered on Obama, however, has not transferred over to Clinton.One obstacle getting in Clinton's way: third party candidates. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 36% of voters under 30 plan to support Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or the Green Party's Jill Stein.  With just 50 days left until Election Day, the Clinton campaign is relying heavily on popular, big-name Democratic surrogates to help court undecided and unenthusiastic voters. Last week, it dispatched Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to battleground states.And Priorities USA, a super PAC backing Clinton, announced last week that they are launching a multimillion-dollar digital campaign to discuss ""how a vote for a third-party candidate is a vote for Donald Trump."" Priorities has conducted polling on voters backing Johnson and Stein -- research they will use to determine how those individuals can be persuaded to back Clinton, according to Priorities spokesman Justin Barasky.The lead that Clinton has enjoyed since the Democratic National Convention in July has largely evaporated, and she is now neck-and-neck with Trump in both national and swing state polls. ""This is going to be close. We need everyone off the sidelines,"" Clinton said Monday. ""Not voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump's hands.""A vote against Trump, Clinton concluded, would show that world that ""America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump."""

That document showed Obama was born in Hawaii. In the interview, Christie stretched the truth beyond recognition two times within 30 seconds, a kind of double Salchow of prevarication.First, his assertion that the so-called birther issue was first raised by the Clinton campaign. ""It was a contentious issue,"" Christie told Tapper, ""and, by the way, an issue that Patti Solis Doyle of the Clinton campaign in 2008 has recently admitted that it was an issue that Mrs. Clinton also injected into her campaign in 2008 in a very quiet, but direct way against then-Sen. Obama.""Really? Solis Doyle said that? Actually, here's what she said to CNN's Wolf Blitzer.""The campaign, nor Hillary, did not start the birther movement. Period. End of the story. There was a volunteer coordinator, I believe in late 2007, I think in December. One of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties in Iowa, I don't recall whether they were an actual a paid staffer, but they did forward an email that promoted the conspiracy.""""The birther conspiracy?"" Blitzer asked.""Yeah. Hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. We let that person go, and it was so, you know, beyond the pale, Wolf, and you know, so not worthy the kind of campaign that certainly Hillary wanted to run or that we as a staff wanted to run that I called David Plouffe, who was obviously managing Barack Obama's campaign in '07, to apologize and basically say this is not coming from us.""Funny, Solis Doyle's admission sure sounds an awful lot like a denial and there is no evidence that then-Sen. Clinton interjected this into her campaign in any way.Shortly thereafter, Christie took issue with Tapper for saying that Trump stayed on the birther issue for five years after Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011.""It's just not true that he kept it up for five years,"" Christie said to Tapper. ""It's simply not true. It wasn't like he was talking about it on a regular basis until then, and when the issue was raised he made very clear the other day what his position is.""Here is what CNN reported on what Trump said and did after the long-form birth certificate was released: -- ""He didn't know he was running for president, so he told the truth. The literary agent wrote down what he said ... He said he was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia ... Now they're saying it was a mistake. Just like his Kenyan grandmother said he was born in Kenya, and she pointed down the road to the hospital, and after people started screaming at her, she said, 'Oh, I mean Hawaii.' Give me a break.""May 24, 2012, interview with The Daily Beast's Lloyd Grove, responding to an erroneous report about Obama-- ""A lot of people do not think it was an authentic certificate. ... Many people do not think it was authentic. His mother was not in the hospital. There are many other things that came out. And frankly if you would report it accurately I think you'd probably get better ratings than you're getting.""May 29, 2012, to CNN's Wolf Blitzer-- An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud.Follow  Donald J.

You tell me. Some people say that was not his birth certificate. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. I'm saying I don't know. Nobody knows.""August 2013 to ABC News- ""How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's 'birth certificate' died in plane crash today. All others lived.""Follow Donald J.

Well, a lot of people don't agree with you and a lot of people feel it wasn't a proper certificate.""May 2014, in an interview with TV3's Colette Fitzpatrick in Ireland, Trump first contested whether Obama had released his birth certificate, then questioned its legitimacy.-- ""There are three things that could happen. And one of them did happen. He was perhaps born in Kenya. Very simple, OK? He was perhaps born in this country. But said he was born in Kenya because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid and you got into colleges. People were doing that. So perhaps he was born in this country, and that has a very big chance. Or, you know, who knows?""May 27, 2014, in remarks at the National Press Club-- ""Who knows about Obama? ... Who knows, who knows? Who cares right now?... I have my own theory on Obama. Someday I will write a book, I will do another book, and it will do very successfully.""January 6, 2016, in an interview with CNN's Wolf BlitzerSure sounds like Christie is wrong when he says that Trump is not keeping the issue alive.

Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closures, an incident that has come to be known by some as ""Bridgegate.""  Text about Christie: He 'flat-out lied'Christie has never been named as a conspirator in the case or charged. Wildstein has pled guilty in the case and pointed to the two staffers on trial.When asked whether Monday's assertions mean charges could be coming for Christie, Reilly said, ""We have not filed any charges and we never discuss whether we will/won't file charges.""CNN has reached out to Christie's office, as well as the offices of Baroni and Kelly's attorneys for comment.A source with ongoing knowledge of the case has told CNN that Monday's assertions by the prosecutor that Christie knew about Bridge-Gate came as a surprise because Christie has never been charged in the case, and because up until now the prosecutors have said they were not bringing charges against the governor. Christie told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday that he would testify if subpoenaed, but didn't expect to be called as a witness.""Of course I will,"" Christie told Tapper on ""State of the Union."" ""I have been investigated by three different entities, two of them led by partisan Democrats, who have all found that I had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement in it. And so I would have no problem if called to testify by either side. But the fact is that I won't because I really don't have any knowledge of this incident at all.""  The traffic headache was allegedly intentionally called for because Sokolich did not endorse Christie's re-election. Baroni and Kelly allegedly ""bragged"" to Christie about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Sokolich was not getting his calls returned, prosecutors said in court according to Reilly.Baroni's attorneys have sought to argue that Baroni is being unfairly singled out in the scheme. In a previous court filing, the attorneys released a text message exchange from a Christie aide saying he ""flat-out lied"" during a news conference about the bridge closures. Christie had said senior staff were not involved in that news event. He later said that staff in his office lied, but that he hadn't known it at the time of the news conference. Attorneys for Kelly and Baroni previously confirmed to CNN that they will both testify in their defense. The trial is expected to last six weeks.Christie has long denied any involvement in the closures and neither the federal investigation nor the New Jersey legislative inquiry has pointed to him.In December 2015, when they were opponents, Trump told an audience in South Carolina Christie ""totally knew about it,"" referring to the Bridgegate closures. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment."	Prosecutor in Bridgegate trial: Chris Christie knew of closures

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""Clinton has, in fact, discussed terrorism. Earlier in the day, she touted her national security experience from serving as secretary of state, saying she would ""launch an intelligence surge"" and that she would put more into ""training and intelligence they need to effectively prevent and respond to terrorist attacks."" Rather than the policies of President Barack Obama's administration, which Trump argued are responsible for the threat of terrorism, Trump called once again for a radical rethinking of counterterrorism policies in the US.He emphasized the need for ""extreme vetting"" and again called for a ban on immigrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism -- the latest iteration of his ban on Muslims -- while arguing that ""immigration security is national security.""""My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency,"" Trump said.And championing the cause of many hawkish conservatives, Trump appeared to argue that terrorist suspects captured on US soil like Ahmad Khan Rahami, the New York and New Jersey bombing suspect who was apprehended earlier Monday, should be treated as ""foreign enemy combatants.""  Rahami is a naturalized US citizen who under current law is entitled to due process rights.""Congress should pass measures to ensure that foreign enemy combatants are treated as such. These are enemies. These are combatants and we have to be tough and we have to be strong,"" Trump said.Those comments came after Trump lamented the fact that Rahami would be treated humanely and in accordance with the law.""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he'll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is,"" Trump said.""We must also use whatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before it's no longer timely,"" he added.Trump also responded to Clinton's accusations earlier Monday that Trump and his harsh rhetoric against Muslims has been a recruiting tool for ISIS.Clinton had said: ""I think it is important for voters to know and hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November. We know that a lot of the rhetoric we've heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular ISIS. Because they are looking to make this into a war against Islam.""""Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monster of evil on us,"" Trump said.Instead, Trump boomeranged Clinton's attack back at her, arguing that Clinton and President Barack Obama's policies have helped ISIS's recruiting efforts.""Weakness invites aggression and silence in the face of a brutal enemy ... allows them to spread and that's what's happening all over the world,"" Trump said.The Republican nominee also speculated, without evidence, that if Obama could do it again he wouldn't choose Clinton to serve in his Cabinet."

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/us-election-terrorism-trump-clinton/index.html	"The attacks over the weekend mercifully did not kill anybody -- but they inevitably put the fear of terrorism back at the center of the showdown between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.From Trump's point of view, the new terror scares play directly into a vision of a nation under siege and which he must get Americans to buy into if he is to win in November.""We cannot let this evil continue,"" Trump said in Florida on Monday after the capture of a US naturalized citizen of Afghan descent suspected of planting a series of bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, and the stabbing of nine people in a separate attack in a Minnesota mall on Saturday in an attack claimed by ISIS. ""If you chose Donald Trump, these problems are going to go away.""Still -- Trump's hard bore approach does carry risks. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton is also maneuvering in the wake of the attacks, portraying herself as the kind of steely and calm commander-in-chief Americans traditionally turn to in times of crisis.""I know how to do this,"" Clinton said at an airport news conference on Monday.Trump is presenting the attacks as the result of what he says are lax, weak anti-terrorism policies pursued by President Barack Obama and his Democratic foe Clinton while she was secretary of state. And he's offering a solution: that the new threat of homegrown Islamic terrorism could be snuffed out if only the United States adopted the kind of ""extreme"" vetting of foreigners and drastic changes to the immigration system that he proposed and which lit a fire under his presidential campaign.""Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores, and it's already happening,"" Trump said Monday. ""Let me state very clearly, immigration security is national security.""Trump is also likely to seize on the fact that Ahmad Khan Rahami, the accused New York bomber, a US naturalized citizen of Afghan descent, had spent time in Afghanistan and Pakistan in recent years to renew his call for a halt on immigration to the US from nations with proven links to terrorism.Though Trump's plans might not have prevented Rahami from visiting South Asia, where thousands of law abiding US citizens travel every month, Rahami's travels will play into the febrile political atmosphere that Trump is trying to tap into following the attacks.And revelations Monday that at least 858 people that had been ordered deported or removed under another name were improperly granted US citizenship due to a failure to maintain adequate fingerprint records, according to a new report, will be used by critics of the immigration system to bolster his claims of the need for reform.Trump's tough response to the terror attacks is likely to be a hit with his faithful supporters who have responded to such a message before -- for instance after attacks in Paris, San Bernardino California and Orlando which helped to shape the Republican primary process.But it's a gamble because while some Americans like the tough talk, he risks exacerbating impressions that with his vehement response to terrorist attacks, he is exhibiting the deficiencies that have many other voters wondering whether he is fit to be president.It's also unclear whether the limited human toll of the weekend's attacks will dilute their impact on an election still 49 days away -- in an election season in which the narrative often seems to shift by the hour. For instance, the huge campaign controversies of recent days -- Trump's false claim that Clinton was to blame for accusations that Obama was not born in the United States and the Democratic nominee's health issues dominated campaign conversation for days last week -- but barely got a mention on Monday.Voters also appear conflicted on the how national security will factor into the election.A CNN/ORC poll this month showed that voters trust the Republican more to tackle terrorism, by 51% to 45%. But the same survey found that voters think Clinton has the superior temperament required of a president (56% to 36%) and is better able to handle the responsibilities of commander in chief (50% to 45%).Trump's potential temperamental vulnerability came into focus during his Florida rally, when he bemoaned the medical treatment offered to Rahami after he was injured in a shootout with police.""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer,"" Trump said.But New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Clinton supporter, pointed out that what Trump was proposing was a wholesale repudiation of the humanitarian, civic and legal values for which the US stands -- a factor that could give some voters pause when they consider handing the White House to Trump.""""Welcome to America,"" Cuomo told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.""We have a system of jurisprudence, you are innocent until you proven guilty, you have a right to counsel, you have a right to hospitalization if you are ill. That is our system and it's what makes this country special. And what makes this country great.""The Clinton campaign, for its part, has long believed that in the unwanted circumstances of an ""October Surprise"" terror attack, voters would turn to experience and a steady hand rather than Trump's more impulsive leadership.""I have sat at that table in the Situation Room, I have analyzed the threats, I have contributed to actions that have neutralized our enemies. I know how to do this,"" Clinton said during her news conference.While Trump responded to the fears of Americans, Clinton issued a call to their intellect.""We should also launch an intelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks before they can be carried out. We need to work more closely with Silicon Valley and other partners to counter terrorist propaganda and recruitment efforts online,"" Clinton said, repeating policies she has long embraced."

The letter notes that Trump's business dealings overseas could pose ""unprecedented"" and ""significant conflicts of interest"" if he guided US foreign policy.

Global leaders meet at UN ""Our next commander-in-chief will inherit complex national security threats and complicated relationships with allies and adversaries alike,"" the officials wrote. ""But our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in America's best interest, not by the financial interests of our president.

""Once you leave this country, you fight for ISIS, you never come back."" Is that really true that they come back and let loose? In a word - no. New America, a Washington-based think tank, has used public records and news accounts to track Americans who have aided ISIS. According to its analysis, 117 people in the US have attempted to join ISIS or other terrorist groups in Syria, have made it there to fight, or have helped other join these organizations. According to New America's report, 74 of those were arrested before reaching Syria. Forty-three managed to reach that country and join the fight. Of those, 17 were killed and 8 were arrested when they returned home.  ""Any American who has traveled to fight with a designated foreign terrorist organization and returned here would be subject to prosecution,"" said Justice Department spokesman, Marc Ramondi. One person, Moner Abusalha of Florida, did train with the al-Qaeda affiliated group, the al-Nusra Front, and did return undetected to the US. But rather than stage any attacks on US soil, Abusalha returned to Syria after unsuccessfully trying to recruit more fighters here. He was later killed.
