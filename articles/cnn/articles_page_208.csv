The Pentagon-housed spy agency on Sunday apologized, tweeting: ""Earlier today, a tweet regarding a news article was mistakenly posted from this account & does not represent the views of DIA. We apologize."" The initial tweet, which has since been deleted, included a link to a New York Times report about a dust-up over security protocols at the tarmac when Obama landed in China -- and later, shouting matches between Chinese officials and Secret Service agents at the West Lake State House, where Obama met Chinese President Xi Jinping. The tiffs were largely over American journalists' access to Obama. Chinese officials unexpectedly limited reporters' access to the President. The first incident occurred when a Chinese official demanded that a group of reporters traveling with Obama be ushered away from Air Force One, according to pool reports. When a White House official responded that it was the United States' president and plane and that the press wasn't moving, the man shouted back: ""This is our country."" Later, at the West Lake State House, White House aides, protocol officers and Secret Service agents spent 15 minutes arguing with Chinese officials over which, and how many, Americans would be allowed in -- an exchange that left one security official looking ready to throw a punch. ""Calm down please. Calm down,"" a White House official said. A foreign ministry official said in Chinese: ""Stop, please. There are reporters here."" It was the first of two disputes between American and Chinese officials there. The second, minutes later, was over how many American journalists would be allowed in the room when Obama, Jinping and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met. The Chinese insisted on limits that left two US reporters unable to enter the room, despite one White House press officer pleading: ""There's space. They are print reporters. They would just be just standing.""Asked about the airport kerfuffle after a Sunday morning meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Obama acknowledged to reporters that ""the seams are showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes."" ""I wouldn't over-crank the significance of it, because, as I said, this is not the first time that these things happened,"" Obama said. ""And it doesn't just happen here. It happens in a lot of places, including, by the way, sometimes, our allies. Part of it is we also have a much bigger footprint than a lot of other countries. And we've got a lot of planes and a lot of helicopters and a lot of cars and a lot of guys, and if you're a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much."""

Johnson performed poorly in Virginia during his 2012 effort, securing less than one percent of the state's vote. The ex-governor has said he hopes to break out this year due to the low favorability ratings for Trump and Clinton, and the paper followed that line of thinking.The editorial also called for Johnson to join the nationally-televised debates alongside Trump and Clinton. The former governor has said repeatedly that he needs to make the general election debates to have any realistic chance at the White House. The presidential debate commission requires a candidate to reach an average of 15 percent in the polls it has selected. Johnson must rapidly improve his position to meet this threshold. CNN's latest poll of polls found Johnson sitting at an average of 9 percent nationwide, and a Quinnipiac poll from mid-August had Johnson at 12 percent in Virginia."

This is serious business,"" Kaine, the Virginia senator and Democratic vice presidential candidate, said on ABC's ""This Week.""He was defending Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, saying Clinton has admitted it was a mistake. ""But on the other hand we've got a candidate in Donald Trump who won't release his tax returns to the public after he promised to do so. And talk about national security -- he has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyber hacking to try to find more emails or materials, and we know that this cyber attack on the DNC was likely done by Russia,"" Kaine said. ""So contrast the Hillary situation, where the FBI said there's no need for legal proceedings, with an attack that is being encouraged by Donald Trump on the DNC by Russia similar to what led to resignation of a president 30 years ago,"" he said. Kaine has often criticized Trump as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the campaign trail. Trump in late July appeared to encourage Russian intelligence agencies to find Hillary Clinton's thousands of deleted emails -- comments he later said were ""sarcastic.""On the same show Sunday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said of Clinton's campaign that ""when you ask them a question about them, it takes them about 10 words to get to Donald Trump's name."" ""Hillary Clinton is having a hard time being accepted as a truthful and honest candidate vis-a-vis the American people,"" Conway said. ""And I thought that Senator Kaine trying to pivot away to Donald Trump is really become a favorite parlor game these days."""	Tim Kaine: Donald Trump's actions like Watergate

The Turkish leader was expected to press Obama on US-based cleric Fethulah Gulen, under suspicion in Turkey for helping plot the coup. Gulen denies involvement, and the US is demanding evidence of his participation, but rejecting the request could worsen ties between the two countries.     Erdogan said his government was preparing to submit additional evidence about the coup to the United States, and would soon send his justice and Interior ministers for consultations with American authorities.For the US, alienating Erdogan remains an unwelcome prospect given Turkey's critical role in the battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Even on that front, disagreements persist. Washington has pressed Ankara to end airstrikes on Syrian Kurds, whom the US is backing in the fight against ISIS terrorists.READ MORE: US headache: Keeping Turkey, Kurds apartAirport scuffleIt's the second day of high-stakes diplomacy for Obama, who arrived here Saturday to an inauspicious welcome: no red-carpeted stairs for Air Force One and open quarreling on the tarmac between Chinese and US officials over press access. Other leaders arriving for the G20 here were greeted with a far grander welcome.The rancor continued throughout Saturday as Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to cement a carbon reduction agreement and haggle over longstanding disputes like cybersecurity and maritime aggression.Obama said Sunday the US would never apologize for its insistence upon press access, but said he understood why Chinese officials may have chafed at the Americans' demands.""We don't leave our values and ideals behind when we take these trips. It can cause some friction,"" Obama said following his meeting with Theresa May, the newly installed British prime minister. At the same time, Obama cautioned against inflating the incident.""I wouldn't over crank the significance of it,"" he said. ""We've got a lot of planes and helicopters and a lot of cars and a lot of guys and, you know, if you're a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much.""Haggling over SyriaObama was beginning his day of talks as his Secretary of State John Kerry was working to reach a deal on ending violence in Syria. The President said Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov had been working ""around the clock"" to hammer out an agreement, but hadn't yet reached a final accord.""I think it's premature for us to say that there is a clear path forward, but there's the possibility at least for us to make some progress on that front,"" Obama said.Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin were expected to interact during this week's Group of 20 summit, though a formal meeting was not on the books. Any deal to end widespread suffering in Syria was likely to be met with doubt after past settlements failed -- a fact Obama acknowledged on Sunday.""Given the failure of previous cessations of hostilities to hold, we approach it with some skepticism,"" Obama said.But he said any work toward easing the deeply troubling humanitarian crisis was valuable.""It is worth trying,"" he said. ""To the extent that there are children and women and innocent civilians who can get food and medical supplies and, you know, get some relief from the constant terror of bombings, that's worth the effort.""Deep divides over Syria have marred Obama's relationship with Putin, adding to a litany of discord between the US and Russia that's driven relations to their lowest level since the Cold War.    This week's interaction between Obama and Putin could be a final attempt to salvage what's become one of the most acrimonious relationships on the global stage. Putin's persistent support for the Syrian regime, Moscow's moves in Ukraine and the charge that Russia may be meddling in the US presidential contest have built a deeply antagonistic dynamic between the two leaders.A deal on Syria could place US-Russia ties in a firmer position as Obama prepares to leave office. American diplomats have been pressuring Moscow to use its influence in Damascus and force the Syrian regime to end its strikes on civilians and US-backed opposition fighters.Obama said on Sunday that Russian participation was essential.""Our conversations with the Russians are key because, if it were not for the Russians, then Assad and the regime would not be able to sustain its offensive,"" he said.Brexit bluesObama used a morning session with British Prime Minister Theresa May to gauge the new leader's plans for executing Britain's exit from the European Union, a move the US has insisted must proceed in an organized fashion.Obama said Sunday the US-UK ""special relationship"" would persist as Britain works to exit the European Union.""The bottom line is that we don't have a stronger partner anywhere in the world than the United Kingdom,"" Obama said. ""Despite the turbulence of political events over the last several months, we have every intention to making sure that that continues.""It's Obama's first face-to-face encounter with May since she replaced David Cameron, a close Obama ally who resigned in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Obama took the unusual step of personally lobbying against Britain's exit from the EU, but if the aftermath of the vote has said he would stand by Britain amid the country's internal struggles.May insisted during a joint appearance with Obama that exit negotiations would move forward.""Brexit does indeed mean Brexit,"" she said."

Citing the ""good things with AIDS and so forth"" the Clinton Foundation has done, the Vermont senator who challenged Clinton in the Democratic primary, said he ""can't definitively answer"" if it should be shut down, or the former secretary of state just shouldn't be involved. ""At the very least she should not be involved. At the very least,"" Sanders said.The Clintons have already said the foundation would stop accepting foreign and corporate contributions if Hillary Clinton is elected president, and that former President Bill Clinton would step down from its board.A Trump campaign statement Sunday afternoon cited Sanders' comments in criticizing her over the foundation, characterizing them in a way he didn't actually say. ""When Bernie Sanders and the New York Times say the Clinton Foundation presents an unacceptable conflict of interest, it shows just how badly compromised a Hillary Clinton presidency would be,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in the statement. ""It's time for Clinton to end her 274-day streak without a press conference and explain why she thinks it is appropriate for the Clinton Foundation and its offshoots to continue accepting foreign contributions while she runs for the White House,"" Miller said.

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/04/politics/donald-trump-immigration-deportations-rudy-giuliani/index.html	"In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump doesn't want to break up immigrant families in America.Giuliani told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that Trump ""would find it very, very difficult to throw out a family that has been here for 15 years and they have three children, two of whom are citizens. That is not the kind of America he wants.""Giuliani's comments follow a hardline immigration speech Trump delivered last week in Arizona. The former mayor cited an Associated Press report characterizing Trump's comments as ""a sharp retreat"" from his pledge during the primary season to remove all 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.Still, other Republicans, including Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, rejected the idea that Trump had softened. And Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway were coy on the issue. Their comments triggered criticism from the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, over ""attempts to mislead"" about Trump's immigration plan.Trump's Phoenix speech took a tough line on his signature issue of immigration. He rolled out a list of 10 proposals to crack down on illegal immigration, including building a wall along the US-Mexico border and ramping up deportations of undocumented immigrants who have committed other crimes within the United States. ""In a Trump administration, all immigration laws will be enforced,"" Trump said. ""As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But, unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement -- and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation -- that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.""Trump in his speech drew a line at any form of amnesty. ""For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.""Trump added: ""We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty.""But on Sunday Giuliani insisted ""all 10 policies are largely directed toward criminal illegal immigrants,"" drawing a distinction between those immigrants and others who haven't broken additional laws in the country. Giuliani said Trump was calling for the United States to secure its borders and remove those who have committed additional crimes -- and only then address what to do with the majority of undocumented immigrants living in the United States, including so-called ""Dreamers"" -- undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children. ""That's the point that he was making in the speech, and I agree with you that point got lost to some extent in the emotion of the moment,"" Giuliani told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. He chalked that emotion up to the parents of Americans slain by undocumented immigrants who shared the stage with Trump, underscoring Trump's call to end so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that don't deport undocumented immigrants. Democrats said they weren't buying Giuliani's claims about Trump's stance on immigration.""Donald Trump should have gone to the Olympics as a gymnast, because there's a lot of contortionism there,"" said Labor Secretary Tom Perez, a Clinton supporter, on ""State of the Union."" He cited Trump's use of a Phoenix-area sheriff known for his sharp crackdown on undocumented immigrants on-stage last week. ""If you're trying to get kinder and gentler, it's a curious strategy to get Joe Arpaio to introduce you at a speech,"" Perez said. ""He stands for what Donald Trump stands for, and that is, Mexicans are 'rapists.'"" Sen. Flake, who isn't yet supporting Trump, told Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that he didn't get the same message as Giuliani from Trump's speech. ""If it was there, it was buried pretty deep. And no, I didn't catch it,"" he said of any new indications of Trump's openness to allowing some undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States.Of Trump's speech, Flake said: ""It just really doubled down on a lot of the rhetoric that he used before, and it really didn't explain with any clarity where he's going to move ahead in the future.""Flake's comments caught the attention of Trump. On Sunday night he tweeted, ""The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.""Trump sooner followed up on Twitter with a more personal jab at Flake.""The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!""Differing views on immigration among Team Trump membersTrump's vice presidential pick, Gov. Pence, on Sunday deflected questions about the fate of those undocumented immigrants who haven't committed additional crimes in the United States, on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""""With all due respect to the media's focus on the 11 million or whatever that number is, he was focused on the more than 300 million people who are citizens of this country and are here legally in this country, and driving policies in immigration that will work for them, work for the future of our nation,"" Pence said.Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway also wouldn't say what Trump's eventual plan for the majority of undocumented immigrants living in the United States would be. On ABC's ""This Week,"" Conway said that ""once you enforce the law, once you get rid of the criminals, once you triple the number of ICE agents, once you secure the southern border, once you turn off the jobs magnet, jobs and benefit magnet, then we'll see where we are.""""And we don't know where we'll be. We don't know who will be left. We don't know where they live, who they are. That's the whole point here, that we've actually never tried this,"" Conway said. ""He will rescind all those executive amnesties and try to work with the Congress. And so at least he's trying to solve a problem.""The comments by Conway and Pence brought criticism from the Clinton campaign.""Donald Trump has stated very clearly throughout his campaign that he will deport everyone who is undocumented, something that was reinforced in his speech in Arizona last Wednesday,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in statement Sunday afternoon. ""What we saw today is Mike Pence and Trump's top campaign officials attempt to mislead voters about their mass deportation policy by using soft words to describe harsh tactics -- one of the oldest tricks in the book,"" Mook added. ""Immigrant families know the meanings of 'humane' and 'fair' and can see straight through their cynical ploys. Trump's message to immigrant families is clear: everyone must go."""

""These are the people who support Trump. These are the people who seem to have the most suspicion about you.""The President pointed to the country's ""long tradition of inclusion"" as well as its historical suspicion of ""outsiders"" in his response.""That's not new. That dates back to, you know, the beginning of this country,"" Obama said.""Although you'll see bumps, whether it's anti-immigrant sentiment directed at the Irish, or Southern Europeans as opposed to Northern Europeans, or the Chinese, or today, Latinos or Muslims, the long-term trend is people get absorbed, people get assimilated, and we benefit from this incredible country in which the measure of your patriotism and how American you are is not the color of your skin, your last name, your faith, but rather your adherence to a creed, your belief in certain principles and values,"" Obama said.He added: ""I don't expect that that's going to change simply because Mr. Trump has gotten a little more attention than usual.""Trump, Obama said, has ""been able to appeal to a certain group of folks who feel left out or are worried about the rapidity of demographic change, social change, who, in some cases, have very legitimate concerns around the economy and are feeling left behind."" But the President maintained that these people do not make up ""the majority of America.""""If you talk to younger people, the next generation of Americans, they completely reject the kinds of positions that he's taking,"" he insisted."

But that there are those who think Trump needs to dig into his own bank account if he wants to be truly competitive.""He really only has until October 15th, sources say, if he wants to raise this money and be able to spend it effectively before Election Day,"" Murray said. ""He's obviously is going to need to spend more time campaigning and less time raising money in these last couple of months, and that means all hands are on deck. Ivanka Trump, Don Jr., and Eric Trump are all expected to be hosting fund-raisers in the next few weeks.""2. The ""Super Bowl"" of political science: Who has the right forecast?Pollsters ask voters who they plan to vote for in November, but to some political scientists the names don't matter at all. Or at least not as much as factors like the unemployment rate or the incumbent president's approval rating.Dan Balz, chief correspondent at The Washington Post, this past week reviewed the competing forecasts of several political scientists that are about to be published.""Most of them project that Hillary Clinton will win, but there are at least two that say that Donald Trump will win,"" Balz said. ""And one of the authors, Alan Abramowitz, an eminent political scientist, is openly hoping that his model, which is called 'Time for Change,' and calls for a Trump victory, will actually be wrong because he is so anti-Trump.""3. Clinton returning to a busy schedule -- with some helpOne big reason for the Clinton lead in the money race was an August where she spent considerable time off the campaign trail and at high-dollar events with wealthy Democratic donors.But Labor Day is a page-turner, Clinton's aides say, promising a much busier campaign schedule not only for the Democratic nominee but also her big named surrogates: President Barack Obama, Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.Abby Phillip of The Washington Post shared reporting that as Clinton returns to the trail, she also plans to put some of that August fund-raising take to good use.""We're going to start seeing that on Monday with some Spanish-language TV ads hitting the air waves,"" Phillip said.""They are going to really blast the airwaves for the next several months going to Election Day.""4. Mike Pence offers up his services -- but will there be takers?Mike Pence wants to help Republican candidates in key Senate races. But there doesn't appear to be a fight to get to the front of the line.Ashley Parker of The New York Times reports that Pence is eager to do what he can to help the Republican Party keep its Senate majority and believes he can assist even in races where the GOP candidate has decided the best course is to keep some distance from Trump.""In recent weeks, Governor Mike Pence has been quietly talking to Senate Republicans about hitting the campaign trail,"" Parker said.""But you'll notice he actually hasn't really held any major events, which raises the question: Does Mike Pence bring sort of too much downside, which is basically the stench of Trump, and not enough celebrity upside? So that's something I am going to be watching for -- to see if he actually appears with the candidates to campaign.""5. GOP has little room for error in Senate fightThat fight for control of the Senate is intense -- and Republicans have little or no room for error heading into the final two months.Democrats need a net gain of four seats if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, with a Vice President Tim Kaine breaking 50-50 tie votes. A net gain of five would give the Democrats 51, and outright majority.At the Labor Day mark, top Republicans involved in Senate strategy view three GOP held seats as likely lost causes: Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana.They feel confident about three other GOP-held seats that at times were mentioned as possible flips: Florida, Arizona and Ohio.Assuming those calculations are correct, that would leave little room for error in three highly competitive Senate races that also happen to be in major presidential battlegrounds: Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and North Carolina.If Republicans could somehow win two of those three, control could come down to the Nevada seat from which Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid is retiring -- where Republicans see a pickup opportunity."

I'll release mine in the next week,"" he told Todd in an excerpt of the interview released Saturday. ""Donald Trump will be releasing his tax returns at the completion of an audit.""Trump has said he will release his tax returns when he is no longer being audited, though there is no legal reason he cannot do so during an audit. In refusing to release the returns, he has broken with decades of modern presidential campaign precedent. Several members of his party, including Reps. Sean Duffy and Jason Chaffetz, have said he should disclose them.Clinton released her 2015 tax returns last month and eight years of personal income tax returns in 2015.Todd also asked Pence about the release on Friday of the FBI notes from its interview with Clinton about her use of a private email server while leading the State Department. The release revealed that Clinton said she couldn't recall key details and events related to classified information procedures and that a person deleted Clinton's archive mailbox shortly after the server became publicly known.""Well, it's just more evidence that Hillary Clinton is the most dishonest candidate for president of the United States since Richard Nixon,"" Pence said.

His visit, however, was greeted by protests outside of the church ahead of his arrival.Sitting in a pew at the front of the congregation, Trump took a selfie with a church member and at one point held up a baby over his shoulders. He then addressed the congregation.""For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of this country. So true,"" Trump said, reading from prepared remarks. He added, ""The African-American faith community has been one of God's greatest gifts to America and its people.""Trump told the audience he was there to ""listen to your message"" and said he hoped his appearance would ""also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country."" He said he would lay out his plans for economic change and school choice -- issues that he said would benefit black communities -- in the future.""When I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it. I will do something about it,"" Trump said. ""I do get things done, I will tell you. I'm going to get things done.""Speaking in a measured tone, Trump lamented what he said was a nation that was ""too divided.""""We talk past each other and not to each other. And those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what's going on. I'm here today to learn, so that we can together remedy injustice in any form, and so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.""""I believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time,"" said Trump, before he concluded by citing 1 John 4:12.""No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us,"" Trump said, adding, ""That's so true.""Draped with prayer shawlAfter Trump finished speaking, the church's pastor, Bishop Wayne Jackson, draped a prayer shawl over Trump's shoulders, much to the crowd's delight, and handed him a Jewish Heritage Study Bible.""This is a prayer shawl straight from Israel. Whenever you're flying from coast to coast -- I know you just came back from Mexico and you'll be flying from city to city -- there is an anointing. And anointing is the power of God,"" Jackson said. ""It's going to be sometimes in your life that you're going to feel forsaken, you're going to feel down, but the anointing is going to lift you up. I prayed over this personally and I fasted over it, and I wanted to just put this on you.""Later, Trump swayed along with the music as the congregation's chorus sang.After the service concluded, Trump accompanied Ben Carson, his former primary rival turned top surrogate, to the retired neurosurgeon's boyhood home in Southwest Detroit. Carson told CNN's Jeremy Diamond he wanted Trump to see areas in the city that are now blighted but were prosperous when Carson was a boy.Mixed reviewsCarletta Vaughn, a Hillary Clinton supporter and a senior pastor at Holy Ghost Cathedral in Detroit, said Trump was ""scripted"" but she felt like he was ""honest and transparent"" with his message. ""I think that the experience of being in an African-American church and the presence of God, it was clear that it was new to him, but it was not in any way offensive,"" she said. ""It was great.""Vaughn, 63, said she doubts he changed any minds in the crowd but that he left people with a more relatable impression. Taurus Simpson, a pastor from Saginaw, Michigan, said he saw a more ""humble"" version of Trump. But Simpson said he doubts the mogul will make large gains with black voters ""overnight,"" saying it will take a while to erase the perception that African-Americans have of Trump. ""Perception is everything. What we had seen is that he had no care about the blacks at the beginning of this,"" he said, referring to Trump's campaign. Sonia Green, 53, also said she saw a different side of the politician. ""I saw Donald Trump the human being, instead of Donald Trump the guy that just, you know, 'We're going to build a wall, we're going to keep them out,'"" she said. As far as whether Trump will make inroads with minority voters, however, Green said the ""proof will be in the pudding."" ""We'll see about what he says, the actions that he takes,"" Green said. ""Not just for people of color, but all people.""Greeted by protestersDozens of protesters gathered outside the church before Trump arrived, some of whom chanted, ""Whose city? Our city!""At one point, several tried to rush toward a gate near the church's entryway. Four police officers on horseback blocked them. Some of the protesters urged others to remain peaceful.Lawrence Glass, the president of the Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit and Vicinity, addressed reporters and demonstrators at a news conference earlier in the morning, declaring that black voters ""will not be trumpets to get his message of fear and hate out.""""He is speaking at a black church, which is not equivalent to speaking to a black church,"" Glass added.As Trump was set to speak, about a dozen mostly black protesters outside the church followed around Eric Jones, a black Trump supporter from Michigan who was wearing a Trump T-shirt and button. They called him a ""sellout,"" with one protester hurling a racial epithet at him.Some of the protesters attempted to converse with Jones, who tried to respond to their questions, but the taunting and shouting drowned him out. He tried walking away but was followed by the group.Jones told CNN he wasn't surprised by the reaction, and that he experienced a similar response when he walked among protesters at the Republican convention in Cleveland last month. ""The fact is, you got to have honest dialogue in order to change your circumstances.""Jones said he likes Trump because he's an ""outsider"" and ""has the best policies,"" like his proposals to reform immigration laws. ""You can't have a country unless you have some borders,"" he said. Outreach to African-AmericansThe Republican nominee has been criticized throughout his campaign for not reaching out to African-American voters in their communities, an issue Jackson said Trump was looking to remedy.""If we don't sit down and dialogue, then we don't know. You just can't get up and say, 'Well, what the ""H"" you have to lose?' We need promise that's going to be real,"" Jackson told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Friday. ""And you only can make it happen when you sit down and have a dialogue with someone, a communication with someone. And I'm encouraging him.""Jackson held a one-on-one interview with Trump before the service Saturday that will eventually air on the Impact Network, an African-American-founded Christian broadcast television network. The interview came under controversy when it was revealed Trump was provided with questions ahead of time so he could better prepare.Jackson told reporters Saturday that Trump's answers weren't scripted, though he acknowledged Trump was ready for the questions.""He just sat down like a normal guy and answered the questions,"" Jackson said.The GOP nominee has stepped up his outreach to African-American voters in recent weeks, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Clinton, whom he has called ""a bigot"" for seeing minorities as votes, rather than human beings.Early Saturday evening, Trump's campaign issued a statement outlining its ""new civil rights agenda,"" highlighting his previously stated positions on public safety, education and job security.It says a Trump administration would work with law enforcement at all levels of government -- and even the Mexican government -- to fight crime, in particular gangs, violent offenders and ""the international drug cartels."" The statement called for school choice and allowing states to use federal money to ""help parents and students"" find alternatives to public schooling, including charter schools, religious schools and home schooling.Regarding job security, Trump railed against globalization and said illegal immigration -- a signature cause of Trump's campaign -- was particularly harming African-Americans."
