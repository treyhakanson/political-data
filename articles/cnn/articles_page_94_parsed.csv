The Post also reported that Malik Obama called now-deceased Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi one of his best friends -- a potential source of awkwardness for Smith.Malik Obama, who was born in Kenya and is an American citizen, voiced his support for Trump in July, saying he hoped to meet the Republican nominee. Trump's feelings are mutual.""I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""He gets it far better than his brother."" Malik Obama shares the same father with the president but has a different mother. He told the Post on Wednesday that he blames Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time Gadhafi was toppled and killed, for making the situation worse in Libya.Clinton invited both Cuban and Whitman, campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said, and the duo agreed to attend.Obama: Trump's rigged election claim 'whining before the game's even over'Whitman, a longtime Republican, endorsed Clinton earlier this year, saying in a statement that she would vote for and donate to Clinton. Since then, Whitman has headlined events for Clinton and contributed a considerable amount of money to her campaign, including attending a $50,000-a-person fundraiser in California earlier this year.Cuban sat in the front row at Clinton's first debate against Trump, a move that was intended to shake the Republican nominee because the Dallas Mavericks owner has been so outspoken against the businessman.Cuban endorsed Clinton at a July event in his native Pittsburgh. Afterwards, he told CNN that Trump was ""bats--- crazy.""""Trump scares me,"" Cuban said after speaking at the event. ""Donald, initially, I really hoped he would be something different, that as a businessperson, I thought there was an opportunity there. But then he went off the reservation and went bats--- crazy.""Trump lashed out at Cuban for attending the debate with Clinton, calling him ""dopey.""Nevada poll: Clinton leads Trump by 7Since announcing her candidacy, Clinton has picked up a group of high-profile billionaire backers. The campaign has, in turn, used them to question Trump's wealth, citing the fact that he has not released his taxes as a reason for the questions.Clinton regularly mentions Cuban and billionaire investor Warren Buffett at events across the country, calling them ""real billionaires"" compared to Trump.'She murdered him'Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Clinton's guests or Smith.At the second presidential debate, Trump appeared with three women who have in the past accused former President Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior as part of an effort to rattle Hillary Clinton.Trump invited Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and another woman, Kathy Shelton, whose alleged rapist was defended by Clinton as a young lawyer.Smith confirmed to CNN that she will be attending the debate at the Trump campaign's request. She said she doesn't know where she's sitting yet, but she's ""heard rumors"" that it'll be the front row.""I would like to have Hillary tell me what happened,"" she told CNN. ""I know she murdered him ... I do hope she will tell me something. I don't think she will because I don't think she's got the guts to tell me what happened (in Benghazi).""Smith spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where she told the audience of Republicans that Clinton ""should be in stripes.""""This entire campaign comes down to a single question: If Hillary Clinton can't give us the truth, why should we give her the presidency?"" Smith said to cheers on the convention's opening night.Her son Sean, a foreign service information management officer, was killed along with US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and two CIA contractors in the 2012 attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi."

""I am not supporting a candidate in as much as I'm voting against Donald Trump,"" he added.Ahead of the interview, Gibbard had just heard that Trump criticized the appearance of one of the women who are accusing the Republican presidential nominee of sexual assault.Donald Trump on accuser: 'Take a look at her ... I don't think so'""Unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable,"" Gibbard said, before launching into a tirade against Trump and explaining why for the first time throughout his music career, he has chosen to get political.The Seattle native, who was also the frontman of the Postal Service, has been making music for decades, but ""Million Dollar Loan"" is the first political song he has ever recorded.The song was inspired by Trump's story that he got his start in business in Brooklyn with a ""small loan of a million dollars,"" given to him by his father.Gibbard said that while ""there's almost too much material,"" for protest songs against Trump, that particular moment especially ""enraged"" him.""The fact that he would choose to share that story in an attempt to relate to Americans and specially to working class Americans, I found so egregious,"" Gibbard said, ""to refer to a sum of money that most people will never see in their lifetime as 'small,' to use this as a feeble attempt to relate and prop yourself up as some sort of self-made billionaire — absolutely outrageous.""A message left with Trump's campaign for comment was not returned.Gibbard said that he has ""empathy"" for Trump supporters and can relate to their dissatisfaction with Washington, but slammed what he calls ""the racist, mysoginistic and xenophobic rhetoirc that has come out of (Trump's) mouth and by proxy, the mouth of his supporters.""The musician was a supporter of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary, who also rallied against the establishment, but Gibbard said that he Sanders' platforms were too ""idealistic"" to become reality in today's political climate.Check out: #GetPolitical — A CNN Politics originial series ""I appreciate (Sanders) bringing all of these issues to the table,"" Gibbard said, but added that he was unable to ""latch on completely to his campaign"" in the same way he is unable to passionately rally behind Clinton.""I'm voting for Hillary Clinton, there's no doubt about that,"" Gibbard said, ""But I'm disappointed in the choices we were given."""	30 Days 30 Songs: Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard slams Trump in 'Million Dollar Loan'	['Love', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Sanders']	[]
2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/democrats-registration-battleground-states/index.html	Republicans maintained their edge in Iowa, and improved their position in Pennsylvania, but they still lag behind Democrats there by more than 900,000 registered voters.In Florida, Democrats added more than 25,000 more voters to the rolls than Republicans in the past month, according to new data from the Florida Department of State. The overall Democratic edge is now almost 300,000 --- lower than 2012, but higher than it was this summer.The registration deadline in Florida was delayed for a week by a federal judge after Hurricane Matthew forced millions to evacuate and displaced many from their homes. Tuesday was the last day to register.Election officials in Colorado started mailing out ballots to residents Monday, the first presidential election in the state's history where all registered voters automatically get a ballot in the mail.There are now more registered Democrats than Republicans for the first time in 32 years, according to the Colorado secretary of state. Democrats have improved their position there consistently this year: They turned an 11,600-voter Republican edge to a 6,000-voter deficit for the GOP in three months.The Democratic registration lead in Nevada swelled by almost 6,000 voters in September, according to data from the Nevada secretary of state. That means there are now 77,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans -- something Clinton and Democrats down the ballot will hope to lean on in November.New CNN/ORC polling shows a tight race in Nevada, with Clinton at 46% and Trump at 44%, a race that is within the margin of error. Early voting in the Silver State begins Saturday.Democrats also managed to hold their registration advantage in North Carolina last month.Good news for GOPRepublicans added about 12,000 more voters to the rolls than Democrats in Pennsylvania last month. But the GOP is still in the hole: The Democratic advantage is about 906,000 voters, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State.That edge isn't as large as what President Barack Obama enjoyed in 2012, when it was more than 1.1 million voters. But it is still a significant obstacle for Trump to overcome if he wants to flip the Keystone State red this year -- and Clinton leads in polls there.In Iowa, Republicans held steady with a lead of about 33,700 registered voters. The registration numbers have been stable in the Hawkeye State this year, which could spell trouble for Democrats.New numbers were unavailable from New Hampshire, where registered Republicans lead Democrats by 24,000 voters. The small electoral prize -- four electoral votes -- could be pivotal if the race tightens.The voter rolls change from month to month because people switch parties, move to new states and are scrubbed from the lists when they die. These statistics don't necessarily indicate which party is attracting new voters, but they add context to the political landscape in a particular state.​​	Democrats expand voter registration leads in battleground states	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

The organization's founder, Max Temkin, is one of the creators of the popular card game Cards Against Humanity. Money for the PAC was generated through Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump add-on packs to the game, Nuisance Committee spokeswoman Melissa Harris said. The billboard in Dearborn directs viewers to www.trumpisscared.org, which shows a timeline of Trump's statements on Muslims, Syrian refugees, and immigration. The other billboards are in Chicago near O'Hare airport, and in Orlando near the University of Central Florida. ""We on the committee really believe that Donald Trump represents a threat to our values and our democracy in ways that other Republican candidates have not. This is not about Republicans or Democrats -- this is about Donald Trump,"" Harris said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the billboard represents the sentiments of the Arab community.""It's an attempt to push back against these bigoted statements and policy proposals using humor,"" CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper said. A spokesman for Donald Trump's campaign could not be immediately reached. "	Billboard taunts Trump in Arabic	['Harris', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/obama-renzi-italy-state-visit/index.html	"But even Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whom Obama feted Tuesday with the highest form of Washington flattery, isn't a certain bearer of the Obama legacy on a continent gripped with uncertainty and populist fervor.Both Obama and Renzi warned Tuesday that an isolated Europe would be harmful for economic growth. And while Obama insisted Renzi remain in office even if his proposed constitutional reforms are voted down in December, neither leader expressed much certainty about Europe in the months and years ahead.""I believe that we find ourselves in a season of our political lives,"" Renzi said through a translator at a midday press conference in the White House Rose Garden. ""Maybe some people choose hatred, the culture of intolerance. We have to bet on liberty. We have to bet on our identity, the values that make this country extraordinary. And Europe -- Europe has a desperate need to find its own soul.""Obama, meanwhile, warned that nationalist voices in the United States and Europe would only be amplified if governments fail to address the valid concerns of citizens.""There's probably been no group of people who've enjoyed more prosperity and more peace over the last several decades than a united Europe,"" Obama said. ""If it begins now splintering because their sense is the global capitals and elites are not attentive to the ordinary concerns of people, that would be a tragedy. And my hope is that that discussion, led by Matteo and others, will continue.""The visit came as Obama's closest European allies have either been ousted from office, face uncertain futures or are nearing the end of their tenures. In rolling out the red carpet for Renzi, Obama hoped to buttress -- through a lavish display of friendship -- one of Europe's most outspoken pro-US voices, one he hopes can provide a bulwark against isolationism on the continent in the months and years ahead. ""The president does see in Renzi an up-and-coming politician that's likely to be around for a while and who shares his progressive agenda, who shares a similar outlook on lots of different issues. In that respect, he's bringing him to a very important event in part to give him visibility and give him a boost,"" said Charles Kupchan, Obama's senior director for European Affairs, who called Renzi, 41, one of ""the most promising young politicians in Europe.""RELATED: White House state dinner: Batali's pasta, 2016 politics to chew onLike his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, Renzi represents the type of left-leaning politician Obama hopes will continue his liberal legacy on the global stage once he leaves office. Once accused of failing to develop close ties with foreign leaders, Obama has worked during his final year in office to foster more personal bonds with the leaders he's leaving behind in January.The effort has ramped up due in part to a new generation of foreign counterparts entering office, including Trudeau, whom Obama hosted for a state dinner earlier this year. It's also come as Obama's closest European allies were either forced from office, like Prime Minister David Cameron, have seen their political star dim, like French President Francois Hollande, or are nearing the end of their terms, like German Chancellor Angela Merkel.That's left an uncertainty in Europe as Obama prepares to hand off US foreign policy to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The same nationalist and anti-trade forces that have propelled Trump to the top of the Republican ticket are at work in Europe, too. Obama has issued a full-throated pushback against those sentiments in Europe to decidedly mixed results.In Renzi, Obama has found a like-minded liberal who has emerged as Europe's top advocate for strong transatlantic ties. The pair have worked jointly to address migration issues and European stability; they've also spent time jogging together during global summits. Renzi has voiced eager support for Obama's stalled TTIP trade plan with the EU and has been a strong voice in Europe against austerity fiscal policy.But Renzi himself isn't secure in his job. Italians vote in a December 4 referendum of a slate of constitutional reforms he says are necessary for effective governing. Meanwhile, nationalist parties are gaining ground in capitals across the continent.Like Cameron, Renzi could find himself politically wounded after the referendum vote in December, when Italians will decide on a set of constitutional reforms the Prime Minister has pushed to streamline the governing process.Obama said Tuesday he supports those reforms, believing they will help jolt a paralyzed legislative process. But he was careful not to wade too deeply into yet another sticky referendum vote could prove tricky for a president whose stance on the last two closely-watched foreign votes -- on Britain's exit from the EU and Colombia's adoption of a peace deal with the FARC rebels -- ended up being opposed by the people.""I won't weigh in on the referendum, but the reforms Matteo is initiating, certainly on the economic side, are the right ones,"" Obama said. ""And in a global, Internet-driven world, governments have to be able to move fast and quickly and transparently.""On Tuesday, Obama and Renzi made a push toward the trade deal with Europe, even as other European leaders, including in Germany and the UK, have backed away from the notion amid anti-trade sentiments. They also discussed the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean, where migrants fleeing turmoil in Northern Africa and the Middle East have faced peril and death reaching Europe on overstuffed boats. Despite their similarities, Renzi hasn't been an entirely consistent ally for Obama, hesitating to enact tougher sanctions on Russia for its incursion into Ukraine as his country remains dependent on Moscow for oil.And he's vowed to resign his post if the constitutional reforms fail to pass, though as polls have showed support stalling in recent weeks he's avoided repeating his promise.On Tuesday, Obama said his partner should remain in place, even if he finds himself wounded in December.""I am rooting for success, but I think you should hang around for a while no matter what,"" Obama said.For his part, Renzi -- who openly backs Clinton in the upcoming election -- acknowledged that attention in the US and abroad wasn't on his own political troubles.""I have a feeling, and I think that rightly so, our American friends are a little bit more interested in November 8 than in the Italian vote on constitutional reform,"" he said. ""And so are we, might I add."""	Barack Obama looks to lift Italy's Renzi to cement agenda in Europe	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/presidential-debate-debt-economy/index.html	"In the speech, Clinton referred to the 2010 Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan as ""the right framework,"" a stance that is seemingly at odds with her 2016 platform. Throughout the year, Clinton has been decidedly to the left of Simpson-Bowles, which called for a series of changes, including raising the Social Security retirement age from 67 to 69, cutting the growth of future benefits and considering a change in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 if health care costs grow faster than expected.While the general election has been seemingly void of policy issues, the future of Social Security and Medicare may come up at Wednesday's final presidential debate, where ""debt and entitlements"" are one of six pre-selected topics.Should you let your kids watch the final debate?WikiLeaks has posted roughly 15,000 emails hacked from campaign chairman John Podesta's account this month, with more to come. The Clinton campaign is not confirming the authenticity of any of the individual emails and sharply criticized Trump for not condemning what they view to be a hack directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the purpose of influencing the US election.But the Clinton campaign is simultaneously distancing itself from the Simpson-Bowles framework and is suggesting that the Democratic nominee is now firmly in the liberal camp wanting to expand benefits.""Since the beginning of the campaign, Secretary Clinton has committed to expanding Social Security and she's made clear that she would not raise the retirement age or reduce cost of living adjustments,"" Clinton spokesperson Julie Wood told CNNIn her 2016 campaign, Clinton has promised to look at raising Social Security taxes on wealthier Americans without specifying exactly how she would do it. Currently, the Social Security tax only applies to the first $118,500 of income. At the same time, Clinton has shied away from the kinds of restraints on spending advocated in the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan.But in the April 2013 Morgan Stanley speech, Clinton suggested that Democrats who call for higher taxes while rejecting restraints on spending contribute to Washington's ""gridlocked dysfunction"" because they leave no room for compromise with Republicans.""[T]he Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right. The specifics can be negotiated and argued over. But you got to do all three. You have to restrain spending, you have to have adequate revenues, and you have to have growth. And I think we are smart enough to figure out how to do that,"" said Clinton, according to the speech excerpt contained in the stolen email.""[Y]ou've got Democrats saying that, you know, you have to have more revenues; that's the sine qua non of any kind of agreement. You have Republicans saying no, no, no on revenues; you have to cut much more deeply into spending,"" she said according to the excerpts. ""Well, look what's happened.""Trump tried to seize on the Simpson-Bowles hacked email while campaigning last week in Pennsylvania. ""The speeches also show that Crooked Hillary supports cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits, one more example of how Hillary Clinton's public position is a lie,"" Trump said. ""She wants to knock the hell out of your Social Security. She wants to knock the hell out of your Medicare and Medicaid. And I am going to save them.""Trump's suggestion that Clinton would ""knock the hell"" out of Social Security and Medicare has been called ""false"" by CNN's Reality Check team --- the Simpson-Bowles blueprint would not have amounted to drastic cuts as suggested by Trump's language. Trump has endorsed sweeping tax cuts and a ""hands off"" approach to entitlements that could explode the nation's debt somewhere between $5.3 trillion and $7 trillion, according to studies conducted by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Tax Policy Center, leading to the obvious question of how that can be paid for and maintained.Clinton's 2016 planOn her website, Clinton promises to ""oppose reducing annual cost-of-living adjustments"" and to ""oppose Republican efforts to raise the retirement age"" -- stances that her staff reaffirmed this week to CNN.The Simpson-Bowles blueprint, by contrast, called for both of those moves: it would have raised the retirement age and it would have changed how annual cost-of-living adjustments are calculated, a controversial move that would have meant lower benefits for some Social Security recipients. Changing how benefits are calculated would have reduced deficits by an estimated $280 billion over a decade.Maya MacGuineas, the president of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, maintains that the Simpson-Bowles debt plan was an ""opportunity missed"" for a country that is currently on track to add $9 trillion to the nation's debt over the next 10 years.""Under Simpson-Bowles, debt was projected to peak around 70% of gross domestic product and come back down to less than 55% of GDP by 2026,"" MacGuineas wrote in The Wall Street Journal. ""Instead, under Mrs. Clinton's proposals, the country is on track for debt to be 86% of GDP in 2026 or 105% of GDP under Donald Trump's."" MacGuineas says that a debt burden of this magnitude would slow future growth, starve public investment, and eventually lead to even larger across-the-board cuts.Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group leading the charge for expanding Social Security benefits, told CNN that he is not surprised that Clinton appears to have been supportive of Simpson-Bowles back in 2013. Green said the ""center of gravity"" has shifted since then due to organizing efforts of liberal activists and the support of leaders on Capitol Hill like Sen. Elizabeth Warren.Clinton's praise of the Simpson-Bowles framework ""would be concerning if it were a private comment last week,"" said Green. ""But it is not a surprise that she held the view of many other Democrats -- including President Obama -- in 2013.""Green says that Trump has been voicing a ""faux populism"": he talks about protecting Social Security and Medicare while advocating deep tax cuts for the rich. According to a recent study by the Tax Policy Center, Trump's tax plan would cut taxes for the top 1% of earners by $317,000 per year despite saying back in April on NBC's ""Today"" show that he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy including himself.Clinton, by contrast, has proposed a series of measures to raise taxes on Americans who make more than $250,000 per year with the heaviest burden falling on multi-millionaires.'Free lunch economics' Deficit hawks are looking forward to Wednesday's debate, believing that the nation's fiscal challenges have been virtually ignored during the 2016 campaign.""They are both embracing free lunch economics,"" MacGuineas said of Trump and Clinton ""in that they are not holding themselves responsible for dealing with ... the $9 trillion that we are on track to borrow.""""I would challenge anyone to point to any hard choice that either candidate has proposed during this campaign,"" she added. While criticizing both candidates for not doing enough on the debt, MacGuineas was quick to point out that there is an important difference between the proposals that Trump and Clinton have put forward thus far.""She would grow the debt by [an additional] $200 billion over 10 years,"" said MacGuineas. ""Trump would grow the debt by [an additional] $5.3 trillion.""""Clinton has taken the critically important step of saying that these fiscal issues matter while Trump is absolutely burying his head in the sand,"" said MacGuineas. ""They are not equivalent but neither is sufficiently fiscally responsible.""

""Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end.""Trump called for limiting House members to six years of service, and senators to 12 years during his second rally later Tuesday, the equivalent of three and two terms, respectively.The real estate mogul argued the proposal was necessary ""so that we can have a government that works again and can function properly.""""It is time to drain the damn swamp!"" Trump said during a rally in Grand Junction, Colorado.Trump said in August said in North Carolina that he would ""take a very serious look"" at the idea of imposing term limits on members of Congress. And last month, he said in New Hampshire that while he was ""absolutely OK with term limits,"" he argued, ""to me, it is not the most important thing.""""Someone does not do the job, you vote them out, but I am absolutely OK with term limits,"" he said during a rally in Laconia, New Hampshire.Trump's push for congressional term limits on Tuesday came a day after the Republican nominee called for imposing restrictions on members of Congress and executive branch officials transitioning into positions lobbying the federal government.""Together we are going to deliver real change that puts Americans first,"" Trump said here on Tuesday.Trump's new focus on governmental reforms comes as he is sliding in a slew of national and battleground state polls following two weeks of damaging disclosures about his treatment of women -- first an audio recording of Trump bragging about groping women, and then nearly a dozen allegations from women who said Trump groped or kissed them without their consent.Trump also continued to hammer Hillary Clinton over hacked emails WikiLeaks has published in the last week and decried ""corruption"" in Washington after an FBI report on Monday revealed that officials at the two departments allegedly sought to bargain over declassifying an email on Clinton's server.But while Trump on Tuesday again pointed to the ""package of ethics reforms,"" he began calling for a day earlier, the Republican nominee did not avoid straying from that message and spent time lambasting the media and even complaining about polls.""Even though we're doing pretty well in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore,"" Trump said, issuing a surprising statement given the amount of time Trump has spent at rallies reading off poll numbers.But that was when he was winning."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/donald-trump-rigged-vote-twitter-2012/index.html	"The Republican nominee's disinformation campaign continued apace during Wednesday night's debate, as Trump refused to guarantee he would accept the November 8 election results and suggested, again and without evidence, that the contest was ""rigged"" against him.This follows a week of increasingly alarmist claims that the ""distorted media,"" along with the Clinton campaign, ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""many polling places,"" have banded together to commit ""large scale voter fraud"" and deliver what Trump now clearly expects to be an Election Night disappointment.Though his efforts to undermine confidence in the American voting system are unprecedented among major party candidates, a look back at 2012 -- when Trump was a cheerleader for Mitt Romney -- tells us a lot about his 2016 tactics.Trump began that Election Day with a flurry of familiar complaints. He called out President Barack Obama on Twitter for playing basketball -- ""That is why our country is in trouble!"" -- and then blamed the Chinese for creating ""the concept of global warming.""But as the day wore on, the paranoia set in.At 2:26 p.m., he tweeted a Fox News story reporting that members of the New Black Panther Party were intimidating voters in Philadelphia and Cleveland.Two minutes later, Trump was warning of a ""very dangerous pattern developing across (the) country by Obama supporters,"" this time linking to allegations by the Michigan Republican Party that a poll watcher in Detroit had been threatened with a gun.By about 3 p.m., he started in on the conspiracy theories.""More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama,"" Trump tweeted, imploring followers to ""pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen."" ""Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote,"" he said in his next post. ""If you have any problems, notify the poll workers.""After a smattering of complaints -- ""Wrong! -- about Obama's campaign schedule, Trump issued another warning at 3:26 p.m.: ""If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters,"" he said, ""make sure you report it immediately.""Major news outlets began calling the race for Obama a little after 11 p.m., when the polls closed in California. Trump initially reacted to the news with resignation, tweeting, ""Well, back to the drawing board!"" But only 11 minutes later, he was calling for public insurrection.""We can't let this happen,"" he tweeted at 11:29 p.m. ""We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!""What happened in the meantime?The deleted tweets tell the story.Preserved here by New York Magazine, we see Trump begin to lash out at the Electoral College, calling it ""phoney"" and declaring (sic) ""the loser one!"" Obama, he said in another post, had ""lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election.""""We should have a revolution in this country!"" Trump blared.Obama, of course, had not lost the popular vote. Rather, the tallies from out west and some urban centers had not yet trickled in. The incumbent would surpass Romney in the total vote count about two hours later. But in the meantime, Trump enjoyed 15 minutes of madness:11:30 p.m.: ""Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice!

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/melania-trump-slovenia/index.html	"""Melania is very wise,"" Mirjana Jelancic says. ""Donald should listen to her more."" It's a common refrain in Sevnica, a quiet industrial town of 5,000 nestled in a lush tree-lined valley on the banks of the Sava river in central Slovenia. Melania was born in 1970 in what was then communist Yugoslavia, the daughter of textile worker Amalija and car salesman Viktor, who friends say bears a striking resemblance to her husband. ""She was always very sophisticated, extremely well brought up in a very traditional way,"" recalls Jelancic prior to Wednesday's election result, her former classmate and neighbor. ""In that respect she was different from us."" READ: Melania: I don't always agree with DonaldIf Donald was something of a troublemaker in his younger days, Melania was the opposite -- a reserved and diplomatic presence on the playground outside the modest concrete apartment where she grew up.""She was well spoken, she never swore if there were arguments between us,"" says Jelancic. ""She always mediated, forged a compromise and unified us again."" In their grade school days, the girls would knit gloves, sweaters and leg warmers as they flipped through the fashion magazines that inspired Melania from an early age.  ""Melania never said she wanted to be a model, she wanted to be a designer,"" says Jelancic. ""But I always had a feeling that Sevnica and Ljubljana would be too small for her."" 'She is too reserved'In 1987, the photographer Stane Jerko noticed Melania -- by that time a high school student in Ljubljana -- outside a fashion show waiting for a friend. ""She was a bit shy, but she learned very quickly,"" Jerko says of Melania's first ever fashion shots, described by the Trump campaign as test photos. ""The second time she was very good, like a model."" Although they haven't spoken in decades, Jerko has followed Melania's career from afar. Speaking to CNN in October, he said she would be a ""marvelous"" first lady, adding that she could have been put to better use on the campaign trail. ""I feel like she got a bit lost,"" he says. ""She is too reserved and she is too much in the background."" READ: Melania Trump: Donald was 'egged on'Abrasive election campaignProud as they are of Melania -- who will be only the second foreign-born first lady in US history -- many Slovenians were alarmed by Trump's abrasive campaign.""Trump has horrific views on women and how they should be treated,"" said Mia Janezica, a law student in Ljubljana. ""Just because he has money and power, he can't treat people like that."" Melania's old classmates were more diplomatic. ""These aren't easy words for any woman to hear about her husband, but I know that she will know how to handle this,"" said Petra Sedej ahead of the election. Sedej recalls the more carefree high school days of the late 1980s, when the pair would hang around in Melania's apartment in Ljubljana after their design classes finished. ""She was very funny, it wasn't serious all the time,"" she says. ""We both liked fashion and design and we were both quiet girls. We didn't like heavy partying or discotheques."" Farewell to SloveniaBy the early 1990s Melania left Slovenia for good, ditching a university degree in Ljubljana for the runways of Milan and Paris. In 1998, two years after Melania immigrated to the US, she met Donald Trump at a party at the Kit Kat Club in New York. READ: Melania Trump on Donald: He is who he isThey married in 2005 in a lavish ceremony at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida -- the same property where, one year later, a People magazine journalist who was there to write a story about the couple's anniversary says Trump tried to force himself on her.Trump and his campaign have vigorously denied the accusation. READ: Melania Trump asked Donald to 'tone it down'Hometown adviceMelania's visibility in her native country is almost nonexistent. Although her husband's exploits are often front page news here, journalists in Ljubljana can't recall the last time she did an interview with Slovenian media. Back in Sevnica, family friends say they haven't seen Melania in years. Her parents still own a house in town, but since their grandson Barron -- Trump's only child with Melania -- was born in 2006, they spend most of their time in New York, according to neighbors.  Standing in the courtyard of the medieval castle overlooking Sevnica, the town's mayor Srecko Ocvirk tried ahead of voting day to describe what it would mean if Trump - and by extension Melania -- won the election.""It would be a message to the younger generation that people from a tiny country can have success on the global stage,"" he said.Following Wednesday's projected result, we'll now see how true those words are.
