The winners have to keep in mind they're working bright and early the next morning.""I remember on election night I could not go to Chicago and watch the victory party because were we to win, I would have to open the transition office next morning,"" recalled Christopher Lu, President Barack Obama's transition executive director. What is a presidential transition?He said he watched the returns from DC. ""I recall being at a bar up on Capitol Hill and people asked me what I did, and I said I worked for Sen. Obama and I think they all said, 'Why aren't you in Chicago?'"" said Lu, now the deputy secretary of Labor.""I remember shortly after the race was called at 11 p.m. on election night, I got a phone call from the head of the General Services Administration,... 'We have certified that Barack Obama is the president-elect of the United States and we essentially give you keys to a federal building and access to federal funding,'"" Lu said. ""While everybody was celebrating, I knew that the next morning I had to get up and open an office at 9 a.m., and so your election night certainly has a different tone than the other people who you're working with.""That sentiment was echoed by Clay Johnson III, who oversaw the transition of President George W. Bush. Like Lu -- who has known Obama since law school -- Johnson is an old friend of Bush's, going back to their high school days at at Andover. Johnson said Bush charged him with planning for a future administration in June 1999 -- 16 months before it would happen. So election night was basically a confirmation of a mindset he had held for months. ""The campaign people, their work is over, so they are besides themselves with jubilation and just so happy,"" Johnson said. ""Election night, when the person's successful, only confirms the mindset that the transition people have had for the last three, four, five months, that this candidate is the person that's going to be the next president of the United States. That's nice. That's happy. I'm glad for them, but meanwhile, let's get back to work.""""Maybe they'll have an extra cocktail or two or congratulate their campaign buddies,"" Johnson continued, ""but their time to celebrate is Inauguration Day. ... There's a little deferred gratification for the transition people.""All that hard work...If the 2016 transitions are following the example of their predecessors, there is likely already a rough agenda for a potential President-Elect Clinton or Trump on November 9. ""At 3 o'clock on the day after the election, we were scheduled to begin decisions on who the president's White House staff should be, who the national security team should be and who the Cabinet members should be,"" said Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor who chaired Mitt Romney's transition in 2012. Trump transition fundraises with email from ChristieBut Romney lost, and Leavitt experienced the flip side of transition watching: the heartbreak. ""I had the benefit of getting up everyday for six or so months believing that Mitt Romney would become president of the United States,"" Leavitt said. ""By the time we got to election night, not only did we, but other people, believed he would be re-elected. The next morning, it was remarkable disappointment. It was hard every day for weeks not to think, 'Today is day 17, we would have done X, Y and Z.' We literally had a tick-tock schedule based on what needed to be done."" Disappointment was also the description from Ryan Cunningham, executive director for John Kerry's transition in 2004, when Kerry lost to Bush. ""It's extremely disappointing,"" Cunningham said. ""We had done all of the work, we had our notebooks ready to go, the offices were ready for President-elect Kerry, and we were in Boston on election night. We were in the hotel where President-elect Kerry would have gone to make his acceptance speech and we were literally ready to sit down with him and open the notebook to page one and say, 'Mr. President-elect, let's begin.'""Cunningham said all the work was then boxed up and the team would four years later support Obama's transition. Leavitt turned his work into a book, ""Romney Readiness Project 2012,"" which offers a road map for transition planning. But even though both remember the sadness of election night, neither feels regret for the work they put in along the way. ""Every four years someone lives the experience I did,"" Leavitt said. ""That's a difficult part of a democracy, but one that we all ought to be grateful for."""	2016 election night isn't a party for presidential transition staff

But that hasn't stopped fake ads, encouraging Hillary Clinton supporters to ""Save time. Avoid the lines. Vote from home,"" from making the rounds on social media. ""Text 'Hillary' to 59925 and we'll make history together,"" reads one, which has a ""Paid for by Hillary for President"" stamp at the bottom. At first glance, the ads look legitimate. Various versions target Hispanic and African American voters, who are historically more likely to vote Democratic. Twitter has suspended some of the accounts associated with the ads, a company spokesman told CNN. One Twitter user flagged the issue to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who responded that the company has ""fixed"" the problem. Twitter's Government & Elections team also sent out a reminder to its 2.3 million followers, saying, ""Remember: you cannot vote via text or Tweet."" While some fake ads urging people to text votes for Donald Trump have circulated, the vast majority appear to target Clinton supporters.The deceptive ads drew a sharp rebuke from the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.""Every voter is entitled to have their voice heard and vote counted. Unfortunately, some users of social media are spreading false information about voting,"" said the committee's Chris Melody Fields Figueredo in a statement.""Twitter has set a good example for all social media companies by removing such content. We encourage other social media companies to moderate voting-related ad postings and quickly remove those designed to mislead voters or suppress voting, just as they do with other kinds of damaging content,"" Figueredo added.""We encourage these platforms to help users vote and learn where they can turn if they have problems voting. The sites should actively promote all of the non-partisan voter helplines staffed by trained legal volunteers.""As CNN has noted, fake news is rampant in this election. Triple check before you share. For voting and election questions, always check with your local precinct or state election commission. Social media, however, is not your best bet. "	Vote by text message? No, you can't
2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/reality-check-no-assassination-attempt/index.html	" At one point during the rally, Austyn Crites, a registered Republican who is supporting Hillary Clinton, made his way towards the front of the crowd. He then silently held up a sign that read, ""Republicans against Trump."" A scuffle broke out as Trump supporters began pummeling him and attempted to rip the sign away. During the melee, someone yelled, ""gun!"" This prompted Trump's Secret Service protective squadron to immediately rush the candidate off-stage. The Secret Service quickly handcuffed Crites and led him away. But, after searching him, they found no weapon, and he was released after brief questioning.  The Secret Service also noted that those attending the rallies of major presidential candidates must go through metal detectors. The agents brought Trump back on stage and the rally continued. Thanking the Secret Service, Trump said, ""Nobody said it was going to be easy for us. But we will never be stopped."" Yet, several of his supporters went further, tweeting that their candidate had just survived an attempt to kill him. That night, Dan Scavino, the candidate's social media aide and Trump's son, Donald, Jr, retweeted this from a Trump supporter: ""Hillary ran away from rain today. Trump back on stage minutes after assassination attempt."" It is true the Hillary Clinton had cut short a rally in Florida earlier that day because of a downpour, though she completed her remarks in the rain. It is not true, however, that there was any kind of attempt to kill Donald Trump.  Trump's son and Scavino might be excused for stating that there had been an attempt on the candidate's life before all the facts were out. But the facts did come out... and quickly. And yet, the next day the Trump campaign declined to correct the record. Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" about retracting the tweet, Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, instead attacked the network's campaign coverage. ""Is CNN going to retract all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that have turned out not to be true? The race is over. The path is closed. It's going to be a blowout.' You guys retract that and I'll give a call to Scavino about the retweet."""	Reality Check: No assassination attempt

Voters in the most populous state have to slog through 17 such questions this Tuesday -- some colorful, some gravely serious like repealing the death penalty. But 17 questions are nothing compared with the 48 ballot measures Californians dealt with in 1914 or the 29 in 1988. The sheer number of propositions has raised eyebrows, and it has also triggered confusion and anger.""This is not direct democracy. This is a broken system,"" lamented a San Francisco Chronicle editorial over the ballot-happy state.And sometimes the only way to make sense of it all is to put it into a song, as one group of  musicians did, with lines like ""52 deals with hospital fees and Medi-Cal matching funds."" What a time to exercise your vote in the Golden State. Sex: Voters have a say on pornProposition 60 Why is this on the ballot? That's what a lot of people want to know. This is a public health issue, proponents say. Condoms protect porn workers' health and their jobs if they insist on having protection. Voters passed a similar law in Los Angeles County in 2012 and now the AIDS Healthcare Foundation wants to expand it to the entire state. Opponents say this will just drive the porn business out of the state and that it opens up the industry to frivolous lawsuits. Drugs: Legalize marijuana and control drug prices Proposition 64 legalizes recreational marijuana in California. It would also slap a 15% sales tax on retail sales of pot.Why is this on the ballot? Medical marijuana is already legal in California. This would clear a way for recreational use. California's not alone on this one Tuesday. Nevada, Arizona, Massachusetts and Maine also have similar decisions to make. Proposition 61It limits how much the state pays for prescription drugs from pharmaceutical companies. Under this proposal, California wouldn't pay more than the lowest price paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Why is this on the ballot? Think EpiPen and Pharma Bro. High-profile price hikes have cast a critical eye on big pharma.Bernie Sanders backs the measure and major drug companies oppose it. The battle over Proposition 61 could be the most expensive ballot proposition battle. Plastic bags: To ban or not to ban?More cities around California have been banning plastic bags because they're ""flimsy, storm-drain-blocking, sea-turtle-choking, virtually immortal,"" as summed up by the Los Angeles Times.  So, in 2014, the state passed a statewide ban on plastic bags, allowing a 10-cent charge on paper bags. Proposition 67The American Progressive Bag Alliance says the law needs to be repealed because it kills 2,000 manufacturing jobs. Proponents say plastic bags kill wildlife, pollute oceans and cause litter, and that the campaign is being waged by plastic bag companies. Why is this on the ballot? If state lawmakers already passed the ban, why is there a vote on this? The proposition was supported by the plastic bag industry with a slogan, ""bag the ban"" that insists that its bags ""are the most environmentally friendly option."" Extra credit for San FranciscoWhile Californians have their homework cut out for them, San Francisco residents have 25 additional ballot measures to assess. Among other issues, they have to figure out: Should 16-year-olds vote in local elections? Should noncitizens vote in San Francisco school board elections? Should the city tax soda?

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/senate-races-2016-guide/index.html	"Track Senate election resultsRepublicans currently hold a 54-46 advantage over Democrats, meaning to gain control of the Senate, Democrats would need to pick up five seats if Donald Trump wins the White House or four if Hillary Clinton comes out on top. Here's a guide to key Senate races:Toss-ups:WisconsinSen. Ron Johnson had been left for dead -- a first-term Republican facing a well-funded Democratic challenger in former Sen. Russ Feingold in a state Clinton is expected to carry. But polls show Johnson has inched much closer to Feingold, and could pull off a major upset.  Johnson has shifted his campaign tactics with a mix of positive ads about himself and attacks against Feingold, and seems to have caught Democrats off guard. Buoyed by an influx of outside spending --  such as $2.2 million from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's super PAC -- and Trump outspending Clinton on TV in the state, Johnson has suddenly found himself down by just 1 point, according to a new Marquette University poll.Still, both sides acknowledge that Feingold is the favorite heading into Election Day, especially given that no GOP candidate has won a Wisconsin Senate seat in a presidential year since 1980.New HampshireThe race between incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan -- two popular women who each have been elected statewide more than once -- has swung back-and-forth for months.7 things to watch for on election nightHassan worked hard to tie Ayotte to Trump and some of his most controversial comments, especially negative things he's said about women. Ayotte stumbled during an October debate by saying she considered Trump a role model for children. She took it back the next day, but that didn't stop Democratic groups from flooding the airwaves with her awkward response.Hassan got help from Democratic heavy hitters when she sat on the stage with Hillary Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, who won the state's Democratic presidential primary.But Republicans have dropped major dollars into TV, radio and digital advertising that argued Ayotte would be a curb on a Clinton White House. The late money fortified Ayotte's position, making the race a true toss-up.PennsylvaniaThe race has tilted in favor of Democratic challenger Katie McGinty in recent weeks as Clinton's poll numbers have held steadily above Trump's in this key battleground state. That has created a challenging playing field for GOP incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey to win re-election.Toomey's campaign has been marked by his refusal to either endorse Trump or fully condemn the GOP presidential candidate for his controversial statements and positions. This middle position has made it difficult for Toomey to win the forceful backing of Trump supporters or the support of moderate voters.McGinty, a former environmental aide for President Bill Clinton, has repeatedly blasted Toomey for what she describes as his waffling on Trump.For his part, Toomey has worked the Philadelphia suburbs to appeal to moderate voters -- especially women -- to help power him to victory.  But the national headwinds may end up being too tough for him to overcome. North CarolinaSen. Richard Burr's candidacy has been a constant cause of stress for GOP leaders. They don't think he has worked hard enough to define his Democratic opponent, Deborah Ross, or make the case that he should be re-elected. GOP groups have poured money into an effort to define Ross as an out-of-touch liberal elite, picking apart her record working as a top attorney for the North Carolina chapter of the liberal American Civil Liberties Union.Scrutiny over Burr's private comments at a recent fundraiser -- suggesting some gun owners may want to incite violence toward Clinton -- has put him on the defensive in the closing days of the campaign.This race could tip with the presidential contest in North Carolina. In 2012, Mitt Romney narrowly defeated President Barack Obama -- but polls have consistently shown Clinton leading Trump in the state. FloridaSen. Marco Rubio's loss in the Republican presidential primary turned out to be the Florida GOP's gain, as Rubio -- who had planned to retire -- was coaxed by GOP leaders into running for a second term. Rubio's presence turned his opponent, Rep. Patrick Murphy, from a top-tier recruit into a candidate Democrats considered leaving for dead before a super PAC tied to Harry Reid made a last-minute play in the state. Murphy has been stung by reports that he inflated his business resume. Rubio, meanwhile, has struggled to distance himself from Trump, and has faced constant questions from Democrats over whether he'd serve a full six-year term rather than running for president again in 2020.  A Murphy win would be a signal of a Democratic wave, since Rubio is a favorite to win a second term. MissouriSen. Roy Blunt could be one of the few Republicans thanking Trump on Election Night if he holds onto his seat. GOP strategist: Clinton will win -- but Congress won't work with herDemocrat Jason Kander, currently Missouri's secretary of state, has emerged as perhaps his party's strongest candidate of the 2016 cycle. Under fire from the National Rifle Association over his support for gun control measures, Kander -- an Afghanistan veteran and former member of the Army National Guard -- cut one of the campaign's most memorable TV ads. Kander calmly puts together an AR-15 rifle in the spot -- while blindfolded. However, Kander doesn't have the same advantage Democrats in battleground states do. Trump, polls show, is on course for a double-digit win in Missouri -- which means Blunt would have to lag badly behind his own party's nominee to lose his seat. Indiana Republicans long looked certain to hold the seat vacated by retiring Sen. Dan Coats. Then, this summer, the Democratic nominee -- former Rep. Baron Hill -- suddenly dropped out, and the party replaced him on the ballot with Evan Bayh. The popular former governor and senator was his party's best-known figure in Indiana, and was still sitting on a $10 million campaign war chest left over from his retirement in 2010. Republican Rep. Todd Young, backed by the US Chamber of Commerce and super PACs tied to Mitch McConnell, has savaged Bayh for post-Senate lobbying work and raised questions about Bayh's residency. Bayh, stuck permanently on the defensive, has seen his numbers collapse in the polls, turning Indiana into a toss-up. NevadaDemocrat Catherine Cortez Masto, Nevada's former attorney general, is seeking to become the first Latina in the Senate. Republican Rep. Joe Heck, meanwhile, is attempting to pull off what could be Republicans' lone pickoff of a Senate seat in the 2016 election cycle. Hovering over this race is retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, long the dominant Democrat in Nevada politics. This race -- like Nevada's presidential contest -- could be decided by Latino turnout. Democrats hope Trump's controversial remarks about Mexicans and immigrants will sink him with the key constituency, and they've worked for months to link Heck to Trump.   Closely-watched but outcome anticipated:IllinoisFirst-term Sen. Mark Kirk long has been considered the most vulnerable Republican running for reelection this cycle and he appears poised to lose Tuesday to Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran. While Kirk was an early critic of Trump's -- something that might have helped him in this blue state -- the former Naval intelligence officer couldn't distance himself from his own controversial comments during the campaign, such as last week, when he challenged Duckworth's statement that her family's military roots traced back to George Washington, since she also has descendants from Thailand. Kirk apologized, but his fate probably was sealed already. The race featured two disabled candidates. Kirk suffered a struck stroke four years ago and regularly uses a cane or wheelchair. Duckworth lost both her legs in battle and uses a wheelchair.ArizonaSen. John McCain appears set to win his sixth Senate term after fending off a respectable campaign from Democratic Rep. Anne Kirkpatrick in this red state that is beginning to tilt blue.McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee who is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, had a troubled relationship with Trump, who early in his campaign criticized the senator for having been a prisoner of war during Vietnam.While McCain rose above those comments and for many months backed his party's nominee -- in part because McCain knew many of his base voters supported Trump -- he ultimately withdrew that backing after the ""Access Hollywood"" video surfaced in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. IowaGOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, appears set to win re-election to a seventh term after overcoming a challenge from Democrat Patty Judge, a former lieutenant governor who was considered a serious contender when she first entered the race. Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, faced heavy criticism from Senate Democrats at the time for blocking President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. While the sharp criticism on the Senate floor may have stung, Republicans in Iowa backed Grassley's tough stance and his candidacy. Iowans also are impressed by his reliability and durability, reflected in 7,653 consecutive votes he has cast in the Senate dating back to 1993.Grassley was an early supporter of Trump's and unlike some Senate Republicans candidates who are now facing possible defeat, he never waffled on that. OhioSen. Rob Portman was considered an endangered Republican when popular former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland decided to run against him, although polls show Strickland's bid has fizzled. Portman, a former U.S. Trade Representative in the George W. Bush administration, initially backed current Ohio Gov. John Kasich's campaign for the White House, but when Kasich withdrew, Portman quickly threw his support behind Trump. However, after the ""Access Hollywood"" video, Portman withdrew that support and said he would write-in Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, instead.Before the controversial video surfaced, Portman, a soft-spoken veteran of Washington and proud policy wonk, said Trump's unorthodox candidacy helped his re-election race by energizing the GOP base.Other notable races:LouisianaTwenty-four people, including former KKK leader David Duke, have jockeyed for the open Senate seat being vacated by GOP Sen. David Vitter, who ran for governor but lost. With such a crowded field, no one is expected to break the 50% threshold of the vote to avoid triggering a December 10 runoff between the top two finishers. That means it's possible we won't know which party will control the Senate until then. Polls show Republican state treasurer John Kennedy and Democrat Foster Campbell, a member of the Public Service Commission leading the race but others -- including two GOP congressman -- are in the hunt. While Louisiana is largely a red state, it also elects Democrats statewide, such as in the most recent governor's race. The political world will turn its gaze south if the Senate is at stake in a runoff.CaliforniaDemocratic State Attorney General Kamala Harris, who is expected to win Tuesday, would be only the second African-American women elected to the Senate in history -- the first being Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, who served in the 1990s. Harris would join two other black men in the Senate, Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, and Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, which will mark the first time ever three African-Americans have served in the Senate at the same time, according the Senate Historian's Office.New YorkSen. Chuck Schumer holds a commanding lead over his Republican opponent Wendy Long and is expected to cruise into his fourth term. Schumer, who has spent decades steadily climbing the ranks on Capitol Hill, is set to take over the helm of the Senate Democrats replacing Harry Reid, who is retiring. The only question is whether Democrats pick up enough seats to make him majority leader -- a very powerful post --  or minority leader if they fall short.KentuckyRand Paul went to great lengths to preserve his ability to run to keep his Senate seat at the same time he was making an ultimately unsuccessful run for the White House.  Paul is expected to be re-elected to the chamber, where he will join former presidential rivals Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and, possibly, Marco Rubio, R-Florida, if he wins Tuesday. The three young conservatives spent that last two years circling each other like political warriors as they tried to outmaneuver one another and position themselves to win the GOP presidential primary.  They are sure to remain vocal critics of the status quo and ambitious -- each no doubt readying for future runs for the presidency."	A guide to key Senate races
5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/paul-ryan-comey-letter/index.html	"""I think it's baked into the cake,"" Ryan told Wisconsin radio host Jay Weber on WISN, explaining that the update from the FBI ""is just another saga in the Clinton chapter of them living above the rules, treating themselves by a different set of rules -- scandal after scandal after scandal.""Comey upended the 2016 presidential race just 10 days ago when he sent a letter to Capitol Hill leaders indicating the FBI located additional emails potentially related to its investigation of Clinton's private email server and was reviewing tens of thousands of email messages. Donald Trump seized on the news, and the GOP presidential nominee and other down ballot candidates' standing in the polls tightened in key battleground states.   But the FBI Director stunned the political world again Sunday, with another letter just two days before the election reporting that the review was complete and he stood by his July decision that there was not enough evidence to prosecute Clinton for improper handling of sensitive material.Ryan said concerns expressed by some in his party that Comey might have rushed through a review is ""beside the point."" Instead, he pivoted back to the message he has stressed in recent days of ripping Clinton's behavior and warning about what her win would mean.  ""The point is she mishandled classified information repeatedly. She put national security in jeopardy and why did he do this? So she could treat herself by a different set of rules than everybody else. That is a fact and that's just indisputable and that just shows you the kind of presidency we could have if we have a Hillary Clinton presidency.""RELATED: Comey's letter may be too little too lateThe speaker, who is traveling to nearly every corner of his home state of Wisconsin in the final days to urge people to vote for the entire ticket, stressed bringing Republicans back together, but didn't mention Donald Trump's name during the ten minute interview. ""I think we need to unify as a party. I think we need to get everybody to the polls.""  Ryan appeared with Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, over the weekend, and told reporters he would have attended a rally in Wisconsin with the billionaire nominee, but it was scrapped.He acknowledged that there were some reluctant voters this cycle, telling Weber, ""I get why people don't like this election cycle, I can clearly understand it, it's the most bizarre one we've ever seen.""  But Ryan said he warns that Clinton is ""sitting on top a party that's run by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  This is not a moderate party -- this is a very, very liberal left progressive party.""  The Wisconsin Republican said even with questions about Trump's ability to win, voters needed to understand the significance of down ballot races on the future of the Supreme Court and other policy priorities.""So even if we come up short at the top of the ticket it's really important that we keep the Senate to we can make sure that we have control on what judges go the bench."" Ryan stressed that he did over 100 political events in October in 45 cities in 17 states in three weeks, but is making the final push in his home state with an emphasis on getting out the vote for GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, saying the contest in his home state is ""the proxy race"" for control of the Senate.""We are just going to leave everything on the field fighting for Ron in these final moments,"" Ryan said.Ryan also told the Charlie Sykes radio show that he plans to run for speaker again.

""Tomorrow night, this election will end,"" Clinton said, prompting her supporters yell out: ""Today!"" ""But our work together will be just beginning,"" she said.Clinton, Trump in final sprint to finish lineTo Clinton's left, supporters held up letters to spell out: ""MAKE HISTORY."" Behind her, her husband and former president looked on with obvious pride, more than once clasping his hands in front of his face as though he were in awe of the woman before him.  ""I want you to know and I want you to spread he word: I want to be president for all Americans. Not just some,"" Clinton said. ""None of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more.""A grandmother to Chelsea's two young kids, Clinton concluded her final campaign speech by describing what is at stake on Election Day for parents and grandparents. ""When your kids or grandkids ask what you did in 2016,"" she said, ""you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America. An America where we build bridges, not walls. Where we prove, conclusively, that yes: Love trumps hate.""With those words, Clinton concluded her second presidential campaign. Her day had begun with a first rally in Pittsburgh, where Clinton pleaded with Americans to reject Donald Trump's ""pessimistic"" worldview. She also asked the country to look ahead to the work that needs to be done after Election Day. ""Tomorrow is the election, but that is just the beginning,"" Clinton said. ""We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, to listen and respect each other.""The former secretary of state and her campaign have been intently focused on get-out-the-vote and early voting efforts over the last few weeks, urging Americans to resist the temptation to stay home and vote before November 8 if they can. All day Monday, Clinton stressed the importance of heading to the ballot box Tuesday for those who have not yet voted. With a renewed sense of urgency, Clinton said in Pittsburgh that voting on Tuesday is a ""vote for yourself, vote for your family, vote for your futures.""And as she has been doing throughout the general election, Clinton sought to paint a stark contrast between her candidacy and Trump's. Donald Trump reflects on his bid: 'It's been some campaign'""We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America,"" she said. ""Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. Our core values are being tested in this election.""Clinton even urged voters that confront long lines on Election Day: ""Please wait.""""In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours,"" she said. ""And there have been reporters and others going up and down the line asking people, all kinds of Americans, not one type, all types, 'Why are you here?' 'Because my future depends on it,' they say.""Several hours later, campaigning in Allendale, Michigan, just outside of Grand Rapids, Clinton stressed that the support she has received from Republicans across the aisle signals ""why this election is so different.""""It's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me,"" Clinton said, adding that some Republicans ""have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party.""""Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party,"" she said. Once again painting Trump's vision as ""pessimistic"" and dark, the Democratic nominee said she simply doesn't see the country through her opponent's lens. ""People look at us with yearning,"" Clinton said. ""We are already great, but we can be greater. And we will be greater.""At her final rally, Clinton evoked Bon Jovi's famous single, ""Livin' On a Prayer,"" to concede that there was not much more she could do. ""Between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be livin' on a prayer!"" she said. "	Hillary Clinton's last campaign speech: 'Love trumps hate'

""They say it's the single greatest movement in the history of this country ... that's quite an honor.""""We'll get a tremendous amount of credit if we win or lose,"" he said, adding that his campaign has made the public more aware than ever of the ""rigged system."" He even said he ""worked very hard"" to get the government to publish data on Obamacare premium hikes, a disclosure he, in fact, did not influence. Still, Trump stressed that he's ""not looking for credit"" should voters deal a death knell to his presidential aspirations.Even as he contemplated the possibility of defeat, Trump expressed hope that his campaign would triumph Tuesday, predicting with characteristic bravado victories in blue states like Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, where he is hoping white working class voters will turn out in droves.""You watch what's going to happen in Pennsylvania, the miners are going to come out, the workers are going to come out, the steel workers who lost their jobs are coming out,"" he said.The Republican nominee also predicted women, too, would turn out in droves to support him Tuesday, despite a candidacy marred by sexual assault allegations and a 2005 tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women.Trump also appeared to relish in his final political rallies, raucous spectacles that have defined his campaign from the start. After a week during which he strove to closely stick to the prepared remarks scrolling on the teleprompters before him, Trump veered off script several times as he relived his political victories and his decision more than 500 days ago to run for president.RELATED: In final push, Trump's aggressive campaign swing creeps past midnight""It was time. It was time. I had to join the other side, which is you,"" Trump said of his switch from insider to establishment-bashing outsider. ""We are going to do things so special.""After spotting a costume mask of his own face in the crowd, Trump had the mask brought up and held it up, side-by-side with his own face before tossing it into the crowd. Minutes later, he spotted a fireman's helmet and held that up on stage as well, touting his support among firemen.Trump also marked his last day of campaigning by serving up some of the vintage, crowd-pleasing riffs that have long been staples of his off-the-cuff campaigning, like his idealistic and humorous vision of a Trump-run country.""We will start winning again and winning like you've never seen before. I'll tell you, we're gonna win again. In fact, the people of Florida may get tired of it. You may say, 'Oh, this guy, he wins too much, we can't take it. He wins too much.' You'll send your emissary, 'Please Mr. President, the people of Florida just don't want to win this much. It's true. You're winning on trade, you're bringing back jobs, you're winning at the border, the military is unbelievable, it's too much,' "" And I'll say, 'sorry folks, we're gonna keep on winning' right?"" he said."

A copy of the letter was read to CNN by a recipient.The letter lists some pro-Trump PACs, including Rebuilding America Now and Future 45, and the titles of ads they are funding. Elias' letter says that ""at no point"" did the FBI ""reopen"" the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. That's a view Clinton campaign officials and their surrogates have repeatedly made since FBI Director James Comey sent an October 28 letter to Congress saying that the FBI was investigating a cache of thousands of emails found as part of an unrelated investigation. That unrelated investigation is focused on Abedin's husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner. ""Therefore the claim in these ads is provably false,"" Elias wrote. The fight over the use of the term ""reopened investigation"" stems in part from the Justice Department's announcement in July that Clinton matter was ""closed."" The discovery of the Abedin emails in October prompted FBI officials to take another look to ensure the new findings didn't change the July conclusion. Comey, on Sunday, affirmed that the July decision stood. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Sunday that perhaps some parts of the tough ads would have to remove the now inaccurate claims about Clinton given the FBI's latest findings."
