He offered no evidence to back up his wild claim.""I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate,"" Trump said during a rally here. ""Because I don't know what's going on with her, but at the beginning of her last debate, she was all pumped up at the beginning, and at the end it was like, huff, take me down. She could barely reach her car.""Trump appeared to be conflating the debate with last month's 9/11 ceremony where Clinton struggled to get inside her van on her own due to a bout with pneumonia.Reached for comment, the Clinton campaign said Trump is trying to depress voter turnout by his ""shameful attempts to undermine an election weeks before it happens.""Trump has repeatedly questioned Clinton's ""strength and stamina,"" raising concerns about her physical and mental fitness to be president -- all without providing any evidence for his claims.But Trump's suggestion that Clinton has been taking drugs in order to perform well at the presidential debates is a new step for him.""A lot of things are going on, folks. A lot of things. I think she's actually getting pumped, you want to know the truth? She's getting pumped up,"" Trump said Saturday. ""She's getting pumped up for Wednesday.""Trump added that presidential candidates are ""like athletes"" and should undergo drug screenings before the next debate.""Athletes, they make them take a drug test. I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate,"" Trump said. ""I'm willing to do it.""Trump lays out drug policyTrump's comments about Clinton came as he laid out his policy to combat drug abuse and trafficking while speaking in New Hampshire, a state that has become a flashpoint of opioid and heroin abuse.The Republican nominee called on the Federal Drug Administration to sped up its approval of ""abuse-deterring drugs,"" called for lifting the cap on the number of patients doctors can treat and said the federal government should reduce the amount of opioids that can be manufactured in the US.Trump also said he would seek to further incentivize state and local governments to mandate treatment through drug courts to help drug offenders break their addictions, and said he supported giving first responders' access to the drug Narcan, an antidote that can save the lives of individuals who overdose on opioids."

She told the paper the real estate magnate ""took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,"" without her consent.  She said Trump held her in place and kissed her. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Heller's claims.A spokesman for Trump's campaign said there was ""no way"" Heller's account is true.""The media has gone too far in making this false accusation,"" Jason Miller said in a statement. ""There is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on Mother's Day at Mr. Trump's resort. It would have been the talk of Palm Beach for the past two decades. The reality is this: for the media to wheel out a politically motivated Democratic activist with a legal dispute against this same resort owned by Mr. Trump does a disservice to the public, and anyone covering this story should be embarrassed for elevating this bogus claim.""Heller has donated to Democratic campaigns on multiple occasions, including a $2,700 donation she made to Clinton's presidential campaign this year. She also told The Guardian ""her husband's family is involved in a years-long effort to recover initiation fees that her late in-laws paid to join Mar-A-Lago.""But The Guardian said it corroborated Heller's claims with a relative who was seated at the dining table as well as a friend whom Heller told a year and half ago.Heller is one of nearly 10 other women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual assault, including accounts of kissing and groping. Trump has vehemently denied all the allegations, suggesting they are surfacing now because of a ""smear"" campaign to derail his candidacy.""Remember this, it's a rigged election because you have phony people coming up with phony allegations with no witnesses whatsoever,"" Trump said at a campaign rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. ""The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her (Clinton) president.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Heller's version of events as reported by The Guardian."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/15/politics/donald-trump-ohio-gop-chairman/index.html	"The campaign's Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik, slammed Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges in a letter Saturday to the state party's central committee for wavering in his support for Trump in a series of recent interviews and announced that Borges ""no longer has any affiliation with the Trump-Pence campaign.""Paduchik said Trump is ""very disappointed in Matt's duplicity.""""Mr. Trump told me, 'This is why people have lost faith in the establishment and party leaders.' I have to agree with him. Too often some leaders of our party have been quick to bail on candidates and principles; it's why our nation is on the wrong track,"" Paduchik said.Borges told CNN on Saturday that he ""won't let a staffer's ego get in the way of us doing all we can to win elections up and down the ballot this year.""The rift could be dangerously damaging to Trump's chances of winning the presidency, as Ohio is the battleground state where the Republican nominee remains best positioned for victory, even as his poll numbers have dipped in a slew of other swing states.Borges responded to Paduchik's allegations in a letter to the Ohio GOP's central committee, saying he has helped the Trump campaign build a political organization in the state, working directly with Trump and the campaign's national political director, including by recommending Paduchik for the state director post.Borges also noted in the letter that ""the majority"" of the Trump campaign's Ohio staff are paid by the state party. He said the state GOP has worked in close coordination with the Trump campaign.Borges added that Paduchik never shared his concerns with him until his public letter earlier on Saturday.Paduchik also noted in his letter that the state Republican Party has been fronting some payroll costs and urged the committee to ensure that continues, should Borges seek to nix that agreement.Paduchik's letter came after Borges sat for a series of interviews following the release of a 2005 tape in which Trump brags about being able to grope women without their permission, and after women began publicly accusing Trump of sexually assaulting them this week.Borges said in those interviews that he was unsure whether he would vote for Trump and said that he had been urging the Republican nominee to also stop attacking fellow Republicans, as Trump has done this week in the wake of top Republicans defecting from his campaign.Paduchik accused Borges in his letter of having ""routinely exaggerated his relationship"" with Trump and accused the Ohio GOP chairman of ""promoting himself"" in a bid for the Republican National Committee chairmanship. Borges has not publicly declared an intention to seek the office.At least two state central committee members came to Borges' defense Saturday.""We are poised to win elections up and down the ballot for Republicans this year in Ohio, just like we did in 2014 under Chairman Borges' leadership,"" committee member Jo Ann Davidson said.Jim Simon, another committeeman, said the election cycle has been ""difficult and challenging ... unlike any I've ever seen.""""Matt has handled it perfectly,"" Simon said. ""Drawing fire away from our candidates and officeholders is the chairman's job, which is something I'm sure Bob (Paduchik) doesn't understand."""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/15/politics/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-goldman-sachs-speeches/index.html	"The remarks, which were hacked as part of an extensive breach of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's email account, show Clinton commenting on Wall Street's role in financial regulations, relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the damage done to US foreign policy by past WikiLeaks releases.The Clinton campaign declined to confirm the authenticity of any of the transcripts and CNN cannot independently confirm their authenticity. But the campaign has not challenged any emails in other WikiLeaks releases and this is the second time transcripts from Clinton's paid speeches have been made public by the group.Clinton's campaign compared the WikiLeaks hack to Watergate, the scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.""There is no getting around it: Donald Trump is cheering on a Russian attempt to influence our election through a crime reminiscent of Watergate but on a more massive scale,"" Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said Saturday. ""We're witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election.""The US government has said WikiLeaks is working with Russian operatives.'For political reasons'Clinton made three paid appearances for Goldman Sachs between the time she left the State Department in 2013 and when she announced her presidential campaign in early 2015.Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms were a rallying cry for Bernie Sanders supporters during the Democratic primary. Trump has looked to seize on the WikiLeaks releases, regularly touting them at his events to the point that Democrats have argued he is condoning hacking by Russian operatives. Trump said Saturday that he almost delayed a rally in Maine because of the emails' release.Clinton's campaign was obviously worried about the speeches, too, the hacked emails show. Staffers asked Tony Carrk, the campaign's head of research, to look into the content and present top campaign aides with comments that could prove politically troubling. Pence appears to split with Trump over Russian hacking roleIn total, Carrk highlighted five comments from the paid speeches. The comments mostly pertained to regulating the financial industry.In an October 2013 speech to the financial firm, Clinton implied that action was necessary to curb Wall Street street abuses ""for political reasons.""""There was also a need to do something because for political reasons, if you were an elected member of Congress and people in your constituency were losing jobs and shutting businesses and everybody in the press is saying it's all the fault of Wall Street, you can't sit idly by and do nothing,"" Clinton said.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed in 2010 in response to the great recession and looked to impose tighter regulations on financial institutions. While business leaders, especially those leading the financial firms, were generally against the measure, the decision was politically popular with Democrats who blamed Wall Street for the recession.In the same speech, Clinton said that ""more thought has to be given to the process and transactions and regulations so that we don't kill or maim what works, but we concentrate on the most effective way of moving forward with the brainpower and the financial power that exists here.""Clinton on foreign policyIn a June 2013 speech, just months after she left the State Department, Clinton said she wished the United States could intervene in Syria ""covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene.""""We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can't help themselves,"" she said. ""They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we're doing and I want credit for it, and all the rest of it.""In a bit of irony, the WikiLeaks release also brought to light Clinton's reaction to a past release from the group that exposed Democratic cables that cast foreign leaders in a negative light.Clinton joked that she embarked on the ""Clinton Apology Tour.""""It was painful,"" Clinton said. ""Leaders who shall remain nameless, who were characterized as vain, egotistical, power hungry, corrupt. And we knew they were. This was not fiction. And I had to go and say, you know, our ambassadors, they get carried away, they want to all be literary people. They go off on tangents. What can I say. I had grown men cry. I mean, literally.""On Russian relations, Clinton said she wishes she could ""continue to build a more positive relationship with Russia."" Clinton added that Putin has rejected some of their attempts to work together ""out of hand."" Comments largely in line with public positionsClinton collected at least $1.8 million for at least eight speeches to big banks, according to figures released by Clinton's campaign and tax documents she released earlier this year.And while the transcripts show a more blunt, less reserved Clinton, much of what the former secretary of state said to Goldman Sachs and other groups appear generally in line with some of what she has said publicly.Clinton campaign discussed ways to refute rape accuser's claimsIn another 2013 speech, Clinton dismissed the idea that President Barack Obama would have been able to accomplish more if he had schmoozed with Republicans in Congress more often.""I know that he spent a lot of time early on in the first term with the Republicans in trying, as you recall ... it turned out that the Republicans' side, particularly in the House, couldn't deliver,"" she said.Clinton's campaign has so far declined to comment on specifics in the releases, in part, because they don't want to validate any of the hacks. Instead, Clinton's top aides have dismissed the releases as partisan efforts by the Russian government to elect Trump president.But the releases, which have come daily for the last week, are impacting Clinton's campaign by forcing her aides to constantly comment on emails written long before Clinton ran for president.And, for possibly this reason, Clinton told Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, at an event in October that she wished the presidential election was shorter.""Look, I am of the mind that we cannot have endless campaigns,"" said. ""It is bad for the candidates. It's bad for the country. I mean, part of the reason why it's difficult to govern is because an election ends and then the next day people start jockeying."""

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/passport-visa-photos-glasses/index.html	Starting November 1, those taking pictures for US passports and visas will be required to remove their glasses for the photo. The State Department says this is to help take away shadows or glares that tend to cause delays in the processing passport and visa applications. The goal is to have more consistency in photo standards.Pictures with glasses in current passports and visas are fine until they expire.According to the State Department, more than 200,000 passport customers submitted noncompliant photos last year, which caused a delay in the processing of applications. The department says the most common problem was glasses, which caused the applicant to not be clearly identified. In 2017, State expects more than 20 million passport applications -- a record high.But there are rare exceptions: If applicants have a medical necessity to wear glasses in their photos, they can do so as long as they have a doctor's note.

""It was at a club ... Next thing I know, there is a hand up my skirt. I basically just pushed the hand away, turned and looked, got up off the couch and we all moved.""""I recognized the eyebrows right away and I turned to my girlfriends and I was like 'look at this dude,' and they are like, 'That's Donald Trump,' and I was like, 'Oh yeah, that's Donald Trump, the eyebrows,"" she continued. Anderson first made the allegations to The Washington Post, which reported that the incident took place in the early 1990s as well as her claim that Trump touched her vagina.CNN has not yet independently verified Anderson's account.Her account comes as numerous women have accused Trump this week of groping them in the past. Trump has vehemently denied the accusations.Anderson told Cooper she did not consider her experience to be sexual assault at the time and did not report it to club management because she did not have confidence they would act on her complaint. ""Could I have said something?"" she asked. ""Maybe? But who am I going to tell?""""Assault in my mind meant something else,"" she said. ""Hitting was assault. I was very unaware of mental abuse, manipulation, bullying.""Trump on Friday called Anderson's account ""nonsense"" and ""false,"" arguing that he rarely sits alone, even though Anderson never claimed Trump was sitting alone at the time of the incident.""I was sitting alone by myself and then I went wah to somebody,"" Trump said at a Greensboro, North Carolina, rally, motioning to his side as he attempted to re-enact Anderson's account of his behavior."

And I actually like my speeches without the teleprompters,"" Trump said before grabbing one of the stands holding up the teleprompter panel to his right, which had toppled over.""Get this thing out of here!"" he shouted.Moments later, both teleprompters were gone from the stage of the candidate who had long resisted delivering speeches off a teleprompter before giving in two months ago. Since mid-August, Trump has delivered every rally speech with teleprompters on stage.""I like teleprompters. They're fine. But it's sort of cooler without it, don't you think? I like it better without,"" Trump said Friday, later adding he was having ""so much fun without these damn teleprompters!""The Republican nominee's decision was his second act of rebellion on Friday, a day Trump spent mostly fuming about allegations of groping and unwanted kissing that are threatening to destroy his campaign.During an earlier rally, Trump dismissed his campaign advisers' wishes for him to talk about economic issues and not address the sexual assault and misconduct allegations he is facing -- and then he did just that.His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway laughed off the teleprompters incident on Friday. ""You know we let Trump be Trump,"" she said. ""It's the end of teleprompters for tonight.""Asked if Trump would be back on the teleprompters at his next rally, Conway muttered ""who knows"" before offering a tongue-in-cheek comment:""He's always on message, don't you think?""Conway declined to say whether she was bothered by Trump continuing to focus on the sexual assault allegations plaguing his campaign, but noted that Trump said Friday evening he wanted to talk less about the allegations.""I'm glad he's here talking to voters because one candidate should be,"" Conway said in a shot at Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton, who has had a light campaign schedule this week.But confronted with the fact that Trump spent much of Friday talking about the allegations against him, Conway shrugged off the question and walked away from the group of reporters questioning her."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/ron-johnson-russ-feingold-donald-trump-wisconsin/index.html	"Ever since Donald Trump began plummeting in nationwide and swing-state polls, Republicans in tough re-election fights have been weighing how aggressively to elbow out their presidential candidate. Several competitive candidates have disavowed Trump entirely -- but others have tried to traipse the tightrope.Debating here in the shadow of Lambeau Field in his first showdown against his Democratic challenger, former Sen. Russ Feingold, Johnson attempted to do just that, rolling out a check-and-balance argument. The strategy allows Johnson -- and other Republicans -- to effectively concede the presidential race without having to invite Trump's scorn with an un-endorsement. ""I'm not going to defend the indefensible,"" said Johnson when asked if he could pledge to ""100%"" support Trump given the spate of recent allegations of sexual misconduct against him. ""But I will hold whoever is our president accountable.""It was a preview of the playbook that Republicans could employ in the final three weeks before Election Day -- broadly and non-controversially defending Trump, relentlessly attacking Clinton and promising to not let Clinton steamroll him if both are sent to Washington.Yet Johnson left open the door to abandoning Trump should he look more and more poisonous to down-ballot candidates. Johnson, speaking to media after the debate wrapped, first dismissed a question about ditching Trump if he is getting ""destroyed"" as a ""hypothetical"" -- but then left open the possibility when pressed by a reporter.""Sure, anybody could do something that would make me withdraw my support,"" Johnson said. ""Donald Trump's a change agent. So am I.""Johnson had been long thought to be one of the two Republican incumbents almost certain to be replaced by a Democratic challenger. Despite being an incumbent, Johnson is actually lesser well-known than Feingold, the state's longtime Demcoratic senator who Johnson ousted in 2010.But after leading Johnson for nearly the entire year by double digits, the race has surprisingly become competitive: the most recent survey, by Marquette University Law School, showed Feingold leading by just 2 points.That has invited some increased scrutiny of Feingold, who on Friday did not prosecute the anti-Trump campaign that Senate Democratic candidates are executing nationwide. After the first question about Johnson's fealty to his nominee, Feingold did not utter ""Trump"" a single other time during the entire hour-long debate.Johnson similarly tried to place Clinton's unpopularity as a weight on his Democratic opponent, and by the end of the evening, both candidates were calling for their rivals to renounce their party's nominee. Feingold, speaking to reporters after the debate, was a late endorser of Clnton -- even on Friday, he wouldn't say whether he supported fellow liberal Bernie Sanders in the primary -- and he labored to tell reporters that Clinton would carry out an ""ethical presidency.""And as for those surveys showing a tightening race?""A close race and a close poll focuses the mind,"" Feingold said."

The two then began making lewd comments about her.Trump has apologized for the language he used in the hot-mic moment, calling it ""locker room banter.""
