You want to profile Arab or Muslim men. How would that work?Trump: Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel does it. And Israel does it very successfully.O'Reilly: They do it at the airports. They do it at the airports.Trump: Well, they do it. They do it. And when they see somebody that they would like to talk to, that they would like to look at, that they would maybe like to open up their satchel and take a look inside, they do it. And they don't like to do it. I don't like to do it. But we have to be -- you know, you have a woman who is 87-year-old in a wheelchair from Sweden and we have to look at her. We have to look at somebody else. It's ridiculous what's going on there.O'Reilly: So, what would you do though?Trump: If you want to be so politically correct --O'Reilly: Do you have a vision of how that profiling would work?Trump: It works. And we see somebody that we think there could be a problem. At airports and other places. You talked to them and you see what's going on.O'Reilly: But I think they do that now.Trump: We don't do that.As Trump would say, excuse me, excuse me -- but we do.Screening at airports does not just entail putting everyone through a metal detector. The Transportation Security Administration has had protocols for years that tell agents what kinds of behaviors to check. But TSA insists it is behavioral, not racial, profiling. Last year, TSA began a pilot program to update these protocols. The agencies does not publicly lists the kinds of activities that can draw an agent's attention. But in March 2015, The Intercept website published what it said was a confidential memo that told TSA screeners at that time what to look for. Among the suspicious signs: - Exaggerated yawning.- Excessive complaints about the screening process.- Widely open staring eyes.- Wearing improper attire for location.- Whistling as the individual approaches the screening process.- Gazing down.- Exaggerated or repetitive grooming gestures.- Face pale from recent shaving of beard.- Rubbing or wringing of hands.- Excessive throat clearingSo if TSA is already profiling people based on behavior, what further profiling would Trump like them to do?

It and Syria's Raqqa -- the group's self-declared capital -- are the major targets left for the US-led coalition to take back from its control.Dunford's statement is the clearest sign from a senior US military official that the military battle for Mosul could soon begin once the Iraqis make the political decision to proceed. It also means the battle for Mosul may be raging during the US presidential election, with US forces facing dangers on the battlefield. Those troops might also be called upon to help begin providing humanitarian aid.Dunford, along with Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday. Both are expected to face stiff questioning from Republicans on the panel about the Obama administration's strategy to fight ISIS.CNN has learned the Pentagon is now considering setting up new remote bases well outside Mosul as hubs from which US forces can operate. Those types of bases, given their locations, are likely to be less secure than the large bases the US has generally been using. They could be used by US military advisers who are expected to work with the Iraqis in the field. Because of the remote locations, security may be difficult. US forces may move ""in and out"" of the bases rather than locate there consistently, one official said. These bases are in addition to the large Iraqi base south of Mosul at Qayyarah, where hundreds of US troops are already located to assist with supplies, logistics and support for the Iraqi forces.A key decision to be made is whether additional US conventional and special operations forces will be needed for ensuring the Iraqis succeed, several US defense official told CNN. The US forces will not be on the front lines but will be out in the field with Iraqi units, officials said. Some forces already in Iraq could be reassigned to northern Iraq, or additional forces could be sent.President Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's meeting in New York Monday also signaled the Mosul operation may soon unfold. ""We feel confident that we will be in a position to move forward fairly rapidly,"" Obama said. Calling Mosul a ""challenging battle,"" Obama also noted that the US will be ""prepared to help provide rapid humanitarian assistance"" to displaced Iraqis.Abadi underscored the urgency.""We hope within the next few months we're going to kick Daesh out of Mosul and we'll deliver a huge blow to what Daesh believes in,"" said Abadi, using another name for the terrorist group."

Ever. Ever. Ever,"" Trump said to approving nods from the nearly all-white crowd.""You take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street. They're worse -- I mean, honestly, places like Afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities,"" he continued. ""And I think it's resonating.""His comments came despite the fact that African-Americans in the US have faced dramatically worse circumstances throughout history -- from slavery to Jim Crow laws.President Barack Obama, the first black US president, took on similar assertions by Trump last Saturday while speaking Congressional Black Caucus gala.""You may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or Jim Crow,"" Obama had said. ""But we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. We will educate him.""In harsh rebuke of Trump, Obama referred to the businessman as ""somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life.""On Trump's quest to win over African-American voters, Obama quipped: ""Well, we do have challenges, but we're not stupid."" The Republican nominee has made a concerted effort to reach out to black voters over the last month, including visiting a predominantly black church in Detroit, and visiting the water plant and a church in the majority-black city of Flint, Michigan. But his visit to Flint was marred in controversy after the church's pastor interrupted Trump to keep him from leveling political attacks. He was also met with hecklers there who called out his record as a landlord in New York, where he faced a civil rights lawsuit from the Justice Department in 1973 -- which Trump settled -- alleging he discriminated against black tenants.Critics have also panned Trump's outreach to African-Americans for painting the lives of black Americans in broad-brushed and bleak terms.Trump has argued that black voters should flock to his candidacy because he will ""fix it"" and has slammed his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for seeing black Americans as votes, not as people -- even though she has a history of championing civil rights issues and more than 9-in-10 African-Americans support Clinton, according to recent polling.Trump's support with African-Americans stands in the low single digits according to recent national polls.Despite his words aimed at drawing black voters to his campaign, Trump on Tuesday did not address the most police recent shooting of an unarmed African-African American man. Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old black man, was shot by police Friday night in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Clinton addressed the shooting earlier Tueaday on ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show,"" calling it ""unbearable"" and arguing for the need to ""tackle systemic racism."""

That means there only could have been two entities responsible,"" deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Tuesday night, referring to Russia and Syria. He didn't specify which country's planes carried out the strike.""We hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing,"" Rhodes said, referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the United States and Russia.Is there any hope left for Syria?Denials from Russia, SyriaRussia denies it was responsible and says that terrorists carried out the attack. Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Tuesday that analysis of video footage from drones of the strike show that militants were following the convoy, according to the Russian state news site Tass.""It is clearly seen in the video that a terrorists' pickup truck with a towed large-caliber mortar is moving along with the convoy,"" he said.Syria has also strongly its forces were behind the attack.UN outrage UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the attack ""sickening, savage and apparently deliberate.""""Just when we think it cannot get any worse, the power of depravity sinks lower,"" Ban told world leaders convening Tuesday at the UN General Assembly annual meeting.Eighteen of the convoy's 31 trucks were hit, the United Nations said. The convoy was due to deliver food and medical aid for some 78,000 people in eastern Aleppo, where an estimated 250,000 civilians are facing severe shortages as a result of a government siege.Current intelligenceRebels, locked in a vicious civil war with the Syrian government, reportedly hold the area where the convoy was struck. Russia has been helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the fight, though it has said its efforts are focused on attacking terror groups such as ISIS that have flourished during the conflict.The US military has been reviewing classified radar, signals and aerial surveillance intelligence.Based on that intelligence and reports from the ground, it has concluded that only Russian warplanes were in a position to attack this location at the time, the official said.UN chief calls convoy attackers in Syria 'cowards'For now, no intelligence indicates Syrian aircraft or helicopters were in the area, though that type of information could come to light later, the official said.The official added that reports from the ground appear accurate about at least two waves of airstrikes -- a common Russian military practice. Trucks inside as well as outside the compound on the road were hit.But the Obama administration has not yet fully decided how much information it wants to reveal, concerned that it will expose sensitive military intelligence capabilities to the Russians.What about the the ceasefire?Monday night's attack came just hours after Syrian authorities declared an end to the fragile ceasefire, which began September 12.Soon afterward, Syrian warplanes resumed airstrikes in Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and deadly violence returned across parts of the country.The events have left the hard-fought ceasefire brokered by Russia and the US in tatters, although US officials said they believe the ceasefire agreement is still in place.Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said the US preference is to continue with the ceasefire effort, paving the way for more cooperation between the Russian and US militaries in Syria, but that Moscow's actions could prevent further coordination.""We have not seen good faith. This was an outrageous action,"" Rhodes told CNN's Michelle Kosinski. ""It raises serious questions about whether or not this agreement moves forward.""He added, ""In conflicts like this I think we have an obligation to continue to pursue whether there are diplomatic openings. If we can't, we walk away.""US Secretary of State John Kerry said before the convoy was struck Monday that any decisions about the ceasefire would be made between Washington and Moscow. ""The Syrians didn't make the deal,"" he said, ""the Russians made the agreement."""	Syria convoy attack: US blames Russia	['Obama']	[]

Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016,"" he tweeted, with a graphic that said: ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" Find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on ""The Daily DC"" podcastThe graphic had an official Trump logo that the Republican nominee shares with his running mate, Mike Pence.Despite widespread condemnation, the campaign stood by the tweet and in a statement called Trump Jr. ""a tremendous asset to the campaign.""""America has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clinton's planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk,"" said senior communication adviser Jason Miller. ""Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what's needed to protect us.""Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, also defended the comparison to CNN's Erin Burnett.""What we do know is that many Americans are concerned with the lack of vetting that's going on. We see what's happening all across Europe ... that has been a disaster,"" she said Tuesday on ""Erin Burnett OutFront.""But Mars Candy, which produces Skittles, said in a statement, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy. We respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing."" 'This is disgusting'The graphic's language apparently wasn't a Trump Jr. original, but instead that of former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois and now a conservative talk radio host. Walsh tweeted at Trump Jr.: ""Hey @DonaldTrumpJr, that's the point I made last month. Glad you agree.""Walsh's tweet included a screenshot of a tweet he made dated August 13.Hillary Clinton's campaign spokesman Nick Merrill retweeted Trump Jr. adding: ""This is disgusting.""The 2016 campaign has featured heated rhetoric around US policy for accepting refugees. Clinton has called for an increase in the number of Syrian refugees the US should accept and Trump has called for ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants, as well as a ban on immigrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism, such as Syria.One of President Barack Obama's former speechwriters responded to Trump Jr. with a link to CNN reporting about a little boy in Aleppo, Syria, who became the face of the humanitarian crises in Syria.""Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr, this is one of the millions of children you compared to a poisoned Skittle today,"" Jon Favreau tweeted.Former Obama campaign staffer, Jason Sparks, tweeted at Trump Jr. photos of the Syrian refugee children in the crises and said: ""These aren't Skittles, @DonaldJTrumpJr.""Musician John Legend, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump on Twitter, wrote: ""There's a tiny chance that anyone could be a murderer.

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/barack-obama-un-diplomacy/index.html	"Never mentioning Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by name, the President's final address to the United Nations General Assembly was at heart an impassioned rebuke of the GOP candidate's policies on trade, immigration and multiculturalism -- and a defense of liberalism and tolerance -- delivered 49 days before votes are cast for his replacement.He painted a dark picture of the future awaiting Americans, and the world, if the forces of ""aggressive nationalism"" or ""crude populism"" win out. And he specifically inveighed against building a wall -- a centerpiece of Trump's proposal on border security.""A nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,"" Obama declared to the assembled representatives of the UN's member states.Gone were Obama's idealistic appeals to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons and an agenda focused on peace, as were his previous UN addresses. The ""hope and change"" of his argument as a presidential candidate himself was also replaced by exhortations against a future filled with chaos.""Time and again human beings have believed they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment, only to repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate,"" Obama suggested.""We have to remember the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war,"" Obama said. ""Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history.""He pointed to growing divisions and discontent at home that challenge those decisions, and noted that the shortcomings of globalization had created ""an uncertainty and unease and strife"" that required acknowledgement, but not turning inward.""I believe that at this moment we all face a choice,"" Obama said. ""We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back.""It was Obama's eighth and final address to the UN body, which enthusiastically welcomed him in 2009 after he moved to reverse the unilateral approach of his predecessor George W. Bush. In his speech that year, Obama vowed to work within international bodies to confront the world's crises while pushing an agenda combating climate change and nuclear non-proliferation.But in the intervening years, the harsh realities of diplomacy settled in, both for Obama and the UN. The organization's inability to stem suffering in Syria and Ukraine laid bare the continued struggles to combat breaches of international law, while Obama's own work toward combating violent extremists has failed to stop terrorist groups from committing atrocities.Obama's address Tuesday reflected those realities. He drew titters from the collection of world leaders and diplomats in the high-ceilinged General Assembly hall when he noted that ""at times both America's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington. And perhaps too many in Washington believe that, as well.""He made scant mention of individual world flash points, choosing instead to offer a more thematic recap of his foreign agenda.""The world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. And yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife,"" Obama said. ""Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface.""RELATED: Clinton, Trump meet world leaders for very different reasonsObama continued his tradition at the UN of acknowledging areas where the US has fallen short in its practice of democracy, saying his country and other developed nations must set a better example for emerging democracies.Citing the pervasive role of money in politics, entrenched party allegiances and a patchwork of voting laws, Obama said it was up to long-established nations to show the way forward.""Those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully. Because both the facts and history is on our side,"" Obama said. ""We better strive harder to set a better example at home.""Obama used his own efforts to help revive a stalled economy as an example of US leadership during his tenure, saying other countries would be wise to follow his lead of going after corruption and unfair tax policies.He also cited the deal with Iran to curtain its nuclear program, and reopening of ties with Cuba and Myanmar, as examples of a successful global approach.RELATED: Global leaders at UN tackle world's worst to-do listBut the array of places where Obama's approach hasn't yielded the outcomes he projected during his first appearance here in 2009 were also unavoidable. That includes his inability to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians -- a major topic in his first four UN addresses that was entirely absent during last year's speech. This year, the President took issue with both sides' actions toward one another. He criticized Israeli settlements, saying the only path to Mideast peace will come when the two sides reconcile deeply held differences.Palestinians must ""reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel,"" Obama said.But he also said peace won't come until ""Israel recognizes it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land.""Obama plans to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to ""discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground,"" according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.Another persisting crisis -- Russia's continued incursion into Ukraine -- also drew Obama's attention Tuesday.""In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force,"" Obama said. ""If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. It may fuel nationalist fervor for a time. Over time, it's also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure.""Indeed, many of his harshest warnings were aimed at global government practices that damage democracy and liberalism and called for the rejection of strongmen, authoritarian and tribalism. ""There appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now,"" he told the assembled leaders. ""And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest."""

Kennedy's daughter and the former Maryland lieutenant governor. There were roughly 40 people in the room, and it's not clear how many people heard him, though multiple sources did.The Republican former president's embrace of the Democratic nominee represents a dramatic new chapter in the complicated three-decade-old relationship between the two most prominent families in American politics.It's a stunning political move -- one that comes just 49 days from the election, and less than a week before Clinton and Donald Trump square off in their first debate.Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN's Erin Burnett Tuesday that she respects ""the 92-year-old former president very much and his decision.""""It is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race,"" she added on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""But look, this was a bruising primary ... so I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there."" News of his support for Clinton came first on Facebook, when Kennedy Townsend posted a photo of herself with George H.W.

She later took down the Facebook post. GOP's Trump divideTrump's controversial candidacy has split the group of former Republican nominees. Mitt Romney has hammered Trump in speeches and on Twitter, calling him unfit for office. But former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole has endorsed Trump, as has Arizona Sen. John McCain -- though somewhat reluctantly, often referring to ""the Republican nominee"" rather than Trump by name. Neither George H.W. Bush nor George W. Bush had weighed in on the general election -- even as Trump savaged George W. Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq. However, many of the 41st and 43rd presidents' Cabinet secretaries and national security officials have backed Clinton. George H.W. Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft endorsed Clinton in June, saying she ""has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time."" George W. Bush Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said on CNN in August that he ""would have preferred Jeb Bush, but I think Hillary is a great choice. I am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country."" And Louis Wade Sullivan, the Health and Human Services secretary under George H.W. Bush and the only African-American in his Cabinet, said this month that ""though my enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is somewhat tempered, I certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than Donald Trump."" But George H.W. Bush isn't speaking for his entire family. Marvin Bush, the former president's youngest son, has said he would vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. George P. Bush, George H.W. Bush's grandson, has backed Trump. And Jeb Bush, Trump's former primary rival, has said he won't vote for Trump or Clinton. A representative for George W. Bush wouldn't comment on Kennedy Townsend's Facebook post or how George H.W. Bush would vote. The representative simply said George W. Bush is ""spending his time working to keep the Senate in Republican hands and is not commenting on the presidential campaign.""The Bush-Clinton relationshipThe evolving relationship between the Bush and Clinton families began in 1992, when Bill Clinton ran against -- and defeated -- incumbent President George H.W. Bush. Eight years later, with Clinton term-limited out of office, Bush's son, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, succeeded Clinton on a pledge to ""restore honor and dignity"" to the White House -- a not-so-subtle knock on Clinton's marital infidelity. But Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush have also spent their post-presidencies teaming up for philanthropic endeavors. And in recent years, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have increasingly appeared together. The two grew so close that George W. Bush has referred to Clinton as his ""brother from another mother,"" and Clinton has said the two bonded over becoming grandfathers. A Bush-Clinton matchupEarly in the 2016 campaign cycle, it appeared the two families could be headed for another showdown with the presidency on the line: Hillary Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- the 41st president's son and the 43rd president's brother -- was a Republican candidate and a fundraising powerhouse. Even if George H.W. Bush hadn't endorsed Hillary Clinton, it was hard to envision him backing Trump.Neither of the former Bush presidents attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump became the GOP's nominee -- with the Bush family staying out of presidential politics after Jeb Bush, denounced repeatedly by Trump as ""low-energy,"" exited the race.

He was eventually expelled by the Sudanese government for his involvement with al Qaeda and subsequently relocated to Afghanistan.Sudan is one of only three countries to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, with the other two being Syria and Iran.When asked about the apparent contradiction, Kirby issued a statement to CNN, saying, ""We engage bilaterally in a number of areas and cooperation in these areas will help us normalize ties.""  But, he added, ""Complete normalization of relations would require significant progress in a range of other areas, including an end to the fighting in Darfur and the Two Areas."" The latter designation refers to the South Kordofan and Blue Nile states of Sudan which, along with Darfur, have been the site of violent armed conflict between the government in Khartoum and opposition groups over the past several years.The International Criminal Court issued warrants for the arrest of Sudan's long-serving President Omar al Bashir in 2009 and 2010 for ""crimes against humanity"" and ""war crimes"" pertaining to his actions during the conflict in Darfur.""As we've consistently said, we would initiate the process of rescinding Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism only if the government of Sudan met all the criteria,"" Kirby said.According to Kirby, these steps included the ""certification that the government of Sudan has not provided support to international terrorism in the preceding six-month period and that the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future,"" noting that the ""process has not been initiated.""""We have been quite clear with the Sudanese on the steps that need to be taken,"" he added."
