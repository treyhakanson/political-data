During their fractious, occasionally raucous face-off in Las Vegas, Nevada, the candidates also touched on abortion, immigration, national debt and foreign policy. The fight for Mosul, which began Sunday, is being led by a diverse 94,000-member coalition comprised of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga allies and thousands of irregulars from various Iraqi minority groups after more than two years of ISIS rule. The US is advising on the effort to reclaim Iraq's second-largest city and ISIS's top stronghold in the country. The battle is expected to take months, officials say, but would be a crucial step in routing the terror group. Is Trump right that ISIS fight should be secret?'She wanted to look good... so they're going in'On Wednesday evening, Trump insinuated that Iraq launched the mission to help Clinton win the White House. ""The only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough,"" Trump said. ""They want to look good.""""She wanted to look good for the election,"" he continued, ""so they're going in.""Clinton said Trump's claim reflected his belief in conspiracy theories.""I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks,"" Clinton said. ""You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.""The exchange was part of a contentious back-and-forth between the candidates over the war in Iraq, the war in Syria and the rise of ISIS, for which the New York real-estate mogul blamed Clinton. ""We should never have let ISIS happen in the first place,"" Trump said. Final Trump-Clinton debate in 140 characters (and more)Clash over AleppoModerator Chris Wallace of Fox News asked the candidates about the ongoing siege of Aleppo in Syrian. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad, along with its Russian allies, are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped.""They're being slaughtered because of bad decisions,"" Trump said. When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large-scale deaths in bombings there, the Republican candidate didn't respond, saying instead that ""Aleppo is a disaster,"" and adding that ""a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton.""Later, discussing Syria, Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton, saying ""wait 'til you see what happens in the coming years,"" and blaming her. ""Thanks a lot, Hillary,"" he said. Freed from ISIS -- but not from fear No-fly zoneClinton made a clear pledge to pursue a no-fly zone in Syria if elected -- a policy decision President Barack Obama has declined to take. Critics of the idea say that, among other problems, it would expose US jets to the danger of accidental clashes with Russian planes.  Clinton said she was ""well aware of the concerns"" about establishing these zones that Obama and some military officials have expressed. But she said, ""I think a no-fly zone could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict.""  ""This would not be done on the first day,"" she said, adding that her administration would make clear to the Russians and Syrians that the purpose would be to create a safe area for ordinary Syrians fleeing the violence.  ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians this would be in the best interests of the Syrians,"" Clinton said.  "	Trump: Iraq launched Mosul campaign to help Clinton	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

The attack killed two Peshmerga soldiers and injured two French military personnel north of Mosul, Iraq, the Peshmerga officer said.While the technology employed by ISIS has been comprised of commercial items available to any consumer, Major Gen. Gary J. Volesky, commander of coalition forces fighting ISIS in Iraq, said the US is keeping an eye on it.The drones are ""clearly not the capacity or capability that, that we have, but they are using them,"" he told reporters at the Pentagon Wednesday. ""We have seen them, and we're taking measures to mitigate that.""Beyond the battlefield in Iraq and Syria, the CTC report says terror groups seem to have advanced the most at using drones for surveillance and strategic communications.But, the report finds, ""terrorist interest in drones as an attack platform has been diverse and has spanned a number of ideologies and geographic regions.""And with the proliferation of various drones and reduction in their sizes, among other factors, the report warns that a ""tipping point"" of more diffuse use by terrorist groups may not be far off.In June 2013, Iraqi authorities arrested five men tied to ISIS who were reportedly planning to use helicopters to release Sarin and mustard gas as part of an attack against targets in Iraq, North America and Europe.Last month, the United States bombed an ISIS chemical weapons plant that was housed in a converted Iraqi pharmaceutical factory, and the US-led coalition has targeted key ISIS figures involved in its chemical weapons program.""We have been very, very focused with our targeting to go after those places where we think this is being produced, those individuals that are producing it, and the resources they require to do that,"" Gen. Joseph Votel, the top military commander for US forces throughout the Middle East, said at the Center for American Progress in Washington on Wednesday.ISIS' development of chemical weapons is not ""an overly sophisticated threat at this particular point, but yet it is out there, and so we have got to continue to address that"" he said."

""Just ask the question, 'What's it going to be like to have to govern?'""Heilemann suggests looking to the 2008 election and its aftermath for a clearer picture of exactly what kind of Washington will greet the next president. President Barack Obama came into office, Heilemann said, ""after a relatively unifying election...and then giving a speech in Grant Park that was magnanimous and big,"" only to find an uncooperative Republican Party ""ready to undermine him from the moment he walked in.

The new ads come as Trump's campaign promises a massive ad blitz leading up to Election Day.  Campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN Tuesday the organization is sticking with its plans, announced in late September, to air $100 million in ads during the final seven weeks of the campaign.  To reach that level of spending, Trump would need to be particularly aggressive, reserving an additional $30 million in television ads on top of the $14 million he has already booked for each of these remaining three weeks.Trump has continued to say in recent days that he plans to spend $100 million of his own fortune on the race, which would require Trump spend another $40 million by Election Day. Miller said he was not aware of any changes to that plan.The new ads give Trump the fodder to make his economic and anti-Clinton case to television viewers, who have watched a series of negative revelations about Trump, including allegations of sexual misbehavior and assault.Anti-Clinton messageFour of the new Trump ads are decidedly anti-Clinton.  One features Laura Wilkerson of Pearland, Texas, a mother whose voice cracks with emotion as she explains how her son, Joshua, was killed by an undocumented immigrant.  ""Hillary Clinton's border policy is going to allow people into the country just like the one that murdered my son,"" she says.  Another unearths controversial comments Clinton has made about young African-American gang members as well as more recent comments about supporters of Bernie Sanders and Trump.  ""Super predators. Basement dwellers. Deplorables,"" a graphic on the screen reads. ""What elitist arrogance."" Two other spots argue against Clinton's Washington experience as a senator and secretary of state.  ""She's been there 30 years. Taxes went up. Terrorism spread. Jobs vanished. But special interests and Washington insiders thrived,"" the narrator says in one spot. In another: ""Hillary failed as secretary of state, and now the world is unraveling.""Positive economic messagesThe remaining two new Trump ads argue the Trump's policies would be good for the economy.  ""I think Donald Trump cares about the working man, because the working man has made him what he is,"" a hard-hat wearing worker says in one spot, which is airing in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. ""Donald Trump has given this whole area around here a glimpse of hope for our future.""  The other spot argues Trump's proposals around taxes, healthcare, childcare and maternity leave can the middle class achieve the American Dream.  ""It takes a builder to rebuild the American Dream, and Donald Trump has the blueprint.""  "	First on CNN: Trump debuts 6 new TV ads, pledges an advertising blitz	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Our latest snapshot of the current state of play in the battle for 270 electoral votes is one that is moving significantly toward Clinton.What's changed?-- Arizona (11) moves from from ""lean Republican"" to ""battleground""-- Utah (6) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground""-- Florida (29) moves from ""battleground"" to ""lean Democrat""-- Nevada (6) moves from ""battleground"" to ""lean Democrat""Road to 270: Electoral College mapNote: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.The state of playIn this new electoral map outlook, we have moved the biggest electoral prize among the battlegrounds - Florida - to leaning in Clinton's direction.  The same is true for Nevada.We have also moved Utah to a true battleground due to third-party candidate Evan McMullin surging in several polls there and the clear struggle Trump has had to rally what is usually the most reliably Republican state to his side.And for all the talk of Clinton's team trying to expand the map into places like Georgia, Missouri and Indiana, the one Republican-leaning state that does seem to have shifted full force into the toss-up battleground category is Arizona. It will likely not be too long before we see Clinton campaign in the state following on the heels of high profile surrogates such as her daughter, Chelsea, Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders.The math is becoming truly daunting for Trump. In our current outlook, which is just a snapshot of the current state of play and not a projection of what will happen on November 8, the states solidly in Clinton's corner or leaning in her direction add up to 307 electoral votes -- well above the required 270 to win the White House. Trump's got 179 electoral votes either solidly or leaning his way. The remaining true battleground contests are in Arizona, Ohio, North Carolina, Utah, Maine's 2nd Congressional District, and the 2nd Congressional District in Nebraska. That leaves a total of 52 electoral votes up for grabs.Trump has a final debate performance in front of a huge national audience and 20 more days of non-stop campaigning to dramatically upend this race and mount what would be the greatest political comeback in modern times. He has proven unable or unwilling to do that over the course of the last 23 days since the first debate.

We're out here to offer people a real alternative,"" he said in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Dana Bash Tuesday during an outdoor ""Politics on Tap"" event on the Las Vegas strip.Johnson used the opportunity to speak out against Trump's recent claims that the election is rigged. ""No, elections are not rigged,"" he said. ""Why does he continue to say these things day after day? I have no clue."" He went on to say that the claims may cost Trump the election. ""I think the guy's toast. I don't think people are going to vote for him.""GOP congressman: No, the election isn't riggedWhen asked about the recent allegations from women who say Trump inappropriately groped them, Johnson did not hesitate to say he believes them. He also strongly criticized the Republican nominee for the lewd language he used in the recently published 2005 recording. ""I think that his comments that he made were beyond inappropriate,"" Johnson said. ""And he says, 'Gee, that's locker room talk' ... Nine women have come forward, that goes beyond locker talk. That's reality."" Trump has denied all the allegations, suggesting they are surfacing now because of a ""smear"" campaign to derail his candidacy.But Johnson did not only have harsh words for the Republican nominee. Unlike his running mate -- former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who has said he will focus exclusively on beating Trump -- Johnson argued he doesn't think Clinton should be president either. ""There's just so much out there,"" he said. ""The revelations what I find incredible are saying one thing to Wall Street and saying one thing to Main Street."" He continued: ""If Hillary Clinton is elected president, government spending will go up ... We're going to continue to drop bombs.""Trump adviser: Whoever loses needs to give concession speech to 'help bring America back together'While Johnson is only polling at 6% nationally, according to CNN's most recent poll of polls, swing state polling shows he could make a difference between a Trump or Clinton victory in key states like Ohio, Florida, Nevada, and North Carolina. High-profile surrogates like Michelle Obama have cautioned on the trail against voting for third party candidates saying it is ""throwing away your vote."" Johnson argues it is just the opposite: ""Throwing your vote away is voting for somebody that you don't believe in.""Despite several recent embarrassing foreign policy gaffs, Johnson spoke fluently about the recent efforts to recapture Mosul. ""In the end, it's going to be Iraq and its government being able to maintain control over Mosul if it's going to be successful,"" he said. When it comes to the longer term goal of defeating ISIS, Johnson agreed the United States needs to be involved in fighting terrorism and praised President Barack Obama for recognizing the important role that regional partners must play, but cautioned against the US contributing to the ""net number of deaths."" ""When we bomb ourselves I think innocent people get killed and the threat to the United States rises as a result of that,"" he said. ""I don't want to be a part of the United States adding to the death tolls in these countries.""At one point during the conversation, Bash asked Johnson if he was high when he asked, ""What is Aleppo?"" during a now infamous interview. Johnson, who has been outspoken about his views in favor of legal marijuana, said that he has not been using the drug during the campaign and explained that it was simply ""a brain fart."" He laughed at himself when searching for words later in the interview, saying ""I'm not having a moment.""Johnson was also brutally honest when asked why he's not getting national security briefings that he requested along with Clinton and Trump. ""I'm just not relevant,"" he said.In a lightening round of questions at the end of the event, Johnson summed up his view of his role in the race with a creative answer to a question from Bash about what he would say to Trump and Clinton if he was trapped in an elevator with them. ""Don't worry, I'll figure a way out of this,"" he said laughing. ""I'm the handiest guy that you have ever met."" Johnson finished with a poignant note, ""Much as I love you both, I'm going to save you both."""	Gary Johnson says the election isn't rigged	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/politics/election-day-russia-hacking-explained/index.html	"The public is understandably concerned about the integrity of next month's election.But election officials and cyber experts say it's virtually impossible for Moscow or some other outside group to influence the election outcome.Hackers could create mischief -- some say ""chaos"" -- but the election system is resilient enough to withstand shocks. The key concern, experts feel, is public perception: Sowing distrust is easily achieved even without successful hacks. Here are five things you should know about the security of the election system.1. Why is it unlikely the presidential election can be swayed by a hack?The American election system is decentralized by design, with state, county and local governments all managing voting. Even though many precincts use voting machines, none are connected to the Internet, nor are they connected to each other.That's not to say voting machines don't have vulnerabilities -- those have been well documented and studied for more than 10 years. But to influence the outcome of a presidential election or statewide race would require physical tampering on a grand scale across in counties across multiple states on Election Day: In other words, it essentially can't be done.""Nobody is going to be able to change the outcome of the presidential vote by hacking voting machines. The system is too distributed, too decentralized, too many implementations for any individual actor or group to make substantial change,"" said Nicholas Weaver, a computer scientist and cybersecurity expert at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.""Yes, they're horribly insecure, yes, many of them give me nightmares,"" he continued, ""but the attacker's not going to be able to change the outcome of the presidential vote that way.""2. What kind of preparation is there to ward off attacks?Election officials are on guard for any problems on voting day. Machines go through rigorous pre-election testing every cycle, and many states do post-election audits to verify results as well. About 75% of votes will be cast on machines that generate a paper trail, adding further confidence.States can also tap federal resources. The Election Assistance Commission creates standards for voting technology and certifies it, and provides officials to help with security preparedness. The Department of Homeland Security says at least 36 states and 11 local election officials have responded to their offer to help with vulnerability scanning, as well.""I think that elections are as secure as they've ever been, and I think that with the added thought of incidents occurring, election officials are paying extra attention to this,"" EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks said in an interview with CNN. ""Voters should have the confidence that if they got to the polls, their votes will be counted accurately.""3. What can be affected by hackers?A bigger concern for most experts isn't the actual hacking of ballots or vote totals but registration databases. Many of those are connected to the Internet as a way for voters to register, make changes or check their status.That was the target in Illinois, where hackers successfully stole roughly 90,000 voters' information, such as their names, drivers license numbers and last four Social Security Number digits. But no data was changed in the system itself, which would indicate an attempt to go beyond mere identity theft to cause electoral disruption.Nearly two dozen other states have reported attempts to break into their registration databases, with the US government saying the attacks have been traced back to servers in Russia.RELATED: More states request election security helpBut it is unknown if those attempts are related to election fraud and government hackers or run-of-the-mill cyber criminals, who also tend to be based in Russia.""Whoever did that hack really just wanted the voter data from Illinois in some way,"" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall of the Center for Democracy & Technology. He explained that voter registration data is some of the most useful for committing identity fraud.The real threat to the ballot box would be if hackers delete voters from the database entirely, meaning when they arrived at the polls, their names wouldn't appear in the system. 4. What if something goes wrong?By law, voters who don't show up as registered properly can cast a provisional ballot and then follow up to verify their registration in the days following the election. The process would be tedious, but not prohibitive.Voters can show their voter registration cards at polling stations, and many states also keep frequently updated back-up copies of their voting rolls offline or in hard copy, and. Those back-ups could be used to rectify any changes made by hackers.""If you're just trying to disrupt the election, there are easier ways than an attack on a voter registration database that would probably not stop people from voting anyway,"" according to Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir, a Texas election official who works on election security.Resilience in response to the unexpected is a primary focus of election officials in general. Any number of things, from natural disasters to poorly designed ballots to long voter lines, can disrupt Election Day. Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler recently testified before Congress that he was making contingency plans for flooding as well as cyber intrusions.""We don't get a lot of sleep right before early voting starts because we just want to make sure everything's perfect, so we check and check and check,"" DeBeauvoir said. ""Election administrators often play the game of what if: What if this happens, what if that happens? And we play that scenario enough so we know what to do if any circumstances arise.""5. So should voters be worried?Experts say rather than the hacks, it's the reaction from the public that scares them.Rumors of hacking -- even if not successful -- could undermine faith in the election and play into a losing politician's claim that the election was ""rigged."" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has frequently questioned whether the election results can be trusted.""That's what worries me, not just the cyberattack impacting the vote, but the cyber fears playing into such a narrative,"" Weaver said. ""The damage is not the computer hack. The damage is the reaction to the computer hack.""RELATED: White House: We will respond to Russia hacksDeBeauvoir also urged voters to have ""patience,"" saying Election Night results are always a first pass, with officials verifying results and collecting mail-in ballots over the following days.""In World War II, there used to be a saying: Loose lips sink ships,"" DeBeauvoir said. ""It's the case in this instance, too. It's not real that there's a concern that there's going to be a hack that would affect voters, it's the talk about it that's the real hack.""She added, ""It's cheap, easy and effective. It works really well unless we all recognize that's what it is and give voters information."""	No, the 2016 presidential election can't be hacked	['Trump']	[]

Moore said on Facebook last month that the community board overseeing the Midland Theater in Newark, Ohio, opted against allowing him to perform there over concerns that he was trying to sway the election. That's not in dispute. ""TrumpLand"" is an unabashed effort to get Hillary Clinton elected, and to thwart Donald Trump -- just as Moore's 2004 film, ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" was a bid to defeat George W. Bush.Moore held a free sneak preview Tuesday for his latest film at the IFC Center in New York, where the film began being shown Wednesday. Despite the hurried premiere, the film was not entirely unexpected. Moore had been teasing it for days on Twitter.""Yes, some rumors may be true,"" Moore tweeted over the weekend. ""I 'might' be putting the finishing touches on an 'October Surprise' for this election. Then again..."" The unconventional release is fitting for what appears to be an unconventional movie for Moore. In a review for The New York Times on Wednesday, the critic Neil Genzlinger wrote that, in ""TrumpLand,"" Moore ""seems to be decidedly uninterested in provoking anyone with this new offering."" Genzlinger described the performance shown in the film as a ""stand-up comedy routine"" that at times ""sounds like a commencement address.""The film, Genzlinger wrote, ""is not an attack on Mr. Trump, but instead a paean to his opponent in the presidential contest, Hillary Clinton.""Moore has spoken out against Trump's candidacy throughout the campaign, but the Oscar-winning filmmaker hasn't exactly been a diehard Clinton supporter over the years. In 2008, Moore said he was ""morally prohibited"" from voting for Clinton due to her past support for the Iraq War. He endorsed Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary earlier this year.But Moore said in May that he would ""absolutely"" back Clinton if she were the nominee. And during last month's first presidential debate, Moore made a plea to Sanders supporters.""Fellow Bernie voters -- admit it, there's nothing she's said we disagree with,"" Moore tweeted.

But would she demand a litmus test from potential nominees on the issue? Even retired Justice John Paul Stevens -- who dissented in the case during his final term on the court -- thinks litmus tests are a bad idea.What about the Second Amendment? During the last debate she squeezed in a comment trying to make the point that you can respect the Second Amendment while still advocating for comprehensive background checks and closing the gun show loophole. Will she be pressed on Antonin Scalia's landmark opinion District of Columbia v. Heller?Clinton, a Yale Law School graduate and previously an attorney in Washington, D.C. and Arkansas, has certainly praised President Barack Obama's nominee to the high court, Merrick Garland. But will she commit to making him her nominee if Senate Republicans run out the clock through Jan. 20, 2017, as expected?  Who is her favorite Supreme Court nominee -- past or present -- anyway?And what is she looking for in a justice? Is ""real-life experience"" and ""understanding what people are up against"" the same thing as empathy?How important is diversity on the bench? Currently almost all appellate court judges with fancy law degrees.Trump has put out 21 potential names for the bench. Will she? Why not?Garland's hearings -- or lack thereof -- have frustrated Nan Aron, president of the progressive Alliance for Justice. ""The Supreme Court is hobbled and the risk of deadlock on critical questions is high,"" Aron said at the beginning of the term. As a senator, Clinton voted against Chief Justice John Roberts as well as Justice Samuel Alito. But should that come up, she would likely note that those two at went through the process and had hearings.For Donald Trump:Trump has developed his roster of potential justices with help from conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation -- but will he pledge to keep to that list?Recently Trump talked about the 20 judges on his list of potentials. What about number 21, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the only non-judge? Has he fallen off the list? And speaking of lists, will Trump commit to those candidates, or might he ultimately go off-list. Justice Rudy Giuliani anybody? Trump has been watched closely to see how closely he sticks to the conservative line on the court. C. Boyden Gray, who worked in the George W. Bush administration hopes the candidates will be asked meaningful questions about how they approach judicial nominations. ""The next president should nominate judges who have a demonstrated commitment to the rule of law, who will hold agencies to the limited scope of their authority, and who possess the internal fortitude necessary to defend the Constitution without being swayed by flattery or criticism,"" he said on Tuesday.Is Trump looking for a litmus test on Roe or Obergefell, the landmark Supreme Court cases from 1973 and 2015, respectively, in favor of abortion rights and same-sex marriage? How far is he willing to go on those issues?Does he think that it's fair not to hold hearings for nominees, even after the election? Arizona Sen. John McCain seemed to float that this week until his office clarified.Judicial conservatives love Trump's list of potentials. But his take on eminent domain and the controversial Kelo v New London decision? Not so much. Ted Cruz tried to make this an issue against Trump in the primary; in the general election, does Trump maintain his stand?Trump has threatened to sue news organizations and mused about changing libel laws if he wins the White House. Is that a real threat? What about the First Amendment and a potential lawsuit against a media organization?""One of the things I'm going to do if I win... I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,"" Trump said in February.Does he think Ruth Bader Ginsburg will have to recuse herself if the election were decided by the courts?
