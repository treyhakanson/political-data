Ecuador granted Assange political asylum after he said he feared an extradition to Sweden could lead to another extradition to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks.Ecuador said last month it would allow an interrogation of Assange, which is now scheduled to take place October 17.'Risk he will evade legal proceedings'The order from the Swedish appeals court said that Assange ""is still detained in absentia,"" adding that it ""shares the assessment of the (lower) district court that Julian Assange is still suspected on probable cause of rape... and that there is a risk that he will evade legal proceedings or a penalty.""It was the eighth time the European arrest warrant has been tested in a Swedish court, with all seven previous judgments also having gone against Assange.WikiLeaks tweeted a statement from Assange's legal team Friday after the decision, saying their client was ""disappointed.""""Mr. Assange will appeal the decision and remains confident that his indefinite and unlawful detention will cease and that those responsible will be brought to justice,"" the statement said.The decision comes a day after WikiLeaks released medical records claiming that Assange's mental health would be adversely affected if he remained holed up in the embassy.""Mr. Assange's mental health is highly likely to deteriorate over time if he remains in his current situation ... It is urgent that his current circumstances are resolved as quickly as possible,"" said a report published by the organization on Twitter.A 27-page medical analysis, which was attributed to an unnamed ""trauma and psychosocial expert"" in London and dated December 11, 2015 was published alongside supporting documentation.Assange's legal team has intensified its calls for Sweden to adhere to a non-binding opinion by the United Nations working group on arbitrary detention, which stated in February that their client's confinement in the embassy should be considered as arbitrary detention enforced by Sweden and Britain.Exchange offeredOn Thursday, Assange said he would agree to serve prison time in the United States in exchange for President Barack Obama granting clemency to imprisoned former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, the group's Twitter account said .""If Obama grants Manning clemency, Assange will agree to US prison in exchange -- despite its clear unlawfulness,"" the group said.Assange attorney Barry Pollack told CNN Thursday the deal would have to include a pardon for Manning, who was convicted in 2013 of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in US history. Manning was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against her, including violations of the US Espionage Act.Thursday's tweet offering the deal was posted along with a letter from Pollack addressed to Attorney General Loretta Lynch that pressed the Department of Justice to provide information about its ongoing criminal investigation into his client.Pollack argued in the letter, which was written last month, that over the course of the investigation into Assange, which is in its sixth year, the Justice Department ""revised the department's regulations with respect to obtaining evidence from and charging members of the news media.""Pollack also said ""the department publicly announced it was closing its criminal investigation of the handling of classified information by Hillary Clinton,"" as another development that justifies more transparency into the case against Assange.The Justice Department told CNN it was unaware of any deal being offered by Assange or his representatives. An official with the US Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, where he would be prosecuted, had no comment."	Julian Assange's arrest warrant upheld	['Lynch', 'Obama']	[]

""I'm not going to start discussing someone else's private emails. I've already spent a lot of time talking about my own, as you know.""Asked again, Clinton said: ""I'm not going to comment on anything that is said in a private email.""Trump, meanwhile, took to Twitter Wednesday night to disparage Powell, seemingly in response to harsh words from the former Bush administration official.""I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster. We can do much better!,"" Trump said.Powell had written in June: ""Trump is a national disgrace and an international pariah.""Clinton has had to repeatedly answer questions about her exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of state. At times, Clinton has indicated that Powell advised her to use private email instead of the State Department system.""I have told Hilleary's [sic] minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try,"" Powell wrote in another email.Powell's emails were posted to DCleaks, a website known to share hacked documents associated with high-profile figures, and first reported by BuzzFeed and The Intercept.An aide to Powell confirmed the accuracy of the emails to CNN but offered no further comment. Powell's emails offer an unvarnished look at how the former secretary of state views one of his successors.""For good reason she comes across as sleazy,"" Powell writes after being asked when he plans to endorse Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.In other emails, Powell writes that the investigations into the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack ""is a stupid witch hunt"" but that some blame rests on Clinton.Clinton returns to the campaign trail on Thursday in North Carolina after spending three days at home after being diagnosed with pneumonia. In the interview -- which was taped on Wednesday -- Clinton said she was ""well aware that I still have work to do"" to attract young black voters. ""I'm very committed to continuing to travel across the country, to talk about and hear from young African Americans about the struggles they face daily,"" she added.Clinton also declined to answer whether she would ask for President Barack Obama to take back Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court should she win in November.""I think we should stick with one President at a time,"" Clinton said. ""I'm going to let this President serve out his term with distinction and make the decisions that he thinks are right for the country. I think he's got a pretty good track record, and he's earned that right."""	Hillary Clinton doesn't want to talk about Colin Powell's emails	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/clinton-struggles-democratic-senate-majority/index.html	"Hillary Clinton returns -- and not a moment too soonLess than two months until Election Day, Democratic confidence has been shaken, as Hillary Clinton suddenly finds herself trailing Donald Trump in some swing states and a fresh batch of polls show GOP incumbents in the lead.""Everybody needs to step it up,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.In Ohio and Florida, GOP incumbents now have double-digit leads, according to a new CNN-ORC poll released Wednesday, undercutting Democratic efforts to pick up seats once viewed as prime opportunities. In New Hampshire, two polls show Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte now in the lead after falling behind Gov. Maggie Hassan last month. And in Nevada, Rep. Joe Heck holds a slight edge over his Democratic challenger Catherine Cortez Masto, buoyed in part by Trump's sudden resurgence in their state.This comes as other seats that once appeared within reach, like John McCain's in Arizona, seem to be a steeper climb. And a prized Democratic recruit in Indiana, former Sen. Evan Bayh, has stumbled on the campaign trail, seeing his once commanding lead now shrinking to single digits.One thing in common: Trump has all-but-erased Clinton's lead in some of the key battleground states with major Senate races, according to a batch of new public opinion polls. He's up by 5 points in Ohio and 3 in Florida, according to the CNN-ORC poll. ""If I'm a Senate Democrat, you have to start thinking about: Do I run away from her?"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said of Clinton.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said if Trump keeps the margin with Clinton close -- even if he ultimately loses the White House -- his party will keep the majority.""I am [concerned] if there's too huge a gap between him and Mrs. Clinton, but that gap appears to be closing,"" Cornyn said. ""Most of our Senate candidates are outperforming a Republican nominee in their various races for the Senate, so that's positive, but obviously there's two months to go and anything can happen.""These developments are worrying Democratic leaders, who are uncertain whether Clinton will be an asset come Election Day. But they are pinning the blame for the tightening poll numbers on the deluge of outside spending helping GOP candidates -- much of that cash coming from Republicans who decided not to give to Trump.""It's more challenging now than it once was. Our candidates I think are quality candidates and are going to win and give us a majority, but it's tougher now because of all of this money,"" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat.Asked if Clinton would have coattails to help Democratic candidates, Durbin said: ""It still remains to be seen what impact Hillary Clinton is going to have on downballot races.""The national landscape still favors Senate Democrats, who only have to worry about losing one seat this cycle while the GOP is trying to hang onto more than half-a-dozen in competitive races. To take back the Senate, Democrats need to pick up four seats if Clinton wins the White House, five seats if Trump wins. The party still has an advantage in winning in Illinois and Wisconsin, while New Hampshire, Indiana and Pennsylvania are well within reach. Moreover, other states once viewed as long-shots are tough but winnable, like Missouri and North Carolina.But if Trump improves his standing, it will undermine the main Democratic campaign theme of 2016: Tie GOP candidates to Trump.""I don't care what the polls show,"" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, whose retirement is creating the race for an open seat in Nevada. ""We know that they don't work.""CNN/ORC polls: Trump's national gains extend to Florida, OhioReid, who has been using his perch as Democratic leader and head of the Nevada Democratic Party to go after Heck, said bluntly: ""Trump is going to lose Nevada and Joe Heck deservedly is going to lose the Senate race because of his being a pawn for Donald Trump.""But Republicans say that their candidates have effectively created their own brands in their states, making it fruitless to tie candidates to Trump. Several polls over the summer found that a majority of undecided voters, both nationally and in swing states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, said that their choice for a presidential candidate wouldn't make a difference on how they voted down-ticket.In the House, where Democrats need to net 30 seats to take the majority, they need a Clinton landslide to help their party regain control of Congress. Democratic officials say it's far too early to tell if that will occur, arguing that House races won't start breaking until October.Harry Reid: Trump is ""not slim and trim""Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, won't predict the Democrats will win the majority. But he argues that Trump is a far bigger liability for the GOP than Clinton is for Democrats.""What we're seeing across the most competitive congressional districts across America, about two dozen of them, is that Secretary Clinton is still holding a lead over Donald Trump on average,"" Lujan said Tuesday.Still, with new polling showing the GOP doing better, Republicans are breathing a little easier, for the first time in a while.Asked to what he attributed his lead in the polls, McCain deadpanned: ""My good looks."""

There is a legitimacy to their protests,""Dionne told David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.The conversation was recorded last week, hours before Hillary Clinton gave her much-quoted remarks at a New York City fundraiser at which she depicted half of Trump's supporters as belonging to a ""basket of deplorables,"" driven by their biases to support his candidacy. But Dionne asserted his own view that Trump's appeal was a play to prejudice.Race and racism in the 2016 campaign""But we will also have to look back and say what part of the Trump movement was not primarily about this economic protest, but really was... people who are uneasy with the changes in the country, with the changes in the culture?

""What was birtherism if not something that played at racial feeling in the country?""During the hour-long conversation with Axelrod, Dionne, author of the new book ""Why the Right Went Wrong"", said that in this bitter campaign, Hillary Clinton would have to rely, in part, on fears of a Trump presidency to drive turnout in her favor on Election Day. ""The question is will she get enough turnout from the old Obama coalition, particularly from African-Americans who turned out in record numbers for President Obama, to some degree from Latinos, and then also from [Bernie Sanders supporters] and young people? I think Trump's radicalism or extremism, the sense of threat people feel from the possibility of a Trump presidency, can inspire a lot of turnout,"" Dionne told Axelrod. ""We forget that sometimes fear inspires at least as much turnout as hope.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/trump-children-business/index.html	"Handing the business to his kids will do nothing to minimize the potential for foreign influence on the presidency and would make it possible for the Trump family to gain financially from the highest office in the land, global businesses analysts and former presidential advisers said. Now it's become another line of attack for the campaign of his rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump has said that his children will be his business management back-up plan for months now, most recently in a Fox News interview Thursday.""I will sever my connections and I'll have my children and executives run the company, and I wouldn't discuss it with them,"" Trump said in reference to a Newsweek magazine article about the potential conflicts of interest caused by Trump's business holdings in India, South Korea, Russia and elsewhere.RELATED: Can Donald Trump be a CEO and a president?However, there are a number of reasons why putting his kids in charge wouldn't address concerns, according to experts. Trump would still know where his family properties are located in the US and overseas, and as president, would be in a position to make decisions on the economy and foreign policy that could benefit his family's fortunes.And foreign countries might see Trump business ventures in their country as a way to exert pressure or curry favor.Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta charged that the details in the Newsweek report ""paint a frightening and dangerous picture of the influences circling Trump and the Trump organization. Trump's business dealings could effect his judgment.""Podesta noted that few of Trump's foreign interests were disclosed in his filing with the Federal Election Commission and raised the question of transparency -- a weapon both campaigns are trying to deploy against the other. ""There are 54 days to go to election day,"" Podesta said. ""It's simply appalling that we don't know more about the debts and foreign business dealings of the man running to be president,"" he said in a conference call Thursday.Trump's ""extensive financial dealings overseas with America's allies and enemies pose an unprecedented conflict of interest that could threaten our national security interests and global interests.""The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has been accusing Clinton of conflicts because of the donations her family's charitable foundation receives from international figures.Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Trump's massive empire meant that a Trump White House will be ""a constant drama as to whether his business ventures are benefiting or being harmed by his public policy decisions.""Kenneth Gross, who has advised previous presidential candidates on how to handle their finances, said Trump's handing his business over to his heirs or placing the holdings into a blind trust doesn't work well with physical properties. Generally, these techniques are applied to stock or bond assets that someone else trades for the original investor.""Putting it into a blind trust doesn't wipe out your knowledge of it. You know it's there,"" said Gross, now a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meager and Flom.Trump's Financial Disclosure Report shows the bulk of his business interests are in the US, but he has holdings such as hotels and golf courses in at least 22 countries, including Saudi Arabia, China, Turkey, Panama, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.In an example of how complicated Trump's business holdings are, the candidate paused during remarks about Chinese currency manipulation at the Economic Club in New York Thursday to add a thought -- that he ""likes China"" because it rents a lot of condos. Podesta also raised Newsweek's description of Trump's stymied efforts to get more of a toehold in India's market, wondering aloud if Trump's would ""come down harder on Pakistan to win favor with the Indian government.""""These are decisions affecting countries with nuclear weapons,"" Podesta said. ""They're serious and they're potentially catastrophic"" if influenced by anything other than the concerns for our national security, he said. Norm Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, said that since Trump's international holdings are largely in property and real estate, if he became president, ""most foreign policy decisions you would make would have real implications for your holdings and your net worth, which means the conflicts of interests would be piling up beginning with every morning's security briefing."" And other countries could see Trump's business as a means to wield influence. ""There would always be the question -- whether they're putting the screws on him in his private life to have him change his policies in his public life,"" Hufbauer said.A former ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush said another problem will be the way banks and regulatory agencies in the US deal with Trump family members managing his properties.""You think the banks are going to turn down the president's son on a leveraged loan?"" said Richard Painter, now a corporate law professor at the University of Minnesota.In Thursday's Fox interview, Trump was also asked how he would handle a situation in which sanctions were imposed on a country where his businesses are located.""Oh, I would absolutely get out in some form, if its ownership -- would have to sell,"" Trump said. ""I would get out of those countries. I wouldn't be want to be involved."" Podesta said the fog around Trump's foreign interests mean he must meet three demands. The first would be to disclose those business dealings, a second is that he has to divest from his company if he wins the presidency -- a requirement that would apply to Cabinet members, said Podesta, a former  noted. ""Surely the same standard should apply to those seeking the presidency of the United States,"" he said. And he called on Trump to release his tax returns so people can have greater clarity on what his business interests actually are. Those deals, he said, raise the question of whether a President Trump would ""be basing decisions on the best interests of the United States and national security or would he be basing his decisions on what's good for the Trump organization's bottom line."""

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/politics/koch-brothers-senate/index.html	"The Koch network has planned to spend $42 million of advertisements to boost Republican Senate hopefuls, marshaling resources initially intended for the presidential race toward a half-dozen Senate contests where the millions could make a difference. But now, with less than 60 days to go, the network is refocusing, encouraging supporters to donate to their nonprofits tasked primarily with organizing voters in the key Senate states rather than continuing to saturate the airwaves.""A lot of folks can put up good and effective ads,"" James Davis, a group spokesman, told reporters Wednesday. ""We have a robust field capability and that's something that distinguishes us from many others. We have to play to that strength, particularly in the environment we're in in 2016.""The heavy advertising earlier this year was a new posture for the Kochs, who oversee the most influential conservative donor network in the country: They made their mark in the 2012 cycle by knocking on doors and sending direct mail in swing-states, not with flashy television ads financed by their new super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund.And now they are bulking up their field program in two states in particular: Pennsylvania and Indiana, where Koch officials said they remained hopeful despite weak polling for Senate hopeful Todd Young. And they are adding two new targets to ther list of states: North Carolina and Missouri, where Democratic challengers are waging surprisingly successful bids. ""In January, if you said to us: 'Would you be in North Carolina?' You'd rather hope that would not be necessary,"" said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, who said to interpret the North Carolina buy for Sen. Richard Burr as out of an ""abundance of caution.""The Koch network is spending $250 million on politics and policy in 2016, and are channeling their efforts in the final eight weeks on what they say is 5 million voters in eight Senate states. One group is undecided Senate voters in competitive states, regardless of who they are supporting for president. The second includes reliable Republican voters who lack enthusiasm about this November's elections.""We're not saying there aren't going to be split-ticket voters,"" Phillips said. ""We're just saying that's not a leading attribute to define our audience.""The decision is a recognition by the network that there are few persuadable voters remaining, and that they must turn out voters perhaps dismayed by the two presidential candidates. Their field program, in a shift from prior years, now expressly calls for the defeat or reelection of candidates, and officials said it is more than twice the size of their program in 2012.They continue to making changes as polling warrants. The Kochs announced they are cutting about $500,000 of advertising planned to air in Florida in late September on behalf of Marco Rubio. And they have already canceled ad reservations behind Rob Portman in Ohio, who has pulled away in his Senate reelection run thanks in part to $10 million in Koch network spots.And given the shift away from television, their super PAC is not expected to post a strong haul in their August fundraising report to be filed Tuesday.They are now not planning air any television ads after October 5, when their buys expire -- closing a door that Koch officials said they initially left open."

Faith Green Timmons of the Bethel United Methodist Church told Trump after walking to the podium while Trump was speaking.""OK. That's good. Then I'm going back onto Flint, OK? Flint's pain is a result of so many different failures,"" Trump said.Timmons, in a statement provided at the event, noted her church welcomes ""all people."" ""This public event is open to all and today Donald Trump came to observe. Trump's presence at Bethel United Methodist in no way represents an endorsement of his candidacy,"" she had said.On Thursday, Trump told Fox News ""something was up"" with Timmons, but he wasn't bothered because ""everyone plays their games.""Trump was responding to the host's question about whether he was ""bothered"" by the fact that she purportedly had written on Facebook (according to the Fox hosts, who noted it was later erased) that she hoped to ""educate"" Trump on what had been going on in Flint. ""She was so nervous, she was shaking. And I said, 'wow, this was kind of strange.' And then she came up. So she had that in mind, no question about it,"" Trump said, adding that he suspected that he might face an unfriendly reception at the church.The awkward momentMoments before Timmons interrupted him, Trump had begun attacking Clinton for supporting free trade agreements, which Trump argued had caused Flint economic pain.""Hillary failed on the economy. Just like she's failed on foreign policy. Everything she touched didn't work out. Nothing. Now Hillary Clinton --,"" Trump said before he was cut off by the church's pastor.The awkward moment was just one of several uncomfortable ones during Trump's visit to the majority African-American city of Flint on Wednesday, which marked Trump's latest effort to appeal to black voters. Trump was also heckled during his visit to the church. His visit to Flint came less than two weeks after he attended a church service at a predominantly African-American church in Detroit, where about 200 protesters gathered outside.One woman heckling Trump Wednesday interrupted him to raise allegations that he ""discriminated against black tenants,"" an apparent reference to the Justice Department's 1973 civil rights lawsuit against Trump and his father's landlord practices in New York City.""No, I never -- never would never would,"" Trump said before the church's pastor stepped in to defend Trump.""This is my church and you will respect him,"" Timmons said.Another heckler accused Trump of having called black people ""lazy.""Home to a water crisisTrump made his first visit to Flint on Wednesday, home to a water crisis that contaminated the city's water supply, rendering it toxic.Trump also visited the city's water plant, but in his remarks at the church, he focused on the decline of US manufacturing and outsourcing that he claims has hurt Flint's economy.The real estate mogul's visit to Flint is the most attention Trump has devoted to the city whose water crisis rose to national prominence earlier this year.Throughout most of his campaign, Trump has rarely addressed the crisis or offered his views, including whether Rick Snyder, the state's Republican governor, should resign amid mounting pressure.When he was asked in January as the crisis gained national media attention about the situation, Trump said he ""shouldn't be commenting.""""Well it's a shame what's happening in Flint, Michigan. A thing like that shouldn't happen, but again I don't want to comment on that. They've got a very difficult problem,"" Trump had said.And in an interview with a local Michigan TV station on the morning of the state's primary, Trump called it a ""catastrophic event,"" but declined to say whether he believed Snyder should resign."

Asked by CBS' Norah O'Donnell what the Trump family would do to prevent those potential conflicts, Ivanka explained that ""as a private business, we can make decisions that are not in our best interest.""""There's something so much bigger than our business at stake and that's the future of this country,"" she said. ""We can say, you know what, we'll do less deals and not going to do that deal even though it's a fine deal and economically reasonable, because it could create a conflict of interest.

Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton has begun campaigning in earnest while her mom recovers from a pnuemonia diagnosis.

She also spotlighted the Clinton campaign's proposal to make community college tuition-free and public colleges or universities ""debt-free,"" and outlined policies to strengthen education in science, technology, engineering and math.Trump floats Ivanka for Cabinet, prompting Clinton jab""When I graduated from Stanford, about one in five of the college graduates in the STEM fields in that year, in 2001, were women. And now we're less than 15%. So we're losing ground. So if you want to stop that trajectory, we know we need to make investments early and consistently throughout the education pipeline,"" she said.
