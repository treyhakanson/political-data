This year the poll was conducted on the magazine's Facebook page. Readers were asked to try the recipes out at home and ""like"" or ""love"" their favorite. Clinton's cookie was pitted against Melania Trump's star-shaped sugar cookie. According to a statement from Family Circle, the Clintons' recipe received 1,623 likes and hearts on Facebook while Trump's cookie received 535. The Clintons stayed ahead in the poll by a margin that any politician would dream of having, leading by about a 3:1 ratio during the entirety of the six-week voting period.The magazine was quick to point out that its cookie poll has correctly predicted the winner of the general election in five of the last six elections. In 2008, Cindy McCain's oatmeal butterscotch cookies fared better than her husband's presidential ambitions, beating Michelle Obama's shortbread recipe. In 2012, Obama took a cue from the Clintons and returned to the contest with a chocolate chip cookie recipe of her own.Bill Clinton's recipe was the same one that earned this year's Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton the crown in 1992 and 1996. The results of the Family Circle poll mirrored those of a random taste test CNN conducted in front of the White House in August.

Delivering a similar message to one he takes on the campaign trail today, Trump also advocated  for more protections for police. The case involved five teenage boys of color, who were wrongly accused and convicted of beating and raping a woman in Central Park. Trump purchased full-page ads that ran in several New York City newspapers that read,""Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!""In the interview with King, Trump defended the ads. ""I don't see anything inciteful, I am strongly in favor of the death penalty,"" Trump told King. ""I am also in favor bringing back police forces that can do something instead of turning their back because every quality lawyer that represents people that are trouble, the first thing they do is start shouting police brutality, etc.""""I have never done anything that's caused a more positive stir. I've had 15,000 — 15,000 — letters in the last week and a half,"" continued Trump. ""I don't know of more than two or three that were negative out of 15,000. The ad's basically very strong and vocal, they are saying bring back law and order. And I'm not just referring to New York, I'm referring to everything.""The men were later exonerated in 2002, when another man confessed to the crime and DNA backed up his confession. Trump wrote an op-ed in the New York Daily News in 2014,  calling New York City's $41 million settlement with the five men ""a disgrace.'Speaking with King in 1989, Trump said he had the support of 90% of the public, adding that 40% of newspaper columnists agreed. ""I had some women the other day stick a microphone in my face from one of the major networks, 'but don't you have compassion for these young men? That raped and beat and mugged and everything else this wonderful women,'"" said Trump. ""Do I have hatred for them?"" ""And I said, look this women was raped, mugged, and thrown off a building -- thrown off a building on top of everything else,"" continued Trump. ""She's got some major problems to put it mildly. I said, 'of course I hate these people and let's all hate these people because maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done.'""Trump told King his newspaper ads were not ""pre-judging"" the  five teens, but rather advocating for their execution if they were to be found guilty. Trump also explained his ad didn't apply to minors, but said minors convicted of crimes should be locked up for a long time in the prison system. Trump said police were afraid of being charged with police brutality and the criminal justice system provided too many rights to alleged criminals. ""The problem we have is we don't have any protection for the policeman. The problem with our society is the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights -- unbelievable rights. And I say it has to stop, and that's why I took the ad and I have to tell you, that ad, I have never done anything that's been so positively received. People are tired, sick and tired of what's happening."" "	"Trump in 1989 Central Park Five interview: ""Maybe hate is what we need"""	['Trump']	[]

Incidents that prompted Charlamagne to select Trump for the designation include -- but are not limited to -- the following: When Trump declared a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the country; When he said ""Second Amendment people"" might be able to do something about Clinton becoming president; When he asked ""How's Joe Paterno?"" (who passed away) at a Pittsburgh rally; When he kicked Univision's Jorge Ramos out of a press conference; When he said Hispanics ""love"" him;And when he said he would have fought the female Black Lives Matter protesters if they had grabbed his mic like they did when they interrupted Bernie Sanders last year.A CNN message left with the Trump campaign seeking comment was not returned.Charlamagne said that while Trump's message ""fuels hate"" and represents ""everything that's wrong with America,"" Trump also represents ""everything that's right with America.""""He's everything that's right with America because Donald Trump is the best case scenario when you're trying to build a case for optimism,"" Charlamagne said, adding that to many, Trump's success in business and politics represents the American dream.""Donald Trump is the epitome of that, because he was the executive producer of ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and now he's the GOP nominee, potentially about to be president with no political background whatsoever,"" Charlamagne said.

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/town-hall-debates-awkward/index.html	"Sunday night's debate between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton holds the promise of the town hall format's greatest (at times worst) hits: aimless meandering, awkward bar stools that participants mostly have to lean on and, of course, face-to-face interaction with voters. Nothing makes presidential candidates seem more like actual humans than taking difficult questions from real people. The 2008 town hall between then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain played host to two of the most awkward debate moments in recent memory. First came the moment when McCain referred to Obama as ""that one,"" which was viewed as disrespectful. That moment was only eclipsed at the end, when both nominees wandered between moderator Tom Brokaw and his teleprompter. That wasn't the only time the open floor plan of the town hall caused issues. In 2000, then-Vice President Al Gore seemed to try to intimidate George W. Bush by standing up and walking over to Bush while the governor was mid-sentence. Bush raised his eyebrows and nodded at Gore, prompting the audience to burst into laughter. Bush's town hall moment was better for him than the moment people remember from his father's 1992 debate. Then-President George Bush was caught looking at his watch. During town hall debates, there is nowhere to hide for 90 minutes.And who could forget the moment in 2012, when moderator Candy Crowley stepped in to tell Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney that he was mistaken. Romney claimed that Obama hadn't referred to the attack on a US Consulate in Benghazi as ""an act of terror"" until weeks after the fact. He had. It would have been awkward if they were sitting behind a table, but Romney was in open water, all thanks to the town hall debate format.Watch the 2016 town hall presidential debate Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on CNN and catch up on the greatest hits (so far) in the video above.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/missouri-2016-election-voters/index.html	"From St. Louis and its suburbs south to Branson, voters here are vocal about an angst around next month's election. Many say they feel like they're choosing between the lesser of two evils, that the political dialogue feels sharply negative, and they are deeply fearful of what might happen if their preferred candidate loses.""It's just a sad year for politics, that's all,"" said Loretta Hon, a 66-year-old retired office manager who was picking up a Trump-Pence yard sign at the Fenton Days festival outside of St. Louis last weekend. Hon and her granddaughter, Erin Walters, a 20-year-old medical canvasser, both said they are voting for Donald Trump because they can't stomach Hillary Clinton. But as they carried off their yard signs, they said they were ""not at all"" excited about their vote.Missouri was once the quintessential swing state. For a century, from 1904 to 2004, it voted for the presidential winner in every election but one, since 1956. Since then it's veered more sharply Republican at the national level, and few strategists think Clinton has a serious shot at beating Trump in the Show Me State. Still its relatively diverse electorate provides a pretty good snapshot of the national mood.Sunday night's debate here at Washington University likely won't curb the bad feelings voters have about the race.Pollsters have found historically high unfavorability ratings for the two major party candidates. A national Monmouth University poll last week found 70% of voters say this election has brought out the worst in people, and only 4% say it has brought out the best. Less than one-third said the harsh language used on the trail is justified. Downstate in Hollister, a reliably red part of the Bible Belt, voters were also expressing discomfort with their choices.Randy Kate Summers, who will turn 18 before Election Day, and Hannah Coleman, 18, both said their families were voting for Trump and they probably would as well -- given their choices. ""How I feel about it is, I don't want to be disrespectful, but the better of the worst,"" Summers said. ""I don't think they're super excited about it,"" Coleman said of her family and friends. ""It's kind of like the lesser of two evils. Neither side is like, 'Yay!' But I feel like Trump is better than Hillary because he is conservative.""Neither Andrew Bolger, 31, an evangelical Christian pastor, and Grant Ryder, 27, a resident director at nearby College of the Ozarks, were prepared to choose a candidate. ""I don't know how I'll make the decision this year, and honestly my wife and I were just discussing that recently,"" Bolger said. ""This area is very conservative. I think most people are trying to decide of the lesser of two evils, and I never feel like that's the best way to make a decision. So I am kind of at a loss how to make that decision.""Neither Bolger or Ryder said they could identify with any of the candidates, making the decision tougher. ""I think a lot of people are torn between what they feel like they're supposed to do and maybe what they want to do,"" Ryder said. ""I hear a lot of surprise and more shock as to who actually the two final candidates are, and I think there's a lot of distaste with those two people from the younger perspective. ... I'd say most of the responses I've heard are more kind of jokes.""Many Missourians also spoke out against the negativity in politics, both in politician and surrogates' discourse and in campaign advertising. ""I hate the ads,"" Hon said. ""I hate it, all they do is cut each other down, and I don't think that should be part of politics. It wasn't that way when I was growing up and I think it's gotten out of control.""For voters who are dedicated to their chosen candidates and excited to cast that vote, many still spoke of a fear of what might happen if the other side wins.Annette Read, 54, who is a director of the volunteer office supporting Trump in Fenton, said she's been excited about the prospect of a Trump political run since before he was a candidate. But she said that doesn't necessarily extend to the full GOP.""I don't like the direction the Republican Party has gone,"" she said. ""We have so many people, even Democrats, saying, 'We don't want any more of these party politicians.'""  Another volunteer in that office, Brinda Johnson, 66, a retired real estate developer, said she was a life-long Democrat who went to the convention for Clinton in 2008 -- until she read ""Clinton Cash,"" a book that slams the Clintons for their family foundation and fundraising. She said she and her family have all switched to Trump out of distaste for Clinton.  Meanwhile, at a phone bank volunteer night at Clinton's campaign office in St. Louis, volunteers spoke as much about their support for Clinton as their concern about Trump.""There is no question that Hillary needs to be president and not the alternative, that would be very bad for our country,"" said Lisa Marz-Browning, 66, a retired lab supervisor who said she usually votes Democratic but has voted for Republicans in the past. Jarvis Neal, a 22-year-old senior at nearby Lindenwood University who grew up not far from where Michael Brown was killed by police in Ferguson, said that although he is not used to talking about politics, his professor convinced him to come phone bank. He added the election was ""definitely ... important.""""I feel like a lot of Democrats in this area are really scared, because no one wants Trump to win. Talking to my family and friends, if Trump wins, they're going to be devastated,"" Neal said.""This is not an election that I want to give to chance. I mean, the stakes are too high,"" said Lauren Davis, a 68-year-old retired public high school teacher. She said she is volunteering more than in the past, and donating a little more. ""It's really time to step up to the plate to stop Trump and support Hillary."""	Election 2016: Misery in Missouri -- and everywhere else	['Neal', 'Coleman', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

He described the adjustments as ""shifting resources from over-performing markets to new battlegrounds.""Cancellations and adjustments are not unheard of in political advertising, especially as campaigns stare down tough decisions about how to allocate resources in the final weeks.Although the Trump campaign had said it would reserve $100 million in television time from late September through Election Day, the campaign as of Friday has reserved less than half of that -- $45 million, with more than one-third of that headed to Florida, according to advertising records. The $100 million buy would almost certainly not be possible without either a substantial increase in fundraising or, more likely, by Trump writing a check from his personal fortune that many Republicans close to him expect him to cut.The adjustments come as outside groups pick up more of the advertising slack for the Trump campaign. A nonprofit funded by the powerful Adelson and Ricketts families on Friday disclosed $7.3 million in spending, the first television push by the group, 45Commtitee, which isn't required to disclose its donors.And the National Rifle Association, which has become one of the biggest pro-Trump boosters on television, said earlier this week it would spend another $6.5 million on his behalf."

8	8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/john-podesta-emails-hacked/index.html	"WikiLeaks, which has been alleged to work with Russia, posted more than 2,000 emails from Podesta and promises to post more from a trove of more than 50,000 the group said it has access to. The Clinton campaign would not confirm the authenticity of any of the documents but has not disputed the contents.Clinton's comments to financial firms, if legitimate, would validate what supporters of Bernie Sanders long said about her: Clinton is a fake populist who is really out of touch with the middle class. But the timing of the leaks, well after the Democratic primary and the same night video emerged of Donald Trump bragging about being able to grope women, could blunt any political impact.About a week after Sanders raised the issue in a January debate, the campaign's head of research, Tony Carrk, sent around the excerpts, apparently provided by ""HWA"" (likely referring to the Harry Walker Agency, a firm representing Clinton and other high-profile speakers), to Podesta and other top campaign officials, including Podesta and Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri. The speech excerpts shed light on Clinton's relationship with Wall Street behind closed doors, as well as her positions on issues such as trade and regulation. Clinton's presidential campaign has sought to cast the former secretary of state as a fighter for the middle class, someone who will stand up to monied interests and corporations, and advocate on behalf of people who have seen wages stagnate over eight years under President Barack Obama. In one 2014 speech, Clinton admits to being ""kind of far removed"" from the struggles of the middle class. ""My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing,"" she said in the remarks. ""...And now, obviously, I'm kind of far removed because the life I've lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy, but I haven't forgotten it."" Russian involvement?The emails released Friday range from menial email blasts and newsletters to highly sensitive internal campaign discussions from inside the Clinton campaign as they were facing a strong primary challenge from Sanders. And they come just hours after top national security officials accused Russia of trying to influence the US elections through highly-coordinated hacks. US accuses Russia of trying to interfere with 2016 electionPodesta fired off a series of tweets Friday night, blasting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and pointing to Russia as the source of the hacks, although there is no official link between his specific emails and hacks by Russia.""I'm not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,"" Podesta tweeted Friday night. In another tweet, he said, ""Don't have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.""The Clinton campaign declined to confirm whether the emails were Podesta's.""Earlier today, the US government removed any reasonable doubt that the Kremlin has weaponized WikiLeaks to meddle in our election and benefit Donald Trump's candidacy,"" Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said in a statement Friday night. ""We are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton.""Caplin also pointed to concerns that Russian hackers could have doctored the content in the emails, saying, ""Guccifer 2.0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign."" Sanders sought speech transcriptsFor many Sanders supporters, including some who remain wary of Clinton, the release of Clinton's paid speech transcripts is too little, too late.Sanders made Clinton's speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial interests a cornerstone of his stump speeches, regularly slamming Clinton for the private remarks.""I kind of think if you're going to be paid $225,000 for a speech, it must be a fantastic speech,"" Sanders said during a speech in Warren, Michigan. ""A brilliant speech which you would want to share with the American people.""He regularly added that the remarks must be ""Shakespearean"" given Clinton's fee.With Sanders' urging, the refrain caught hold among his supporters. Protesters at Clinton events routinely yelled ""Release your transcripts"" and the phrase became a commonly used hashtag on social media.But the reality of Friday's release is that these partial transcripts would have had more impact had they been released in March, not October -- especially Clinton's comments on trade.After calling the Trans Pacific Partnership the ""gold standard"" as secretary of state, Clinton has said publicly that she now does not support the deal.""I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as President,"" Clinton said earlier this year in Warren, Michigan.But in a 2013 speech, Clinton told an audience that her ""dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.""Clinton has publicly said that she believes in trade, but has made running against the way certain trade deals are enforced - including the North American Free Trade agreement - a key to her outreach to union and white working class voters.""I am not satisfied with the status quo, I am not telling you everything is peachy keen,"" Clinton said about trade in a July speech in Philadelphia. ""I am telling you we have made progress but we have work to do."" 'You need both a public and a private position'While Clinton's comments at the paid speeches are different than what she usually says, Clinton has been up front - in public - about the fact that she and Bill Clinton have vaulted from the middle class to wealth since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s. ""Bill and I have been blessed,"" Clinton said in Raleigh in September. ""We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father died before he was born."" She added, ""They struggled, they worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being president."" In a 2013 speech, Clinton told members of the National Multi-Housing Council, ""you need both a public and a private position"" in politics. ""I mean, politics is like sausage being made,"" she said. ""It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.""State Department technologyClinton also weighed in on her use of technology at the State Department -- an issue that would later plague her campaign when it was revealed she exclusively used a private email server to conduct State Department business. ""When I got to the State Department, it was still against the rules to let most -- or let all Foreign Service Officers have access to a Blackberry,"" Clinton said in August 2014. ""You couldn't have desktop computers when Colin Powell was there."" She also spoke about how the State Department was targeted by hackers ""every hour, more than once an hour."" ""And we knew it was going on when I would go to China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out, because this is a new frontier,"" said Clinton. Carrk, the man who wrote the hacked document, currently serves at Clinton's research director and is part of Clinton's campaign inner circle, trusted enough that he has been part of Clinton's tightly controlled debate preparations. Carrk worked for Clinton during her 2008 campaign and later led rapid response research at the Democratic National Committee. Before joining Clinton's 2016 campaign, the Democratic operative lead the research operation at the Center for American Progress."

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/reality-check-bill-clinton-obamacare/index.html	"""You've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and it's the craziest thing in the world,"" former President Bill Clinton said Monday at a rally in Michigan. He also said, ""But the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies.""Say what? The comments exploded into the political scene. Democrats smacked their foreheads in disbelief. Republicans clapped their hands with joy. Clinton walked them back somewhat. It is clear that Obamacare has its share of problems. For example: Several large insurance carriers have walked away from the exchanges, and as a new round of enrollment is set to begin on November 1, it is anticipated that premiums for policies purchased on the law's exchanges will jump considerably. All this has made the law a political football.But, beyond the partisan fallout, which was and is considerable, it looks like the Explainer-in-Chief, has some ""splaining"" to do since his analysis of the law's short-comings is, for the most part, dead wrong.First of all, just who is he talking about? Certainly not the nearly 56% of the population that got their health insurance through their job in 2015. Studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, two organizations that track health care costs, indicate the premiums and deductibles were rising even before the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. Premium increases have slowed down while deductible hikes have continued at about the same rate. Indeed, a study by Kaiser indicated that premiums for the average employer-provided family plan went up by 31% in the five years before the law was enacted, and by just 20% in the five years afterward. One reason for the flattening out was the recession, another is that the higher deductibles and co-pays employers and insurance companies increasingly require are forcing consumers to be more thrifty in shopping for medical care. Premiums for the most popular policies purchased on the Obamacare exchanges have risen at a slower rate than what was originally projected.  A survey of major cities in 16 states plus the District of Columbia done by Kaiser found that premiums for the most popular ""Silver"" policies -- the second cheapest policy available on the exchanges -- increased by a mere 2% on average this year. Analysts anticipate a hefty jump of about 9% in these premiums in 2017 as several federal programs to help insurance companies hold down costs expire. But the estimates of sky-rocketing premiums on the exchanges voiced by some critics are based on requests from insurance carriers. And until state regulators approve, deny or modify those requests no one -- not even Bill Clinton -- knows how large the premium hikes will be. And even if they are gargantuan, more than 80% of those who buy policies on the exchanges qualify for federal subsidies that keep their payments at roughly the same percentage of their incomes that they paid this year.Clinton is right when he says that the people who will be hurt the most are those who buy their insurance on the individual market, but earn too much to qualify for the subsidies. But how many people is that? Using census data, the Commonwealth Fund estimated that about 8 million people were in the private health insurance market place last year and not eligible for government help. That's about 3.2% of all people under the age of 65 who have health insurance. Now, 8 million people struggling is nothing to sneeze at. But is 3% of a proportion of people with health insurance enough to justify Bill Clinton calling Obamacare ""the craziest thing in the world?""So what about the law's impact on small business? Bill Clinton also said Obamacare was hurting ""moderately successful small businesses."" But businesses with 50 employees or less -- more than 90% of all small businesses -- are exempt from the ACA mandate that companies provide health insurance. Until the end of 2017, those small businesses that voluntarily cover their employees are also allowed to provide cut-rate plans that do not meet the law's requirements for minimum coverage. To be sure, the law does place some burdens on small business and 52% of small businesses said in a survey done by the National Federation of Independent Business that rising health care costs is their number one problem. But that was also the case before Obamacare came along as can be seen by the fact that the rate of small businesses dropping health care coverage for employees is roughly the same in the years before the law was passed than it was in the years afterward. It could be what's happened here isn't so much that Obamacare didn't hurt small businesses but it didn't help them very much."	Reality check: Bill Clinton on Obamacare	['Clinton']	[]
