Podesta, who now serves as chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, was leading Obama's transition team before he was inaugurated in his first term at the time of the emails. All of the eight emails (plus attachments) are from October and November 2008. These emails were not hacked from White House servers, but part of a wider hack of Podesta's emails published by WikiLeaks.Feds: NSA contractor's secrets theft 'breathtaking'CNN cannot independently confirm the emails' authenticity. But the Clinton campaign has not challenged any emails in other WikiLeaks releases.One of the emails with the subject line ""Diversity"" to Obama is about potential cabinet choices for his new administration. The email is from Michael Froman, who at the time was a Citibank executive, and went on to serve as US trade representative in the Obama administration. The email lists potential African American, Latino and Asian American candidates -- as well as female candidate options -- for Obama to consider appointing for his cabinet. Clinton, who was Obama's rival in the 2008 Democratic primary, is listed as a potential secretary candidate to head the State Department or the Department of Health and Human Services.The White House did not immediately respond to CNN for a request to comment."

But where Clinton's remarks singed, Trump's burned -- costing him an opportunity to take some of the heat off his campaign as it struggles through the final three weeks of the 2016 contest.No happy warriors to be found at Al Smith dinner""I wasn't really sure if Hillary was going to be here tonight because, I guess, you didn't send her invitation by email. Or maybe you did, and she just found out about it through the wonder of WikiLeaks,"" Trump said. ""We've learned so much from WikiLeaks. For example, Hillary believes that it is vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private.""When the audience booed at that line, Trump said, ""That's OK, I don't know who they're angry at, Hillary, you or I. For example, here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.""The jeers from the audience were unusual for the event.""I've been to that dinner like six, seven, eight times,"" Christine Quinn, the former speaker of New York's city council, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I've never heard boos like that. Never.""Also unusual for the Al Smith dinner: Neither offered any kind words about the other.The night, which followed another brutal debate on Wednesday, underscored that Americans face a choice in two and a half weeks between two candidates who plainly don't like each other and have waged one of the most negative campaigns in recent memory.Trump opened with light-hearted remarks -- referencing his ""beautiful hands"" and joking that the event with more than 1,500 attendees was for him ""a small, intimate dinner with some friends. Or as Hillary calls it, her largest crowd of the season."" Al Smith dinner: Most memorable linesBut the mood turned dour when Trump began to directly take on Clinton.Trump skewered Clinton's use of a personal email server and accused her of ducking FBI questions. He pointed to WikiLeaks' hack of Democratic emails and accused her of hating the Catholics for whom the event is a high-dollar fundraiser, with attendees paying at least $3,000 each.""According to her sworn testimony, Hillary has forgotten more things than most of us will ever, ever know -- that I can tell you,"" Trump said, to crickets. ""We're having some fun here tonight.""Clinton takes shot at Trump's comments on womenClinton, too, made a more direct political attack on Trump than is customary at an event that typically features light-hearted roasting. With Trump's wife in attendance, Clinton said: ""Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a 4 -- maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair."" Clinton joked about her own personality. ""I know that I am not known for my sense of humor. That's why it did take a village to write these jokes,"" she said.She also lampooned the Democratic ticket -- including Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine.""I'm not boring at all. In fact, I'm the life of every party I attend, and I've been to three,"" she said, adding that when parties get out of hand, they need a ""chaperone to get them home safely -- and that is why I picked Tim Kaine to be my vice president.""Her remarks, too, included sharp shots at Trump. She accused him of ""translating from the original Russian"" when he reads off teleprompters -- a reference to Trump's coziness with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Mocking a letter from Trump's doctor about his health that lacked specifics, Clinton said: ""Donald really is as healthy as a horse -- you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.""During most of the dinner, Trump sat, arms crossed, grinning during Clinton's jokes. But while Clinton looked toward the podium to watch Trump during his address, the Republican nominee mostly looked in front of him, reacting only by listening to Clinton's jokes.When Clinton wrapped, he heartily applauded. After Clinton's remarks, Trump leaned in to say ""good job."" Trump's light-hearted startTrump started with some innocuous jokes that were well-received.He cracked one about Melania Trump's plagiarism of a Michelle Obama speech when she spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer.""Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it's fantastic. They think she's absolutely great. My wife Melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case,"" Trump said, groaning that he'd be in trouble at home after the event. ""She didn't know about that one,"" he said, looking at his wife -- and then to Cardinal Timothy Dolan, sitting nearby. ""Cardinal, please speak to her,"" he said. Even some of his early jabs at Clinton went over well.""We have proven that we can actually be civil to each other. In fact just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me -- and she very civilly said, 'pardon me,'"" Trump said, a veiled reference at his debate stage pledges to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton if he wins the presidency.""And I very politely replied, 'Let me talk to you about that after I get into office,'"" Trump said. ""Just kidding, just kidding."" Trump made reference to calling Clinton a ""nasty woman"" in Wednesday nights' presidential debate -- and compared his feelings about Clinton to his years-old beef with Rosie O'Donnell.""After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I don't think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore. In fact, I'm actually starting to like Rosie a lot,"" he said.No handshakeThe two did not shake hands or acknowledge each other on their way to their seats, though they did shake hands on the dais as the crowd mingled after the events.During his introductory remarks, Al Smith IV said Trump asked Clinton how she was before they came on stage together. ""I'm fine,"" Smith joked Clinton said. ""Now get out of the ladies' dressing room.""Both Clinton and Trump laughed. But the GOP nominee's wife, Melania Trump, did not seem as impressed with the comment about the swirling accusations around the Republican nominee.As Al Smith IV's locker room joke hit, Trump swayed to his side, leaning into Melania and laughing off the joke with a knowing wince.After urging the guests to turn off their phones, Smith said, ""Secretary Clinton has told me that Donald is welcome to tweet away. Apparently when Donald tweets, it makes both of them happy.""Dolan spent most of the time speaking with Clinton and almost had his back turned to Trump. Former New York City mayor and Trump surrogate Giuliani came up behind Trump at one point, grabbed his shoulders and whispered something to him and Melania.Minutes before he was set to address the room, Trump could be seen writing down notes on a piece of paper and then showing them to his wife. It wasn't clear if he was editing remarks or writing on a blank piece of paper.Bitter rivalsHistorically, the dinner has been a good-natured roast -- one with plenty of jokes, to be sure, but none that break with the white-tie gala's sense of decorum. Thursday night is different, for one simple reason: Clinton and Trump loathe each other.The two declined to shake hands at the beginning and end of Wednesday night's presidential debate, one where Trump called Clinton ""such a nasty woman"" and Clinton called Trump a ""puppet."" Trump, in particular, has struggled to laugh at jokes told at his expense. He famously glowered at President Barack Obama, who ribbed him at the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner over his years of stoking false conspiracy theories about Obama's birthplace. ""He can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"" Obama said then. Minutes later, he took a swipe at Trump's role as host of ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Trump has also complained about Alec Baldwin's portrayal of him on ""Saturday Night Live."" After last weekend's take on Trump's performance in the second debate, he tweeted: ""Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!""A long-standing traditionThe Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner -- held the third Thursday of every October -- is a tradition in American presidential politics and marks the last time the two nominees share a stage. Named for the former New York governor and first Catholic to receive a major party nomination when Democrats tapped him to oppose Herbert Hoover in 1928, the Manhattan event has an attendance of more than 1,500 donors who give more than $3,000 each to Catholic charities for tickets.

Mark Meadows said Thursday the effort to remove Speaker Paul Ryan is ""picking up some steam"" because many GOP lawmakers and a stream of callers to the North Carolinian's congressional offices are incensed the Wisconsin Republican hasn't embraced fully Donald Trump's candidacy for president.""A lot of people who believe so desperately that we need to put Donald Trump in the White House -- they question the loyalty of the speaker,"" Meadows told radio host Tyler Cralle of WAAV radio in Wilmington, North Carolina.Meadows, one of the 30-plus members of the ultra-conservative and powerful House Freedom Caucus, said there ""will be real discussions after November 8 on who our leadership will be and what that will look like going forward."" House Republicans are expected to meet privately the week after the election to vote for their leaders.Meadow's sentiment got a boost from conservative commentator Sean Hannity who told the Washington Post that he'd like to see Meadows or two other members of the House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio or Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, run against Ryan for the House's top job.Just over a year ago, Meadows, a mild-mannered second term lawmaker who was worried Boehner wasn't taking a hard line in spending negotiations with the White House, threatened to force a no-confidence vote that might have succeeded. But before it could happen, the Ohio Republican shocked his colleagues by resigning.RELATED: Why John Boehner quitIn the radio interview Meadows referenced an ""infamous"" conference call for House Republicans that Ryan led last Monday in which the speaker said he would no longer campaign for or defend the GOP standard-bearer. Ryan has had a publicly troubled relationship with Trump for months, but his decision to back away from Trump -- although not formally unendorsed him -- came after the controversial Access Hollywood videos were released showing Trump bragging about sexually abusing women.  Ryan's stance upset many Trump supporters.""I've probably had more calls about the speaker and where he is and why he's not getting behind the nominee than any other call in the last week or so since the infamous conference call,"" Meadows said. Asked for reaction to Meadow's comments, Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, ""Speaker Ryan is fighting to ensure we hold a strong majority next Congress, and he is always working to earn the respect and support of his colleagues.""Privately, Ryan's allies argue he has broad support in the GOP conference and his job is safe. Even Meadows recognized Trump is not a traditional conservative candidate and acknowledged he didn't support him initially. But he said there is too much at stake -- such as Supreme Court appointments -- not to back the Republican. ""It's not as much about the shared values, because I'm certainly more conservative than he is,"" Meadows said about Trump. ""But it's a shared concern about the direction the country is going.""RELATED: Donald Trump digs a deeper hole"	GOP lawmaker: Move to oust Ryan grows over speaker's tepid support of Trump
3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/donald-trump-i-will-totally-accept-election-results-if-i-win/index.html	"Trump offered a stunning declaration during the final presidential debate that he might not accept the results of next month's election. In his first speech since the debate, Trump seemed to simultaneously double down on the stance he articulated Wednesday night while also trying to clean it up.Trump argued forcefully during a rally here that he was being asked to ""waive"" his right to contest the election after critics slammed him for refusing to pledge to accept the results of the election the previous night during the final presidential debate.Trump: I will keep you in suspense ""I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, if I win,"" Trump told supporters here in his first comments since the final debate.After raising concerns about voter fraud -- instances of which are extremely rare -- Trump also pledged to accept ""a clear election result.""""Of course, I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result,"" Trump said. ""And always, I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who have come before me. Always.""His running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, echoed Trump's comments while speaking in Reno, Nevada, telling supporters: ""Of course, we will accept a clear election result, but we also reserve the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of questionable results.""'I will keep you in suspense'Trump's remarks Thursday appeared aimed at quelling the outrage he sparked the previous night as Republicans and Democrats alike balked at Trump's response that ""I will look at it at the time,"" when asked if he would concede the election should he lose on November 8. But by refusing again Thursday to promise outright that he will abide by the results of the election, Trump kept alive a worrying conspiracy theory that his underdog candidacy could be defeated by below-board behavior.The remarks came after Trump took intense fire from Republicans and Democrats alike for saying ""I will look at it at the time,"" when asked if he would concede the election should he lose on November 8.""I will keep you in suspense,"" he added during the debate.Trump digs a deeper holeTrump also said Thursday that he was only refusing to make a blanket statement concerning the results of the election because he wants ""fairness during the election.""""This is having nothing to do with me but having to do with the future of our country. We have to have fairness,"" he said.Trump, who has spent weeks calling the election ""rigged"" and suggesting to his supporters the presidency could be stolen from them, sought to compare his situation to the 2000 election, when Al Gore sought a recount in several counties after the results of the election in Florida were very tight.""If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed three weeks before the election to concede results and waived their right to a legal challenge or a recount then there would be no Supreme Court case,"" Trump said of the ensuing legal process following the contested result of the 2000 election.But neither Bush nor Gore raised concerns about the legitimacy of the electoral process, neither before nor after Election Day. And a day after the Supreme Court ruled, Gore called Bush to concede.Trump's pledge to accept the results of the election ""if I win"" could have gone differently on Thursday, based on prepared remarks the Trump campaign released after his speech concluded.The prepared remarks of that ""major announcement"" offered a similar, and seemingly more lighthearted, pledge labeled ""ALTERNATE.""""I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept -- without delay or hesitation -- the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton,"" read the alternate text of Trump's pledge to accept the presidential election results if he wins.The question about accepting the election's results was posed to Trump on Wednesday night after the Republican nominee spent weeks arguing that there was a mass ""establishment"" conspiracy seeking to undermine his candidacy.Trump's talk of a ""rigged"" election came after nearly a dozen women came forward last week alleging that Trump had groped or kissed them without their consent -- prompting a deluge of defections from Republicans who had been supporting his campaign and unfavorable media coverage. But in previous months, Trump had already begun suggesting to his supporters that the election could be stolen, urging them to be vigilant on Election Day and watch for cases of voter fraud, which are extremely rare in the US."

Hilton, of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, granted the preliminary injunction request filed by several civil rights groups and citizens who argued that voter registration needed to be reopened and extended because the online registration tool had malfunctioned and crashed in the days leading up to the state's registration deadline on October 17.In an interesting twist, both the plaintiffs and the state came to court with joint proposal asking for the judge to extend voter registration until Monday, October 24, but the judge disagreed. ""I do believe you are asking for too much time,"" Hilton said. In the judge's view, the extra days over the upcoming weekend would be ""beyond what the legislature provided.""Both sides suggested they did not want to have to come back to court if the website fails again, but the judge said the case will remain open in the event further technical problems arise. After the hearing, Edgardo Cortes, commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections, told CNN he was ""hopeful"" the state will be able to meet the judge's new registration deadline of October 21 at 11:59 p.m. ""The site is back up and running now,"" Cortes said."

Their game plan for months has been to emphasize individual records and discuss local issues. In some cases, members have withdrawn support from Trump, denounced the GOP nominee, or ignored the top of the ticket. In recent weeks, Republican members and strategists have touted their own polling in competitive races across the country showing GOP candidates outperforming Trump. House Democrats, who have been working hard to tie GOP candidate to Trump, say his ballot troubles are filtering the advantage down-ballot to their candidates across the country. One senior House Democratic strategist admitted that while some polls do show Republicans in decent shape, they are feeling good that Hillary Clinton could win with a large enough margin that it would be difficult for GOP candidates in House districts and would topple those who may now have 4- to 5-point leads. These Democrats say getting the 30 seats they need to retake the House is still a high hurdle, and admit the limiting factor is not having enough money to help amplify their national message of running against Trump.

""Comparing candidate Trump with Commander Chavez is an expression of the racist arrogance and irrationality of a party that does not serve its constituents.""The Spanish-language video, which was shared on the DNC's bilingual Twitter account targeting Latino voters, juxtaposes Chavez speeches with clips of Trump threatening to jail Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton if he's elected, promising to ""open up"" libel laws to crack down on reporters and removing Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a press conference.The ad also includes an excerpt from an interview with former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who's slammed Trump for months over his pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. In the clip, Fox calls Trump a dictator and likens him to Chavez, Hitler and Mussolini.""We already know these tactics,"" the video says, concluding with a message to voters: ""Protect the democracy in our country. Don't vote for Donald Trump.""The ad's ominous implication: that Trump's remarks echo comments Chavez made as he shut down broadcasters and persecuted political opponents.It's a comparison others have made. Latin America has a long history of leaders who've strong-armed their way into power, and experts on the region have pointed to parallels between Trump and divisive, larger-than-life figures such as Chavez and Argentina's Juan Peron. Venezuela's foreign minister said the ad showed a lack of respect for Chavez's legacy. The leftist president, a polarizing leader who frequently criticized the United States, died in 2013 after battling cancer. Throughout his presidency, he denied accusations that his government had incarcerated political opponents and unjustly cracked down on the press.""Commander Chavez is a leader who transcended our time because of his democratic attitude, his militancy for the poor and his universal sense of humanity,"" Rodriguez wrote on Twitter.Trump's campaign and a DNC spokesman did not immediately respond to a request Thursday for comment.Asked about the Venezuelan  criticisms, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine told CNN en Español that he hadn't seen the video."

Cyrus will knock on doors at George Mason University, hoping to use her stardom to spur students to vote for Clinton.On Tuesday, Clinton's campaign launched the ""Love Trumps Hate"" concert series, hoping to entice possible voters to turn out with a free concert.Katy Perry, a longtime Clinton supporter who has performed for her supporters in the past, will headline an event in Philadelphia the Sunday before Election Day, according to a campaign aide, while rocker Jon Bon Jovi will perform in Tampa, Florida, on the same day.Bon Jovi will also perform in Pittsburgh on October 27 and The National, an indie rock back from Cincinnati, Ohio, will perform in their hometown on November 2.Jennifer Lopez, whose song ""Let's Get Loud"" has been a staple on Clinton's campaign playlist for months, will perform at a Miami concert on October 29.A Clinton aide said the concerts are meant to serve as a way spur excitement among likely Clinton voters.
