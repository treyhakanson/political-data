Jackson interviewed the Republican presidential nominee who has been repeatedly criticized of making racially insensitive comments.""I am the least racist person that you have ever met,"" Trump told the pastor in the interview taped earlier this month and aired on the Impact Network.""And you can speak to Don King, who knows me very well. You can speak to so many different people,"" Trump said, referring to the African-American former boxing promoter.But critics have noted Trump has repeatedly engaged in divisive and racist rhetoric since the launch of his campaign. ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best ... They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,"" he said when he launched his campaign.He also called for a complete ban on Muslim immigration to the US as a means of preventing terrorist violence.""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,"" he read from a campaign statement in December. Trump also accused the Black Lives Matter movement of instigating the recent killings of police officers.""Certainly, in certain instances they are,"" Trump told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in July, when he asked whether the group has been ""a fuse-lighter in the assassinations of these police officers.""""They certainly have ignited people and you see that ... It's a very, very serious situation and we just can't let it happen,"" he added. Trump was also sued by the federal government in the 1970s for breaking federal laws and discriminating against communities of color in housing.Most recently, Trump has been challenged on the tone and accuracy of his approach to African-American voter outreach.""You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?"" Trump told black voters in a recent campaign speech.Jackson also conducted an interview with the GOP nominee earlier this month before hosting Trump at his Detroit church, Great Faith Ministries International. He faced some backlash for inviting Trump given some of his past comments.Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton, has repeatedly criticized Trump for racially insensitive comments, recently saying that half of his supporters are a ""basket of deplorables"" including racists. Clinton later said she regretting saying ""half,"" but maintains that Trump's campaign promotes ""bigotry and racist rhetoric.""Trump dismissed the charge as merely a partisan attack, not one specific to him and his campaign rhetoric.""They were calling Romney a racist. They were calling McCain a racist. They call everybody that's a Republican a racist. It's automatic,"" he told Jackson in the interview. ""And all of a sudden it's getting more and more vicious.""Trump similarly defended himself against charges of being a racist during a December interview with CNN's Don Lemon.""I am the least racist person that you have ever met,"" Trump told Lemon. ""I am the least racist person."""	Donald Trump: I'm 'the least racist person'

Lobbyists and activists intervene. Candidates lie to grease their paths to high office.Usually though, these failures to follow through on campaign pledges come after the official wins and takes office.Not so for Donald Trump. The Republican nominee has repeatedly defied his own commitments and fudged assurances -- and done it well before a single vote was cast. Here is a short list of guarantees the Trump has either reversed on or refused to deliver.   1. Make public his tax returnsTrump is the only candidate in the modern era to keep his tax returns under wrap. The campaign in recent months has repeatedly attributed the decision to what it describes as an ongoing audit. But it wasn't always this way. Opponents have been calling on Trump to reveal the records since the early rounds of the GOP primary contest. And Trump has often expressed his willingness to do just that.Asked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in February 2015, a few months before the billionaire announced his candidacy, Trump said: ""I would release tax returns.""How far back, Hewitt asked. ""Three years, five years?""""We'll take a good, strong look at that,"" Trump answered after some prodding. ""But I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns.""By early 2016, though, Trump had gone back and forth on the issue. He had also become the front-runner for the GOP nomination.In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in January, he was questioned again. And again, he promised to make the paperwork public.""We're working on that now,"" he said. ""I have big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time.""Trump hinted again in May that some kind of release could be in the works, telling Fox News, ""I'll release. Hopefully before the election, I'll release.""Now, with 54 days until the polls open across the country -- and with Trump's son, Donald Jr., saying on Thursday the decision to withhold the returns is rooted in political concerns -- that seems unlikely.2. Release 'detailed medical records'Trump has repeatedly called out Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for a lack of ""stamina,"" occasionally hinting at conspiracy theories that suggest his opponent is concealing a terminal or debilitating illness. But even as Clinton has been faced with heavy criticism for a lack of transparency on this and other questions, Trump has offered less -- while promising more.""I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records,"" he tweeted late last month. ""I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?""Trump this week went a step further than he has in the past, releasing a brief letter from his doctor on Thursday that said he is in ""excellent health."" But that hardly amounts to ""detailed medical records.""3. Hold a news conference on Melania immigration questionsTrump and wife Melania, a naturalized US citizen who was born in Slovenia, have repeatedly asserted that she ""followed the law"" as an immigrant.When a series of reports surfaced this summer suggesting that her road had been more complicated, Trump -- who was mired in a series of damaging controversies at the time -- pledged to hold a news conference to quiet the doubters. On August 9, Trump told reporters the event would happen ""over the next couple of weeks."" More than a month later, we're still waiting.4. Forswear the use of telepromptersIn the early days of his campaign, as he mocked shell-shocked Republicans (and Clinton), Trump often equated the use of teleprompters with weakness or incompetence.  ""I say we should outlaw teleprompters for anybody, right? For anybody! For anybody running for president,"" he said to cheers in Iowa last summer.By 2016, though, Trump had changed his tune -- and not just when he was giving tamer speeches with the help of his own teleprompter.""I like using them on occasion, too, by the way. It's not so bad,"" he told supporters during a June event. ""I've been given good reviews when I use crazy teleprompters, can you believe it?""5. Use his own money to finance campaignThe Trump campaign, at least in the beginning, was boosted by two fundamental guarantees. First, that he would deport undocumented immigrants while preventing new entrants by building a wall on the US-Mexico border. The other: that he, alone among the candidates, could not be bought or influenced by donors because he was financing his own bid.""I don't need anybody's money,"" Trump said, announcing his run. ""It's nice. I don't need anybody's money. I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich.""But a review near the end of the primary season found that roughly a quarter of Trump's campaign cash had come from individual donations. The billionaire had loaned the operation money -- and would subsequently forgive those debts -- so he came close, but his pledge to eschew donors ultimately failed.As for the general election race, Trump was clear in the spring he would embrace more traditional fundraising methods if became the standard-bearer. He has delivered on that front. Working with the Republican Party, the campaign banked $80 million in July alone.On a related note: Earlier in the campaign, Trump's pledge to donate $1 million to a military veterans' charity, raised during an event organized in lieu of attending an early primary debate, came into question when, months later, he had still not delivered the cash. The money finally went out -- along with a cranky Instagram video -- in late May, after weeks of intense media scrutiny.  6. Pay legal fees for rally-goer who punched a protesterWarned by security that he could be the target of, as he put it, ""somebody with tomatoes"" at an Iowa rally earlier this year, Trump first asked supporters to ""knock the crap out of"" any potential hurlers, then added: ""I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise.""In March, after a 78-year-old man was charged with assault after sucker-punching an African-American protester at a North Carolina rally, Trump doubled down.""I've actually instructed my people to look into (paying the legal fees of supporters),"" he told NBC.Trump would back off the claim, and the offer, in subsequent interviews. He has not provided financial support to supporters in legal trouble -- possibly because his initial comments could help make a case that his campaign should be held liable for the violence.7. Make you tired of winning so muchHere's Trump on what his campaign would do and the effect his potential presidency would have on Americans:""We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning,"" he said in South Carolina before the February primary. ""You're going to say, 'Please Mr. President, I have a headache. Please, don't win so much. This is getting terrible.' And I'm going to say, 'No, we have to make America great again.' You're gonna say, 'Please.' I said, 'Nope, nope. We're gonna keep winning.'""Verdict? To be determined."	Donald Trump's unfulfilled promises

And that's OK. Luckily I brought some notes,"" Trump said as he held up the notes he read from for the first few minutes of his speech.Trump, who once rejected teleprompters but has now used a teleprompter at all but one public campaign event in the last month, then switched back to reading his speech from the device once it came back online.Donald Trump loses battle with teleprompter in GOP acceptance speech""Everything broken today can be fixed and every failure can be turned into a great success,"" Trump said, referring to the problems he sees in the US.""Just look at the way I just melded into the teleprompter,"" Trump said to laughter from the crowd. ""Who else could have pulled that off?""But the Republican nominee's issues with the teleprompter panels he used on Thursday during his address to the Economic Club of New York didn't end there.As he sat down for a moderated discussion of his economic proposals, a young man stood on stage behind him, taking apart one of the teleprompter panels.""He's a little late, right?"" Trump said, getting laughs from the audience. ""I had nothing to do with it."""	Donald Trump's teleprompter journey: From mocking to missing

However, the White House is continuing to express optimism that the goal will be reached despite the administration's dwindling time in office.While the latest bill passed largely along party lines and is unlikely to move forward in the Senate, it signals a continued resistance to the administration's efforts to reduce the prison population. Capitol Hill's unwillingness to allow detainees to be housed in the United States has posed a major obstacle as the White House tries to find homes for the 61 remaining Guantanamo prisoners.""For the president, this is about keeping a campaign promise. For us, this is about keeping Americans safe,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a statement following the bill's passage Thursday.He also seized on the latest example of detainees' recidivism to press the case that no one else should be released: ""The news that two more former Guantanamo detainees have returned to the fight underscores the need for this action.""The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which tracks recidivism among former inmates, said Wednesday that the intelligence community has confirmed that two more detainees released since Obama took office have returned to ""terrorist activities"" since its last review, published in March. Intelligence officials would not say who the two inmates were or what actions they had undertaken.According to the new document, nine of 161 inmates released since January 2009 fall have returned to supporting terror groups. An additional 11 are ""suspected"" of having gone back to terrorist activity, though the report notes that the Defense Intelligence Agency puts that number at 15.During the George W. Bush administration, 113 of 532 released prisoners were confirmed to have reengaged in terrorism, the report said.The largest detainee transfer under Obama took place in August, with 15 inmates going to the UAE. The prison's dwindling population recently caused military officials to close one of the detention camps and consolidate the remaining inmates.Despite the hardened congressional opposition, Obama projected optimism during a news conference last week in Asia.Obama said that he was ""not ready to concede"" that the detention facility may remain open after his time in office. ""We're still working diligently to continue to shrink the population.""He added, ""It's a tough road to haul, but, you know, I expect to work really hard over the next four months."""

4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/hillary-clinton-greensboro-north-carolina/index.html	"The moment she took the stage, Clinton addressed the topic that has overwhelmed headlines since Sunday: Her health. She acknowledged to the Greensboro, North Carolina, crowd that being forced to stay at home following her pneumonia diagnosis at such a crucial moment in the election wasn't easy to stomach. ""As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good,"" Clinton said, after walking out into a school gymnasium to James Brown's ""I Got You (I Feel Good)."" ""I'm not great at taking it easy even under ordinary circumstances, but with just two months to go until Election Day, sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be."" CNN/ORC Polls: Trump's national gains extend to Florida, OhioAfter grudgingly following her doctor's orders to slow down and rest to recuperate from pneumonia -- and watching Donald Trump seize the spotlight and pull even or ahead in some key swing states such as Ohio -- the Democratic presidential nominee has signaled she is eager to make a feisty comeback at a crucial moment in the election.One of the last times the public saw Clinton, she was being helped into a van by her security detail, her knees buckling and body slouching over as she lost her balance.Clinton said she spent the time at home reflecting, as she mused that ""the campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection.""""It turns out, having a few days to myself was actually a gift,"" she said. With less than two months until Election Day, polls have begun to tighten. In Clinton's absence, Trump and his surrogates were free to relentlessly attack the former secretary of state with relatively little pushback. Trump particularly zeroed in on Clinton's in artful comments from last Friday night, in which she described half of Trump's supporters as being in a ""basket of deplorables.""In a more reflective speech than normal, Clinton admitted some of her shortcomings, including having ""a tendency to over prepare"" like ""a lot of women.""""I sweat the details whether we are talking about the exact number of lead in the water in Flint or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs or the precise interest rate on your student loans, right down to the decimal.""And even though the Clinton campaign disclosed more information about her health on Wednesday, its initial decision to not immediately reveal the candidate's pneumonia diagnosis until late Sunday -- well after she left the September 11 memorial and briefly disappeared from reporters assigned to follow her -- has raised a slew of fresh criticism about the lack of transparency.Clinton campaign releases new health informationClinton returned to the campaign trail with a rally in Greensboro and will follow up with a speech at a Congressional Hispanic Caucus gathering in Washington in the evening.In Greensboro, Clinton spoke about the issue of ""how we lift up our children and families,"" in remarks that marked Clinton's second in a series of ""Stronger Together"" speeches -- part of a broader effort to inject more of the candidate's personal story into the narrative. ""One upside to Hillary Clinton's break from the trail was having time to sharpen the final argument she will present to voters in these closing weeks,"" communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement ahead of the speech. But if Clinton is trying to change the subject away from her health, Trump may make that difficult. After largely staying away from commenting on Clinton's recent health episode, he took a swipe at his opponent's stamina at a rally in Canton, Ohio, Wednesday night.""I don't know folks -- do you think Hillary Clinton would be able to stand up here for an hour? I don't know,"" Trump mused. Clinton was originally scheduled to travel to the West Coast on Monday, where she planned to deliver a message aimed at millennial voters in California and Nevada. And her remarks in Los Angeles on Tuesday were meant to about a more inclusive economy. All of those plans fell through when Clinton stumbled at the 9/11 memorial ceremony on Sunday, and it's not clear when the campaign will reschedule those events. When Kaine knew about pneumonia diagnosis Clinton declined to address when her running mate Tim Kaine knew about her pneumonia diagnosis, as she faced questions about the nature of her partnership with her running mate on her first day back on the campaign trail. In a news conference following her remarks, Clinton was directly asked when she informed Kaine that she had pneumonia. Her doctor made the diagnosis Friday, but the public did not find out about it until Sunday. ""My senior staff knew and information was provided to a number of people. And look -- this was an ailment that many people just power through and that's what I thought I would do as well,"" Clinton said, not addressing the specific Kaine question. ""I didn't want to stop, I didn't want to quit campaigning, I certainly didn't want to miss the 9/11 memorial.""Another reporter followed up, asking how often Clinton speaks with Kaine and how she views her relationship and working partnership with her running mate. Clinton said she communicated with Kaine as late as Wednesday night and referred to him as a ""great partner"" and great future vice president. ""We've communicated but I'm not going to go into our personal conversations and I feel very comfortable and confident about our relationship,"" Clinton added.Kaine has also been asked about his knowledge of Clinton's diagnosis, and suggested in Dayton on Monday that he was in the dark until Sunday. ""I don't want to talk about her and my conversations, the content of them, except just to say that I reached out to her as soon as the incident happened on Sunday, as soon as I was aware of it,"" Kaine said. When pressed to clarify if he didn't know about Clinton's diagnosis on Friday, Kaine responded: ""I can just say, I'm not going to get into the content, but we talked yesterday after the incident happened.""North Carolina's importanceClinton is sending a message by choosing North Carolina — a state her campaign believes is a must-win for Trump -- as her first stop back on the trail. Trump has a 5 point lead in Ohio and a 3 point cushion in Florida, according to a new CNN-ORC poll released Wednesday, meaning the Tar Heel State is increasingly important for Clinton as well.Then-Sen. Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2008, while Republican nominee Mitt Romney won in 2012. Clinton's top aides believe North Carolina may be more solidly blue than typical bellwethers like Ohio because of the abundance of African-American and college-educated white voters.Why wait for November? Campaigns look to lock in support before Election DayNorth Carolina has a larger than average number of college-educated whites, buoyed by growth of college and post-college white voters in the Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill area.Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said North Carolina is Clinton's ""best chance"" to win a state that Mitt Romney carried four years ago. ""Polls consistently have showed her holding a narrow plurality in the state, built on strong support among African-Americans and an ability to win over some better educated suburban whites in the Charlotte area and the Research Triangle who liked Romney but find Trump out of sync with their values,"" said Garin, who advises the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA.Thursday's visit is her fifth since she clinched the nomination on June, while Clinton's campaign and her aligned super PACs have spent close to $15 million advertising on TV in the state. And by the time she visits on Thursday, Clinton's Tar Heel State operation will have 33 organizing offices in the state. Clinton has so far struggled break away from Trump in states like Nevada, New Hampshire and Ohio, which have smaller than average numbers of college educated white voters. While Trump has led with white voters, those with college degrees have rejected Trump in larger numbers than past elections.Where and when to vote earlyWhile Obama lost college-educated white voters by 14 points, national polls in August found Clinton up by 10 points with the group.But as polls tighten, so has Clinton's advantage with that group. CNN/ORC polls released Wednesday found that Trump actually leads by 9 points among the group in Ohio and 8 points in Florida. Clinton knows she needs to be on the trail in order to seize back momentum she had earlier this summer. And she says it's been difficult to follow her doctor's orders.""I was supposed to rest five days -- that's what they told me on Friday -- and I didn't follow that very wise advice,"" Clinton told CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday night. ""So I just want to get this over and done with and get back on the trail as soon as possible."""	Hillary Clinton returns -- and not a moment too soon

Some of those could be criminal charges leading to a court martial, two defense officials told CNN.      The documents detail repeated incidents -- including the one with the dryer -- such as slapping and hitting recruits, and making them do activities from stress positions, all alleged hazing. The Muslim recruit who was put in the dryer has not been identified, but according to the documents and as first reported in The Washington Post, he suffered burns. Several Marines were subjected to ethnic or homophobic slurs, including Marines assumed to be Muslim being questioned by more senior Marines about whether they were terrorists, the documents say.Investigation found physical and verbal abuseThree ""command-level investigations"" concluded that Siddiqui committed suicide, the Marines said last week. But Siddiqui's family has told CNN affiliate WDIV in Detroit that they strongly doubt he killed himself.The 20-year-old from Michigan died March 18.The Marines recommended a number of changes, including mandatory suspension of personnel investigated for abusing or hazing recruits and increased officer oversight of training. Last week's statement said some commanders and senior enlisted advisers were relieved of duty and some drill instructors were suspended. "	Documents disclose alleged Marine hazing at Parris Island

RELATED: Trump doesn't exercise, and other things we've learned from the Dr. Oz interviewThe fact that Trump's physician's letter references ""stamina"" is significant because it's a word the Republican presidential nominee has regularly used in attacking Clinton. After taking several days off from directly attacking Clinton's health following her diagnosis of pneumonia over the weekend, Trump appeared to raise questions about her health at a rally Wednesday night in Ohio.""I don't know folks -- you think Hillary Clinton would be able to stand up here for an hour and do this? I don't know,"" Trump said.Trump also said during the rally that Clinton is ""in all fairness ... lying in bed and getting better.""""And we want her better. We want her back on the trail, right?""Trump has frequently used discussions of virility as an attack against his opponents. Throughout the primary, he labeled opponent Jeb Bush as ""low energy,"" and attacked rival Ben Carson as even ""lower energy.""Donald Trump's son made a similar argument in an interview with TV station WTAE.""He's got more energy than any human being alive. Our opponent does one event a day and then has to take two or three days off, it's a very different scenario,"" Donald Trump Jr. said."

""They've been happening for a long time. If we are going to leave our children with oceans like the ones that were left to us, we're going to have to act. We're going to have to act boldly.""The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, which Obama created on Thursday, is situated 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod on the southern edge of George's Bank. It will protect 4,913 square miles of ocean from commercial activity and development, the White House said.That includes barring undersea drilling and mining, as well as commercial fishing activity. Some fishing groups had protested the long-rumored designation of the canyons and seamounts as a national monument, saying the move could harm the region's economy and impede the work of existing fishery management groups.One group representing seafood producers, the Southern Georges Bank Coalition, wrote in a letter to the White House's Council on Environmental Quality that Obama had exceeded his executive authority in creating the marine monument. ""The monument ultimately designated in the Atlantic was largely the result of a series of political compromises layered with a thin veneer of public outreach,"" the organization wrote.An administration official downplayed the effect on local fisherman, describing a ""limited number of vessels"" who regularly operate in the newly protected area.The White House says it designed the new designation to ""recognize the unique role that fishing plays in the region's economy and culture."" Red crab and lobster fisheries will have seven years before they're required to cease commercial activity within the monument, while other types of commercial fishing enterprises will have 60 days to exit.Recreational fishing will still be permitted within the monument's boundaries.During his remarks Thursday, Obama recalled his own childhood in Hawaii, saying it instilled a humble respect for the sea.""I spent my childhood on those shores, looking out over the endless ocean, and was humbled by it,"" Obama said. ""I know in a contest between us and the oceans, the oceans will win one way or another.""His moves protecting the New England waters were hailed by environmental groups.""Teddy Roosevelt had the foresight to protect the treasures of America's landscape. With that same boldness, President Obama is conserving the crown jewels of our nation's seascape,"" said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""This historic act will make our ocean more resilient to climate change. By preserving this rich diversity of marine life, it will also support New England's coastal and ocean economy.""The creatures who populate the protected area range from unique types of coral to several species of mammals, including sperm, fin, and sei whales. Some of the specimens exist only in that particular ecosystem.Responsibility for managing the area will fall to the departments of Interior and Commerce.Earlier this month Obama traveled to Midway atoll in the Pacific to view the expanded Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which he quadrupled in size in August.
