The additional payments were delivered to Iran in Swiss francs, Euros and other currencies. It's sure to stoke more criticism from Republicans, who had already sharply denounced the $400 million transfer as ""ransom."" That cash payment was made in January on the same day Iran released four American prisoners and formally implemented the nuclear deal. The money was flown in a plane to Iran on wooden pallets stacked with various currencies to resolve a dispute between the two countries stemming from a failed arms deal made before the Islamic Revolution in 1979 that toppled the Shah.  When the nuclear deal was implemented in January, the Obama administration announced that it agreed to pay $1.7 billion to settle the decades old dispute, although officials didn't say when or how the payments were made until now. The administration has dismissed the notion that the payments amounted to a ""ransom."" ""We do not pay ransom,"" Obama said last month. ""We didn't here, and we won't in the future."" ""We announced these payments in January. Many months ago,"" Obama added. ""They were not a secret. It wasn't a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it."" Dawn Selak, a spokesperson for the Treasury Department, sounded a similar note Wednesday.""As we announced at the beginning of this year and was widely reported at the time, the United States in January agreed to pay Iran $1.7 billion to settle a long-standing legal claim at the Hague,"" Selak said. ""The form of those principal and interest payments -- made in non-U.S. currency, in cash -- was necessitated by the effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions regimes over the last several years in isolating Iran from the international financial system."" House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce introduced a measure Tuesday to censure the Obama administration for the payments. Sen. Marco Rubio also introduced legislation that would prohibit those kinds of payments to Iran. The Florida Republican said the bill, ""The No Ransom Payments Act,"" ""will prevent this president or any future president from paying ransoms and ensure that American victims of Iranian terrorism are paid first, before the regime in Tehran can claim settlements."" ""The Obama administration's ransom payment has become a source of bragging rights and extensive propaganda from the Iranian regime,"" Rubio wrote in an editorial published Wednesday in the Tampa Bay Times. ""The payments were made within hours of the hostages being released, and the plane carrying the hostages was not allowed to leave Tehran until the plane with the ransom payment arrived,"" the senator added. ""Payments conditioned on the release of hostages are ransom payments, no matter what other dispute they are intended to settle."""

It's not up-tempo, but it certainly would get the message across,"" Nicks said, referring to Fleetwood Mac's 1975 hit.""Don't Stop,"" one of Fleetwood Mac's signature songs, was used as the theme for Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, and Clinton's inauguration even prompted members of the band to reunite for the performance amid internal feuds.Clinton and Nicks were joined on stage by several celebrities, including Michael Jackson and Sally Field, following the performance.""It's hard to think of anything as amazing as that song was for Bill.

Video of the pro-Trump children was a social media hit. But Jeff Popick, the group's manager and the father of one of the girls, told CNN the Trump campaign did not give him and the girls their due. Popick claimed the Trump campaign failed to allow the group to set up a table to sell CDs at a rally and then, after making a trek from Florida to Des Moines, Iowa, canceled the Freedom Kids' scheduled performance. He said the Trump campaign never made the situation right and that it was worth legal action.""This is the way they played us,"" he said. ""They can only ignore us for so long.""He threatened to sue in late July, when he recounted the story in full to CNN. Popick said he believes the case will go to trial, although his lawyer said, ""These types of things should be settled."" A copy of the suit provided to CNN showed that it was filed last week, and the attorney representing the plaintiffs told CNN he expects the Trump campaign to be served with the suit in the near future, if it has not already. Upon receipt of the lawsuit, the Trump campaign will have 20 days to respond, attorney Marc Shapiro said. Questions about the matter sent to the Trump campaign were not returned for comment. The lawsuit seeks between $5,000 and $15,000. Shapiro and Popick both stressed that their intention was only to seek a fair compensation.""People would look at it like it's an opportunistic thing, and it's not,"" Popick said.Despite his preference to keep the case away from trial, Shapiro said he was confident in the case he had built on behalf of the children against the Trump campaign. He said he had experience focusing on breach of contract cases, although also said, ""I mainly do litigation of personal injury"" as well as real estate matters.As for the song that started the entire controversy, Popick repeated what he said in July: the entire experience had tainted the very song that made the group a viral sensation. ""Freedom's Call"" is not on the USA Freedom Kids' new album, and the girls still do not perform it.  ""It's just a very sad thing, that's all,"" Popick said."	USA Freedom Kids v.

""He has been a government official who was committed to Mexico and loyal to the republic's president.  Thank you very much, Luis, for your service to our nation.""The circumstances surrounding Videgaray's exit were not immediately clear. But a Mexican government official and a source close to the Mexican government both told CNN previously that the idea to extend invitations for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to meet with Peña Nieto came from the finance ministry. Trump and Peña Nieto met last week. Trump's whirlwind visit to Mexico and private meeting with Peña Nieto gave the real estate mogul the visual of meeting with a foreign leader. Yet the trip later devolved into finger-pointing after Peña Nieto and Trump delivered contradicting accounts of the closed-door sit-down. Both leaders are unpopular in Mexico.Trump has pledged to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and force the southern neighbor to pay for it. Peña Nieto has said unequivocally that his country will not pay for it.Mexico invited Trump to show that it could work with the Republican nominee if he were to win, according to the source close to the government. Yet the foreign ministry was not aware of the invitations to Trump and Clinton, said the Mexican government official."	Mexican finance minister Luis Videgaray out after Donald Trump visit
4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/politics/donald-trump-defense-spending-sequester/index.html	"Trump said in a speech to the Union League of Philadelphia that he will ask Congress to reverse cuts to defense spending enacted under the 2013 budget sequester once he takes office and submit a new budget to rebuild the US military, which Trump described as unprepared to confront the threats the US faces.Trump did not say whether the increase in military spending would match or exceed pre-sequester funding levels, but a senior campaign aide said Trump would most likely seek to boost defense spending to higher levels than when the sequester went into effect in 2013 after Congress failed to reach a new budget agreement, slashing both defense and domestic spending.Trump did not outline how large the increase would be, but the senior campaign aide said eliminating the sequester would amount to a roughly $500 billion reinvestment over 10 years, which Trump said he would seek to ""fully offset"" through ""common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks.""""History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military dominance,"" Trump said as he lamented the cuts to defense spending, which he said is ""on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy."" The US spent more than $600 billion in defense spending in 2015.Trump also vowed to help offset the cost by seeking additional payments from countries where the U.S. has military bases, including Germany, Saudi Arabia and Japan.Trump's call for eliminating the sequester cuts to defense spending sits in stark contrast to his initial reaction to the sequester's across-the-board cuts, which Trump downplayed weeks before they went into effect.""It's a very small percentage of the cuts that should be made. And I think, really, it's being over-exaggerated,"" Trump told Fox News in February 2013. ""Frankly, this is a very minor amount of the cuts that have to be made, ultimately, and a lot of people are saying that.""And while Trump has consistently called for building out the US military, the real estate mogul said last fall that he would look to bolster the military while still spending ""a lot less"" than current defense spending levels.""I'm gonna build a military that's gonna be much stronger than it is right now. It's gonna be so strong, nobody's gonna mess with us. But you know what? We can do it for a lot less,"" Trump said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" last October.But Trump on Wednesday outlined multi-billion dollar investments to bolster the US military, mostly calling for increasing in spending to boost the elements of the military most useful in traditional warfare, not in confronting terrorism.The Republican nominee also called for increasing the number of ships and submarines and increasing the Air Force's fighter aircraft to 1,200 from 1,113.Trump also stressed the need to bolster the US's missile defense systems, including modernizing Navy cruiser ships.""The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these very old, aging, aging ships. They're old, they're tired,"" Trump said.Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival, also supports ending the sequester on military spending in addition to the sequester's cuts to domestic spending.""Here's what we have to do -- we can't lose our military edge. That means giving the Pentagon the stable, predictable funding it needs to make smart investments,"" she said last week at the American Legion in Cincinnati. ""We cannot impose arbitrary limits on something as important as our military. That makes no sense at all. The sequester makes our country less secure. Let's end it and get a budget deal that supports America's military, our families and our country. And let's make reform a priority, so that the Defense Department spends its budget on the right things.""Trump also contrasted his vision of US foreign policy with Clinton's record, accusing her of being ""trigger happy and very unstable"" and describing a Middle East that was more stable before her tenure as secretary of state.Clinton's campaign dismissed Trump's criticisms, likening him to a ""schoolyard bully.""""When she lays out a thoughtful speech outlining why he is unfit to be commander in chief, he calls her unhinged. She gives a speech on his disturbing history of racial discrimination and ties to white supremacists and the alt-right movement, he calls her a bigot,"" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""You could dismiss these actions as insecure schoolyard behavior but this man is running to be president of the United States.""While Trump and his advisers have argued that Clinton did not learn from the mistakes of the Iraq War -- for which she voted as a senator -- and drove the US into another blunder by arguing in favor of military intervention in Libya, Trump supported both of those military interventions.Despite his words to the contrary on the campaign trail, Trump said he favored invading Iraq one month before Congress voted to authorize the use of military force and continued to praise the invasion in its first months. He also called on the US to intervene militarily in Libya to stem the worsening humanitarian situation in the country.The Trump campaign, in a statement Wednesday night, denied any flip flops in the Republican nominee's position.""Mr. Trump has been consistent with the need to adequately fund our defense and military spending to ensure that America's national security is never compromised,"" Trump Rapid Response Director Steven Cheung said. ""Mr. Trump will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military. As part of removing the defense sequester, Congress must fully offset the costs of increased military spending, thus, making government leaner and more responsive to the public."""

Two-thirds oppose mass deportation of the kind Trump advocated in an immigration-focused speech in Arizona last week, with 66% saying the government should not attempt to deport all people living in the country illegally (even among Trump's supporters, just 45% support such a plan).The complete CNN/ORC Poll resultsBut there's a tight split among voters over which candidate would do the better job handling immigration, according to results from the same CNN/ORC Poll released Monday. Among registered voters, 49% say they trust Clinton on the issue, 47% Trump. Those who trust Clinton on immigration overwhelmingly say the nation's top immigration priority should be finding a way for those in the country illegally to stay (71%), while the Trump backers are more focused on stopping people from entering the country illegally (56%).Overall, 51% say developing a plan to allow legal residency for those working in the US illegally should be the nation's first priority in terms of immigration policy, while 36% say developing a plan to stop immigrants from entering the US illegally should be the first priority. Far fewer say the focus of US immigration policy should be on deporting immigrants living in the US illegally, just 11% rate that as a top priority.Poll: Nine weeks out, a near even raceThere's broad consensus on a bill to allow those immigrants working in the US illegally, who have been in the country for some time, speak English and are willing to pay back taxes, to remain in the country and eventually apply for citizenship (88% favor such a plan). On that, Clinton and Trump voters agree even though the candidates don't, with 80% of Trump's backers saying they would support such a bill and 94% of Clinton's backers behind the idea.Trump's proposed wall along the border with Mexico provokes the largest gap between Clinton and Trump backers, 82% of Trump backers support the wall, 89% of Clinton voters oppose it.Immigration now rivals the economy as a top concern for voters when considering who they'll support in November, with 16% naming an immigration related issue as their top concern in an open-ended question. The voters who name it as a top issue are more apt to support Trump's approach to handling immigration. Overall, 61% of them say they trust Trump on immigration, 38% Clinton.These immigration voters split between prioritizing border security (43% call that the top priority) and a plan to allow those working in the US illegally to stay (39% see that as the top priority). They are more apt than others to favor building a wall along the entire border with Mexico (54% compared with 41% overall) and deporting all immigrants living in the US illegally (43% vs. 30% overall). Yet a broad majority, 78%, say they would favor a bill to allow those immigrants working in the US illegally, who meet certain criteria, to stay and eventually apply for citizenship.The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 1-4 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. The survey includes results among 886 registered voters and 786 likely voters. For results among registered or likely voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

He's appointed more women, African-Americans and Hispanics to the federal bench than his predecessors, and also worked to name judges with a wider array of work experience.But the Senate has been slow in confirming Obama's nominees, and halted any progress on judicial nominations until after Obama's term ends in January, including Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.That makes it unlikely Qureshi will be confirmed in the months left of Obama's tenure, unless lawmakers take up his nomination in a lame duck session.
