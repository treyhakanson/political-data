He wouldn't call the Republican nominee's accusers liars outright but said some cases appear ""kind of untrue"" to him. ""I believe Donald Trump,"" he said. ""I don't know about the nine women. I haven't studied the case. I'm a lawyer. I'd have to study each case to tell you that. I'm not going to engage in Clinton-type conduct in attacking. I'm just telling you that I believe he's telling the truth. I do not believe -- some of these cases appear to me on their face to be kind of untrue."" Giuliani said it's ""not true"" that Trump has attacked his accusers more viciously than the Clintons criticized Bill Clinton's accusers. When Tapper pointed out that Trump, in campaign speeches, is ""calling them liars and saying they're not good-looking enough,"" Giuliani demurred. ""I really don't want to dispute this with you. I mean, the four women that I met with tell me that Hillary Clinton was engaged in all types of attacks on them, both public and private,"" Giuliani said. The former New York City mayor then tried to turn to the discussion to policy.""But in any case, shouldn't we be beyond that now? Shouldn't we be beyond Donald Trump's past and Hillary Clinton's past?"" he said.Giuliani: 'I would have to be a moron' to say some cities won't rig electionTapper pointed out that it was Trump who brought three women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second presidential debate and featured them in a surprise event beforehand.""It's not the media making sexual assault an issue. Donald Trump is making sexual assault an issue,"" Tapper said. ""They asked to come. They asked to come,"" Giuliani said. ""But the reality is, can we get off it? ... I was with Donald Trump all day yesterday. He talked about the women maybe two or three minutes."" "	Rudy Giuliani on Trump groping allegations: 'I believe Donald Trump'	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

His comments are notable because Trump has insisted it's not clear whether Russia is playing a role. In the second presidential debate, he said Clinton's campaign has pointed to Russia's role in the hacking as a political deflection. ""But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking,"" Trump said. ""Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.""On Friday, US officials familiar with the investigation told CNN there is mounting evidence that the Russian government is supplying WikiLeaks with hacked emails pertaining to the US presidential election.The methods of the disclosures ""suggest Moscow is at least providing the information or is possibly directly responsible for the leaks,"" one US official said.US intelligence officials are still investigating the degree of connection between Russia and WikiLeaks but they remain confident that Russia is behind the leaks themselves.CNN attempted to reach WikiLeaks for comment but received no response. WikiLeaks's founder, Julian Assange, has previously denied any connection to or cooperation with Russia.On Friday, former Acting CIA Director Mike Morrell said on a conference call organized by the Clinton campaign that it was ""absolutely clear ... WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2 are working with the Russians on this.""Russia's highest officials are dismissing accusations that Moscow is trying to sway the US presidential election with cyber attacks, speaking out before the latest accusation concerning WikiLeaks was shared with CNN on Thursday.President Vladimir Putin ridiculed such talk Wednesday as ""hysteria.""""Let them prove it,"" Sergei Lavrov told CNN's Christiane Amanpour, waving off a US vow to retaliate with a ""proportional response."""

He introduced himself, discussing his time in Honduras as a missionary, and noting Clinton's faith as a Methodist. The Virginia senator encouraged parishioners to vote, emphasizing the responsibility to participate politically in accordance with Christian values, and reminded them of the October 18 registration deadline. Following his remarks, Kaine received a blessing from the pastor, attendees standing and raising their hands to pray for him and his family.The visit is part of the Clinton campaign's outreach to new Americans in the election, particularly in the battleground state of Florida. One sign the campaign is counting on Hispanic-Americans to turn out on Election Day: Nearly one-quarter of the campaign's Florida organizing staff speaks Spanish, and has been working to register voters outside supermarkets, community centers, bodegas and churches, including the one Kaine attended Sunday. A campaign aide said there has been a ""huge spike"" in vote by mail requests from Hispanic voters in the Sunshine State.

At every turn, Trump finds another ""broken,"" ""rigged"" and ""disastrous"" policy to undo or abolish. Real worries and legitimate concerns share space -- sometimes lines in a single speech -- with Trump's dark fantasies.And like so many aspiring authoritarians before him, the candidate is also consistent on another point: channeling scapegoats and delivering a promise that ""I alone can fix it."" Here are more than a dozen people, places and issues Trump has claimed to be damaged or corrupted beyond repair -- by anyone other than himself:American cities""We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African-Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it's so dangerous,"" he said during the first presidential debate.

""I was shocked just because I was like, 'What was that? I've never had anybody greet me like that,' and I almost wanted to wipe my mouth just because I felt awkward and kind of embarrassed,"" Taggart said.The second incident Taggart remembers as ""different,"" but ""similar.""Trump invited the aspiring model to visit the Trump Tower to introduce her to Ford and Elite modeling agencies, according to Taggart, who said the meeting took place several weeks after the pageant.Escorted by two chaperones, Taggart went to meet Trump. ""I went out there and when his receptionist called him back when he came out to greet me, he gave me another embrace and a kiss and it was a little different this time, it kind of felt like, it just felt like a little bit more to me,"" Taggart said, adding, ""To me it was like, 'I hope he knows I'm here for business.'"" Taggart told Burnett that the situation made her feel awkward and that instead of staying for the multiple weeks she had planned, she ended up buying a plane ticket and flying herself home after the first week. ""I felt awkward,"" Taggart said. Taggart first accused Trump of misconduct in a New York Times article in May. She repeated her claims to NBC News earlier this week in the wake of a 2005 clip in which Trump brags about being able to grope women and get away with it.""He had walked in, and my dad had seen him, and he just introduced himself then introduced me. And the first time, it was just like a, kind of a quick hug and kiss on the lips,"" Taggart told Burnett.Trump responded to Taggart's allegations in a statement to NBC News: ""I don't even know who she is. She claims this took place in a public area. I never kissed her. I emphatically deny this ridiculous claim.""Taggart's accusation comes in the wake of multiple women accusing Trump of sexually assaulting them. Trump has vehemently denied the accusations and on Friday responded by calling himself the ""victim"" of a political ""smear."" Taggart told Burnett she had no political motivations in coming forward with her story, noting that she was a Republican.""I had excused it. I've been through a lot worse with guys since then,"" Taggart said.  When asked if she was coming forward to aid the Clinton campaign, Taggart replied: ""Not one bit,"" and said she was not planning on voting for either candidate.

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/15/politics/donald-trump-rigged-election-hillary-clinton/index.html	"Trump opened Sunday with a series of tweets sowing doubt about the legitimacy of the election. ""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD""But Trump's own vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, disagreed during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" saying he will accept the Election Day results.""We will absolutely accept the result of the election,"" he said. ""Look, the American people will speak in an election that will culminate on November the 8. But the American people are tired of the obvious bias in the national media. That's where the sense of a rigged election goes here, Chuck.""That stood in contrast to Trump's top surrogates. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani claimed that Democrats could steal a close election by having dead people vote in inner cities.""I'm sorry, dead people generally vote for Democrats rather than Republicans,"" Giuliani told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" ""You want me to (say) that I think the election in Philadelphia and Chicago is going to be fair? I would have to be a moron to say that.""And Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, on ABC's ""This Week"" urged Trump voters to monitor polling stations.""I remember when Richard Nixon had the election stolen in 1960, and no serious historian doubts that Illinois and Texas were stolen. So to suggest that, we have, you don't have theft in Philadelphia is to deny reality,"" Gingrich said.The intensity surrounding the election is building in the final weeks of the race. In the evening, Trump -- without evidence -- blamed the firebombing of a North Carolina local GOP office on supporters of Hillary Clinton. ""Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP,"" Trump tweeted Sunday night. For its part, the Clinton campaign quickly tweeted a note of sympathy.""The attack on the Orange County HQ @NCGOP office is horrific and unacceptable. Very grateful that everyone is safe.""The North Carolina Republican Party tweeted its appreciation in response.""Thank you for your thoughts & prayers, Sec. @HillaryClinton.""Intensifying Trump criticism of ClintonThe ""rigged election"" allegations by Trump and his top lieutenants came after an event Saturday in New Hampshire in which the candidate refuted allegations he groped and kissed women without their consent as ""total lies.""Trump also argued, once again, that Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ""should have been prosecuted"" and ""be in jail"" for her improper use of a private email server at the State Department. She escaped prosecution, Trump alleged, because of collusion between the Clintons and the Department of Justice.He also used that claim earlier Saturday to fundraise.""Folks, there's never been a situation like this in the history of our country,"" Trump said at a campaign rally here.Trump also sought to discredit the women who have accused him of sexual assault in recent days, calling one a ""crazy woman"" and pointing to a statement from the cousin of another accuser.John Barry, the cousin of Summer Zervos, a former ""Apprentice"" contestant who on Friday accused Trump of having groped her, had released a statement Friday evening through the Trump campaign alleging that Zervos had ""praised"" Trump and supported Trump's presidential bid until recently.Zervos' attorney, Gloria Allred, in turn called Barry ""a huge Trump supporter.""Trump argued that other allegations are ""total lies"" and have ""already been proven so false.""But Trump primarily raised the allegations to argue again that the media outlets reporting on the allegations -- many of which describe actions Trump bragged about in a 2005 conversation that surfaced last week -- are doing so to sink his campaign.""Remember this, it's a rigged election because you have phony people coming up with phony allegations with no witnesses whatsoever,"" Trump said. ""The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her (Clinton) president.""A sitting senator, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, added his voice to Trump's attack in remarks before the GOP nominee took the stage, saying ""they will not succeed"" in manipulating the election.Asked for comment in light of Trump's remarks, the office of Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan vouched for the integrity of the US electoral process Saturday afternoon.""Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,"" said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan.Fundraising off threatTrump's remarks came after his campaign pushed out a plea for donations to supporters by pointing to his vow to investigate and prosecute Clinton if elected, a threat that is unprecedented in modern US political history. Trump even issued the threat to Clinton at the last presidential debate.""As I promised on Sunday, if elected I will appoint a special prosecutor to look into Crooked Hillary's emails and get the answers the American people deserve,"" Trump says in the email.Trump casts away his telepromptersHe again cited his argument that Clinton is the ""ultimate career politician, enriching herself off of the rigged system for decades while getting NOTHING accomplished.""When Trump brought up the threat at Sunday's debate, Clinton responded, ""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.""To which Trump replied, ""Because you'd be in jail.""The Department of Justice, acting on an FBI recommendation, declined to press criminal charges against Clinton regarding the matter over the summer.'Rigged' claimsEarlier Saturday, Trump continued to claim that the election is ""rigged"" against him, citing the sexual assault charges that have embroiled his campaign.""100% fabricated and made-up charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton Campaign, may poison the minds of the American Voter. FIX!"" Trump tweeted. He followed up: ""This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!""And again: ""Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election.""Later in the afternoon, he added: ""Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!""Trump has warned of a ""rigged"" election for months. He said in North Carolina Friday that ""the whole thing is one big fix"" and, railing against the sexual assault allegations, said he was the ""victim"" of a ""political smear campaign.""But his comments come as his campaign has urged him to focus on issues and Clinton, particularly in the wake of politically damaging WikiLeaks releases, with just over three weeks to go before Election Day. Trump's poll numbers have been declining since the first presidential debate late last month, and his polling troubles accelerated with the surfacing of a 2005 tape last week in which Trump bragged about being able to grope women and get away with it."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/15/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-juanita-broaddrick/index.html	"The hacked email, entitled ""History of Juanita Broaddrick Allegations,"" contained several attachments.The documents were made public on Saturday as part of WikiLeaks' hack of Podesta's email account. The Clinton campaign has refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails released by WikiLeaks, and CNN cannot independently confirm their authenticity.In the tweet, Broaddrick repeats an allegation that ""I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73...it never goes away."" Bill Clinton's attorney denied that claim in 1999.The hacked email sent to Podesta from Kendall included a 1998 affidavit signed by Broaddrick. The document states: ""During the 1992 presidential campaign, there were unfounded rumors and stories circulated that Mr. Clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies"" and goes on to say: ""I repeatedly denied the allegations and requested that my family's privacy be respected. These allegations are untrue and I had hoped that they would no longer haunt me, or cause further disruption to my family."" This affidavit was part of the lawsuit filed by Paula Jones against Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. She was subpoenaed in that case.Kendall noted to Podesta in January of this year that Broaddrick also testified in a deposition in January 1998 reaffirming the contents of the affidavit.In April 1998, however, she told investigators from Independent Counsel Ken Starr's office that the affidavit was false, said Kendall, who sent part of Starr's report to Podesta.""Starr was seeking more evidence against the president, any way he could, and he immunized Broaddrick to protect her from any prosecution for perjury if she now changed her story. Voila! She did, disavowing her sworn affidavit and sworn deposition testimony,"" wrote Kendall in the email.Also attached to the email was a NBC News story from 1999 recounting a statement Kendall made saying ""any allegation that the president assaulted Mrs. Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is false.""Kendall ended the email, saying, ""Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide about this slimefest."" Broaddrick was one of three Bill Clinton accusers who appeared alongside Donald Trump a week ago in St. Louis at an event before the second presidential debate. The group was invited to sit in the debate hall by the Trump campaign.The Clinton campaign did not comment on Broaddrick until after Sunday's debate, when the Democratic nominee, responding to Trump's decision to bring the accusers, told reporters it was up to Trump as to how he ran his campaign."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/15/politics/donald-trump-fundraising-september/index.html	"Trump's campaign, along with Republican joint fundraising committees, said it raised $100 million last month, more than it has in any previous month though well short of the $154 million Hillary Clinton's operation took in.But Trump -- who largely closed a polling gap with Clinton during much of September -- did not give more to his campaign than he had in previous months despite being pressured to invest more of his fortune.His campaign did not specify how much of the money was raised by his campaign versus the committees, which must split proceeds with the Republican National Committee and more than 20 state parties.Meanwhile, a new fundraising report filed Saturday night found few Republican heavyweight donors cut major checks to Trump's campaign during the summer months.Trump Victory, his high-dollar fundraising group, raised $61.3 million for Trump's campaign and the Republican Party between July and September. And very few of the GOP's most prominent financial backeres can be found listed on the report, a concrete sign of just how much the GOP's donor class has spurned him.Some Republican billionaires did pony up: The most generous GOP donor in the country, Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam, donated $10 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, Future45, in September, $5 million more than had been expected. The group — expected to be one of the leading Trump advertisers in television during the homestretch —  raised a total of $12.3 million, thanks to smaller donations from GOP megadonors Joe Ricketts and Joe Craft.A second Trump super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, posted disappointing totals, but revealed a few more GOP donors willing to cut checks. The group — which has repeatedly claimed massive amount in pledges from donors — raised only $18 million between July and September. Almost two-thirds of that money came from two well-known Trump financiers: Bernie Marcus, the founder of Home Depot, who gave the super PAC $5 million, and Linda McMahon, the former Senate candidate in Connecticut, who gave the group $6 million.Trailing Clinton in cashTrump entered the final month of the campaign trailing Clinton in the cash race by $75 million, a wider margin than he trailed at the end of August. His campaign and committees said they had $75 million on hand as of September 30; Clinton's campaign and committees claimed $152 million.The Trump and Clinton campaigns will offer a more precise description of their financial position when they file monthly reports with the Federal Election Commission next week. Trump's ability to raise money online has largely made up for his poor relationship with traditional Republican high-dollar donors, who have largely spurned him for the entire campaign, though he did win a few marquee names over in the month of September. And the campaign on Saturday attributed Trump's haul to those low-dollar givers.Shortly after he became the GOP nominee, Trump slowed down his contributions to his campaign to typically $2 million a month after having spent more during his primary campaign.But at rallies and fundraisers in recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly said he would contribute more than $100 million to his campaign by the end, leading to speculation that he had handed over a major gift during September. For Trump's statement to become true, he would now have to contribute more than $40 million during the final five weeks of the general election. ""I have developed some tremendous friendships,"" Trump joked at a Dallas fundraiser earlier this month. ""I'm going to have to spend $100 million to do that.""One other committee posting its report Saturday: the Paul Ryan-backing Congressional Leadership Fund, which reported a historic haul of $31 million thanks to $20 million from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam."

Michael Bennet, issued a statement when news broke of Trump's lewd comments on a 2005  ""Access Hollywood"" tape, calling on Trump to voluntarily step aside and saying the GOP nominee was ""simply disqualified from being Commander-in-Chief."" A week later, however, Glenn now says he'll vote for Trump but still doesn't endorse him.In audio obtained by CNN's KFile from a source who attended the closed-door Colorado Concern forum on Friday, Glenn tells attendees he will be voting for the Republican platform and the GOP nominee. ""So where I'm at right now is that I absolutely will be supporting the Republican platform and voting for Mr. Trump,"" Glenn said. ""I will not be personally endorsing Mr. Trump and there is a clear distinction. When I personally endorse you that means I know your heart, I know your character and I can personally attest to that and I can not. If that changes we can revisit that, when it comes to evaluating the policies of what we're going to be able to do with regard to weighing the Republican policy platform versus the Democrats, it is not even a choice. I will be voting for the Republican ticket and Republican candidates.""Several Republican lawmakers and candidates have distanced themselves from Trump since news broke of the 2005 tape, in which Trump can be heard bragging about doing whatever he wants to a woman because he's a celebrity, including grabbing their genitals. Trump apologized for those comments in a video statement and at the debate, referring to them as ""locker room talk""Glenn spent the past week backing away from his strongly worded statement calling on Trump to drop out of the race. After initially telling local media through a spokesperson that he would not even vote for Trump, Glenn praised his debate performance and said he was unsure if he'd vote for Trump or not. At the forum Friday, Glenn said he would not apologize for his strong initial reaction to Trump's 2005 comments.""What I want to do is be able to share with everybody the reality of where we're at in this election cycle,"" Glenn said. ""I mean this is either the best or worst reality TV show ever. And, my background, I grew up in a broken home. Domestic violence is real. When a man puts his hand on a women, that has a tremendous impact on my life. And when the story first came out and I heard that, I had a reaction as a father, as a Christian and I was very concerned, deeply moved by that. The initial reaction was real, that's how I felt. I'm not going to apologize for that.""Glenn added that he found Trump's apology at the debate to be sincere, and that his faith teaches him to never close the door on anybody.""That's when I said, well I don't know him as an individual so I will extend an opportunity to talk to him and that opportunity is still there,"" he said. ""What Republicans must understand -- especially here in Colorado -- is it's fine to sit here and talk to Republicans, but you also must understand, that when I'm out there as the head of my party in the state, when I'm talking to Democrats and un-affiliates, the first question out of their mouth is to justify the comments for my candidate. And I can not do that without not having a relationship with that individual.""A spokesperson for Glenn's campaign declined to comment for this story."

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/15/politics/hillary-clinton-golden-state-raised-100-million-california/index.html	"Clinton headlined what her campaign has been branding as her final fundraiser in California Thursday night -- a 115-person star-studded event featuring a performance by Elton John. The event, which brought in over $4 million, was hosted by entertainment executive Casey Wasserman and attendees included Barbra Streisand.Earlier the day, Clinton headlined a 4,500-person concert fundraiser featuring Andra Day in San Francisco. That event, which included a 40-minute speech by Clinton, raised over $6 million.California is easily Clinton's most lucrative state. Taken together, Clinton's Golden State fundraisers raised just over $100 million, according to CNN's estimate based on ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the campaign.She has held more fundraisers in New York -- 85 -- but those events have brought in just over $81 million based on the same calculation. It is expected that Clinton will headline more New York fundraisers before the end of the campaign.Fundraising is something every presidential candidate has to do to a certain degree, but Clinton has spent more time headlining events than recent nominees. While Clinton has struggled to match the small dollar donations that powered then-Sen. Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and Bernie Sanders' primary race, she has been prolific at top-dollar events.It is unusual that a candidate break away from the campaign trail for days at a time to fundraise this late in the campaign. But the decision to do so is a sign that while Clinton's fundraising has been record-breaking this cycle, much of her top-dollar fundraising stems from events she has to headline.Clinton's most lucrative fundraiser in California was an almost 6,000-person event at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles on June 6. That event was headlined Stevie Wonder and included performances by Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera and John Legend and raised around $15 million. But smaller events were also big raisers: Clinton's average haul from a California fundraiser was just over $1.4 million, according to the same figures provided by the campaign.Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manger, said Thursday that Clinton and her top surrogates will spend less time fundraising in coming weeks, noting that the campaign will be relying on ""online donors"" to fund the campaign.""We saw big spikes in online giving around the convention, around the debate and we certainly expect to see that before and during the next debate,"" Mook said. ""And I would say in addition to that, as the amount of time the secretary and her surrogates spend campaigning in these last few weeks, it is actually these online donors who will almost exclusively be funding this campaign.""But Clinton has a massive war chest that Democrats thing will easily carry her through Election Day.Clinton's campaign raised a record $154 million in September, breaking the record set by Obama's campaign in August 2008. The started October with $68 million in the bank."	Hillary Clinton's Golden State ATM	['Clinton']	[]
