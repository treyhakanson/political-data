Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma — a conservative who voted for Ryan last year for speaker— is threatening to pull his support if the Wisconsin Republican won't fall in line behind the GOP nominee.""Given the stakes of this election, if Paul Ryan isn't for Trump, then I'm not for Paul Ryan,"" Bridenstine tweeted Wednesday.Other conservative Republicans have also flashed their anger toward Ryan over his position that he wouldn't defend or campaign with Trump, raising the specter that Bridenstine could be the first in a crowd of conservatives rebelling against the speaker.The GOP has been gripped by infighting since a 2005 video surfaced last week showing Trump describing women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms. Ryan hasn't withdrawn his endorsement of Trump but he did tell House Republicans Monday that he will no longer defend the nominee and will devote the remainder of the campaign season to helping Republicans in House and Senate races. Several angry GOP members on that call pushed back at Ryan, arguing he should continue to stand strongly behind Trump. Trump repeatedly blasted Ryan Tuesday, lamenting his leadership and blaming him for eroding party unity.Yet on Wednesday, several of Trump's biggest supporters in the House Republican Conference privately urged the campaign in a private conference call to back away from the Ryan attacks and focus on Democrats instead, according to a source on the call. Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said the speaker is ""fighting to ensure we hold a strong majority next Congress, and he is always working to earn the respect and support of his colleagues."" RELATED: Trump vs. the GOP: The road to ruinAfter backing Ryan in 2015, Bridenstine noted in a statement that his support came with conditions.  ""I will work constructively with the new Speaker to advance sound legislation addressing the nation's urgent needs, and I will also hold him accountable to lead House in responsibly performing its representational duties and advancing our national interests,"" he said at the time.The simmering tension is significant because there will be another vote next month for speaker. Assuming the GOP keeps control of the House, the Republican Conference will select its choice for speaker in mid-November in a closed-door secret ballot election. The election requires a majority support to be nominated for speaker.But the more politically treacherous vote is in January when the full House will choose its speaker. Since Democrats will vote for their own candidate, Ryan wouldn't be able to lose more than a handful of votes if the chamber is narrowly divided, as is expected. That means he would have to limit GOP defections in order to win the 218 votes needed to become speaker.RELATED: Donald Trump's GOP civil warRyan was already facing some pressure from some of his members on the right of the conference, many of whom have been critical he hasn't pushed hard enough for their legislative priorities. Some House conservatives have called on GOP leaders to move the date for leadership elections later, saying they don't want to vote for re-electing Ryan until they evaluate how he handles year-end spending negotiations.  Asked about that request last month, Ryan said he expected the conference to vote at the same time it traditionally does after every election.Last October, 10 House Republicans didn't vote for Ryan when the entire House took a roll call vote for the speaker.   Meanwhile, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway held a conference call Wednesday with House Republicans who back the GOP nominee. The lawmakers urged Conway to tell Trump to focus his fire exclusively on Hillary Clinton — and not on his own party.A source on the call said Conway acknowledged what they were saying about Ryan. But she did not commit one way or the other."	Paul Ryan facing threats to speakership over Trump flap	['Bridenstine', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Same-day sign-ups are allowed every day but Election Day, November 8. North Carolina's 15 electoral votes are up for grabs in the presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The state is also the site of a competitive Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. Richard Burr and Democratic challenger Deborah Ross. Florida's voter registration deadline was the subject of a battle between Clinton's campaign and state Democrats, who wanted an extension from a deadline originally set for Tuesday, and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who said the deadline should stand. A judge has pushed the deadline back to next week after Hurricane Matthew.However, Florida doesn't allow the same flexibility as North Carolina's same-day registration during early voting -- which gives campaigns extra time to identify and turn out new voters.It's up to North Carolina's state board of elections to decide whether to grant an extension. The board's public information officers didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Common Cause North Carolina on Tuesday called for an extension of the voter registration deadline to October 19. ""Thousands of North Carolinians continue to face loss of power, flooding and serious property damage caused by Hurricane Matthew. They should be able to focus on the safety and wellbeing of themselves and their families at this time, without the added concern about possibly missing an opportunity to vote,"" Bob Phillips, Common Cause North Carolina's executive director, said in a statement. ""We believe the fair and responsible action for the State Board of Elections is to extend the voter registration deadline. We urge Gov. (Pat) McCrory and legislators from the affected regions to join us in asking the State Board of Elections to extend the registration deadline,"" Phillips said.But the North Carolina Democratic Party hasn't made any official requests, said spokesman Dave Miranda. ""We support anything that makes it easier for registered voters to vote,"" he said. But, Miranda added, ""in North Carolina, it's still very easy to vote even if you miss the voter registration deadline."" Aides for Clinton and Trump's presidential campaigns and the North Carolina Republican Party did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova characterized the move as ""dangerous,"" charging that the United States has actively blocked the release of monies from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to projects in Russia.""Nobody should harbor the illusion that you can pressure Russia, neither the current American authorities, nor those who will replace them,"" Zakharova said.In addition to US accusations that Russia is hacking American elections systems to influence the upcoming vote, Moscow also has taken overt steps that have troubled the West. It abruptly left a nuclear security pact, citing US aggression, and moved nuclear-capable Iskandar missiles to the edge of NATO territory in Europe. Its ships and planes have buzzed their US counterparts. Its officials have openly raised the possible use of nuclear weapons. And that's just the highlight reel.""This is a conflict, there should be no doubt,"" said Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, on the US-Russia confrontation.RELATED: Lavrov denies Russian influence over US electionOn Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the US was considering a ""range"" of ""proportional"" responses to alleged Russian hacking of US political groups. Washington publicly accused the Kremlin of cyberattacks on election systems and the democracy itself last Friday. That came after talks on a Syria ceasefire broke down as US officials suggested Russia be investigated for war crimes in the besieged city of Aleppo.Moscow has steadfastly denied that it's meddling in the US presidential election. In an interview this week with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it was a baseless accusation.""We have not seen a single fact, a single proof,"" Lavrov said.At the same time, Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry are arranging to meet in a multilateral setting this weekend to discuss a Syria ceasefire, a sign that despite the strains, Kerry continues to try to find middle ground with Russia.However, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has pointed to the hacks as evidence that Russia favors her GOP opponent, Donald Trump. Appearing at an investment forum in Moscow on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed that charge.""There was a whole hysteria about that being of interest to Russia, but there is nothing within the interest of Russia,"" Putin said.The friction between Moscow and Washington -- by many assessments at its highest level since the fall of the Berlin Wall -- led Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, to make a plea Monday for dialogue and de-escalation.""I think the world has reached a dangerous point,"" Gorbachev warned, according to Agence France-Presse.""This needs to stop. We need to renew dialogue,"" Gorbachev said, commenting on the US decision to call off Syria talks.""Indeed, it's not a Cold War,"" said Igor Zevelev, former director of the MacArthur Foundation's Russia office. ""It's a much more dangerous and unpredictable situation.""It's unlikely that tensions will ebb anytime soon, with the very real possibility of a building tit-for-tat dynamic developing at a time when channels of communication between the two capitals have dwindled.RELATED: Russia protests anti-Trump comments by top UN officialA Western diplomat said past confrontations between the West and Russia followed a typical pattern of a slow escalation and a mutual understanding on both sides when it was time to stop. With Russia's actions in Syria, where they are supporting President Bashar al-Assad in the siege of Aleppo, placing nuclear-capable missiles at NATO's doorstep and its cyberattacks, the diplomat said, ""you have the impression they are escalating by themselves and going to the extreme.""""This is a very different system,"" the diplomat said. ""When you listen to these new Russians, this is not the strategic balance that we knew. It is unusual and dangerous."" Recent incidents include harassment of US diplomats in Moscow and Russian claims that its foreign service officers are badgered in the US, several occasions in the past year when Russian jets and naval vessels have buzzed the US military and Moscow's 2014 violation of a core security treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile. The list goes on. ""The quality of relations between us is certainly at the lowest point since the Cold War,"" said Russia's ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. ""The risk of miscalculations has increased,"" especially with NATO forces ""being deployed next to our borders,"" Kislyak said in remarks at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.The ambassador said that ""normal channels of communication are frozen"" between the US and Russia. ""We see the United States taking unfriendly steps toward Russia including sanctions, there are calls for isolating Russia,"" he said, adding, ""it doesn't work with Russia and it's not going to work."" Lavrov told interviewers from Russia's Channel One that Moscow had pulled out of the nuclear security pact on plutonium on October 3 because of ""aggressive anti-Russia tendencies at the basis of the US policy on Russia.""He pointed to NATO deployments, infrastructure and missile placement as examples of ""aggressive steps that have a direct bearing on our national interests and can affect our national security.""On the US side, Kerry led the call for a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Syria and has said that the US will retaliate for what it sees as interference in the 2016 presidential vote.""They're not, quote, 'getting away with it' for free,"" Kerry said Monday in Palo Alto, referring to hacks on US election systems and political parties.Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the accusations as ""nonsense"" on Friday, according to the Russian Interfax News Agency.Even so, the US has sent Russia a ""very clear"" message about ""the unacceptability of interference with democracy in the United States of America,"" said Kerry. He warned that ""we will and can respond in ways that we choose to, at the time of our choice.""In light of the tensions, Gorbachev urged a ""return to the main priorities"" between Russia and the US.""These are nuclear disarmament, the fight against terrorism, the prevention of an environmental disaster,"" he listed. ""Compared to these challenges, all the rest slips into the background.""RELATED: Russia vetoes UN resolution to halt Aleppo airstrikesYet change any time soon is unlikely. Putin has consolidated his hold on parliament and looks set to be re-elected within the next 18 months.He has a prickly track record with Clinton, who he accused of instigating December 2011 demonstrations against him while she was secretary of state. For her part, Clinton joked in 2008 that then-President George W. Bush couldn't have gotten a sense of Putin's soul, as he had claimed, because the Russian president is a former KGB agent and that means ""by definition he doesn't have a soul.""Trump has repeatedly praised Putin, downplaying Russian actions in Syria and on hacking, and at one point calling on Russia to help probe his rival's email accounts.""I think it would be great if we got along with Russia,"" Trump said Sunday at the second presidential debate.In his interview with CNN's Amanpour, Lavrov called it ""ridiculous"" to suggest that ""Russia is interfering in the United States' domestic matters."" But Lavrov nevertheless made reference to last week's bombshell that rocked the presidential race: an unearthed tape from 2005 in which Trump can be heard bragging about groping women and grabbing their genitalia. ""There are so many p***ies around your presidential campaign on both sides that I prefer not to comment,"" Lavrov told Amanpour.Regardless of who inhabits the White House next, Putin isn't likely to alter his course. Aligning Russia with Syria, countering the US at the UN Security Council and pushing back against NATO by flying bombers along the western Atlantic coast in September, among other moves, serve the Russian leader at home.""You'd think 'why is he worried,' but there's clearly concern on some level"" on Putin's part about the upcoming presidential elections ""and this shores up his popularity,"" said Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russia and East European Studies at Georgetown University. It also distracts Russians from the economy, which the Eurasia Group, among other analysts, assess has a long-term negative outlook.""It helps to have an enemy if people are feeling the economic pinch,"" Stent said. ""If people think we're going to be at war with the US, they forget about the cost of food.""The cyberattacks may also represent a kind of payback. Putin ""really believes the US is responsible"" for the December 2011 demonstrations against him, Stent said. He may be telegraphing, ""You think you can interfere in our elections? Well, we can do the same thing, too,"" she said.RELATED: White House: We will respond to Russia hacksThere are global elements to the Russian leader's strategy that also signal continued tensions. Putin is ""driven by big ideas about Russia's role in the world,"" said Zevelev, a fellow at the Wilson Center. Putin wants to limit America's world leadership role, curb what he sees as an American inclination for ""regime change,"" and show that Russia too can use military force to achieve foreign policy goals.""Putin wants to assert Russia as a global power with great ambitions,"" Zevelev said, ""and in order to demonstrate it, Moscow has to do something in the world arena from time to time.""The Wilson Center's Rojansky said Russian ""messaging is clear -- 'if we are not getting what we want on one front, we will escalate on other fronts.' ""Moscow could do that by reigniting frozen conflicts in Europe, Rojansky said, taking on other regional interventions or even aligning with China to support Beijing's aspirations for dominance in the South China Sea.And he pointed out that the Russians ""have signaled in a couple of ways that they are willing"" to use nuclear weapons.""This is the most dangerous time since I don't know when,"" said Stent of Georgetown University, who added that the next few months before the new US president takes office will likely be eventful.""Russia understands they have another couple of months until January where nothing much is going to happen, and why not take advantage of that,"" she said.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Interfax is not a state-owned Russian news agency."

No one wants to talk about that,"" Conway said. ""You want me to comment on something he said to Howard Stern in 15 seconds 10 years ago and that somehow I'm an expert on it.""As CNN's Kfile reported this weekend, Trump told Stern he would ""go backstage and everyone's getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it."" Trump campaign manager: Clinton jail comments are being taken 'literally'""You know, the dresses. 'Is everyone OK?' You know, they're standing there with no clothes. 'Is everybody okay?'

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/politics/republicans-us-election/index.html	"The tension that has simmered in the Republican Party for years -- shutting down the government and nearly bringing the nation to default -- escalated into an outright civil war Tuesday. The conflict not only threatens the party's ability to make any realistic attempt at reclaiming the White House next month, but also previews the conflicts and divides that could consume the GOP for years to come if Trump loses.On one side is Trump, who spent much of Tuesday lashing out on social media at his GOP foes, such as Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, and lamenting the lack of party unity. He's backed by conservative lawmakers including Iowa Rep. Steve King and the throngs of loyal supporters who attend his rallies, including the one here in Panama City, Florida, Tuesday, where he renewed his call for a government investigation into his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Some are even raising the potential of denying Ryan the speakership after the election. Trump vs. the GOP: The road to ruinOn the other side is Ryan, who is devoting the full resources of his stature to maintaining a congressional majority. That dominance of Capitol Hill is suddenly threatened -- and not just in the Senate, where there are many competitive races, but also in the House, where the GOP majority was considered untouchable until recently.The infighting -- sparked by the release Friday of a 2005 video depicting Trump describing women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms -- isn't likely to ease in the 27 days before Election Day. Trump made clear Tuesday that if he loses in November, he won't go down quietly -- or alone.He began the day with a series of shots -- taken over Twitter -- at Ryan, saying it's hard to do well when the speaker isn't supportive. He followed up about an hour later calling Ryan a ""weak and ineffective leader.""And nearly two hours after that, Trump posed his most explosive tweet of the day.'Shackles have been taken off me'""It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,"" he said.Trump continued his attacks on Ryan Wednesday during a rally in central Florida, where he said he's at a disadvantage when ""you have leadership not putting their weight behind the people.""He also complained about getting no credit from party leaders for his Sunday night debate performance.""Wouldn't you think Paul Ryan would call and say good job?"" he said. ""It got just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. You'd think they'd say great going, Don, let's beat this crook. No, he doesn't.""Trump's turn on his own party may seem counterproductive -- it hardly allows him to improve his chances of catching Clinton. But it does allow him the satisfaction of vengeance against party leaders he believes have never treated him fairly since his stunning outsider campaign captured the nomination earlier this year.And by blaming Republican leaders for their failure to wholeheartedly endorse his campaign, Trump also opens up the possibility of a face-saving excuse if he crashes to defeat in November.But the cost to the Republican Party of Trump's burn-it-down-around-him strategy is already high, could become more extreme and potentially leave the GOP badly damaged long after he has left the political scene.To begin with, the estrangement between Trump and the party leaders is blowing open a gaping split between the party's grass roots and its establishment leaders that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and others worked so hard to bridge over the summer.It is a divide that will be hard to overcome if Trump loses the election. Forging unity could be impossible if hordes of Trump voters blame party leaders for the defeat of a man who electrified the grass roots supporters in a way no other Republican has managed in decades.GOP on the precipiceKing, the Iowa Republican congressman, warned Tuesday that a purge of party elites might be necessary, saying ""the establishment wing of the party could simply be amputated out in this effort that's going on right now.""""They've gone so far out on this limb,"" King said on the Laura Ingraham radio show.The meltdown in the GOP is the culmination of forces that have been building for years. Intense antipathy towards congressional leaders over their failure to more forcefully oppose President Barack Obama gave rise to the Tea Party and sent waves of anti-establishment lawmakers to Washington in successive elections.Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking by him?Trump's adoption of a factually-challenged style of campaigning would have been impossible without the power of conservative media that has been building for decades and is now fused with the GOP presidential ticket through the role of Stephen Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, who serves as the CEO of the Trump campaign.Trump's turn against his own party could also reverberate in down-ballot races. Republicans have long known that their hold on the Senate was tenuous -- whoever ran at the top of their ticket -- but Trump's slumping poll numbers now threaten to drag down vulnerable incumbents too.Cutting into GOP majorityAt the very least, a Trump implosion that cuts deeply into Ryan's majority could complicate the Speaker's already tough task of corralling his volatile majority coalition. If an anti-Trump landslide sweeps away House GOP members in more moderate districts, it could hand more relative power to the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and give him the same kinds of fits that it imposed on John Boehner, his predecessor.The dilemma is especially difficult for Republican senators running for re-election. Some are rejecting Trump because of revulsion at his remarks among more moderate voters. But at the same time, they risk alienating Trump supporters in states's where the former reality star racked up high margins in the primary race.7 takeaways from the second presidential debateNew Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte fits into this category and her desperate effort to walk the fine line between condemning and embracing Trump during this election has become a symbol of the wider GOP conundrum. Ayotte finally said she could not vote for Trump after the video emerged on Friday.But another star of the GOP, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said Tuesday he's not yet ready to back away from Trump. Rubio looks certain to need Trump voters to maintain his narrow lead in his re-election race. But at the same time, if more explosive video emerges about Trump, Rubio, who has presidential ambitions in his future, risks being tarnished by association with the Republican nominee.Another lawmaker in a tough re-election race who is hedging his bets is North Carolina GOP Sen. Richard Burr, who said that while Trump's comments were ""indefensible,"" he still plans to support him.Risks for ClintonFor her part, the turmoil consuming the GOP would seem to provide a substantial boost to Clinton's White House bid. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday found the Democratic nominee enjoying a 9-point lead among likely voters in a four-way race.But her aides caution against excessive optimism. There's concern inside the campaign that an increasingly negative race -- which could only become darker in the days ahead -- could turn off voters and make them less likely to show up at the polls. In that instance, a lower turnout could create an advantage for Trump.Clinton's campaign sweats turnout""This seems to be their strategy, disgust everyone with our democratic dialogue so that they won't come out to the polls,"" John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, told reporters Tuesday. ""I think it is very unbecoming a presidential candidate.""Clinton said as much herself during an interview with a Florida radio station Tuesday.""Despite all of the terrible things (Trump) has said and done, he is still trying to win this election,"" she said.

The FBI, in the coming days, is preparing to provide updated guidance to state elections officials around the US aiming to help them spot suspicious activity on their computer networks. Several states have reported attempted scans of their computer systems, which often is a precursor to a breach. Previously, Illinois officials have said data on fewer than 90,000 people may have been affected by a breach there, and Arizona officials said they saw no indications hackers accessed data in their systems.The vendor hack in Florida prompted the FBI last week to coordinate an emergency call with county election supervisors who operate the election system in the perennial battleground state. CNN has not confirmed the name of the vendor that suffered the attack.ABC News first reported that Florida election information was compromised. Investigators believe a local contractor in California was the target of a hackers, but the systems accessed weren't related the elections, U.S. officials said.  A spokeswoman for the Florida Secretary of State said: ""We currently have no indication of a Florida-specific issue. The Florida Voter Registration System database is secure. The Department of State does not utilize a vendor for voter registration services. The Department has in place many safeguards to prevent any possible attempts from being successful.""An FBI spokeswoman said the bureau and the Department of Homeland Security hosted a conference call with Florida state officials to address questions regarding the security of election systems and to share information regarding the general nature of the cyber threat. FBI and DHS continue to work closely with state officials to assist them in safeguarding their election infrastructures.In the case of Arizona, US officials say the working assumption by investigators is that hackers were able to access data, even if there are no signs of tampering. Arizona officials maintain they've found no signs that hackers got in.  ""We have no updates, our story hasn't changed,"" a spokesman for the Arizona secretary of state said. ""We have seen no access into statewide registration database and no manipulation of that database.""FBI investigators believe the the hacks and attempted intrusions of state election sites were carried out by hackers working for Russian intelligence. The cyberattacks on election registration sites are focused on parts of the US election system that wouldn't affect the votes cast or the vote counts, according to US officials. Instead, the intruders are targeting registration systems.In a statement last Friday, the Director of National Intelligence and the Homeland Security Department formally blame Russia for hacking political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, and orchestrating the release of private emails in an attempt to meddle in the US elections. The statement said the US government wasn't yet ready to attribute the hacks of election registration sites. "	Feds find evidence Florida election-systems vendor was hacked	[]	[]

Trump asked.""This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States — in the history of the United States.""""We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency.""RELATED: Poll finds Clinton and Trump tied in Utah as a potential spoiler surgesLater on, after moving on to Lakeland, Florida, Trump again renewed his vow to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton if he is elected.Clinton ""has to go to jail,"" Trump warned, adding that the lawyers working for her over the email issue should also be incarcerated.Trump also took a fresh shot at Clinton's health, saying that she would not, like him, be able to stand and deliver a raucous speech for an hour in a boiling hot livestock shed that was hosting his rally.""Let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts, folks,"" Trump said. ""What a joke."" The Republican nominee also argued that emails released by Wikileaks showed Clinton had been ""viciously attacking Catholics and evangelicals."" ""That won't be tolerated. Anybody of religion, I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you,"" he said.RELATED: As Trump gets 'unshackled,' Clinton's campaign sweats turnoutTrump was apparently referencing a 2011 email between John Podesta, the subject of the Wikileaks hack and Clinton's campaign chairman, communications director Jennifer Palmieri and John Halpin, a senior fellow at the liberal think-tank Center for American Progress.In the email, Halpin writes that 21st Century Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch and News Corp Chairman Robert Thomson, who are both Catholic, are attracted to the faith because of ""systemic thought and severely backward gender relations.""Palmieri responded, ""I imagine they think it the is the most socially acceptable, politically conservative religion -- their rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelical.""Palmieri told reporters Wednesday that she ""didn't recognize (the email) but moreover... we are not going to fact check each of the emails that were stolen, hacked by (Russia) ... in an effort to hurt our campaign."""

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/politics/hillary-clinton-utah-poll/index.html	"The Y2 Analytics poll, published first by Mormon church-owned Deseret News, found both Clinton and Trump at 26% among likely Utah voters, with independent Evan McMullin at 22% and Libertarian Gary Johnson at 14%.The poll is striking, given Utah is a reliably Republican state that has not voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, but comes after Clinton's campaign has mounted a concerted effort to win the Beehive State by driving a wedge between the Republican nominee and Mormon voters.McMullin, a Mormon, was a late entrant to the presidential race and has focused on Utah, where he was born. It's one of the few handful of states where the former CIA employee will be on the ballot in November.Earlier this year, Clinton's campaign opened an office in Utah and published an opinion-editorial in a paper owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that knocked Trump's proposed Muslim ban, a nod to Mormon's history of religious persecution.Clinton's efforts -- as much about winning Utah as forcing Trump to spend resources in a state he should win -- have been helped by lewd comments Trump made about aggressive sexual behavior in 2005 that were published last week in a Washington Post report. Trump's campaign has been in a spiral since comments came to light and many Mormon leaders and lawmakers pulled back their endorsements.""It is entirely possible that Utah does not vote for Donald Trump,"" said Republican State Sen. Daniel Thatcher. When asked to put odds on that scenario, he quickly replied, ""50-50.""Thatcher is undecided between Trump and Clinton, because he finds the idea of voting for either of them ""morally repugnant.""""They're both awful,"" he said. ""They're both quite possibly the two worst people in the universe.""Utah's top newspapers have also disavowed Trump. The Deseret News urged Trump to drop out earlier this month and on Wednesday, the Salt Lake Tribune endorsed Clinton over Trump, though that publication has trended Democratic in recent years, endorsing President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.""Utah Republicans were perceptive enough to reject Trump in their March presidential caucus voting,"" the paper wrote, referring to Trump's third place finish behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the March 22 caucus there. ""Were they to support Clinton now, even by the narrowest of pluralities, it would send a strong message to the Republican Party to turn their backs on Trumpism.""Clinton's outreach to Mormons is about more than just Utah, too. While Mormons make up 60% of votes in the Beehive State, they also make up sizable numbers in Nevada and Arizona, two other Western states that Clinton is hoping land in her column on November 8.The Y2 Analytics poll was conducted October 10-11, and used responses from 500 likely Utah voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
