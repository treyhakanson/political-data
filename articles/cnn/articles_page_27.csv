The logistics of how the briefings take place are still being worked out.Trump will also receive briefings on the so-called crown jewels of intelligence, one official told CNN. These briefings will provide Trump with information on the nation's most secretive intelligence-gathering programs from the intelligence community and the US military.Trump will be briefed on matters such as signals intelligence collection methods of the National Security Agency, operations conducted by the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command and CIA overseas intelligence collections operations.RELATED: Why the country can be vulnerable during presidential transitionsThe President-elect will also learn the specific sources and methods by which intelligence is collected -- some of the country's most sensitive information. This will also give him access to information on US spying operations by agents and operatives overseas.The ""crown jewels"" briefings have been put in place in recent years so an incoming president is ready to make key decisions on national security as soon as the oath of office is administered.""The new guys may come in feeling good, but after they walk out of one of those briefings, their faces fall,"" a retired official who has been involved in those briefings in past administrations told CNN.

Here are images from a few in the past 50 years:The Times Square demonstrators above were impressed with neither President Barack Obama nor his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, on Election Day 2012. Obama won re-election.In January 2001, hundreds marched in Washington, D.C., to protest the inauguration of President-elect George W. Bush.In November 2000, Florida A&M students held a protest at the rotunda of the state Capitol in Tallahassee. The students protested discrepancies in the results of the Florida presidential election, which ultimately went to George W. Bush. He gained the presidency after a US Supreme Court ruling.In the late 1990s, protesters called for President Bill Clinton's impeachment over developments surrounding his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was impeached, but he was acquitted by the Senate.On April 6, 1983, demonstrators awaited President Ronald Reagan outside a Pittsburgh hotel. Reagan was in Pittsburgh to address a National Conference on the Dislocated Worker. During the Iran hostage crisis, demonstrators against President Jimmy Carter gathered outside a Temple University hall, where Carter was holding a town hall-style meeting on May 9, 1980.Demonstrators gathered outside the White House to support the impeachment of President Richard Nixon following the Watergate revelations in the 1970s.People demonstrated against President John F. Kennedy on what would be the last day of his life. Protesters gathered at Love Field in Dallas on November 22, 1963. According to the Dallas Morning News, extreme-right activists had created a volatile atmosphere before the visit.	When the people protest their President

How Donald Trump wonHere's a look at some of the most notable examples:Low energyEarly on in the primary Trump labeled former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as ""low energy,"" and while the dig seems very mild compared to other nicknames Trump had for his opponents like ""Crooked Hillary"" and ""Lyin' Ted,"" the insult stuck to the mild-mannered Bush like glue.""I defined him. I gave him this term, 'Low energy.' I said he's a low energy individual,"" Trump explained to Jimmy Kimmel last December. ""We do not need in this country low energy. Do you agree with that? We need high energy.""You can no longer assess a person's energy without the ghost of the Trump vs. Bush battle creeping up on you. You will inevitably ask yourself, ""Am I a Trump or a Bush?"" Trump calls Obama 'a very good man' after historic White House meetingHuge/YuuugePresident-elect Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are both New York City natives with ""yuuge"" New York accents.Their unique way of pronouncing ""huge"" when talking about ""yuuge"" movements or ""yuuge"" crowds stood out to Americans across the nation and this 2016 political buzz word is now forever archived in GIFs, Vines and the subconscious of politically engaged American minds.  LightweightBefore 2016 ""lightweight"" was prominently used to describe a person or an item's weight, particularly in sports like boxing. But after 2016, ""Lightweight,"" which is one of Trump's most prolifically used attacks, will forever be heard as an insult.Trump has referred to tens of people as ""lightweight"" to imply that they are daft or unsubstantial. He repeatedly called FOX News' Megyn Kelly a ""lightweight."" ""I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!"" he tweeted in January.He also dismissed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as a ""dishonest lightweight.""""Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown,"" he tweeted in February.""I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida,"" Trump tweeted in March.He slammed a former acting director of the CIA, Mike Morell, tweeting, ""Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!""SAD!Trump's tweets often ended with what we could refer to as ""Trump-xclamations"" -- a single word with an exclamation mark, often capitalized, at the end of a tweet for dramatic effect. Sometimes he added ""very"" for emphasis and used ""SAD!"" to comment on everything from his opponents, to ""The View.""""Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad!"" Trump tweeted in March.""The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!"" he tweeted in January.""Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!"" the President-elect tweeted last December.Feel the Burn/Bern""Feel the Burn"" will now always be heard as ""Bern"" -- with an ""E"" for Bernie.The passionate support that the Vermont senator got from young Americas across the county translated into an equally fiery campaign slogan and a hashtag that lived on months after Sanders exited the 2016 race. #FeelTheBern will always remind us of the Democratic socialist, who gave challenged Clinton during the 2016 Democratic primary.Playing the woman cardWhen Trump accused Clinton of ""playing the woman's card,"" the former Democratic presidential nominee turned Trump's attack against him by embracing the phrase.The Clinton campaign produced an actual ""Woman Card"" that they sent out to supporters who donate to the campaign.""The other day, Mr. Trump accused me, of playing the, quote, 'woman card,'"" Clinton said in April. ""Well, if fighting for women's health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.""This became a popular line of attack against Trump throughout her campaign.Nasty womanWhen Trump called Clinton a ""nasty woman"" during a debate dig, Clinton supporters embraced the phrase -- capitalizing on the positive connotations of the word that have existed in American slang for years.""Nasty"" has been used as a synonym for ""cool"" and has also been used to describe a fierce woman -- especially one with exceptionally good abilities.""Nasty Woman"" T-shirts popped up around the country and streams of Janet Jackson's ""Nasty"" soared on Spotify.""I just bought a NASTY WOMAN t-shirt. 50% goes to Planned Parenthood,"" one woman tweeted.Even Katy Perry wore a ""Nasty Woman"" T-shirt while campaigning for Clinton last month.Any variation of ""America"" and ""great""Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again,"" sparked heated debates across the country. Some argued that America is already great, others longed for a ""greater"" past, while some pointed to a history of racism defined by slavery and Jim Crow and took issue with the ""again"" portion of the slogan.After 2016, you can no longer say that America is great or long for greater times without appearing to take a political stand.Trump's slogan will also resonate whenever making anything ""great again"" is discussed.Bad""Bad"" is one of Trump's favorite insults. He used it to comment on everything from his election opponents, to describing some Latinos as ""bad hombres"" during the final presidential debate last month. He punctuated several of his tweets about his former primary opponent Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with ""Bad!""""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Trump tweeted in February.""Ted Cruz does not have the right 'temperment' to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!"" Trump tweeted later that month.It will be difficult to call something ""bad"" again without hearing Trump in your head.CrookedTrump is known for selecting nicknames for his opponents -- Cruz became ""Lyin' Ted,"" Sanders became ""Crazy Bernie,"" Rubio became ""little Marco"" and Sen. Elizabeth Warren is simply ""Pocahontas."" But none of his 2016 nicknames will be as prominently remembered as ""Crooked Hillary.""At times, Trump would even drop ""Hillary"" and simply called the former secretary of state ""Crooked"" in various tweets.The Trump campaign even launched a ""Crooked Hillary"" Snapchat filter ahead of the first presidential debate.It's safe to say that ""Crooked"" will never be the same again."

Obviously he's going to build it. It's a campaign promise. He's not going to break a campaign promise,"" Giuliani told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day.""Cuomo pointed out there is bipartisan opposition to the idea of a wall in Congress, to which Giuliani said something very interesting that could presage a very interesting debate over executive power.""Well, he can do it by executive order by just reprogramming money within the, within the immigration service,"" Giuliani said. ""And not only that, they have actually approved a wall for certain portions of the border that hasn't even been built yet. So you could take a year building that out, with what has been approved.""During the campaign, CNN imagined the red tape the wall might encounter in bureaucratic Washington. It'll have to go through government agencies and, theoretically, Congress, which controls the purse strings through bills to authorize programs and then separate bills to appropriate money for them.How will Trump and Congress get along?Even lawmakers who support a wall might balk at the idea of a major project being started without their say-so.As CNN's Capitol Hill team reported recently, there is currently little appetite for the wall among top Republicans. Asked three times by CNN if he supports Trump's signature plan to build a wall with Mexico, US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would only say: ""I want to achieve border security the way that's most effective."""

It's not a thing. Stop sharing it. While Donald Trump has said some questionable things, he never said anything even resembling this quote:""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific."" The post says The Donald made the statement in a People Magazine interview in 1998. Except he didn't.Snopes, that mythbusting site, looked into this when it first started doing the rounds in October. That's October 2015! Trump appeared pretty regularly in People Magazine in those days. But Snopes combed through their voluminous archives and couldn't find a single interview where he said that.So when you see this meme, know that it won't be a helpful counterpoint during the Thanksgiving political debates you'll have with your family.

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/trump-past-positions/index.html	"And that makes his agenda as president anybody's guess.That could give the businessman an edge in making legislative deals in a town unaccustomed to surprises. Or it could halt action in Washington completely if he finds himself at odds with both Republicans and Democrats. Here's a look at key issues, in which, his campaign statements don't sync with opinions he expressed in the past:ImmigrationTrump's incendiary rhetoric aimed at undocumented Mexican immigrants and calls to build a massive border wall and deport those here illegally were the central pillar of his presidential campaign. But in the immediate years leading up to his 2016 campaign, Trump described himself as ""down the middle"" on the issue of illegal immigration, and spoke forcefully against deporting undocumented immigrants who had lived in the US for many years. Speaking about undocumented immigrants on CNBC in June 2012, Trump said, ""I also understand how, as an example, you have people in this country for 20 years, they've done a great job, they've done wonderfully, they've gone to school, they've gotten good marks, they're productive — now we're supposed to send them out of the country, I don't believe in that, Michelle, and you understand that. I don't believe in a lot things that are being said.""Eight months earlier, in an interview on ""Fox and Friends,"" Trump had said he supported ""amnesty"" for some undocumented immigrants, saying, ""how do you tell a family that's been here for 25 years to get out?""And following Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat, Trump called Romney's position on self-deportation for undocumented immigrants ""maniacal"" and ""mean-spirited."" A month later, again on ""Fox and Friends"" in December 2012, he implored Republicans to take the lead on immigration reform or it would ""never win another election.""Foreign policyTrump's views on foreign policy, and specifically intervention abroad, are also difficult to pin down. He has claimed he opposed interventions in Iraq and Libya, and that his opposition to those conflicts are a sign of his foreign policy expertise. Many have taken his claims of opposition to mean Trump is non-interventionist.But Trump did offer tepid support for the Iraq War on Howard Stern in 2002, and in writings and interviews before that, expressed how he wished President George H.W. Bush had ""finished"" the job in Iraq during the First Gulf War. Trump would turn against the Iraq War in 2004, and despite publicly calling for the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq in the 2006, 2007 and 2008, Trump has throughout his campaign criticized President Barack Obama for withdrawing troops to quickly. When the US and NATO were considering intervening against Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, Trump repeatedly called for the US to get involved, saying on CNN at the time, ""At this point, if you don't get rid of Gaddafi, it's a major, major black eye for this country."" And when, in 2011, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down in the face of massive uprisings in his country, Trump praised his decision. Now, Trump criticizes Obama for not backing Mubarak, saying in April, ""He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.""Health careOn the issue of health care, President-elect Trump has vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare. A partial or full repeal is likely, but what a Trump administration would replace it with is less clear. Trump praised the Canadian single payer system — an anathema to conservative Republicans —  as late as 2015 in the first GOP primary debate. ""As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here,"" Trump said at the debate, before talking about his proposals for a private system.In 1999, Trump forcefully argued for universal health care, telling CNN's Larry King, ""If you can't take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it's all over. I mean, it's no good. So I'm very liberal when it comes to health care. I believe in universal health care. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.""TaxesWith Republicans now controlling the executive and legislative branches of government, tax cuts are on the table. Trump's current plan has offered major tax cuts for individuals and businesses, but Trump in the past has shown a willingness to impose higher taxes on the wealthy. In testimony before the House Budget Committee in 1991, Trump criticized Reagan-era tax cuts for earners in the top tax bracket, saying it had removed incentives for wealthy people to invest. When Trump considered a presidential run as a Reform Party candidate in 1999, he once proposed paying for universal health care with ""with an increase in corporate taxes."" That same year, he proposed what would have been the largest tax in American history with ""a one time, 14.25% tax on individuals and trusts with a net worth over $10 million."" When the Bush tax cuts were set to expire in 2012, Trump said told Fox and Friends in December of that year he'd support higher taxes on wealthier Americans as part of a larger deal to balance the federal budget. TradeTrump has largely been consistent in his fierce opposition to what he has called unfair trade deals, but he has spoken about the forces of globalization in the past much differently than he does now. In a 2013 op-ed for CNN, for instance, Trump wrote, ""we will have to leave borders behind and go for global unity when it comes to financial stability."" Even in some of his recent books, Trump has seemingly admitted globalization is here to stay. ""Globalization has torn down the barriers that have formerly separated the national from the international markets and one result is that affluent foreigners have been drawn to real estate in the United States,"" Trump wrote in Never Give Up: How I Turned My Biggest Challenges into Success, a book from Trump University. ""The important thing to consider is that more and more there is an interdependence of world economies,"" he adds. ""No one can afford to be isolationist anymore.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/donald-trump-obama-paul-ryan-washington/index.html	"Three days after mocking Trump as unfit to control the codes needed to launch nuclear weapons, Obama told his successor that he wanted him to succeed and would do everything he could to ensure a smooth transition.Trump, who spent years pursuing Obama over false claims he is not a natural-born American and accused him of being the founder of ISIS on the campaign trail, called Obama a ""very good man"" and said he would seek his counsel in future.The extraordinary meeting was a reflection of the swift and sudden change in the political mood between the frenzied last days of an election campaign and the reality of government and the transition of power between two administrations that follows.""My No. 1 priority in the next two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful,"" Obama said.Obama told Trump: ""If you succeed, the country succeeds,"" as the two men sat in high-backed chairs in front of the fireplace in the Oval Office.Trump thanked Obama for the meeting which he said had originally been scheduled for 10 minutes and went on for 90.""Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times,"" Trump said, adding that he and Obama had spoken about some wonderful and difficult things and ""some high-flying assets."" It was not immediately clear what he meant.The President-elect also said he would seek ""counsel"" from Obama.As the pool of reporters were led out, Trump told them several times that Obama was ""a very good man.""Heavy burdenIt comes with many Americans, especially Democrats and liberals, still in disbelief and shock at Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, after the most vicious and unconventional campaign in modern history.The meeting, and Trump's stern demeanor, also underscored how the heavy burden of the presidency begins to settle on the shoulders of a President-elect. In Trump's case, that process will be especially challenging giving that he will be the first president elected with not political, diplomatic or military executive experience.Republican National Committee chairman Reince Preibus, who is being mentioned as a possible chief of staff in Trump's White House, told CNN's Jake Tapper that Americans would appreciate Trump's demeanor in Washington.""I hope that everyone has seen sort of this presidential Donald Trump that we knew all along was up to the task and I think is going to make us all proud,"" Preibus said. Thursday evening, Trump tweeted about the meeting, writing, ""A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!""Smooth transitionIt is also clear that Obama's determination to facilitate a smooth and effective transition, like the one he was provided by outgoing President George W. Bush, is a reflection of his desire not to permit any animosity towards Trump from he or his staff that would detract from his own legacy in the final days of his presidency.The temporary truce between the White House and Trump and his Republican Party however obscures the deep shock, and disquiet about Trump and his temperament inside the White House and among Democrats.CNN's Jim Acosta said one senior White House official responded with a single word -- ""unbelievable"" when asked about Trump's comment that he would seek ""counsel"" from the current President. The official said no one in the White House had changed their mind about Trump, despite their commitment to a smooth political transition.Still, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that given the history between them, the meeting between Obama and Trump in which they were alone in the Oval Office, was ""a little less awkward"" than might be expected and they did not recreate some kind of presidential debate during the talks over their stark political differences.While Trump and Obama met, first lady Michelle Obama spent time with Trump's wife, Melania.Trump's first visit to Washington began as the President-elect began around 10:30 a.m. when the plane emblazoned with his last name landed at Reagan National Airport, marking a new beginning for America.Trump went to meet House Speaker Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill after the White House visit and also saw Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell while in town. Vice President-elect Mike Pence met Vice President Joe Biden.After meeting McConnell, Trump outlined his priorities. ""We'll look very strongly at immigration. We're going to look at the border, very important. We're going to look very strongly on health care. And we're looking at jobs, big league jobs.""While Trump and Obama were meeting, the billionaire's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and communications aide Hope Hicks met senior members of the White House staff.Earnest said that Obama briefed Trump on his last foreign trip -- to Greece, Germany and Peru next week -- and that the President left the talks with ""renewed confidence"" that Trump was committed to a smooth transition.Acrimony on the campaign trailThe symbolism of a President and a President-elect being together is always powerful. But it was especially notable on Thursday given the bitter history between them.Throughout Obama's presidency, Trump persistently sought to undermine the legitimacy of the nation's first African-American presidency by questioning his citizenship and his Christian faith.""He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there's something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim,"" Trump told Fox News in 2011. ""I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that.""The campaign was considered a racial attack by many people close to Obama.When Obama, attempting to put a stop to the falsehood, released his ""long-form"" birth certificate from Hawaii in April 2011, Trump continued to claim it was somehow faked.It took until September 2016 -- two months before a presidential election in which he was already the Republican Party's nominee -- for Trump to admit the reality that Obama was, indeed, born in the United States.And when he did so, it was only in a brief statement with no explanation of why he'd changed his long-held belief, aside from saying in interviews later that he wanted to get the question off the table in the heat of the campaign.Obama has directed his own barbs at Trump, too.  At the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner, with Trump in the audience, Obama mocked Trump's birtherism, in a biting attack that crossed the line between humor and sarcasm into overt personal hostility.""He can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter -- like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"" Obama said of Trump.He also cast Trump as incompetent and unhinged on the campaign trail, citing a New York Times report that Trump's staff had taken his Twitter account away from him after a 3 a.m. rant about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.  ""They had so little confidence in his self-control, they said, 'We are just going to take away your Twitter.' Now, if somebody can't handle a Twitter account, they can't handle the nuclear codes,"" Obama said on Sunday in Florida, and made similar comments in New Hampshire on election eve."

Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight -- with demonstrations outside Trump's properties. While most protesters were peaceful, dozens were arrested. At least three officers were wounded. And about 40 fires were set in one California city. Here's a snapshot of the rallies across the nation: NY: Thousands march outside Trump's homeOn Thursday afternoon, more than 200 anti-Trump protesters marched from the Union Square area to Washington Square Park in Manhattan. Some carried signs with messages such as, ""White men stop ruining everything."" They chanted, ""Trump and Pence make no sense.""  Overnight, about 5,000 people protested the real estate mogul's victory outside Trump Tower, authorities estimated. They included pop star Lady Gaga, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter.Their concerns ranged from policies, such as Trump's proposed plan to build a wall along the US-Mexican border, to the polarizing tenor of his campaign that they say stoked xenophobic fears. ""I came out here to let go of a lot of fear that was sparked as soon as I saw the results,"" protester Nick Powers said in New York. He said he feared Trump will support stronger stop-and-frisk policies that would put many people in prison. Powers said he was also worried that Trump's victory would embolden sexist views. At least 15 protesters at Trump Tower were arrested Wednesday night for disorderly conduct, New York police said. Oakland, California: 40 fires startedAbout 7,000 demonstrators filled streets in Oakland on Wednesday night -- and some turned violent. Protesters hurled Molotov cocktails, rocks and fireworks at police. Three officers were injured, police spokeswoman Johnna Watson said. Trash fires smoldered on a highway, and a downtown business was set ablaze. By Thursday morning, emergency workers extinguished about 40 fires.""Throughout the evening, the large group splintered into smaller groups that began vandalizing numerous businesses in the downtown area,"" Oakland police said. At least 30 people were arrested and 11 citations were issued for vandalism, assaulting officers, unlawful assembly, failure to disperse and possession of a firearm.Three police cars from nearby Pleasanton were damaged, officials said. A few miles away at Berkeley High School, about 1,500 students walked out of classes Wednesday. In San Francisco, more than 1,000 students across the city walked out of the school and headed to the Civic Center to engage in a peaceful protest, according to a tweet from the San Francisco Unified School District.  ""People are furious, not just at the results of the election but the rhetoric of Donald Trump,"" said Ahmed Kanna, an organizer for Social Alternative at Berkeley. Chicago: 'We're taking many steps back'In Chicago, activists marched down Lake Shore Drive -- an eight-lane expressway along Lake Michigan -- toward the Windy City's Trump Tower.""I still can't believe I have to protest for civil rights,"" one sign read. CNN's Ryan Young, who saw a few thousand people there, said many chanted vulgarities toward the President-elect.""As a nation we thought we had come so far, but it seems like we're taking many steps back,"" one woman said. ""We want to come together to change that.""In Omaha, Nebraska, authorities deployed pepper balls on a crowd of more than 200 people protesting Trump's election after they defied police orders to stay out of the streets. Los Angeles: Trump effigy torchedDozens of high school and college students staged rallies near the USC and UCLA campuses. Overnight, more than 1,000 protesters rallied outside Los Angeles City Hall, including many young Latinos.They chanted, ""I will not live in fear,"" ""Fight back, stand up"" and ""¡Si se puede!"" (Spanish for ""Yes, it can be done"").Protesters also set on fire a piñata depicting the head of the President-elect.Several protesters said they feared that family or friends might be deported once Trump takes office. Brooklyn White, an 18-year-old who voted for Clinton, held a sign that said, ""Hate won't win.""  ""We can't let it stop us,"" she said. ""If he's the president, then fine. But if Donald Trump is going to be it, then he has to listen."" As many as 3,000 people joined Wednesday's demonstrations in the city, and 28 people were arrested for running into the 101 Freeway, said Los Angeles police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado. There was some property damage, but it's too early to know the exact extent, she said.Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement, ""I understand that the results of Tuesday's election are painful for many of us, and this kind of engagement can be a meaningful part of the healing we need after such a long and divisive campaign.""But walking and throwing objects onto freeways is dangerous for pedestrians and drivers -- and it puts a heavy burden on people just trying make it home to their families or get to work safely.""Garcetti emphasized that the protests were largely peaceful, but said police would take quick action against those blocking traffic on interstates or vandalizing property, including news media vans. ""There is no place for the destruction of property, for the dangerous stopping of traffic,"" he said at a press conference Thursday. ""Don't lose the message here. The message is that Los Angeles stands as the great hope.""Garcetti said 28 protesters have been arrested.Washington: 'America has failed'Meanwhile, protesters in Washington chanted, ""No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA,"" as they marched downtown to the Trump International Hotel. Elsewhere in the nation's capital, an illuminated sign proclaimed that the US is ""Better Than Bigotry."" ""Everything that has been built up has been destroyed,"" protester Brian Barto told CNN affiliate WJLA-TV. ""America has failed (minorities).""Supporters: Trump an 'agent of change'Trump supporters also rallied, showing their elation outside his current and future homes -- New York's Trump Tower and the White House. Nicholas Elliot, a Georgetown University student, compared Trump's victory to the United Kingdom's Brexit vote to leave the European Union.""I feel pretty good. A year-and-a-half process has ended, and it ended my way,"" the Texan told WJLA.J.D. Vance, author of the book ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" said Trump supporters in middle America voted for him because so few people -- including Clinton or her supporters -- had paid attention to their plight. ""They see Trump as an agent of change and (an) agent of protest against folks who they feel have really failed in government,"" Vance said. Now comes the hard part: finding middle ground, CNN's Marc Preston said. ""All that anger that has been contained outside of Washington, D.C., and New York that we don't see in middle America ... everyone's starting to see it,"" Preston said. ""There is a lot of healing that has got to happen."""	Protesters target Trump buildings in street rallies across the US
