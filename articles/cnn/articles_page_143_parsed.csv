But you won't do that because you'll be so high and so excited that no movie is going to satisfy you, OK? No movie. You know why? Honestly? Because they don't make movies like they used to, is that right?""On what else he could be doing""I could be doing the 'Apprentice' right now. Somehow, and I loved it -- 14 seasons. How good was that? Tremendous success. They wanted to extend. I could be doing the 'Apprentice' now. Somehow I think this is a little bit more important. Do we agree? Just a little bit? ... I didn't need to do this, folks. This is tough work.""On what Clinton is, where she should be and who's protecting her""She could be crazy. She could actually be crazy.""""She should be in prison.""""She's being totally protected by The New York Times and The Washington Post and all of the media and CNN â€” Clinton News Network, which nobody is watching anyways so what difference does it make.""On Clinton's 'stamina'""Here's a woman who's supposed to fight Putin... (Crowd: ""Lock her up! Lock her up!"") ... Everything she has done has been bad ... She has been a disaster. But here's a woman, she's supposed to fight all these different things, but she can't make it 15 feet to her car. Give me a break.""Trump then mocked Clinton's 9/11 memorial episode""Give me a break! She's home resting right now ... Folks, we need stamina. We need energy.""On creative ways to delete emails... and tweets (?)""She lies and lies -- 33,000 emails deleted. Bleached. Acid washed. Then takes her phones and they hammer the hell out of them. How many people have acid washed or bleached a tweet? How many? That you deleted! So you delete it, but that's not good enough. And this is getting crazy. Our country is becoming a third world country.""On Clinton's fidelity to former President Bill Clinton""Hillary Clinton's only loyalty is to her financial contributors and herself. I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, you want to know the truth,"" Trump said without any evidence. ""And really, folks, really, why should she be?"" On Sanders' alliance with Clinton""Bernie Sanders would have left a great great legacy had he not made a deal with the devil. He would have left a great legacy, now he shows up and 120 people come in to hear him talk.""On 'incompetent' and 'sarcastic' Clinton""She's a really sarcastic woman. To sum up -- and I'll tell you the other thing: She's an incompetent woman. And I've seen it. She's an incompetent woman.""On pundits and 'good ground'""You know, in all of the years of this country, they say, even the pundits -- and most of them aren't worth the ground they're standing on, some of that ground could be fairly wealthy ground, good ground, but most of these people say that they have never seen a phenomenon like is going on. We have massive crowds wherever we go.""On the possibility of losing""If we don't win on November 8, I will say -- I don't care what they write, they have to give us a lot of credit, I think they have to give us credit. I will consider it a tremendous waste of time, energy and money.""On what he wants supporters to 'watch' during the vote""You've gotta go out and you've got to get your friends and you've got to get everybody you know, and you've got to watch your polling booths. Because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania. Certain areas. I hear too many bad stories. And we can't lose an election because of you-know-what-I'm-talking-about ... We don't want to lose but we especially don't want to lose for that reason. So go over and... watch. And watch carefully.""On last Monday night's debate""So let's not forget the other night, the recent debate, which I think I won, to be honest with you. Even though they gave me a bum mic. ... the Commission on Presidential Debates. Big fancy name and they gave me a bum mic. ... How many people in this room think that maybe that was done on purpose?"" (Cheers)On a fan in the crowd""I love you, too. (Points at supporter in audience.) It's a guy that said that -- it's a guy. But I love him, too.""On what's at stake""You have 38 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country come true."""	Trump's weekend meltdown	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/mike-pence-syrian-refugees/index.html	"The ruling from a three judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit held that there is ""nothing to suggest that Indiana is a magnet for Syrians."" The opinion, penned by Judge Richard Posner, is critical at times of the arguments put forward by the state noting that it ""provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States.""Posner calls the suggestion ""nightmare speculation."" In stinging language, the court dismissed the state's argument that it has a compelling interest in protecting its residents. And Posner rejects the idea that the policy is based solely on the threat Pence thinks the refugees might pose to the safety of the citizens of Indiana.  ""(Pence) argues that his policy of excluding Syrian refugees is based not on nationality and thus is not discriminatory, but is based solely on the threat he thinks they pose to the safety of residents of Indiana,"" Posner wrote. ""But that's the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they're black but because he's afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn't discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.""He added that the refugees coming from war-torn Syria are required to undergo multiple layers of screening by the federal government.The ruling is a victory for a private agency named Exodus that assists refugees in the state. The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the president to determine how many refugees to admit annually, and in 2016 fixed the number at 85,000, 10,000 of whom came from Syria. To receive federal money, a state submits to the Office of Refugee Resettlement a plan for using the money to assist refugees. Under the plan, the state contracts with a private resettlement agency for the provision of social services. But Pence refused to pay for the services for any refugee whose country of origin is Syria. Without the payments, Exodus would be unable to provide assistance to the refugees. Pence spokeswoman Kara Brooks defended the governor's actions.""The safety and security of the people of Indiana is Gov. Pence's highest priority. The state of Indiana took decisive action last year to suspend resettlement of Syrian refugees after the terrorist attack in Paris and because the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged security gaps with regard to screening refugees from Syria,"" Brooks said. ""In addition, as recently as September 21, the State Department spokesman is quoted as saying he 'wouldn't debate the fact that there's the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves' into the refugee program.""The ACLU praised the ruling. ""A court has once again rejected Indiana's efforts to block the resettlement of Syrian refugees,"" said Omar Jadwat of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights project. ""This ruling is a stinging rebuke of Gov. Mike Pence's anti-refugee actions,"" he said.Posner, who was appointed to the bench by Ronald Reagan, was joined in the unanimous opinion by another Reagan appointee Frank H. Easterbrook as well as Diane Sykes who was nominated by George W. Bush. Sykes was one of the judges listed as a potential Supreme Court nominee by Trump earlier this year."

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/donald-trump-clinton-cybersecurity/index.html	"Trump hewed closely to his script Monday morning, promising as he read from a Teleprompter that he would order a complete review of the US cybersecurity capabilities and prepare offensives against global opponents. And, just a few minutes into his talk before the Retired American Warriors PAC, he shifted to a sharply honed attack on Clinton.""Has anybody put a server in their basement? Oh boy. Hillary Clinton's only experience in cybersecurity involves a criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive coverup and putting the nation in harm's way,"" Trump said. Trump then hit Clinton on questions of whether she knowingly sent classified information through her private email server: ""The fact that a former senator and secretary of state claimed not to know what the letter 'C' means is just one more example of why she is totally unfit to hold the office of the president.""The ""C"" label is a reference to the demarcation of an email as ""confidential,"" and came up during the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state.  The hard-hitting attack on Clinton comes one week after the first debate, where his supporters said they were disappointed that he didn't hit Clinton on her emails. It also follows a disastrous seven-day stretch dominated by an underwhelming debate performance, a feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, early morning Tweet storms and insinuations -- without evidence -- that Clinton cheated on her husband. The rocky stretch was capped with a report late Saturday in The New York Times that found Trump may have avoided paying federal taxes for 18 years."

They argue that a provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional in part because it violates the First Amendment.  Although the justices declined to take up the Redskins appeal, last Friday they announced they would take up a similar case involving an Asian-American rock band -- called ""the Slants"" -- that seeks to register its name. How the Court rules in that case could affect the Redskins.   The government defends the law arguing in briefs that ""the Constitution does not require Congress to open the federal trademark registration system to racial epithets."" According to the government, the sole effect of the law is that various benefits of federal registration would not be available for disparaging marks. The court's decision means that the case will continue in the lower court. It would have been unusual for the court to take up the Redskins appeal because the lower court has yet to rule on the issue.Although the loss of a registration wouldn't strip the team from being able to use the name, it would bar them from federal benefit protections including the right to exclusive nationwide use of the mark."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-response/index.html	"Speaking at a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, the Democratic presidential nominee attacked her Republican opponent as representing ""the same rigged system that he claims he's going to change.""""While millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard and paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that,"" Clinton said. ""In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.""The Times story, Clinton said, ""tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business.""""After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn't lift a finger to protect his employees, or all the small businesses or the contractors he'd hired, or the people of Atlantic City,"" she said. ""They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire.""Donald Trump's weekend meltdownClinton also mocked Trump for his massive losses during the 1990s, saying they undercut Trump's claim that he is a successful businessman who can help revive the US economy. ""Here is my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?"" Clinton said. The New York Times story, which published online Saturday evening, has the potential to be deeply damaging for Trump in the final weeks of the presidential election. Through an examination of portions of Trump's 1995 tax records, the New York Times determined that Trump declared $916 million in losses in his 1995 income tax returns -- ""a deduction that could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years,"" the article stated. The Times did not look at Trump's federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax returns as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns. CNN has not independently verified the documents, but the Trump campaign has not questioned their accuracy.The story offers powerful ammunition to Clinton as the 2016 campaign enters its final homestretch. The former secretary of state has already been highly critical of Trump and his tax returns during the general election. She has gone after the real estate investor for defying the tradition that modern presidential nominees have followed by refusing to release his tax returns (Trump insists it is because his recent returns are under IRS audit, though that does not preclude him from making them public). During the first debate last week, Clinton suggested that Trump was hiding something -- including, potentially, that ""he's paid nothing in federal taxes.""Post-debate, Clinton takes the leadIn Ohio on Monday, Clinton once again suggested that Trump must be covering up something.""You may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades,"" she said. ""What is he hiding? It must be really terrible.""Clinton's top surrogates are also getting in the action. Vice President Joe Biden, campaigning for Clinton in Orlando and Florida on Monday, said: ""(He) says, 'I didn't pay any federal taxes possibly for more than 18 years.' He said, 'that makes me smart.' What does that make the rest of Americans?""Trump went on offense Monday in his first rally since The New York Times story published. Speaking in Pueblo, Colorado, Trump said he has ""brilliantly used"" tax laws to his benefit and downplayed his alleged financial losses from the 1990s.""The news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax violation from the 1990s, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country's history,"" Trump said. Monday marked the first time Clinton has campaigned in Ohio since Labor Day. Recent polls have shown Trump with a small advantage in his heavily white and working-class state. But the Clinton campaign and its allies insist that the state is still within reach, and that Ohio is a must-win for the Republican nominee. As a part of the strategy to appeal to blue-collars workers in this region, Clinton on Monday went after what she called ""egregious corporate behavior"" that undermines the middle-class. One of her prime targets was Wells Fargo and the recent revelation that the bank created a slew of accounts without customers' consent to collect fees. ""Look at Wells Fargo -- really shocking, isn't it?"" Clinton said. ""One of the nation's biggest banks, bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing their personal information and sticking customers with hidden fees."""

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-polls/index.html	The survey finds Clinton topping Trump 47% to 42% among likely voters with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson at 7% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 2%. Clinton's boost in the race stems largely from gains on Trump among men (from a 22-point deficit with that group in early September to just a 5-point one now) and sharply increased support from independents, who broke heavily in Trump's favor in the early September poll but now tilt Clinton, 44% to 37%. Read the full CNN/ORC poll resultsClinton has even gained somewhat among whites without college degrees, who have been among Trump's most ardent supporters. She trails Trump by 21 points among that group now, down from a 44-point chasm in early September.Although most interviews in the survey were completed before Saturday night's revelation that Trump may have avoided income taxes for nearly two decades, the results were clear that about three-quarters of voters think Trump should release his tax returns for public review (73% say so, including about half of Trump's own supporters, 47%).  Poll: 8-in-10 Trump backers say paying taxes is 'civic duty'More respondents also see Trump's refusal to release this taxes as a sign that he's hiding something than that he's under audit from the IRS (57% say he's hiding something, 33% that he's holding back due to an audit). Voters are in near-universal agreement, though, that paying taxes is every American's civic duty. Nearly 9-in-10 feel that way while just 12% say they see taxes as an unnecessary burden to be avoided. Even among Trump backers, 79% see them as a civic duty.The poll, conducted entirely after last Monday's presidential debate, finds Clinton's supporters increasingly enthusiastic about voting for president this year (50% are extremely or very enthusiastic now, up from 46% earlier in the month), while Trump backers' enthusiasm has ticked downward, from 58% to 56%.Some of Clinton's edge in this poll can be attributed to the effects of that enthusiasm shift on the makeup of the likely electorate. In the early-September poll, Clinton's backers were less likely than Trump supporters to be classified as likely voters because of the responses they gave to questions about their interest in the contest, intention to vote, and past vote history. That resulted in a sharp shift to Trump when assessing preferences among likely voters rather than registered voters. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump?This time around, her voters are no less likely than Trump voters to qualify as likely voters.Voters are about evenly split between issues and personal qualities when asked which will be more important in their choice for president, according to the poll, and Clinton gained ground on both sides of that question post-debate.Clinton has narrowed Trump's edge on handling the marquee issues of the economy and terrorism while increasing her edge on foreign policy, immigration and improving life for racial and ethnic minorities. Trump tops Clinton by four points as better able to handle trade with other countries, a topic that was one of few high points for Trump in the debate, while Clinton has the upper hand, narrowly, on several other issues raised in Monday's debate, including taxes (48% Clinton to 46% Trump), the criminal justice system (48% Clinton to 45% Trump), ISIS (48% Clinton to 44% Trump).The debate appears to have worsened voters impressions of Trump personally, 59% of likely voters now see him unfavorably, up from 54% in early September, while Clinton's favorability rating has held fairly steady, standing at 43% favorable to 54% unfavorable.Trump has lost ground against Clinton when registered voters are asked which candidate is the stronger leader, 45% say Clinton is, 43% Trump. Trump held an 8-point edge on that question in early September. Clinton has widened her edge as the one with the right temperament for the job, topping Trump by 27 points on that score now, up from a 20 point lead in early September. She also holds wide leads as better prepared (+22), more in touch with middle class problems (+17), having a clear vision for the country's future (+7) and being better able to handle the responsibilities of commander in chief (+6). Clinton has also narrowed the gap on honesty, and now stands 7 points behind Trump on that, though a sizable 15% say neither is more honest and trustworthy.A stunning 29% of registered voters say neither Trump nor Clinton is a person they admire, about on par with the 30% who see Trump as the more admirable of the pair, behind the 40% who name Clinton as more admired. Among younger voters, a traditionally Democratic group Clinton has struggled to win over, a full 42% say neither candidate is a person they admire, more than name Clinton (37%) or Trump (21%).Confirming the results of the CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers released shortly after the debate ended, the new survey finds about 6-in-10 voters say Clinton did the better job Monday night, just 24% thought Trump did. Among those who said they watched, 63% said Clinton was the victor, about the same as in Monday night's survey.The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 28 through October 2 among a random national sample of 1,501 adults. Results among the 1,213 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. It is 2.5 percentage points among the 1,335 registered voters interviewed.

Trump Hotel executives, according to the report, visited the communist-run island in 1998 to meet with officials there about doing business.""He said it himself,"" a narrator says before Trump's voice says, ""Perhaps there are two Donald Trump's.""The narrator continues: ""Now we know that there are.

The other Donald thinks because of his money and his businesses that he is above the law.""The ad -- which will air only in Florida -- will run in English and Spanish.

""While their parents and grandparents were fighting the Castro regime -- both on and off the island -- Trump was looking to line his pockets, and even worse, those of the Castro brothers.""Clinton argued last week that the Newsweek report shows Trump picking business over country.""We have laws in our country and the efforts that Trump is making to get into the Cuban market, putting his business interests ahead of the laws of the United States and the requirements that the businesses were operating under because of the sanctions shows that he puts his personal and business interests head of the laws and the values and the policies of the United States of America,"" Clinton told reporters.Trump's campaign responded in a statement denying any wrongdoing by the real estate mogul and saying the attack was based on ""manufactured reports are from a totally discredited reporter.""""Mr. Trump has never been to Cuba or did business in Cuba, as he has always respected the embargo and been very critical of Castro.

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/referendum-colombia-brexit-surprise/index.html	"In Greece in 2015, the government, called and lost a referendum on EU and IMF-imposed austerity measures to ease the country's debt crisis, and had to hold a second one having made its proposals more palatable to the electorate. The former British Prime Minister, David Cameron, gambled on settling a 40-year feud within the Conservative Party over membership of the European Union with last June's referendum. Instead he got Brexit and had to resign, dividing the country in the process.""If a referendum can have such a polarizing influence in a place with long democratic traditions like the UK, as we saw with Brexit, imagine the impact in places like Iraq,"" says Neophytos Loizides, Professor of International Conflict Analysis at the University of Kent.In Iraq's 2005 referendum, Sunnis registered in droves to vote down the constitution and give regional autonomy to Shiites and Kurds. They lost and disappointment helped fuel the ethnic and religious fanaticism that has led to the rise of the pro-Sunni Islamic State.Referendums can be so divisive and dangerous many countries don't allow them on a national level. ""You can suppress political division in your party but at some time you have to confront the consequences,"" said Professor Loizides from the University of Kent. What you gain as a political figure you lose later on.""Question of divisionHaving studied the fall of direct democracy in ancient Greece, the founding fathers of the United States who drew up the constitution, decided to allow states to decide for themselves on how they hold referendums. The US does not hold national issues on ballots.Germany has only limited use of referendums, to answer territorial and constitutional reforms.  All others have been banned.  The country has limited their usage citing manipulation by  Adolf Hitler used a public vote made him both Chancellor and President of the country.Loizides says one of the best ways for a government to win a referendum is to position the question so that it becomes more a vote of confidence in the leader to settle an issue rather than the issue itself. This was the case in South Africa in 1992 when FW De Klerk asked whites only to back him to negotiate an end to apartheid. He gained a resounding yes and the rest is history. Referendums can help independence movements as they did in pre-colonial French Africa and in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, and they can quickly turn to ""neverendums"" such as in Scotland which narrowly voted against independence in 2014.""In the case of the Scottish referendum, it is difficult to see how to put the genie back in the bottle. It was billed as a once-in-a-generation event. ""But if all you are in politics for is independence and constitutional change, then you will continue calling for it until you get it -- even -- as was the case in Scotland -- you lost,"" says Tom Harris is a former Scottish Labour MP, who lost his parliamentary seat in 2015 due to a surge in support for the Scottish Nationalist Party.
