1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/politics/obama-asia-pivot-china-laos-trip/index.html	"Obama will meet for the last time with G20 leaders in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, then attend a regional gathering in the reclusive Southeast Asian country of Laos. The stops comprise a six-day valedictory journey that will be the culmination of his effort to shift diplomatic and military muscle from Middle East quagmires to a dynamic region of vast economic potential.""We see this trip as really bringing together a number of the President's top priorities really for the last seven and a half years,"" said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security advisor and co-architect of Obama's Southeast Asia strategy.But the tour is sure to highlight several growing challenges, including a newly assertive China more willing to throw its weight around in maritime security disputes and to nudge up against US air and naval forces in the region.It will be nearly as difficult for Obama to ignore North Korea, with the Stalinist state already threatening to provoke the first crisis of the next president's administration with its accelerating missile and nuclear development.Trade deal founderingAnd then there's the uncertain fate of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a years-in-the-making trade agreement that the Obama administration sees as crucial to anchoring the United States in Asia and ensuring that China does not get to set the rules of the road for regional trade.The pact would create a vast free-trade zone, slash tariffs and harmonize regulation, linking countries in North America, South America, Oceania and East Asia that make up 40% of the global economy.But the pact has been caught up in a backlash against global trade stoked by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in the presidential election. Even Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who as secretary of state enthusiastically backed the TPP, has repudiated it to preserve her political viability.The administration still hopes Congress will ratify the TPP before Obama leaves office in January. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that it can't pass in its current form and will need to be renegotiated by the incoming president.Losing the TPP would not just be a blow to Obama's legacy but would also raise questions about America's long-term commitment to Asia once he has left office.""For America's friends and partners, ratifying TPP is a litmus test of your credibility and seriousness of purpose,"" said Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during a visit to Washington this month.""Asian countries want America to be engaged,"" he said. ""But we need to know that this engagement will be sustained, we need to know that agreements will be upheld, and that Asia can depend on America.""Many Asian nations fear living in a region dominated by China -- and see America's presence as a counterbalance to Beijing's rising power. But if the United States doesn't ratify the TPP, its economic influence in the region is at risk of eroding.""The bullet we won't dodge is when China goes into countries on the front line and says, as they have been saying by the way, 'We are here, we are not going away, you better think twice at what happens when President Obama leaves town,' "" said Michael Green, formerly President George W. Bush's top East Asia policy official and now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Obama's legacy in Asia will not exclusively be settled by the fate of the TPP, however. The White House believes it has reinvigorated US influence in a region whose security it has guaranteed for decades.""As president, I have ... made a deliberate and strategic decision: As a Pacific nation, the United States will play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future,"" Obama told Australian lawmakers in 2011 in a speech laying out his pivot. (The term was later refashioned as a ""rebalance"" after some US allies elsewhere wondered if Washington was deserting them.)Signs of successIndeed, his administration has racked up regional successes.The US inked a major climate pact with China that has added momentum -- and pressure -- for other major countries to follow suit. America helped push once-pariah-nation Myanmar, also known as Burma, out of China's orbit and towards democracy after years of iron-grip military rule.Obama built on the Bush administration's efforts to court India, the one regional power with the strategic potential to balance China. And his administration can claim credit for steady management of US alliances with key Asian allies South Korea and Japan, the latter of which recently made historic shifts to its pacifist post-war constitution for purposes of self-defense.Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, a top foreign policy think tank in Australia, agreed that Obama's policy has had its successes. ""What has happened, though, is the pivot has run out of puff. It has come off of the boil,"" he said, pointing to a second-term foreign policy team less engaged in the region.""The President has been distracted by other issues at home and abroad. The secretary of state is an unbeliever and the Congress and the media are agnostics,"" he said. ""No one could look at US foreign policy and say it is really rebalanced at the moment towards Asia.""But it's not for lack of effort.Obama, who spent four years in Indonesia as a boy, believes the future will be written in a thriving Asia rather than in a diminished Europe or the war-torn Middle East.Obama has invested more time than any other president in working on Southeast Asia's political architecture, frequently attending regional summits. Washington has repaired an estrangement with Malaysia, lifted the decades-old ban on arms sales to Vietnam and patched things up with its old ally the Philippines. A new defense agreement with Manila will see US forces deployed to five bases near the contested South China Sea.Obama has sent US military assets through waters and air space in the South China Sea claimed by Beijing to state the case for freedom of navigation -- even as his critics say he has done too little to respond to the Asian giant's increasingly overt territorial moves.Reassuring alliesTo reassure allies, US Marines have been rotating through the Australian port of Darwin. Meanwhile, Washington plans to operate littoral combat ships out of Singapore and base 60% of its naval strength in Pacific waters by 2020. During a trip to Japan in 2014, Obama reassured his hosts that US treaty commitments to its ally were ""absolute"" amidst rising territorial tensions between Tokyo and Beijing. At a summit in February in California with Southeast Asian leaders, Obama said that the aspirations of ""all nations, large and small"" should be upheld, in a warning to China about its maritime territorial claims.But with Obama in the last few months of his presidency, key Asian powers are worried about the future with the 2016 presidential campaign upending US foreign policy orthodoxies.Obama will be under pressure in Asia to reassure allies alarmed by Trump's questioning of US security commitments to partners in the region and American troop deployments.Though dismayed about Clinton's turn against the TPP, Asian diplomats say she is a far more known quantity in the region and they are confident she would boost the pivot policy and take a tough line on Beijing.China, for its part, has adopted a more confrontational stance partly rooted in the more aggressive personal political style that President Xi Jinping adopted after assuming China's top political and military posts in 2012 and 2013.""There is some evidence to suggest that Xi and the people around him don't feel that the relationship with the US is as important as it might have been,"" said Aaron Friedberg, a former national security aide to Vice President Dick Cheney.Many analysts believe the next president will face little choice but to inject more steel into US dealings with Beijing and expect that with Obama off the stage, China will seek to pose an early test for the new administration."

According to the release, officials have determined the records of about 700 specific voters were accessed, and those people will soon be notified. The board also said that 86,000 records were ""strongly suspected to have been viewed."" The state is in the process of identifying those people to notify them, the release said, but added that just over 3,500 records will be unidentifiable for an unspecified reason. The update also said officials were ""sure"" that ""no records have been altered or changed in any way.""Hackers breach election systemsAfter news broke earlier this week that state election agencies in Illinois and Arizona were targets of hacking, likely by a foreign entity according to a US official, concern grew about a potential impact on elections of cyberattack.But Illinois has lowered its estimate of how many voters' information may have been affected, and the impact has been minimal in both states. Illinois said that of the records accessed, it's possible hackers might have obtained voters' name, address, date of birth, driver's license number or last four digits of their Social Security Number. Voter rolls and state records are attractive targets for hackers, who often make money by stealing personal information of unsuspecting individuals and then selling off those records on the dark web for us in identity theft and financial crime.There were rumors in Arizona that the hack was attributed to a Russian-based source, but the secretary of state's spokesman told CNN it was based on indirect knowledge. Russia and Eastern Europe have a high percentage of the active financially-motivated cybercriminals in the world. The hack had raised extra concerns, however, because attackers believed to be connected to the Russian government hacked Democratic political organizations earlier this year, dumping a trove of emails and documents online in what experts believe is an effort to influence the US election.There has been no indication that the events are related to date.

We're used to it in the Middle East,"" Youssef said. ""You always need something to hold on to, an enemy to direct your hatred to, to cover up your incompetence and cover up your failure.""One year ago Friday, a photo of the body of 3-year-old Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi went viral. Kurdi, who escaped Kobane, Syria, with his family, died and was washed ashore on a Turkish beach after a boat carrying refugees sank in the Mediterranean Sea. The image galvanized the debate over the world's role in aiding Syrian refugees, and has risen to the fore of American politics, as Trump has vowed to send them back from the US to the war-torn nation if he's elected president.US welcomes its 10,000th Syrian refugee head of scheduleYoussef, who knows firsthand what it's like to be an immigrant, is now diving into American politics and satirizing American democracy in ""The Democracy Handbook,"" a web-based show on Fusion, where he seeks to give Americans a Middle Eastern perspective on US politics and challenge mainstream perspectives on the Arab and Muslim world.""I can't even being to express my sorrow and sadness towards those people,"" Youssef said. ""(Leaving their countries) is not a luxury thing for them. This is out of necessity, out of survival.""Youssef urged Trump and those who oppose refugees ""to look at them as human"" and ""understand their sorrow and their agony.""""It is this systematic dehumanization of the other is why we have a negative outlook on refugees,"" he added.A message left with Trump's campaign was not immediately returned Friday afternoon.A target himself""Tickling Giants,"" a documentary that premiered at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival, chronicles Youssef's journey.The heart surgeon turned political satirist hosted the Egyptian TV program ""Al-Bernameg,"" which means ""The Program"" in Arabic. The show was inspired by Stewart's ""Daily Show"" and both Stewart and Youssef made special guest appearances on the others' shows. Check out: #GetPolitical — A CNNPolitics original seriesIn early 2011, when the Arab Spring came to Egypt, thousands rallied in Tahrir Square, where protests led to the ousting of longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.Youssef, a longtime critic of the Egyptian government, quickly became a thorn in the side of the Egyptian government. His show criticized the administration of Muslim Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsy, addressed social taboos and used humor to call out authorities for undemocratic practices. ""I had my share of problems under the Muslim Brotherhood regime and the regime that followed and we ended up being interrogated, jammed, taken off the air once, jammed again, taken off the air twice,"" Youssef said.In 2013, Youssef was accused of insulting Islam and Egypt and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was later released on bail.But following intense pressure from the government, Youssef abruptly announced the suspension of the show in June 2014.Fearing for his own safety and his family's, Youssef left Egypt and moved to the United States. ""Satire is very strong, especially in the face of fear and propaganda because it dissects trough their lies and nonsense, and it give people a more objective view of what's happening,"" Youssef said."

4	4	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/politics/hillary-clinton-book-democratic-party-leftward-shift/index.html	"The 249-page book, which was co-written with her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, is set to be published on Sept. 6 by Simon and Schuster (list price $15.99), the day after Labor Day, the traditional kick-off of the fall campaign. The book -- which includes policy prescriptions on everything from strengthening the economy to defeating ISIS -- is intended to provide a contrast with Donald Trump, whose campaign has been light on policy details.But when read alongside the book that her husband and Al Gore published in 1992, it offers a glimpse into the many ways that the Democratic Party has drifted to the left over the past quarter-century on everything from crime to trade, from Social Security and welfare to Israel and the Middle East.CrimeBill Clinton's ""Putting People First"" declared: ""We need to put more police on the streets and more criminals behind bars"" (p. 71).Hillary Clinton's book, by contrast, calls for reforming the criminal justice system, expanding the use of body cameras, and ending ""the era of mass incarceration.""""We should work together to pursue alternative punishments for nonviolent offenders where appropriate,"" write Clinton and Kaine. ""We don't want to create another 'incarceration generation'"" (p. 198).TradeBill Clinton and Gore promised to ""support a North American Free Trade Agreement"" (p. 156), a pledge he made good on in the White House.The Clinton-Kaine book, by contrast, promises to ""review"" trade agreements like NAFTA that are ""already on the books"" and promises to oppose the controversial Asian trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).""[W]e oppose the TPP -- and that means before and after the election,"" write Clinton and Kaine.Social SecurityThe Democratic Party has also moved to the left on the issue of Social Security -- a shift that is reflected in Clinton's book.Bill Clinton's book promised to ""protect the long-term solvency of Social Security"" (p. 140).Hillary Clinton's book, by contrast, promises to reject ""years of mythmaking claiming we cannot afford Social Security and that the only solution is to cut the benefits on which 90 percent of Americans seniors rely."" (p. 87).Clinton and Kaine propose expanding Social Security for ""those who need it most and who are treated unfairly by the current system -- including women who are widows"" (p. 88)Clinton calls for paying for this expansion of Social Security benefits by ""asking the wealthiest to contribute more"" (p. 88).WelfareAs part of his effort to move the Democratic Party to the center, Bill Clinton made welfare reform a cornerstone of his 1992 presidential bid.""No one who can work should be able to stay on welfare forever,"" wrote Clinton and Gore in their book. (p. 164).Hillary Clinton's book is silent on this front.IsraelThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is another area where the Clinton books diverge.In 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore wrote ""We oppose the creation of an independent Palestinian state"" (p. 123).Writing in 2016, Clinton and Kaine say in their book ""... we refuse to give up on the goal of two states for two peoples."" (p. 125).Health CareOne area where Hillary Clinton's book comes off as more moderate than her husband's is on the issue of health care, a contentious issue that both Clintons wrestled with in the White House.Bill Clinton's book proposed creating a health standards board that would establish an annual health budget for the nation to limit both public and private expenditures.Hillary Clinton, by contrast, does not propose capping national health spending.Instead, she proposes letting people over 55 to buy into Medicare, supporting efforts across 50 states to create a government-run public option, and providing a new ""progressive, refundable tax credit of up to $5,000 per family"" to help with out-of-pocket health-care costs."

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/donald-trump-campaign-changes/index.html	"The Republican nominee hired David Bossie, the president of the conservative political advocacy group Citizens United, as deputy campaign manager to help steer his campaign in the final months of the election, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway confirmed to CNN Thursday.The campaign's hire of Bossie adds several decades of national political experience to Trump's presidential bid, which has faced several weeks of gloomy poll numbers.Trump announced the hire Thursday in an interview with The Washington Post -- an outlet Trump has banned from attending his campaign events as credentialed press -- telling the newspaper that Bossie has been ""a friend of mine for many years.""""Solid. Smart. Loves politics, knows how to win,"" Trump said in the interview.Bossie has already begun delving into his work with the campaign, attending a series of campaign meetings Thursday at Trump Tower, a source told CNN.The campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton quickly blasted Bossie's hiring, harkening back to his service on a House investigative committee 20 years ago. ""David Bossie is so craven and maniacal that in the heyday of the overreaching, Gingrich-era Congress, the top Whitewater conspiracy theorist in the House had to fire him for doctoring evidence,"" Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta said in a statement.Bossie, Podesta added, ""has devoted his career ever since to trying to tear down Hillary Clinton. For months now, Citizens United has been acting as an arm of the Trump campaign, and this hiring of Bossie now makes it official. This is just the latest sign that Donald Trump has put the most extreme elements of the right-wing fringe in the driver's seat of his campaign.""Bossie's hire came as three sources told CNN that Rick Gates, the right-hand man to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, is expected to leave the campaign.Gates declined to comment on the news, which was first reported by Politico, and Conway said in a text message ""Gates still (Republican National Committee) liaison."" In a follow-up interview, she added that Gates will work out of both the RNC and Trump campaign headquarters.Gates' departure would come nearly two weeks after Trump's senior communications adviser Jason Miller announced on Twitter that Gates had been named the campaign's liaison to the RNC, just hours after Manafort resigned from the campaign.His potential exit did not come as as a shock to campaign insiders who have said Gates would likely leave with Manafort gone, but it's unclear why Gates was named the campaign's liaison to the RNC under those circumstances. It also was not immediately clear why Gates would leave the campaign.Last month, Trump's campaign added Conway and former Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon as campaign CEO."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/donald-trump-doctor-harold-bornstein/index.html	"When asked if Trump has the physically capability of being president, Dr. Harold Bornstein told CNN's Drew Griffin on Thursday, ""Absolutely, no question about it.""Bornstein, a 69-year-old New York City gastroenterologist, has been Trump's physician for more than three decades and came under scrutiny for an unusual letter he wrote in 2015 describing Trump's physical health, which other doctors have said includes strange wording, medically incorrect terms and an unprofessional conclusion.Trump's lab ""test results were astonishingly excellent,"" he wrote, mimicking the grandiose verbiage of his candidate-patient. ""If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.""Bornstein told CNN that he was rushed for time when writing the letter since he had patients to see. ""The only thing I wanted to do in my life is practice with my father, which I managed to do for 35 years.""  RELATED: Trump's doctor: Trump 'will be healthiest individual ever elected' presidentBornstein told CNN that his father started his medical practice at the same Park Avenue office location in 1947. Trump was first under the care of his father Dr. Jacob Bornstein, according to the letter. Harold Bornstein joined the practice in 1980, and when his father passed away in 2010, continued it.When asked if he had any regrets about getting involved in the presidential election, Bornstein said, ""No. My patients, I take care of them the right way.""The CNN interview was cut short when Dr. Bornstein's wife approached, and covered the camera with her hand. Bornstein had warned it might happen. ""My wife will come back, she'll get angry,"" he said as the interview began.At least four medical malpractice lawsuits have been filed against Dr. Harold Bornstein in the state of New York dating back to 1986.In a 1999 lawsuit, New York resident Kenneth Levin accused Bornstein of negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat his wife by ""overmedicating"" her with prescription drugs and not following proper medical procedures, which Levin argued led to her death.The case argues Bornstein ""prescribed unnecessary barbiturates and other drugs to the decedent with full knowledge that these medications were not necessary"" and that some were ""greatly in excess of appropriate dosages.""RELATED: Clinton's health is fine, but what about Trump?Bornstein denied the allegations and settled the case in 2002 for $86,000 with no finding of liability.Another case charged both Bornstein and his father of recklessness in overdosing and improperly performing a colonoscopy on Vincent Pollifrone, which the case argued led to his death in 2000. The case was disposed in 2006, after the defendants denied the claims.The plaintiff's lawyer in that case, Joseph Miklos, told CNN the parties signed a confidentiality agreement so he could not discuss the terms of any settlement.When asked about the lawsuits Thursday, Bornstein defended his credentials and said the number of malpractice suits he has faced is ""normal.""Professor David Studdert of Stanford University, an expert on health law who has tracked data on medical malpractice lawsuits, said gastroenterologists such as Bornstein have about a 10% chance of facing a new medical malpractice suit each year.""Over a career, it would be the norm rather than the exception that a gastroenterologist would have a few claims filed against him. That's not an outlier situation,"" Studdert said.Dr. G Kevin Donovan, a bioethicist at Georgetown University Medical School, agrees that the existence of four disposed malpractice suits does not provide enough information to draw conclusions about Bornstein, but he said Bornstein's letter describing Trump's health is light on detail and heavy on bombast.RELATED: Trump's health care plan: What he promises and what it really says Donovan said most physicians ""don't use that kind of hyperbole for a medical statement.""Donovan added that most letters written by doctors for presidential candidates contain a level of subjectivity since candidates select the doctors who write their assessments and can stipulate what information they include.""They can only tell us what the candidate allows them to reveal,"" Donovan said, adding, ""Is it likely that a candidate would go to a physician that would not speak well of them?""Former patients and a classmate of Bornstein reached by CNN described him as competent yet eccentric.New York resident Roger Friedman, who said he was a patient of Bornstein's in the 80's and early 90's, said he was surprised when he recently heard Bornstein had treated Trump for decades.""He was a good doctor but he was peculiar, disorganized, and not at the level you expect for a billionaire,"" Friedman said. Angelina Kaiserman, a New York jeweler who told CNN she has been in Bornstein's care for more than 20 years, said, ""Honestly I give him five stars.""Dr. Edward Hurwitz, who attended medical school with Bornstein at Tufts University in the class of 1975, remembers Bornstein making sarcastic comments in class and often writing elaborate poems with colorful language he would share with friends.""He was snide with his comments but he was certainly smart,"" Hurwitz said."

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/presidential-poll-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election/index.html	The Franklin and Marshall College poll finds Clinton ahead of Trump 47% to 40% among likely voters, which represents a slight decline from a similar poll taken just after the Democratic National Convention (when she led 49% to 38%). The new numbers are consistent with another Pennsylvania poll from this week -- a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday found Clinton leading Trump 48% to 40%. But in a four-way matchup including third-party candidates, Clinton's lead narrows to 41% over Trump's 38%, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 7% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 2%. The poll also has a much higher share of undecideds than other polls do at this stage, with 13% say they don't know who they would support. Clinton's favorability has suffered a steep decline from her post-convention bounce. The new poll finds Clinton with a 38% favorable/54% unfavorable rating among registered voters, down from 47% favorable/49% unfavorable in July.  Trump, though, fares slightly worse -- he is viewed favorably by 37% of registered voters in Pennsylvania, compared to 58% who say they have an unfavorable opinion. According to the poll, Clinton and Trump run about even when voters are asked who will better handle the economy and protect the US from terrorism. But Clinton is viewed as better prepared to be president and better able to handle foreign policy. Trump is performing well among his key base of support in rust-belt states like Pennsylvania -- he beats Clinton handily among white voters with a high school degree or less, 52% to 35%. But Clinton reverses Trump's advantage among white voters with a college education, leading that group 50% to 29%. And while Trump wins white men, 41% to 38%, that is offset in part by Clinton winning white women by a larger margin, 45% to 38%. The Franklin and Marshall College poll of Pennsylvania was conducted between August 25 and 29, and surveyed 736 Pennsylvania registered voters and 496 likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 points for registered voters, and plus or minus 5.6 points for likely voters.

Two other polls released this week -- by Monmouth and Quinnipiac Universities -- showed Clinton with 7-point leads.In a two-way race without Johnson and Stein, Fox finds Clinton's lead extends to six points, 48% to 42%. That is narrower than the 10-point lead that Fox said Clinton had following the Democratic National Convention.Fox's polls are included in those used by the Commission on Presidential Debates to determine whether either of the third-party candidates meet the 15% threshold needed to win a spot on the stage next month.Despite Trump's recent outreach to voters of color, Clinton holds commanding leads with African Americans and Hispanics, Fox finds. Clinton leads Trump with black voters by 68 points in the four-way ballot test, and by 19 points with Latino voters.Fox surveyed 1,011 registered voters, and the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
