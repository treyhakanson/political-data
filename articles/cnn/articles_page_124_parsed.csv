Tammy Duckworth, who is running for the Senate. ""I don't need to repeat it. There are children in the room.""Obama -- while appearing perturbed by the comments -- said that Trump's ""demeaning"" and ""degrading"" statements were not limited to women but at minorities, immigrants, the disabled and veterans. Trump eyes debate to rescue faltering campaign""It tells you that he's insecure enough that he pumps himself up by putting other people down. Not a character trait that I would advise for somebody in the Oval Office,"" Obama told the audience, adding Trump ""doesn't care much about the basic values that we try to impart to our kids."" Obama's comments come just hours before Trump will face off against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, in the second presidential debate. Trump released a defiant apology for comments that came to light Friday in a Washington Post story.The President also focused his remarks on Democrats winning the Senate, stumping for Duckworth -- an Iraq War Veteran --who is up for the seat Obama once held as a senator.""Are we really going to risk giving Donald Trump the majority he needs to roll back all the progress we've made over the last eight years?"" he asked.Obama spent much of the weekend focusing on the election in his home state of Illinois. On Friday, the President cast an early vote in Chicago and fundraised for Clinton and other Democrats. ""In case you hadn't noticed, the stakes in this election are extraordinary,"" Obama said at a Democratic fundraiser Friday. ""I'm confident that we will have an incredibly capable successor in the White House, by the name of Hillary Rodham Clinton. When I say I'm confident, I'm not over confident. We've still got a lot of work to do."""	Obama: Donald Trump comments 'disturbing'	['Duckworth', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/inside-politics-forecast-trump-tower-palace-intrigue/index.html	"It's all a part of this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast, where you get a taste of tomorrow's news today. 1) Is 'I'll never quit' a negotiation ploy? Does ""never"" mean never? An embattled Donald Trump says he won't quit the race, but some allies of the Republican nominee aren't so sure. ""I think it is all a negotiation ploy,"" one Trump campaign official told CNN as the candidate vowed to ignore mounting Republican calls for him to drop out after a leaked tape revealed him making vulgar comments about women. ""Never signal you are willing to give up out of the box."" What? An ""Art of the Deal"" move by Trump? Sounds nuts, right? But amid the madness of Saturday's news we got a note from another longtime Trump friend reminding us that Trump is on record saying if the polls tanked he might quit the race, and raising the prospect that the candidate might be looking for an exit ramp if Sunday night's second debate goes poorly. The first source has known Trump only for the course of the campaign; the second for decades. They don't know each other. Yet in separate exchanges they both volunteered the idea that Trump might be open to negotiating a withdrawal if things go badly in St. Louis. And both added this: that perhaps the price would be a Republican party repayment of the personal funds Trump has poured into his campaign. To be clear, both said they view this as a remote possibility, not a likely turn of events. But that two very different people, with very different relationships with Trump, would suggest that ""never"" could be the first play in a negotiation was striking.2) Nevada's Heck makes a risky bet  Listening to Trump brag about forcing himself on women was the last straw for many Republicans, including several in close Senate races. Among those was Nevada congressman Joe Heck, who on Saturday forcefully called on Trump to step aside. For Heck it was a big switch after months of tolerating other controversial Trump statements. And, as CNN's Maeve Reston notes, a big risk.  ""Dr. Joe Heck, who's in a very tight Senate race,  went out on stage yesterday and denounced Donald Trump and got booed over and over again. Now, of all the people who came out against Trump after this tape, I think that for Heck this has maybe one of the biggest gambles. Because Nevada is a state that has been very kind to Donald Trump.""3) Clinton's poll ceiling It will take several days to get a good sense of how Trump's taped comments impact the presidential campaign. And the second debate will also be a factor, regardless of how much Trump's offensive remarks come up.            The biggest test will be where Trump stands in the polls by the end of the week. But Dan Balz of The Washington Post said the flip side is equally, if not more, important. Balz says another key question is whether this episode allows Hillary Clinton to move past the poll ceiling she has had so far throughout the race. ""If it's a good week for Donald Trump he goes up [in the polls], and if it's a bad week for Hillary Clinton she goes down, and vice versa,"" explains Balz.""People, particularly Democrats, are wondering whether this moment -- this tape -- will finally break that cycle. That she will be able to push beyond the margin that she hasn't been able to top ... the four-to-five-point range, and go even higher. That's the thing that everyone's going to be looking over the next couple weeks.""4) Ohio as test case It was just a few weeks ago that some Democrats were ready to write off Ohio as a target state for Clinton. But the first debate changed that. Some polls show her moving to a narrow lead in the Buckeye State. It's near impossible to draft a Trump path to 270 electoral votes without Ohio. So now that the tape of Trump bragging about groping women is in the campaign mix, Glenn Thrush of Politico suggests Ohio could be a prime test case of its impact. ""Ohio has been really kinda the bulwark of Trump's Midwestern strategy, where obviously we have seen some pretty significant defections on the  part of women as a result of this tape. Hillary had surged ahead by one or two points in some recent polling,"" says Thrush. ""I would just love to see if her improvement in that state is accelerating, because if it is, it's lights out (for Trump)."" 5) Help for Hillary The nuts and bolts phase of the campaign is upon us, and Hillary Clinton is getting some help from some progressive friends. CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson shared details of separate pushes by Planned Parenthood and The Human Rights Campaign to identify and turn out Clinton supporters in these final 30 days before the November 8 election. ""The Planned Parenthood $30 million effort -- this is all in swing states, particularly targeting millennial voters. In terms of the HRC, they are very much targeting swing states as well,"" Henderson says. ""This goes to show the organizational strength, I think, of the left compared to the right, which is very much in shambles right now in terms of figuring out how to support Donald Trump."""

In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union,"" Tapper asked Kaine if his running mate really desires ""a hemispheric common market with open borders sometime in the future,"" as was written in a transcript of a 2013 closed-door speech she apparently gave to Brazilian bankers that was included in one of the hacked emails.WikiLeaks is alleged to have ties to Russia. The group posted more than 2,000 emails from campaign chairman John Podesta and promises to post more from the over 50,000 the group says it can access.Clinton's Democratic primary challenger, Bernie Sanders, made the release of Clinton's paid speech transcripts a major point of criticism during his campaign, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Friday the documents exposed Clinton as a ""fraud.""The Clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the documents but has not disputed the contents.""I have no way of knowing the accuracy of documents dumped by this hacking organization,"" Kaine told Tapper. ""Anybody who hacks in to get documents is completely capable of manipulating them.""Kaine then explained Clinton's current policy stance on trade, saying it focuses on three criteria: ""Do they increase American jobs, do they increase American wages, and are they good for national security?""But when Tapper pressed Kaine on whether the passage on ""open borders and free trade,"" was what she told Brazilian bankers, Kaine deflected by saying, ""I have no way of knowing that.""""Well, you could ask her,"" Tapper replied.Kaine said: ""Jake, I have no way of knowing the accuracy of documents dumped by this hacking organization.""Tapper said: ""That's fair. Is the document, then, is it accurate?""""I have no way of knowing that,"" Kaine said.Tapper concluded by asking Kaine if a Clinton-Kaine administration would push for open borders, to which Kaine responded by saying the ticket supports ""comprehensive immigration reform,"" explaining that they favor a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants.CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify what Tapper was asking Kaine with regard to Clinton's alleged ""open borders"" remark"	Kaine struggles to answer question on hacked Clinton emails	['Clinton', 'Kaine']	[]

""I think it's time for Donald Trump to answer and take responsibility.""The town hall debate, which will be moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC's Martha Raddatz, will have 100 undecided voters in attendance who will have the opportunity to ask questions of the candidates.""I just can't imagine that undecided voters as part of this town hall will not want to hear him explain why he thought that was acceptable behavior,"" Kaine said.What to watch in the second presidential debateAsked about the newly released audio of a 2005 conversation in which Trump brags about being to grope women and get away with it, Kaine said: ""It is not just words; it is talking about a pattern of sexual assault.""""There's plenty of evidence that this is exactly who Donald Trump is today, and by this, I mean divisive and cavalier in his treatment of others, and with respect to women in particular. What this shows at its base is that he cannot consider women as his equals,"" Kaine told Tapper. ""I think there's kind of a piece of the jigsaw puzzle missing in Donald Trump where he does not look at women and consider them equal to himself.""Asked by Tapper if Kaine had any evidence of ""a pattern of sexual assault,"" Kaine replied, ""My understanding is that there are stories in some papers today with individuals basically saying that they were subject to exactly the treatment that he describes on the tape. So this would be a question for Donald Trump to answer.""If he says, 'I may have said those things but I never did them,' that's one thing, but I think the tape raises an awful lot of questions, and if you take that tape as Donald is actually describing his actions, then yeah, it is a pattern of assaultive behavior and it's much more than words,"" Kaine continued.Since the tape was released on Friday, many GOP leaders and elected officials have rescinded their support for the Republican nominee, with some calling for him to pull out of the race.""People ought to be asking, 'Do you still think he is qualified to be president of the United States and do you still support him?'"" Kaine said about Republicans. ""Anyone who has not stated where they are on that question needs to answer.""Trump eyes debate to rescue faltering campaignClinton has remained mum on the topic since the audiotapes were released. She has been preparing for the debate near her home in Westchester, New York, and has not publicly spoken since the news broke.Kaine was pressed by Tapper on what Clinton will say about Trump's comments at the debate, but he declined to answer and simply said that Clinton will speak about issues such as the economy and national security."

""You look at it, they were all Republicans who all opposed him and didn't support him in the past and this is basically the insiders against the outsiders anyway.""Giuliani has played a large role in helping prepare Trump for Sunday's debate in St. Louis and was at Trump Tower advising him.Since the 2005 audio surfaced, many leading Republicans have rescinded their support for their party's nominee, with some calling for him to leave the race entirely.Among those who have called for Trump to withdraw are Arizona senator and 2008 nominee John McCain and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Some, including John Thune, the No. 3 Senate Republcian, have said vice presidential nominee Mike Pence should instead lead the ticket.Giuliani brushed off their pleas.""Donald Trump is the populist candidate. Most of the people that have turned on him are members of the establishment, so I would see this as if you want change in Washington, you vote for Donald Trump. If you want things the same, you vote for Hillary Clinton,"" Giuliani said.When asked if Trump is considering dropping out, Giuliani responded by saying, ""There is nothing that is going to cause his dropping out. He's in the race to win and he's going to win."""	Giuliani not surprised Republicans backing away from Trump	['Pence', 'Trump', 'McCain']	[]

9	9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/utah-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-voting/index.html	"The Deseret News, which has not issued a presidential endorsement in 80 years, on Saturday called on Trump to leave the race, after a 2005 video emerged of him making lewd and sexually aggressive remarks. ""The idea that women secretly welcome the unbridled and aggressive sexual advances of powerful men has led to the mistreatment, sorrow and subjugation of countless women for far too much of human history,"" the editorial board wrote. ""What oozes from this audio is evil. We hear a married man give smooth, smug and self-congratulatory permission to his intense impulses, allowing them to outweigh the most modest sense of decency, fidelity and commitment.""The condemnation follows a swath of Utah GOP office-holders saying they won't vote for Trump, with some calling him to exit the contest against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Gov. Gary Herbert and Rep. Jason Chaffetz -- a leading Clinton critic in Congress -- both disclaimed support for the GOP nominee on Friday night. Republican senators, House members and governors from across the country followed Saturday with similar statements. Whether that signals a rank-and-file Republican voter groundswell against Trump remains an open question. Utah, where about 60% of residents are members of the Church of Latter-Day Saints, is among the most Republican states in presidential elections. It hasn't backed a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson's landslide over Barry Goldwater in 1964. ""Even with all his problems, Trump still has enormous advantages simply by virtue of being the Republican nominee,"" said Brigham Young University political science professor Chris Karpowitz. ""The question is, how large is the group of Utah Republicans who will stay with the Republican nominee no matter what -- even when he behaves in ways that are clearly at odds with the state's core values and the values Utah Republicans have claimed to champion? We're going to test that question this year.""But this weekend's turn against Trump by Utah GOP leaders suggests Clinton may yet be in a position to nab the state's six electoral votes. It's hardly a new concept. Trump's vulgarities -- in addition to certain policy positions like on immigration -- have been thought to be particularly politically toxic in socially conservative Utah. ""This has been a reliably red state for a very long time,"" said Jason Perry, director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah. ""People are going to kind of really pull away from what support he had. And the third-party candidates are likely to get more support."" Longshot Clinton targetUntil a month or so ago, there was serious chatter about Clinton being able to nab a Utah win. Trump himself mused about the notion of losing the otherwise reliably Republican state. He said in an August speech his campaign was ""having a tremendous problem in Utah."" That had died down of late, after September saw a series of Clinton campaign stumbles and Trump's position in the race seemed to stabilize. But that's all likely now out the window with the Deseret News' chastisement of Trump, on top of his already shaking standing in the state, Perry said.Even Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a strong social conservative, isn't likely to help anymore. ""Mike Pence was a mitigating factor. But people are now not willing to rationalize Trump"" after the video became public, Perry said. That's where the third- (and fourth-) party candidates come in. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson's campaign is based in Utah, and he seems to enjoy at least some residual goodwill from his eight years as a Republican governor of New Mexico, a nearby western state. Then there's conservative-leaning independent Evan McMullin, who in recent months has made direct appeals to #NeverTrump Republicans. The Utah native and Mormon Church member -- a Brigham Young University graduate -- has the potential to further siphon off support from Trump. Even those advantages for Clinton may still leave her short in Utah. Her unfavorably ratings in Utah are high, and the Clinton brand has never been particularly popular there. Bill Clinton finished third in Utah in his 1992 White House race, behind Republican President George H.W. Bush and Independent Ross Perot. Yet Hillary Clinton still has a shot this year. She's unlikely to build a whole lot more support in Utah, but she could possibly squeak through if a fair number of rank-and-file Republicans simply don't vote for Trump.""We will not see voters in Utah turn to Hillary Clinton en masse -- Utah voters see her very unfavorably, too,"" Karpowitz said. ""But disgust with the statements themselves and the signal from state political leaders that Trump has gone too far are likely to hurt him significantly. Whether it's enough to swing the election to Clinton is uncertain, given that it's a four-way race.""She could try to run up the score in Salt Lake City, a majority non-Mormon city that backed Barack Obama in 2008. A growing Latino community -- more than 20% of the city's population according to 2010 census figures -- provide ripe opportunities for the Clinton campaign to pick off votes. Even small-but-growing pockets of African-American and Asian-American voters could help. Prominent anti-Trump RepublicansThe disavowal of Trump by Chaffetz is particularly notable. As chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, he's been a leading Clinton critic over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, and her conduct in the 2012 Benghazi attacks, among other matters. Yet he and Herbert are not the only prominent Utah Republicans already in the anti-Trump camp.That list includes Sen. Mike Lee, normally an ideological compatriot of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who withheld his endorsement from primary rival Trump, but has since backed him. And Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, for months one of the most vocal Trump critics from within the Republican fold. On Saturday morning, a Republican senator from a neighboring state, Mike Crapo of Idaho, a Mormon, also pulled his support from Trump.""The Republican leadership in Utah is in a full-scale revolt against Donald Trump,"" said Karpowitz. ""In my lifetime, we've never seen state-level party leaders abandon a Republican nominee like this.""Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who now lives in Utah at least part-time and is Mormon, has also conspicuously blasted Trump throughout the presidential season. He did so again Friday about the latest revelations.""Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world,"" Romney tweeted. Whether this all works to Clinton's advantage in Utah remains an open question, Karpowitz said. ""If we assume that Clinton's support is fairly stable and ranges somewhere between 25-35%, it wouldn't take much of a shift to make the race essentially a four-way dead heat,"" he said. ""But all of this is uncertain because we're in completely uncharted territory. We've simply never seen anything like this before at the presidential level.""But the notion that Utah is even competitive is not good news for Trump 31 days out from the election. The Deseret News editorial spelled out challenges he faces over the next month. ""This is one of those rare moments where it is necessary to take a clear stand against the hucksterism, misogyny, narcissism and latent despotism that infect the Trump campaign,"" the paper wrote. ""Even as we hope for a more auspicious future of liberty, prosperity and peace for the nation."""
