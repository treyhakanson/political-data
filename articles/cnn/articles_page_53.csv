Earlier in the day, words describing Trump in derogatory terms were painted on a wall at the office.Jefferson County, Colorado, underscores Trump's rocky chancesDenver Police Department spokesman Tyrone Campbell said a possible suspect was being held in connection with the latest incident. ""We are investigating a second incident of vandalism in the city at Donald Trump's office,"" he said.  ""The first vandalism case occurred Friday morning and both cases are under investigation for criminal mischief. 'The person being held had not been identified late Friday.CNN has attempted to contact the Trump campaign for a comment.Contest often has been heated Friday's incident was the latest in a number involving property associated with both Trump and  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during an often heated race for the White House.The front entrance of Trump's new Washington hotel was vandalized with spray-painted messages which read ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice No Peace.""Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college mapClinton, who has met with Black Lives Matter protesters, told a presidential debate audience that Trump ""has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.""In another incident, Trump's star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame was defacedWhite powder was mailed to Clinton's campaign office in New York.

After headlining a concert with Jay Z and Beyoncé on Friday night in Ohio, Clinton and her press corps traveled to Florida, arriving after 1 a.m. ET.In addition to the rally, Clinton visited two early voting sites around Miami.It had been raining on-and-off at Clinton's rally in the Broward County, but as Clinton took the stage, the rain appeared to stop.But minutes into her speech, a drizzle began and by the time she finished, the rain was falling sideways, including onto the Democratic nominee.""My friends, you are a hearty bunch standing out here in the rain. I don't think I need to tell you all of the wrong things about Donald Trump,"" Clinton said near the close of her speech. ""I want to be the president for everybody, everybody who agrees with me, people who don't agree with me, people who vote for me, people who don't vote for me.""With that, Clinton closed her speech.The short speech did not dampen the mood of people in the audience, and many were laughing as they sought shelter after Clinton stopped speaking. But the shortened event will change the way the event gets covered Sunday in Florida, a way Clinton's campaign gauges the success of each visit.The event is Clinton's last on her schedule in Florida, her most-visited state since she claimed the Democratic nomination in July, though it's still possible she could return before Tuesday.Clinton has spent 13 days campaigning in Florida since the July convention, including seven in the last two weeks.The state, aides say, is critical to Clinton's success on Election Day. If Clinton wins the Sunshine State, Trump's path to victory is significantly limited.A CNN/ORC poll released earlier this week showed Clinton and Trump statistically tied in the state."

""I want my daughter to grow up seeing a women lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless,"" said Beyonce, sporting a black-and-white polka dot pantsuit. ""And that's why I am with her."" Her performance was backed by dancers in blue pantsuits, an obvious reference to Clinton.The Cleveland concert, meant to drive up turnout among young people in Ohio, was announced weeks ago, but only as a Jay Z performance, not a joint appearance with his wife.Cuyahoga County, Ohio, could be Clinton's bright spot""We have unfinished business to do,"" Clinton told the audience after the concert. ""More barriers to break and with your help, a glass ceiling to crack once and for all!""Clinton came out after a duet by Jay Z and Beyonce. In her short speech, Clinton quoted something the iconic rapper said during his 2008 performance for then-Sen. Barack Obama.""And remember,"" Clinton said, ""Jay memorably said something we should all recall: Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk. And Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could ran. And Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly!""No one mentioned Donald Trump by name on stage, but multiple performers made mention of his candidacy.""This other guy, I don't have any ill will ... he cannot be my president,"" Jay Z said. ""He cannot be our president. Once you divide us, you weaken us, we are stronger together. And without further ado, I would like to introduce to you the next president of the United State, Miss Hillary Clinton.""CBS News first reported that Beyonce would appear at the Cleveland event.Beyonce has long been a Clinton supporter. She attended a Clinton fundraiser in New York City in 2015, but Friday night was the first time Beyonce has performed for Clinton.Jay Z has been slow to back Clinton, especially considering how close he has been with President Barack Obama. The rapper even said in 2009 that he texts with the President, which Obama denies.On Friday night in Cleveland, though, it was clear that the married duo -- and their special guests - were firmly behind Clinton.""It doesn't really matter who I am. I am here to celebrate our next and first woman president,"" Chance the Rapper said during his set. ""She is running this battle right now, she is killing this race, but see needs all of our help.""""Middle fingers up. You know who they are for,"" Big Sean said during his performance.The concert also served another purpose -- to collect voter information. Tickets to the concert were free, and one of the distribution sites was across the street from the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections. The information collected can then be used to text potential voters to cast their ballots early or remind them to vote on Election Day.Voters said being associated with Jay Z and Beyonce will help Clinton.""People are excited for the concert and they know exactly who it is for,"" said Olufunke Buraimoh, a 27-year-old medical student at Kent State. ""The opportunity to share with other people gets them excited to vote for her.""Buraimoh says she has long been a Clinton supporter. ""There is not an option to not vote,"" she said.Trump, rallying voters in Hersey, Pennsylvania, as the Clinton concert began, bragged about filling a stadium without special guests.""I hear we set a new record for this building, and by the way, I didn't have to bring J-Lo or Jay Z,"" he said. ""I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar. No piano. No nothing.""Clinton's campaign has turned to a number of high-profile celebrities -- and concerts -- to spur young people to vote.Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony performed at a concert with Clinton in Miami on Saturday, Miley Cyrus knocked on doors at George Mason University last month and Katy Perry, who will perform with Clinton on Saturday night in Philadelphia, campaigned in Las Vegas last month.Jay Z and Beyonce urged voters to head to the polls on Tuesday to close out the event.""We have to think about the future of our daughters, our sons and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do,"" she said. ""If you are ready for freedom, make some noise."""	Jay Z, Beyonce headline concert for Clinton

We will work with our Afghan partners to investigate and determine the facts and we will work with the government of Afghanistan to provide assistance.""Afghan forces, advised by the US military, conducted the operation Thursday in the village of Boz in Kunduz district, the statement said. It targeted Taliban leaders planning attacks in the city of Kunduz.""During the course of the operation, friendly forces encountered significant enemy fire from multiple locations and defended themselves with ground fire and US air-to-ground engagements,"" the US military statement said.""Initial reports indicate that several Taliban leaders and Taliban members were killed in the engagement.""Civilians, troops killedAt least 30 Afghan civilians were killed and 25 others injured in an air-and-ground operation launched in an area known as Bohd Qhandahari, said Sayed Mahmood Danish, a Kunduz provincial spokesman.Four members of Afghan special forces were also killed and six others injured, Danish said. Twenty-six insurgents were killed and 10 others were wounded, he added.The Pentagon identified the dead US service members as Capt. Andrew D. Byers, 30, of Rolesville, North Carolina, and Sgt. 1st Class Ryan A. Gloyer, 34, of Greenville, Pennsylvania. They were assigned to Company B, 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort Carson, Colorado.The troops came under fire during what the US military said this week was a mission to train, advise and assist its Afghan partners in clearing a Taliban position and disrupting the organization's operations in Kunduz district.

5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/hillary-clinton-michigan-donald-trump/index.html	"Clinton will make her second visit to Michigan in four days when she campaigns in Grand Rapids on Monday, the day before the election. Clinton has so far only spent four days campaigning in Michigan since the Democratic National Convention in July, a number that pales in comparison to the 13 days she has spent in Florida and the 10 days in Ohio.President Barack Obama will also campaign in Ann Arbor -- home to the University of Michigan -- on Monday, looking to boost millennial voters the day before Election Day.The trips reflect a growing concern that Michigan could land in Donald Trump's column on Tuesday.""The numbers there have tightened,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said Saturday, adding later that the tightening has been seen throughout the Midwest.""We're taking that seriously,"" he said.A recently released Detroit Free Press poll found that Clinton is up 4 points in Michigan, 42% to Trump's 38%.Clinton's campaign has leaned heavily on its ground game to turn out voters early in key swing states, trying to ""bank"" votes before Election Day. The campaign has particularly seen early voting gains in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. Some aides are quietly confident that, given the turnout figures in Nevada so far, the state could already be in Clinton's column. Most voters in Michigan, though, cast their ballots on Election Day, adding a level of volatility to the state that worries Clinton aides.Michigan has been a thorn in Clinton's side throughout the 2016 campaign. Clinton lost to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Wolverine State's March 8 primary after campaigning for the better part of a week in the state. Aides at the time chalked up the loss to the state's predominantly white population, and Clinton bounced back to win the nomination, but the loss was arguably the most stinging of Clinton's primary run.Mook dismissed the idea that reluctant Sanders supporters were the reason for Clinton's current concerns in Michigan.But Trump's base of non-college-educated white voters has been a stronghold in the Midwest throughout the 2016 race. He dominated the states in the Republican primary, and while more demographically diverse states like Colorado and Virginia have tilted toward Clinton, Midwest battlegrounds like Ohio have held steady for the Republican nominee.""From what I have seen, this is a natural tightening of the race. If anything, in the last few days, we have seen things improve a little bit,"" Mook said.In addition to Michigan on Monday, Clinton will campaign with Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and former President Bill Clinton in Philadelphia and in Raleigh, North Carolina.The Raleigh event, said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's spokeswoman, will be near midnight.Clinton's top aides rejected the idea that the tightening in Michigan was caused by FBI Director James Comey's announcement to Congress about a review of emails potentially related to Clinton's email server.""We saw the race begin to tighten before then,"" Mook said, adding that the letter and probe knocked Clinton off message."

7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/girls-on-the-bus-how-things-have-change-gloria-borger/index.html	At the Washington Star, where I began as a reporter, one of my greatest thrills was being able to work in the same newsroom with Mary McGrory, who was the exception to the mostly male rule. She was a trailblazing columnist who changed the way we look at -- and write -- about politics. I would have been honored just to carry her bags (which I often did). She was a female star, a role model -- not to mention being a brilliant writer who asked the direct questions no one else would. There weren't enough women in the newsroom then, but we were starting to sprout. The boys club was daunting, especially if you wanted to cover politics. I approached it with the sense that maybe I was trying to be initiated into a fraternity where I didn't quite belong.But women did make the move to politics and we did belong. I was in print -- at the Star, then at Newsweek, then at U.S. News and World Report. I ironically always thought that TV was going to be my backup job. Then, of course, print started to literally disappear. And what I discovered was that the skills of being a good broadcast journalist are largely the same as being a good print journalist -- both require the same ability to report, write and explain. Those requirements have remained steadfast.Luckily, other things are very different from back in the day. Here at CNN, it's not uncommon for women to dominate -- whether as correspondents in the field or on political panels. It's not only a different environment, it's a broader environment and I think we cover the news better because of it.But while certain things are better, my younger colleagues have it far from easy. In fact, when I look back -- especially on my days writing weekly at Newsweek (imagine that!) -- the schedule seems so, well, relaxed. At CNN, it isn't uncommon for moms to be at the office early and work through the evenings, particularly in a busy period like the election. The 24/7 news cycle means that they don't have the ability that I had to take a break in my day, go home for dinner, and then continue to work and write in the privacy of my own home. That was definitely true in my print reporter days. And I even remember when, on the campaign trail, all of the focus was getting a story on the evening news. How quaint that all seems now.Today, the girls on the bus are always on -- either traveling, or in the studio or reporting off camera. I marvel -- absolutely marvel -- at their ability to juggle. Sure, I had to juggle things to find balance, too, but not like this. They are champions at what they do, and I stand in awe.When we are in the bureau at the same time -- a rarity these days -- we realize how much we miss the daily camaraderie. In our corner of CNN Washington world, I have my office, and Dana Bash is next door, and Brianna Keilar is there, too. We talk all the time. The great thing about women at CNN is that we value each other and counsel each other. Mommy guilt is a very real thing; we have all been through it, with a sense that no matter where you are you think you should be somewhere else. But we thrive, and so do our children. The support flows both ways between generations here. One tiny example: When I was trying to figure out a cool song to dance to with my son at his wedding, the dance party began in the office next door. We celebrate together, we confide in each other and we trust each other's judgment and reporting.You bring who you are to every story you cover, but you don't cover a story differently just because you are a woman. That diversity may just bring a different question or point of view to an interview or to a piece. It took a while for us all to recognize that, but at least we do now.And that's not changing.

8	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/latinos-voter-turnout-early-voting-2016-election/index.html	So far, Latino voting in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina is significantly up from 2012, according to Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates and groups to receive detailed early vote return information this year. Catalist's voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote.In total, more than 30 million votes have been cast already across 38 states with early voting. And both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump continue to urge their supporters to vote early as Election Day nears.Early voting update: Battlegrounds tight with 30 million ballots castLatinos tend to vote more Democratic than the population as a whole. And in 2012, Latinos voted for President Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by 71% to 27%, according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic Center.Here's a look at the available voting data from each of the three states:FloridaAt this point in 2008, 260,263 Latino voters, or 9.6% of the electorate, voted early. So far in 2016, that number has grown to 596,146, or 14.1% of all early ballots cast.In terms of raw numbers, Hispanic early turnout has increased 129% from 2008, according to early voting data from Thursday. Their turnout numbers increased at a faster rate than white and black voters.CNN looked at data from 2008 because it doesn't have comparable data from 2012.Early voting update: Positive signs for both parties in battleground statesIn the most recent CNN/ORC poll this week, Florida appears to be a tight contest, with Clinton at 49% among likely voters while Trump is at 47%.Obama carried Florida's Hispanic vote 60% to 39%, an improvement over his 57% to 42% showing in 2008, according to the Pew Research Center.GeorgiaAt this point in 2012, 12,933 Latinos, or 0.9% of early voters, cast early ballots. In 2016, that number has increased to more than double at 31,623 people, or 1.7% of all voters who cast their ballot early.The Hispanic electorate in Georgia isn't large, but Hispanic early turnout has increased by 144% from 2012, according to early voting data from Thursday.In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey published Thursday, Clinton sits just 1 point behind Trump in Georgia -- 45% to 44%, within the poll's margin of error.North CarolinaAt this point in 2012, 21,474 Latinos voted early -- about 1.2% of the electorate. So far this year, 37,591 Latinos have voted, a slight increase to 1.8% of early voters.  The Latino vote in North Carolina has a relatively small influence in the state, but has increased in voter turnout this year nonetheless. Early voting among Hispanics has increased 75% so far from 2012, according to early voting data from Thursday.A Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday showed Clinton ahead in North Carolina, 47% to Trump's 44%.Obama won 68% of the Hispanic vote in North Carolina in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center.

9	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/north-carolina-voter-rolls/index.html	"Michael Hyers, an Air Force retiree from Fayetteville, North Carolina, has spent hours upon hours combing through records, cross-checking addresses and submitting thousands of challenges to voter registrations in an effort to purge voter rolls at the local Cumberland County elections board. He claims to have removed 6,000 people from voter rolls since 2014.He believes it is his duty. ""I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,"" Hyers told CNN, explaining his belief that Democrats have conspired to commit massive voter fraud and he has a responsibility to scrub rolls of voters who have died or moved away.The challenges submitted by Hyers and his group, the Voter Integrity Project, a conservative organization that believes systemic voter fraud exists, became part of a federal lawsuit that accused officials in three North Carolina counties of illegal voter-roll purges that disproportionately targeted African-Americans.The lawsuit, filed by the NAACP, garnered the attention of the Justice Department and independent elections-monitoring groups, and on Friday, a federal judge ordered the state and local boards to restore the purged voters.Federal judge Loretta Biggs described the purges as a ""flawed process"" and specifically noted that one individual in Cumberland County -- where Hyers lives -- challenged the registration of approximately 4,000 local voters.The North Carolina Board of Elections has no evidence the election will be affected by fraud, and in a statement to CNN, a spokesperson said the board works to ensure the integrity of the elections process by investigating allegations, conducting audits during the early voting period and working in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security.Studies have found limited occurrences of voter fraud, such as a 2014 report by Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite, who concluded, ""The scant evidence of arrests, indictments or convictions for any of the practices defined as voter fraud means that little fraud is being committed relative to the millions of votes cast each year in state, local and federal elections.""But Hyers says he has come across news reports and hearsay to the contrary.He also specifically references videos produced by James O'Keefe, the conservative political activist, and his organization, Project Veritas, which shows Democratic operatives purportedly discussing questionable methods to skew the election against Trump. Most of those videos have been found to be inaccurate and highly edited to promote O'Keefe's conservative narrative.Hyers told CNN this has led him to painstakingly research voter records for names and addresses of individuals he says have not voted in two or more federal elections. He then mails letters to those individuals' addresses that explain how his group has determined they may be inactive and urges them to re-register or face possible challenges to their voting status.If the letter comes back to Hyers with the marking ""return to sender,"" he says he files a challenge regardless of the voter's race or political affiliation.""The system is broken,"" Hyers said. ""(The law) was written by the Democrats in such a way as to keep the rolls bloated, so that voter fraud could be done.""Jay DeLancy, who co-organized the Voter Integrity Project in 2011, said his group depends on people like Hyers to do the work that he says official elections boards can't.""We know that there is some level of voter impersonation fraud going on, but it's not prosecutable unless you catch the person in the act, which is impossible to do because there's no ID required,"" Delancy told CNN.Multiple county officials did not to respond to CNN's request for comment regarding how they proceed when private residents such as Hyers challenge registered individuals' eligibility to vote.But in the eyes of Jimmy Buxton, who heads the Fayetteville chapter of the NAACP, all of this amounts to politically motivated voter suppression.Buxton said some individuals such as Hyers and others have found a way to side-step the official process of election boards to examine the accuracy of voter rolls since North Carolina law allows private citizens to submit residency challenges.Buxton said this allows non-government groups to suppress the votes of African Americans, who more often align with Democrats.""It's undercover racism,"" Buxton said.The North Carolina branch of the NAACP filed suit to challenge the en masse cancellations on the grounds that the National Voter Registration Act prohibits systemic voter removal programs within 90 days of a federal election. The suit also charged that the efforts disproportionately targeted African-Americans.In a statement of interest in the case, the Justice Department wrote, ""the purge program at issue here rested on a mass mailing and the silence of voters largely unaware of the potential injury to their voting rights."" The DOJ also has sent election monitors to at least one North Carolina county, Robeson County.The judge's ruling on the case Friday orders the election boards to stop further purges and ensure that voters have the right to vote in person or receive an absentee ballot if they had been denied."
