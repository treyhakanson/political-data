The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.""So if I had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin,"" says USF Tampa political scientist Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor at the University of South Florida. ""We're to the point where anything is possible. This is just one of those kind of elections.""All eyes are on central Florida's I-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. The area stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics.The two Florida's are apparent by traveling just 60 miles.George H.W. Bush for Hillary? A spokesman isn't sayingThe Villages, a master planned senior community centered on manicured golf courses, is staunchly Republican and full of largely white retirees. It's a must-stop for any GOP state, federal or presidential campaign. Trump's running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, visited the community over the weekend. He opened his rally asking, ""How many Republicans in The Villages?"" followed by a huge roar from a packed ballroom at the conference and activity center.An hour south is Orlando, a city with a Democratic mayor since 2003. It is booming with diversity, including Puerto Ricans on the east side, African-Americans on west side and Vietnamese, hipsters, whites and an LGBT community in the middle.GOP policy guru: Trump can't 'fake his way through 90 minutes'In downtown Orlando on Saturday, a Latin festival filled the air with salsa music and the aroma of Puerto Rican food. It took place on the same grounds of the Dr. Philips Center, where thousands turned out to remember 49 people slaughtered at the Pulse Nightclub in June.Sandra Calixto, a Hillary Clinton supporter who attended the festival, believes Trump is racist.""The main thing is he has discriminated against people with a disability and I have a son with disability,"" she said. ""And for me, he is coo coo.""Trump Jr. likens Syrian refugees to SkittlesClinton is outspending Donald Trump on TV ads in the state by a 4-to-1 margin.  Clinton spent $38.7 million to Trump's $9.2 million throughout the general election. In the past week alone Clinton bought over $5 million in ads -- Trump spent under $1 million, a clear difference in campaign strategy. The campaigns are also taking different courses in setting up offices across the state. Clinton has 57 offices and over 90,000 volunteers, according to a Democratic National Committee memo.Trump has relied heavily on state Republican field offices instead of setting up his own. Between the RNC and Trump, 60 offices are open with 210 paid staff and thousands of volunteers according to Trump's Florida director Susan Wiles.""I am one of those that doesn't think that brick and mortar matter that much,"" says Wiles. ""There are plenty of places for volunteers to gather.""  "	2016 presidential race tightens in Florida

Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments. RELATED: Donald Trump Jr. likens Syrian refugees to Skittles candy""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions. ""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.  ""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees. ""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement. But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.""The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year. The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""RELATED: Boat survivor: I am a refugee with a voiceDavid Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now."" But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean. The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad. And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp. ""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said."	Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity

The Inspector General determined that the agency granted citizenship to 858 individuals who had been ordered deported or removed under another identity but ""their digital fingerprint records were not available"" during the naturalization process.But a footnote on page one of the report also states that there were, as of November 2015, an additional 953 individuals about whom the Inspector General couldn't determine if there was a problem with the fingerprint records specifically, but also should have been deported. This other group consisted of members of a slightly broader classification, from countries of concern as well as from neighboring countries where there is a history of fraud.That amounts to a total of 1,811 individuals granted citizenship who should not have been.The Department of Homeland Security responded to the report, saying it would review all 1,811 individuals ""out of an abundance of caution.""Monday's report drew condemnation from many Republicans in Congress, including Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, who said ""a bureaucracy that blunders so badly is one that doesn't take our national security seriously."" The White House said Tuesday it's ""clear"" some systems need improving following a glitch with DHS' fingerprint system that led to hundreds of people inadvertently being granted citizenship.""It's clear there needs to be an improvement in terms of digitizing some of the fingerprint records,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. ""Additional progress would have been made if additional resources had been appropriated by Congress.""He said the Obama administration ""certainly takes seriously the consideration that is made in terms of protecting our national security in terms of our immigration system."""

He's other-izing people. He calls women pigs if they don't look like beauty pageant contestants. He blames Muslims and Mexicans for our problems. He makes fun of disabled people. This is other-izing with a capital 'O,'"" Soloway said. She continued, ""It has been used in our history before to start and win wars. He needs to be called out at every chance he gets for being one of the most dangerous monsters to ever approach our lifetimes. He's a complete dangerous monster, and at any moment that I have to call out Trump for being an inheritor to Hitler, I will.""CNN has reached out to Trump campaign for comment and not yet received a response. With the criticism, Soloway delivered one of the sharpest Trump condemnations at the awards show -- but she was far from alone, as the program featured a series of actors, directors and producers who slammed the GOP nominee. ""Transparent"" lead actor Jeffrey Tambor, another winner who was backstage during the exchange, said he agreed, according to Variety. And he reportedly quoted the poet W.H. Auden, saying ""Love one another or die.""David Mandel -- the showrunner of HBO's ""Veep,"" which also won multiple awards, and who was also present backstage -- joked that his show, which satirizes politics, couldn't keep up with Trump.""There are days when things we think of pale in comparison to that mad man threatening Hillary Clinton not once but twice,"" Mandel said, according to ""Variety."" ""If I wrote that, I'd get fired by HBO. I find the level of discourse in this campaign horrific.""He added, ""A lot of people don't want to laugh about this stuff."""

""And that's what makes us who we are. That's what makes us special. And if you give that up, Alisyn, then you have defeated yourself,"" Cuomo, a Democrat who has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president this cycle, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""That is the code of democracy and freedom. That is what they resent about us. So don't lose your soul in the process. Because that is the soul of America.""Trump complained Monday about Ahmad Khan Rahami being offered medical treatment and legal assistance following his shootout with police. Rahami, the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey, was captured Monday. Following a frantic manhunt and shootout, Rahami was shot multiple times before being taken to a hospital for surgery. ""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer,"" Trump said at a Florida rally. But Cuomo said Tuesday that leaving a wounded Rahami ""on the streets"" would have been un-American.""That's not who we are. That's not who we want to be. And that's not how we defeat the terrorists. We defeat the terrorists by staying true to who we are,"" he said. Cuomo also responded on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" to Trump's claim Monday that Rahami would have access to ""amazing hospitalization"" and be ""taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world.""""Welcome to America,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""Right? We have a system of jurisprudence. You are innocent until proven guilty. You have a right to counsel ... that is our system. And it's what makes this country special. It's what make this country great.""Cuomo praised law enforcement Tuesday for successfully capturing Rahami quickly.""It was really a remarkable situation when you think about it,"" he said on ""New Day."" ""I think it's a statement of the time. We have gotten so sophisticated in law enforcement, especially in New York.""On Monday, Cuomo disputed Trump's assertion that police aren't doing their job because they are afraid of being accused of racial profiling.""Our local police -- they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling,"" Trump said Fox News. Cuomo responded: ""I don't know how you could have been more aggressive than we were here.""Trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombs""I said as soon it as it happened that justice would be swift,"" he told Blitzer.

Bush asks. (Bush was a big Uber fan who frequently praised the company in his stump speech.)  When Kimmel told him he was going to the Emmy's and that he was nominated, Bush offered a self-deprecating line. ""Wow, what's that like?""He then gave Kimmel some advice on his Emmy candidacy. ""If you run a positive campaign, the voters ultimately will make the right choice, Jimmy,"" Bush said, alluding to his unsuccessful primary fights with Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.But when Kimmel began to reflect on the comment, Bush shut it down.""That was a joke.

""I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric.""An explosive device went off in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan over the weekend, once again thrusting the politics of terror into the center of the 2016 election.Clinton and Trump initially responded to the incident in contrasting styles: Trump was quick to announce that a bomb had gone off in New York, even before there was much information about the incident; Clinton, meanwhile, urged caution, and the importance of waiting to draw conclusions until more information was available.Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said that the Clinton campaign accused the Republican nominee of treason and criticized her previous stances on the war in Iraq.""If Clinton really wants to find the real cause of ISIS, she needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror,"" Miller said. In her news conference Monday morning, Clinton also warned against the instinct to villainize entire groups of people based on religion.Asked about Ahmad Khan Rahami -- in custody following a police shootout after he was allegedly seen on video near the bombing -- and whether his Afghan descent will help Trump politically, Clinton said: ""There are millions of law-abiding, peaceful Muslim Americans.""""That is why I have been very clear. We are going after the bad guys and we are going to get them, but we are not going to go after an entire religion and give ISIS exactly what it is wanting,"" Clinton said.Clinton's news conference offered no new policies to fight terror. She argued, as she has before, that the United States needs to invest more in intelligence to combat lone wolf attacks.The former secretary of state also called on tech companies in Silicon Valley to ""give us the tools and lead us to those who are attempting to promote attacks like we have seen.""Clinton has given speeches on defeating terror multiple times throughout the 2016 campaign, including policy-focused addresses in Minneapolis and New York earlier this year."
