""I was against going into the war in Iraq, he told the crowd, ""but we got out the wrong way. President Obama did a terrible thing the way he got us out of the war."" But CNN's research shows no evidence for his repeated claim of opposition to the war before it started. Instead, during a September 2002 interview on Howard Stern's radio show Trump was asked if he supported invading Iraq. ""Yeah, I guess so,"" he answered. Hardly a ringing endorsement of the upcoming war. But nowhere near full-throated opposition. In an August speech, Trump pointed to an interview with Fox News Channel anchor Neil Cavuto, three months before the war started, to bolster his case that he opposed the war. At one point in the interview, he expressed impatience with President George W. Bush for not starting the war. ""Well, I'm starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy,"" he said. ""They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we're going in, we're not going in, the -- you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn't talk. We have to -- you know, it's sort like either do it or don't do it."" Later in the interview, Trump said the war was not a higher priority than the economy. But he never said it should not be undertaken. ""He's under a lot of pressure,"" Trump said of Bush. ""I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraq situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" It wasn't until August 2004 -- 17 months after the invasion began and the war was being widely criticized -- that Trump came out fully against the war. ""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed,"" he said in an interview with Esquire magazine. ""And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!"" This gap between what Trump claims and the evidence to the contrary has been pointed out many times. Yet he keeps repeating the claims. Given that, it is hard to come to any other conclusion than that he is simply lying.

Here are some of the erstwhile leaders that Obama won't have to worry about during his final UN appearance, and why they're no longer making an appearance at the New York confab.Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Former President of IranAhmadinejad frequently sparked controversy in his UN appearances, often criticizing the United States with inflammatory statements. In 2010, he alluded to the idea that the United States government was behind the 9/11 attacks, prompting a walkout by many US allies. President Barack Obama described the claims as ""inexcusable,"" ""offensive"" and ""hateful."" In 2013, Hassan Rouhani was elected as Ahmadinejad's presidential successor.Hugo Chávez, Former President of VenezuelaChávez presided over a country rife with allegations of widespread corruption and human rights violations. He was also a prominent adversary of the United States' foreign policy, aligning himself with authoritarian nations such as Cuba and Iran, as well as radical movements that were seen as anti-Western. Chávez died while in office in 2013 after suffering from cancer.Moammar Gadhafi, Former Leader of LibyaGadhafi was captured by rebels in October 2011 after a US-led coalition intervened in an uprising in the country amidst concerns that the longtime Libyan leader would massacre his own people. Gadhafi was killed a short time later. His ouster left the country spiraling into chaos and coming under threat from violent extremists.Hu Jintao, Former President of ChinaUnder Hu, China grew as a top economic world power but the country still held to its Communist structure, limiting outside influence and access, and engaging in human rights violations, according to the West and international advocacy groups. Hu stepped down as president in March 2013, keeping to an unofficial tradition of only holding two five-year terms.Dmitry Medvedev, Former President of RussiaMedvedev was a former chief of staff to previous and current Russian President Vladimir Putin. He came to power after Putin faced a two-term limit, but appointed his mentor as prime minister during his tenure, allowing Putin to stay close to the top. The US undertook a ""reset"" in relations with Russia that courted Medvedev, but he only served one term before Putin resumed the presidency.Thein Sein, Former Prime Minister of MyanmarIn 2009, Thein Sein, an army insider in a country long ruled by a military junta, served as prime minister in Myanmar. Reform in Myanmar has been slow but encouraged by visits from Obama in 2012 and 2014. He cited restrictions on political prisoners, the arrest of journalists and the ongoing plight of the Rohingya Muslim minority displaced in Rakhine state after anti-Muslim violence as problems plaguing the nation. He then became president and after his five-year term expired in March 2016, with the country moving toward greater openness, Thein Sein became a Buddhist monk."

The gun lobby has aired $7.7 million in television time on Trump's behalf, support that makes it the second-most active pro-Trump advertiser in the general election. But it had not been on the airwaves since late last month.The NRA's Political Victory Fund is tasked with spending half the money on five swing states -- Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- while its Institute for Legislative Action, its lobbying arm, is spending the second-half on national cable. All of the money is going to a harrowing ad that shows what the NRA says would happen if Hillary Clinton appoints her chosen justices to the Supreme Court.""She'll call 9-1-1. Average response time? 11 minutes,"" says the narrator as a sleeping woman is startled by nighttime footsteps. The woman runs to a nearby safe to grab her weapon, but it's empty. ""Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.""The advertisements targets rural voters in battleground states who might be Democrats or disillusioned Republicans, according to Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman. ""It is designed to run up the score with those Trump voters,"" she said.The NRA's chief political adviser Chris Cox said the ad ""underscores"" how Clinton's position on guns creates ""one set of rules for her, and a different set of rules for the rest of us.""Trump has emerged as a proud spokesman for gun rights, though he has at times invited controversy. On multiple occasions, Trump has been attacked for encouraging gun-owners to incite violence against Clinton, though Trump's campaign has said he is being misinterpreted.""I think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,"" Trump said in Miami last week. ""Take their guns away, let's see what happens to her."""	NRA returns to Trump's defense with $5 million ad buy	['Clinton', 'Trump']	['guns']

Bush hand Karl Rove and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A check of a similar size is expected to go to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a similar super PAC focused on the House of Representatives.And to back Trump, a donation of at least $5 million is likely headed to the political operation helmed by the Ricketts family, who are expected to finally spend their fortunes on Trump as well. Other cash may be routed to Ricketts-led nonprofit groups that are not required to disclose the funders.The spending amounts to a historic investment in the Republican Party ticket's hopes for November, putting millions of dollars behind Trump's bid in a groundbreaking donation that could redefine the final two months of the 2016 campaign.The donation, the Adelsons' first major gifts of the entire 2016 cycle, puts an end to questions about how they would spend their fortunes in the Republican race. Courted by the entire Republican field during the primary, Adelson has been the most prolific Republican financier in recent cycles and bar none the most influential contributor in the donor class.Their decision could convince other major GOP donors to give as well, which would be a major boon for Trump. The real estate mogul has wooed Adelson throughout the year but had not convinced him to open his wallet. The chair of Las Vegas Sands casinos, Adelson signaled earlier this year that he would give $100 million to pro-Trump efforts, though he has yet to part with a single dime. The billionaire gave at least $93 million to conservative groups in the 2012 election. After sitting out of the Republican primary, Adelson became the most prominent megadonor to quickly support Trump, but he resisted months of pitches from pro-Trump operatives to finance their groups, which today still struggle to fund television campaigns. Adelson has also been courted strongly by American Crossroads, a network of super PACs.The Senate Leadership Fund is one of those Crossroads groups and will report Tuesday having raised $28 million in August, shattering fundraising records and injecting new optimism into the GOP's efforts to hold the Senate.The Congressional Leadership Fund or Ricketts groups will not be required to disclose the donations until mid-October.

I suppose Donald Trump might say, 'That's okay,' but that would be a terrible loss for this country.""RELATED: National security moves to the top of 2016 campaignTrump expanded this summer his blanket ban on immigrants to the US to include those ""from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism."" ""You have many, many groups, because we're allowing these people to come into our country and destroy our country and make it unsafe for people,"" Trump said Monday on ""Fox and Friends,"" arguing that the stricter immigration policies he has proposed would better protect the US from terror. But King, who normally caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and endorsed Hillary Clinton in July, said such a ban could prevent ""thousands and thousands"" of immigrants from contributing to the greatness of America. ""You've got the bad guys, but you've also got thousands and thousands of really good people who come into this country -- everybody from Einstein to Donald Trump's ancestors to mine and yours came in through the immigration system,"" King told CNN's Alisyn Camerota.RELATED: Trump reacts to bombings: 'This is only going to get worse'But being an open country doesn't mean that the US government should loosen its vetting process, King said.

A United Cigars shop on one side of the street, a Western Union sign on the other. Lines of cars stretch into the distance. Even Shepard himself -- who is as much a fixture of Welch as any of its buildings -- is in the mural, a blue cap perched on his head.""There wasn't ten square feet in this town that didn't have a successful business in it, a business of every kind,"" Shepard said in an interview. ""No matter what you wanted or needed, you could buy it in Welch.""Those were better days.Now it's a place, people who live here say, that politicians use as a convenient photo op and that the federal government has left behind, a sentiment common among white working class voters. 56% of non-college educated whites say the government in Washington does not represent them, according to a new poll conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation. And two-thirds say they are dissatisfied with the influence people like them have on politics. Locals referred to the once-bustling Welch as ""Little New York,"" but now the town and the county around it are slowly slipping away. The storefronts are empty. The buildings and houses here are now crumbling with decay. Shepard used to take checks to the bank each Monday -- sometimes $1,000, sometimes $1,500. He hasn't had to do that in four or five years he said, because he hasn't had one customer in that long.""It's depressing to watch the population disappear, the business disappear and the activity to stop,"" he said. ""Back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, it'd be hard to walk up the sidewalk because there was so many people. Now you walk up the sidewalk and there's nobody.""McDowell County's population is just 19,835 down from 100,000 in the 1950s. That decline is expected to continue. West Virginia University economists estimate that McDowell will continue to lose residents at a rate of 1% each year.Some, particularly in rural areas like McDowell County, say the government's at fault. Rural working class whites are more likely to blame the federal government for their economic problems than their urban counterparts. Seven in ten say the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for the economic problems facing the working class, in the CNN Kaiser survey, compared with half of urban working class whites. That could explain the appeal of a candidate who is not only intent on upsetting the political system, but has at times seemed bent on breaking it down to start over again.On this winding drive through the hilly roads of Appalachia, there are few signs signaling support for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but Trump is expected to do well here. West Virginia hasn't voted for a Democrat since Bill Clinton's second term. Much has changed in the last 20 years and now Clinton is seen as squarely at odds with the coal industry, which is the bedrock of Welch and the surrounding county.No matter who wins in November, some residents of West Virginia coal country don't believe anything will change their lives. They have come to accept, as Gary Hall, a 55-year-old Trump supporter put it, ""that next year is going to be worse than the last year"" no matter who is president. Hall said he felt alienated from the political process, but rejected the idea that he and other whites without college degrees were angry and flocking to Trump as a result. The CNN/Kaiser foundation survey suggests that's the case, too. Just 19% of working class white voters described themselves as angry about how things are going in their own lives.""We're conditioned that there's really nothing you can do about it. The only thing outrage and protesting and stuff does is cause bad feelings,"" he said. ""People are just resigned to have what they have. The ones that want to leave, the ones that can leave and want to leave leave. Everybody else just stays here.""Rural working class white voters like Hall are more likely to say America's best days are behind us and that their children will be worse off than they are today. In the CNN/Kaiser survey, 58% of rural working class whites say America's best days have come and gone and 57% say their children will be worse off compared with less than half of urban working class whites who say the same.West Virginia is one of the nation's largest coal-producing states and McDowell County used to produce more coal than any county here. But there's been a steep downturn in coal jobs across the state due to competition with cheaper natural gas, tougher environmental rules and mechanization, and this county has seen the worst of it.""We don't have another option,"" said Cecil Patterson, 51, who spent his life working in the coal industry and serves on McDowell County's county commission. ""Once we shut down the coal industry here there's nowhere to go, there's nothing else to do, there's no other jobs available.""The unemployment rate here was 12.5% in July, compared with 4.9% nationwide.When work dries up, people leave, Patterson said, doing anything they can to make ends meet. ""You can't just go to the next county here, you have to leave the state. A man tries to go out of the state, maintain an apartment, try to keep his home back up here, it just puts such a struggle on the family.""Trump won McDowell handily in West Virginia's May primary, taking 91.5% of the Republican vote -- his largest margin of victory in the country. But even before becoming his party's presumptive nominee the week prior, he was the favorite to win in the state.During a campaign rally in West Virginia in May, Trump promised to bring back lost-coal mining jobs but hasn't said how he'd pull it off. Many people here were skeptical that he could -- but credit him with giving them hope.And animosity toward Clinton runs high. Even months later, people still repeat -- verbatim -- the comment Clinton made that her climate change policies would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""Many people here with ties to the coal industry -- virtually everyone here is linked to it -- see Clinton's comments about coal disqualifying and Trump as their only answer.""It ain't gonna be Hillary,"" said 34-year-old Ryan Barnette, his face black with soot, minutes after leaving the mine. ""She wants to shut down the coal industry -- that's gonna put me out of a job."" Elaine Lacaria -- known here as Laney -- was a lifelong Democrat and voted for Clinton eight years ago. But now things have changed.""I won't vote for her again. No, never,"" she said in an interview in the dress shop she opened in 2008, the same year then-Senator Barack Obama was elected president.In the eight years since then, she said things have gotten worse. Jobs have dried up, people are leaving and not coming back and addiction has ravaged this community and others near it.""When we drive anywhere you see small town USA is no more,"" Lacaria said. ""This has affected all of us, not just the coal fields.""Lacaria said she'll never vote for a Democrat again and this year, she'll support Trump.""When I see Trump as a businessman, I think he will help our county definitely, but I think he will help our country as a whole. He knows what he's doing.""Patterson, who also said he plans to vote for Trump due to his support of the coal industry, said the same.""When we wake up the morning after an election, our roads are going to be getting worse, our sewer, our water, our schools are failing, Patterson said. ""They want us to keep paying more and we keep getting less, so there's my take on where we're at the day after the election."" Others, like 69-year-old Vira Rose, say no politician or government got them in this position. And they don't expect to be saved.Rose, who was one of the first women to work as a mine foreman in the area, owns her own auto repair shop. She once sold new tires, now a stack of used tires for sale sits outside of the shop. People can't afford new ones anymore, she said.""Sometimes I come here at 8 a.m., I get out of here at 8 or 9 at night. Any job comes, you don't turn it down and say tomorrow. If you say tomorrow, tomorrow won't be here. You grab it, you do it -- then you help others,"" she said. ""We're the forgotten tribe.""She has no faith in Clinton or Trump.""What am I gonna do? I'm not gonna vote for neither damn one of them,"" Rose said. ""Because there's not much difference, there's really not."""

7	7	http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/republican-reince-priebus-john-kasich/index.html	"The next Republican civil war came into greater focus over the weekend when party chairman Reince Priebus threw a thinly veiled warning at former GOP 2016ers who haven't yet endorsed Donald Trump: ""Get on board"" or face penalties if you ever seek the presidency again.The nudge -- aimed at Republicans such as John Kasich, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush -- was no off-the-cuff expression of frustration. Several Republican party chairs in early voting states told CNN that Priebus has spent days talking about enforcing the pledge that all 17 GOP candidates signed at the outset of the 2016 primary to support the eventual nominee.Find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on ""The Daily DC"" podcast""I can't tell you how many people have asked me, 'What are you going to do about these candidates that are not keeping their promise?'"" Iowa GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann told CNN Monday. He said the Iowa state GOP receives 10 to 20 calls per week from rank-and-file Republicans wondering what, specifically, the party will do to force Kasich, Cruz and Bush to stick to their pledges and back Trump.   ""If I'm hearing it here from a state of 3 million, it must a megaphone there in DC,"" said Kaufmann, who has spoken with Priebus and other Republican officials about enforcing the pledge. ""There's no wiggle room in terms of what that promise was, and it should be honored."" A representative for Priebus didn't comment on the conversations.But his call for penalties wasn't widely embraced -- with the No. 2 House Republican breaking with Priebus Tuesday morning. ""There's a better way to unite people. I'm not a big believer that punishment unites people,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters at a weekly session in the Capitol.  The California Republican added, ""If Hillary (Clinton) can't unite Republicans, I don't think anything can.""Premature conversation?Of course, talk of penalties on candidates who might run in 2020 could be all for naught if Trump wins. The race between Trump and Clinton has narrowed dramatically in recent weeks, though the Democratic nominee still has more paths to the White House. But the episode underscores the frenzy that could consume the GOP if Trump loses the race and the party searches for a new direction.The anatomy of a white, working-class Trump voter""We're watching the trailer for the GOP civil war, out in theaters November 9,"" said a top Republican strategist, who asked not to be named to avoid openly feuding with Priebus. The penalty talk spilled into the open Sunday, when Priebus told John Dickerson on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that members of the 2016 Republican presidential field who haven't yet abided by their pledge to back the eventual nominee and endorsed Trump need to ""get on board."" And for those who don't, he said future presidential bids won't ""be that easy."" ""If a private entity puts forward a process and has agreement with the participants in that process, and those participants don't follow through with the promises that they made in that process,"" Priebus said, ""what should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?"" Kasich's camp quickly zipped off a response accusing Priebus of putting party over principles. Kasich strategist John Weaver said the Ohio governor ""will not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs."" Cruz brushed Priebus off Tuesday evening. ""These are serious times. I think the last thing we need to worrying about is bickering between Republicans,"" he said. ""My focus is on defeating Hillary Clinton and helping preserve a Senate Republican majority.""The RNC's leveragePenalties, several Republicans said, would likely come from the national party in the form of restrictions on access to the Republican National Committee's data and voter files -- and potentially bans from primary debates. Individual states, though, likely couldn't keep candidates off their ballots. Still, Republicans cautioned that talk of penalizing pledge-breakers is aimed at nudging Kasich, Cruz, Bush and others to support Trump in 2016 -- not to handicap the party's presidential candidates in the future. Some said it's not even clear the RNC would have authority to impose the crackdown Priebus discussed.""Reince has simply posed a question to which there is no good answer yet -- and I'm not sure that the question deserves an answer. That's to be determined,"" said Matt Moore, the South Carolina GOP chairman. RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to address the possibility of penalizing future presidential candidates who didn't abide by their pledges to support Trump. ""We are focused on winning back the White House and maintaining our majorities in the House and Senate,"" Walters said in an email. Donald Trump opens the personal insult vault (again)While some party honchos like Kaufmann backed Priebus' warning shot, others -- including Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges -- bristled. ""No. This is not what we are all about as a party. Besides, let's stay focused on 2016 for the next 50 days,"" Borges tweeted Sunday night. Top Mitt Romney 2012 strategist Stuart Stevens tweeted: ""So idea is most popular recent Republican governors of battleground states should run as independents? Great plan.""RNC's handling of TrumpThe RNC's handling of Trump under Priebus will be on trial as the party picks a new chair -- or extends the Wisconsin operative's tenure -- shortly after the election. Then comes a swing-state governor's race in Virginia, followed by the midterm elections, where Trump's brand of populism could butt against more orthodox conservatives. And in 2020, the early stages of the Republican primary would be defined by how the candidates treated Trump. It would be the clearest differentiator of like-minded conservatives like Mike Pence, the Indiana governor who became Trump's running mate and chief defender, and Cruz, the Texas senator who was booed off stage for refusing to endorse Trump at his own nominating convention.   ""Assuming Trump loses, there'll be a really pitched battle for the heart and soul of the party,"" said Weaver, the Kasich strategist who wrote the scathing rebuttal to Priebus on Sunday. ""You're going to have off-year elections, you're going to have midterms -- some of that will impact the defining of the party, clearly. But you won't have any new definition of it until there's a new nominee,"" Weaver said. ""There's a broader debate ultimately about what the party stands for and where the country should go.""Adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for GOPMany Republicans still fault Priebus for failing to criticize Trump forcefully enough in late 2015, when he proposed a clearly unconstitutional ban of all Muslims from entering the United States, and believe the party could have done more to slow Trump's rise. They point out a particular irony: The party that insisted it couldn't intercede in the 2016 nominating contest is now threatening to use its leverage to undercut individual candidates in future races. Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who helmed Cruz's state effort in the primary, defended pledge-breaking candidates, arguing that ""circumstances change"" -- a reference to the pledge's creation as a tool to keep Trump from launching an independent campaign. He said he doesn't see how Priebus could impose penalties on future presidential candidates. ""There's no provisions in the RNC rules that allow anybody to punish anybody,"" Anuzis said. ""The idea of doing that, I think, is extremely difficult, because you normally are looking toward the future, not the past.""

Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, both of whom will be on Florida's ballot, drew 6% and 1%, respectively. Monmouth's poll produced another unfavorable finding for Trump: 54% of Florida voters believe the GOP nominee's recent turnabout on President Barack Obama's origins was made for political reasons. Only 24% think Trump believes that Obama is a natural-born citizen.After years of promoting conspiracy theories regarding the first black President's birthplace, Trump changed course last week. He still has plenty of work to do on that front in Florida. According to the poll, Clinton leads Trump among Hispanic, black and Asian voters in the state, 69%-16%. Those three blocs comprise one-third of Florida's electorate. Clinton's 5-point advantage is wider than other recent polls out of the state, including a CNN/ORC survey released last week that found Trump up by 3, within the poll's 3.5 percentage point margin of error. But it's smaller than her lead in the previous Monmouth poll in Florida last month, which showed Clinton up by 9. That margin was also larger than other Florida polls conducted at the time. The latest Monmouth poll was conducted September 16-19 using phone interviews with 400 likely Florida voters. It has a margin of error of 4.9%.

Clinton has so far given ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families.While those speeches have focused more on Clinton, they have not been devoid of Trump contrast. In all three speeches, Clinton has tried to keep her talk of Trump to a minimum, but they have cast him as an ill-prepared candidate who should not be president. And Wednesday's speech will be no different.Many low-wage workers not protected by minimum wageClinton's campaign and Democrats view Trump's attacks on New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whose arthrogryposis impairs the movements in her arm, as their most effective character attack against the Republican nominee.Trump mocked Kovaleski during a campaign event in South Carolina last year after the reporter questioned Trump for citing his story as proof that ""thousands"" of Muslims celebrating in Jersey City, NJ, as the World Trade Center towers burned and fell during the 9/11 terror attack.Clinton turned Trump's comments into her first general election campaign ad.
