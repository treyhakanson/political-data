Libertarian Gary Johnson earns 5% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein takes 2%. That's in line with other polls this week, which show Clinton leading by just a few percentage points, a smaller lead than the one she held before the FBI announced it was looking at newly discovered emails potentially related to her private email server.Combined with the other four most recent national polls, Clinton enjoys a 5% lead entering the final hours of the campaign. CNN's Poll of Polls shows her at 47%, Trump at 42%, Johnson with 4% and Stein with 2%. The Fox poll of 1,107 likely voters was fielded November 1 to November 3 and has a sampling error of 3 percentage points.The Poll of Polls, which does not have a sampling error, includes the Fox poll; the ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted October 31-November 3; the CBS News/New York Times poll conducted October 29-November 1; the Suffolk University/USA Today poll conducted October 20-24 and the CNN/ORC poll conducted October 20-23.

1	1	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/2016-campaign-best-gifs/index.html	"This madcap presidential election will come to an end on Tuesday, pulling up stakes after a protracted season that delivered delight and disgust, laughter and long groans, without pause for the better part of two years. And while there's still time for one last faulty trapeze wire to snap, or another clown car to blow a tire and careen wildly into the audience, the story of 2016 is all but written. So as we await the grand finale Tuesday, let's take a look back at the good, the bad and the ... unspeakably weird of the past 18 months. Best recovery from a very publicly failed fist-bump attemptSen. Bernie Sanders sat down for a series of conversations with rapper and political soulmate Killer Mike and, despite a few awkward exchanges, went on to succeed in launching a campaign -- and political movement -- even his biggest early backers could have never predicted.Most emotionally complicated low-five on a debate stageDonald Trump spent the first few months of his campaign mercilessly mocking former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, calling him ""low energy"" and other mean things. So it was fitting, if a little uncomfortable, to watch Bush respond to his tormentor's offer of a low-five with a such a fiery slap.Best (and worst) livestreamed haircutGov. Mike Pence led (and trailed) this one-horse race from start to finish.And while the Internet found the show oddly enthralling, the barber seen here snipping his way into American political history was less impressed. How so? Well, it turns out he was unaware of his star client's identity.   The photo opp most likely to exist forever in campaign managers' nightmaresPresidential candidates: they're just like us! Or so they have long been dedicated to having the public believe. One popular way of proving it? Tossing around the old pigskin. Marco Rubio played the game in high school and college -- a mixed blessing, as at least one Iowa child can attest. Most over-the-top entrance to an campaign eventLike you had any doubt. Trump gave the academy a lot to work with, leading to a deadlock -- unable to choose between his gilded descent into the campaign muck (above, at his announcement event) and the scene as he took the stage in Cleveland during Wrestlemania (or was that the Republican National Convention) this summer.Most confusing confused candidate moment  Ben Carson is literally a brain surgeon. But even he got tripped up by the stagecraft at a GOP primary debate back in February, when he waited ... and waited ... and waited in the wings after not hearing his name announced. It wasn't until ABC News moderator David Muir called his name again -- asking Carson to ""please come out on the stage"" -- that the candidate emerged. Best use of aviator shades, red wine and high-waisted pantsOne is on his way out and the other is has been out of work for a while, so we'll offer this as a parting GIF (ha!) to President Barack Obama and former House Speaker John Boehner. It might be their most memorable joint accomplishment.Most evocative facepalm In case it wasn't clear enough, South Dakota's Isaac Latterell, seen here at the RNC, did not vote Trump and was not pleased when his state delivered its delegate bounty to the eventual nominee.Best use of shoulders to convey disdain for opponents/delight at their misstepsTuesday is shaping up to be close, but Clinton wins this one in a landslide.Most unlikely dance move of the year, governor's categoryWhile Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Bush each showed off their dad-liest dance moves over the course of the campaign, the silverware goes to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry who joined the cast of ""Dancing with the Stars"" with this award in mind.Best use of time during what had clearly become a dead-end campaignKasich's was a lost cause way before he arrived in New York ahead of its April primary. But the governor, in keeping with his oddly entertaining campaign trail persona, took a memorable bite out of the Big Apple. (Note: This is, of course, a terrible way to eat a slice of pizza. And Kasich was roasted for it. But the body of work here -- notably this gut-busting performance in the Bronx a week later -- won us over.) Best control room director malfunctionSome people wanted to the award to go to the cameraman. But this zoom was not meant for live TV audiences. So here's to you, trigger-happy control room director. You cut to the two-shot just in time to create something like a promo for NBC's new mockumentary ""The (Oval) Office."" Most historically-politically effective use of a pocket constitutionThese things aren't just coasters or coffee table conversation pieces. Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who ripped Trump at the DNC, sending the Republican nominee into a damaging tailspin, unleashed the campaign-altering power of the pocket Constitution to historic effect.Best six-second medley of facial expressionsTell us how you really feel. (No really, please, Mr. Trump -- tweet us or call and explain what is happening here.)Best thing to happen to American psychoanalysts and psychologists -- everThis campaign is surely driving Americans to their shrinks at a record pace.

2	2	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/rnc-did-not-violate-new-jersey-consent-decree/index.html	"Late last month, the RNC was ordered to provide information detailing ""any efforts regarding poll watching or poll observation"" after the Democratic National Committee alleged that the RNC had violated a decades-old consent decree by improperly collaborating with Donald Trump's campaign on poll monitoring activities aimed at intimidating minority voters.Lawyers for the DNC urged Magistrate Judge John Michael Vazquez of the US District Court for the District of New Jersey at a hearing on Friday to find that Trump had acted as an ""agent"" of the RNC for purposes of enforcing the consent decree.""They are inextricably tied together,"" Joshua L. Kaul argued on behalf of the DNC, pointing to various statements made by RNC chair Reince Priebus, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conaway in an effort to show the high degree of coordination among the two camps.But the RNC flatly denied that the Trump campaign's activities were attributable to the RNC.""(Is the DNC) really contending that the RNC has control over Donald Trump?"" RNC lawyer Bobby Burchfield asked rhetorically. ""That would be a newsflash.""Vazquez agreed with the RNC Saturday, concluding: ""The DNC has submitted insufficient evidence to support its position. ... The discovery thus far produced by the RNC reflects that it is not working with the Trump Campaign on ballot security measures."" To be sure, the judge found that ""Trump Campaign has clearly emphasized voter fraud efforts,"" but those actions could not be imputed to the RNC for purposes of the consent decree.""The RNC produced documentary evidence from its counsel's office to the general counsel for the Trump Campaign which indicated that the campaign was not an agent of the RNC vis-Ã -vis ballot security measures,"" Vazquez explained.At the hearing on Friday, Vazquez previewed skepticism about the remedy being sought by the DNC, pressing Kaul to explain how an injunction of improper ballot security measures would be effective when the RNC's position was that it had not engaged in any impermissible poll-watching activities.""Wouldn't I be enjoining them from something they say they aren't doing anyway? Does that move the ball forward at all?"" Vazquez asked.In denying the relief sought by the DNC, Vazquez's opinion makes clear, however, that the DNC is free to provide the court with additional evidence supporting an extension of the consent decree after Election Day.""(T)he Court will hear the parties after Election Day as to additional discovery on this point in order to develop a full record to determine whether an extension is warranted,"" Vazquez ruled.The DNC did not hesitate to point out this language soon after the decision came down.""I am disappointed in the court's decision denying immediate relief on the eve of this election, but find comfort in knowing that meaningful discovery may be pursued afterward to establish that this 30-plus-year consent order should remain viable in the fight against RNC-inspired voter suppression efforts,"" DNC attorney Angelo Genova said in a statement Saturday.And Marc Elias, a Clinton campaign lawyer, tweeted, ""'For now' and 'at this time.'"""

3	3	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/trump-2011-amnesty/index.html	"In an appearance in November of 2011 on ""Fox and Friends,"" Trump defended former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, then a candidate for the Republican nomination, who was being criticized by his opponent Michele Bachmann for saying at a debate that he wanted ""a humane"" approach to the subject of illegal immigration which would avoid deporting families rooted in American communities. Trump signaled he liked Gingrich's approach, agreeing with a Fox host's description that it could be called amnesty.""Well first of all he's really talking about something where somebody has been in the country for 25 years, they've been educated here, they're really tremendously performing people, and citizens, or not citizens depending â  I guess he's talking about if they become, or should they become, citizens,"" Trump said. ""The fact is he's showing a lot of compassion. Now I know both of them, and they're both very, very, good people. I like what Newt is saying to a certain extent. It's a very limited thing, but he's talking about people that have really been terrific people for this country for a long, long, period of time. He's saying it's very, very, tough to throw them out. ""I tell you, I know Michele,"" said Trump. ""And if you told Michele, 'Go across the street. You see that family? They've been here, they've been really producers for this country for 25 years. They're great people, their children are educated, their children are producers, you go tell that family to get out of here and get into their own country,' I don't think she could do it, because she's a good person.""""This isn't conservative, I'm the world's most conservative person, this isn't conservative. This is compassion,"" added Trump.""Is it amnesty?"" asked ""Fox and Friends"" host Steve Doocy.""I guess to a certain extent, for a very limited number of people, it would be considered amnesty, but how do you tell a family that's been here for 25 years to get out?"" responded Trump.The 2011 exchange is significantly different from the central theme of Trump's 2016 campaign, which has been a hardline position on immigration that emphasized the deportation of undocumented immigrants. In an August speech on immigration, Trump laid out his plan to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds, and made clear that the only path to becoming a legal resident would be for immigrants to return to their home country first.""For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above,"" Trump in his immigration speech. ""Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.""We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty.""A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. CNN's KFile first reported earlier in October that Trump had in 2012 said in an interview that he did not support deporting many undocumented immigrants. The extent to which Trump supported so-called amnesty for undocumented immigrants in 2011 and 2012 was mostly unscrutinized throughout the 2016 campaign.In the 2011 Fox News interview, Trump added that Gingrich's comments would help him with voters in the general election, even if it hurt him with conservatives. ""With a very strong conservative group of people he did himself harm, with the overall electorate he did himself a lot of good,"" said Trump."

""I don't think Giuliani's walkback is credible,"" Clinton's running mate said. ""I think the FBI, sadly, has become like a leaky sieve."" Kaine said Giuliani's initial comments signal that some within the FBI are ""actively working"" to help elect Trump through leaks to the media. ""What's come out since suggests that it's probably more likely explained that he (Giuliani) knew that the FBI is not only a leaky sieve but there were people within the FBI actively working -- actively working -- to try to help the Trump campaign. This is just absolutely staggering, and it is a massive blow to the integrity of that body."" An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Saturday.The Democratic vice presidential nominee said he did not think Comey was trying to influence the outcome of the election, but called his actions a ""massive mistake in judgment,"" speculating that the director felt pressured.""He probably felt pressured to do something because he felt like subordinates were going to do it if he didn't,"" Kaine said. ""In the aftermath, there's going to be a lot of questions about why the FBI turned into a body where some were trying to put their thumb on the scale in an election. I don't think he (Comey) was, but I think there are clearly people in the organization that trying to do that. It's very troubling."""

5	5	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/donald-trump-mosul/index.html	"The Republican presidential nominee knocked US officials as a ""group of losers"" for not launching a ""surprise"" attack and said he was convinced the offensive -- which is led by the Iraqi military -- was launched ""for political reasons"" to benefit his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. He suggested she would get ""credit"" for its success.Trump's repeated criticisms of the ongoing military operation in Mosul come despite forces on the ground making key gains.""Whatever happened to the element of surprise, right?...What a group of losers we have. And now it's a very tough battle, they're dug in. It's a very -- much tougher than they thought,"" Trump said at a campaign event in Tampa, Florida. ""We need different thinking in this country, folks. They should have kept their mouths shut."" Those remarks came after he questioned the core rationale behind the military offensive, which is central to defeating the terrorist group in Iraq.""Who benefits by us getting Mosul?"" Trump asked the previous night during a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania. ""You know it's going to benefit Iran. We're not going to benefit. Because Iran is taking over Iraq.""Although Iran has gained influence in Iraq since US forces largely pulled out of the country in 2011, retaking territory from ISIS is crucial to the US goal of destroying the terrorist group -- which Trump has vowed to accomplish as president.Trump has repeatedly argued that US and Iraqi military leaders should not have announced plans to attack Mosul, a proposal US military officials have strongly rebuked as unrealistic. US military officials and experts have said it is nearly impossible to move tens of thousands of troops into position without alerting the enemy. They have also stressed the importance of warning civilians of the coming battle.Despite gains against ISIS, Trump continued to insist Saturday that the offensive has been a ""disaster,"" directly contradicting accounts from military leaders and observers on the ground.And while Trump on Saturday said the Mosul offensive was designed to benefit Clinton politically, the GOP nominee has also previously argued it was launched to buttress President Barack Obama's political legacy in the final months of his presidency."

6	6	http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/next-us-president-global-challenges/index.html	"After a bruising brawl of a campaign, the next US commander in chief will inherit a world with the toughest array of foreign policy challenges in decades.The President's Situation Room meetings will focus on hot, cold and simmering conflicts around the globe, all playing out as Russia and China seek greater international clout, cyberattacks become increasingly disruptive, and long-time US allies worry about Washington's support.Middle Eastern conflicts in Syria and Iraq are re-igniting sectarian tensions and sending destabilizing waves of refugees across the region and into Europe, where their presence is altering political dynamics.Asia is on hair-trigger alert because of an unpredictable North Korean leader who is improving his nuclear arsenal at an alarming rate. China is challenging US power in the South China Sea, while Russia is placing nuclear-capable missiles  on NATO's doorstep and opposing the US in Syria.  Some national security problems are so big, no one country can deal with them -- climate change and the as-yet-unwritten norms of cyberwar among them.The next president will confront ""black swans"" -- disruptive events that no one sees coming -- but they will also face some certainties, chief among them that foes will test their resolve not long after they move into the Oval Office.An 'early challenge' likely""I expect an early challenge,"" said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.Dubowitz expects ""a forceful challenge"" on Iran and said the new ""administration will have to be prepared to have a full menu of responses, proportionate and disproportionate.""Other analysts predict early tests from Europe and Asia, too. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin bears no warmth for Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state whom he believes instigated protests against him in 2012. And North Korea has a demonstrated track record of provocative acts -- missile launches or nuclear tests -- within a month-long window before or after a US presidential election.RELATED: The world's biggest headaches""The North Koreans are certainly going to challenge the next administration,"" said Victor Cha, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who was President George W. Bush's top adviser on North Korea.The isolated Asian nation poses one of the toughest challenges for the next administration, Cha and others say. Pyongyang's erratic leader Kim Jong Un marked his aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons with a fifth nuclear test in September and seeks the missile capability to deliver warheads to the continental US.The Obama administration's policy of strategic patience, involving sanctions, international isolation and tough talk, has done nothing to dissuade them. ""The notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a non-starter,"" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper acknowledged in October.""The problem is much worse than it was eight years ago,"" Cha said, and it will require the next administration to take decisive steps, such as sanctioning Chinese companies that do business with North Korea or changing its policy on missile defense.A Cold War coming with China?A tougher stance on North Korea will likely roil China, Pyongyang's protector and ally, so that ""it would become much more like a Cold War with China in the region,"" Cha said.China is already set to be a challenge for the next president. Increasingly, Beijing is using its military to assert claims to contested areas of the South China Sea that the US insists should remain open to international navigation and be peacefully resolved. Clapper, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted China's ""extensive military modernization program"" across many fronts, including space, a development he described as ""both disturbing and also impressive."" A former top administration official said the next president will have to deal with a China that ""feels like it's their time"" and is intent on challenging US leadership of the global order, along with institutions like the G20. The next president's challenge will be to find areas of common ground while dealing with Beijing's assertiveness.The next president will also have to reinvigorate relations with Asia, where core allies like South Korea are going through political upheaval, and in places do some repair work, as in the case of the Philippines, whose fiery President Rodrigo Duterte seems to be orienting his country away from Washington and toward Beijing.China's muscle-flexing is part of a larger shift to a ""multipolar construct where countries like Russia, like China, see themselves as important if not dominant players in this world scene,"" Clapper said.US-Russia tensions growTensions between Washington and Moscow have intensified as Putin has pushed back hard against US power globally over the last eight years, annexing Crimea, sustaining a low-level conflict in eastern Ukraine, threatening NATO allies in the Baltics and backing Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, whom the US opposes.Putin has walked away from arms control and non-proliferation treaties with the US, threatened the tactical use of nuclear weapons and put new ICBMs and nuclear capable missiles in Kaliningrad, right beside Washington's NATO allies Poland and Lithuania. Russia has also conducted unprecedented cyberattacks against Democrats during the election.""A year ago, I would have said the relationship is the worst since"" the end of the Cold War, said Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and Eastern European Studies at Georgetown University. ""But it's gotten even worse.""RELATED: Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable conflictAs tensions have risen, channels of communication have broken down, a dangerous situation, said Matt Rojanksy, director of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center. Among the risks the next president faces is the prospect that frozen conflicts that Russia uses to wield influence in places like Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova ""could become shooting wars,"" Rojanksy said.Russia has also been wooing traditional US allies in the Middle East, courting Egypt and Turkey at a time when Washington's relationships in the region have been badly strained. Those tensions within the Middle East are, in large part, byproducts of five years of upheaval that started with 2011 uprisings that have upended countries across the region.Some Arab states -- Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen -- have fragmented, while others like Egypt are dysfunctional. Transnational terror groups such as ISIS, Ansar al-Sham and al Qaeda are feeding on the power vacuums. Meanwhile, Iran continues its support for terrorist groups across the region.Inheriting a messy MideastIn short, the next president will inherit a Middle East that Clapper calls ""a mess.""""It makes your head hurt, it really does,"" he added. Moreover, in the last eight years, US relationships in the region have changed profoundly and will require rebuilding.""Authoritarian leaders, both friendly and adversarial, with whom the US has worked have either been purged or become enemies. Personal animosity between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have strained US-Israel ties.Traditional allies in the Gulf were angered by Obama's reluctance to arm moderate rebels in Syria and his decision not to enforce a ""red line"" he'd drawn about the regime's use of chemical weapons.Ties with Turkey frayingRelations with NATO ally Turkey have frayed, too. Most recently, the government has accused a US resident of planning a July coup attempt and wants Washington to extradite him. So far, the US has declined to do so, adding to the frustration Turkey already feels about the US-backed campaign to oust ISIS from neighboring Iraq.Turkey remains vehemently opposed to US cooperation with Kurdish groups in Syria that Ankara says are linked to terrorists but Washington sees as the most effective fighting force on the ground.""At this point, the US lacks its traditional friends and our traditional adversaries are gone as well,"" said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center.The Kurdish question will be one of many facing the next president when it comes to Syria, where a civil war of more than five years has killed close to a half-million and created one of the worst humanitarian crisis of modern time.More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with more than 4 million straining neighboring countries like Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon and fueling a migrant crisis in Europe. The chaos has fueled ISIS' rise and paved the way for Russian military intervention in support of the regime.Josh Landis, who heads the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Syria will be a difficult test for the incoming president.""We have to make some hard choices about who we are going to support in Syria,"" he said. ""If we support the Kurds, we alienate the Turks. If we support the Turks and rebels, we have to escalate with Russia and pull the rug out underneath the Kurds."" The next president will also have to confront the threat of ISIS and other extremist groups that have made Syria their incubator. They will require the US ""to be in the business of suppressing these extremist movements for a long time to come,"" Clapper said.The history of ISIS ""is one of resilience and flexibility,"" he said. When the terror group is eventually expelled from its current strongholds in Iraq and Syria, it will probably ""morph into something else or other similar extremist groups will be spawned,"" he said. That transnational threat and others will require the 45th US president to work in close cooperation with other nations. One of the most pressing issues will be the thicket of questions surrounding aggressive acts in cyberspace by state and non-state actors. Those challenges are so new that the next president will have to work, in part with other countries, to define terms, said a former Obama administration official who worked on cyber issues.""The questions will be, is it cyberwar, cybercrime or cyberespionage and how do you respond? What's a proportional response?"" the official said. ""This complex of issues will be on the front burner for the national security guys. Those are all novel questions."""
