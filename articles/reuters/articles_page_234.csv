By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee announced his opposition on Wednesday to the 2017 defense authorization bill, underscoring the partisan divide over the $602 billion defense policy measure.Representative Adam Smith said changes in the bill this week by Republicans, who control the House, on issues including women's registration for the draft, transfers from the Guantanamo detention center and protection for gay and transgender employees of military contractors, had led him to oppose it.""These have tipped the balance of the bill considerably,"" Smith said in a statement.President Barack Obama had already threatened to veto the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, over a long list of issues, starting with its use of $18 billion of special war funds for day-to-day military programs to avoid automatic budget cuts.
This week, the powerful House Rules Committee used a procedural move to remove, without a House vote, an amendment approved by the armed services committee that would have required women to register for the military draft.The Rules panel also decided not to allow debate on an amendment that would have stripped a ""religious protection"" measure from the bill that rights advocates fear would undo the president's 2014 executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Smith said he also objected to Republicans' adding further restrictions on transfers from the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and reduction in funds for nuclear nonproliferation and other provisions.Republicans control 246 seats in the 435-member House, which passed the bill by a vote of 277-147 late on Wednesday, largely along party lines, with most Republicans backing the bill and most Democrats opposed.
However, the Senate will pass its own version of the bill later this year, which will be reconciled with the House bill to create a final version of the legislation.Once passed by the Senate and House, that NDAA would be sent to the White House for Obama to sign into law, or veto.

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday to provide $622.1 million to control the spread of the Zika virus, far below President Barack Obama's request and lower than Senate legislation.The bill passed the Republican-controlled House 241 to 184, largely along party lines, and sets up a confrontation with both the Republican-majority Senate and the Democratic Obama administration. The White House has threatened to veto the House bill, saying it was ""woefully inadequate."" The Obama administration has requested $1.9 billion.On Tuesday, the Senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on Thursday of $1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects.Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere.
Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts.House Republicans argue their bill, when coupled with $589 million the Obama administration already shifted to Zika from unused funds to battle Ebola, would provide enough money through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year.It was unclear how long it might take the Senate and House to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills.
U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.
Last year, Brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly, and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the Americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern U.S. states including Florida.The Obama administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine.

By Lisa Richwine and Dustin Volz

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg heard from more than a dozen U.S. conservative leaders on Wednesday and said he will work to build trust with users who believe the social network displays politically biased news content.After a closed-door meeting at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters, Zuckerberg defended his company's practices but acknowledged that many conservatives believe Facebook is politically liberal. ""It doesn't make sense for our mission or our business to suppress political content,"" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook after the meeting. ""I know many conservatives don't trust that our platform surfaces content without a political bias,"" he added. ""I wanted to hear their concerns personally and have an open conversation about how we can build trust. ""The editorial practices at the world's largest social network came under scrutiny after a former Facebook contractor anonymously accused editors there of deliberately suppressing conservative news. The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor.Facebook has denied the allegations and said it would conduct a full investigation.A Facebook spokeswoman said the meeting produced ""a constructive discussion"" and some attendees called it productive.""I think Facebook is very sincere in wanting to resolve outstanding issues with conservatives,"" Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, said after the meeting.
Attendees were frank about their concerns, but the tone was cordial, Bozell said. ""Facebook invited that frank talk. People didn't hold back too much,"" he said.    On her Facebook page, conservative CNN commentator S.E. Cupp said the meeting had produced ""strong commitments to address issues, as well as to work together on common goals.""  Other attendees included former White House press secretary Dana Perino, media personality Glenn Beck and former Republican Senator Jim DeMint.Zuckerberg said that while Silicon Valley has a reputation for being liberal, Facebook's 1.6 billion users span every background and ideology.""The reality is, conservatives and Republicans have always been an important part of Facebook,"" Zuckerberg wrote.
Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has more Facebook fans than any other presidential candidate, he said. Fox News ""drives more interactions on its Facebook page than any other news outlet in the world,"" Zuckerberg added. ""It's not even close."" Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O).Facebook employees who donate to presidential candidates lean Democratic. Seventy-nine percent of employee contributions to 2016 contenders went to Democrats, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance data, and 21 percent to Republicans.Zuckerberg has contributed to candidates in both parties. Sixty-percent of his donations during the 2014 midterm elections went to Republicans and 40 percent to Democrats. He has not supported a presidential candidate this cycle.
Although a U.S. Senate committee is investigating whether there is liberal bias in selection of trending topics, there is little chance the government will try to regulate Facebook's practices, said Republican Senator John Thune, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.""I don't have any reason to believe that would be necessary,"" Thune told reporters on Tuesday.Thune sent a letter to Facebook last week to demand that it explain its editorial decision-making and how stories are chosen for the ""trending topics"" feature. He said his primary concern was that Facebook was potentially being deceptive about how its news feed curation algorithms work. Facebook last week released its guidelines for choosing trending topics, but the operations of the news feed algorithm remain closely guarded.Legal experts said the government has few tools to dictate how a private company makes news decisions.""As a legal matter, Facebook is not required to be even-handed,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""Congress can't introduce something that tries to prohibit Facebook from making these kinds of choices."" (Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb and Dustin Volz; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Tom Brown)"

By Doina Chiacu and Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Infighting dogged the Democrats on Wednesday as Bernie Sanders' campaign accused party leaders of bias against him and many Democrats urged Sanders to keep his supporters in check.The tensions after a chaotic weekend convention in Nevada emerged as Republicans begin to rally around their own outsider presidential candidate, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, in the general election.Trump, who has all but secured his party's nomination, has turned his focus to November, outlining to Reuters on Tuesday  proposals including scrapping financial regulation and the Paris climate accords. On Wednesday, he  released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees.More Democrats urged Sanders on Wednesday to take a stronger stand against his supporters' uprising in Nevada over the delegate selection process. They said he did not go far enough in condemning the unrest, which included a thrown chair, yelling and threats to convention leaders.""That was the time to have sent a full-throated message to his followers: that we don't do this kind of thing,"" U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said on CNN.Democrat Barbara Boxer, the other U.S. senator from California, was at the Nevada convention and expressed her concern to Sanders in a phone call on Tuesday night. ""I feared for my safety and had a lot of security around me,"" she said. ""I've never had anything like this happen.""Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, in a series of television interviews, accused Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, of bias against Sanders from the beginning and ""throwing shade"" on his campaign.""There's a tremendous amount of frustration out there and people want to have a fair process,"" Weaver said on CNN.
Senior U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Wasserman Schultz on Tuesdsay both also called on Sanders to do more to rein in his supporters.Sanders had said he condemned violence and harassment against individuals but framed Nevada's incident as a warning to Democratic leaders to treat his supporters with fairness.The U.S. senator from Vermont is determined to fight on against front-runner Clinton in what has become a longer-than-expected and sometimes acrimonious battle. In contests on Tuesday, Clinton narrowly edged out Sanders in Kentucky, a state where she had not been expected to win. Sanders won Oregon, a state that played to his strengths.Democrats are faced with a delicate balancing act as long as Sanders remains in the race, needing to pivot toward Trump without taking Clinton's nomination for granted and alienating passionate backers of Sanders.Sparring between the Sanders camp and the Democratic Party leaders over the Nevada events threatened party unity before the Democrats' national convention in July in Philadelphia.
""Unaddressed, the toxic relationship between DNC @ @SenSanders campaign, so evident last night, could cast dark cloud over Philly convention,"" David Axelrod, a former top strategist for President Barack Obama, said on Twitter.UPHILL BATTLE FACES CLINTON
Despite having an almost unassailable lead in the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination, and with the  primary battle heading toward the final contests next month, Clinton will need Sanders supporters on her side in the general election.
According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, what played out in Nevada is just a glimpse into the uphill battle Clinton faces in courting them.If Clinton wins the nomination, for every six Democrats who support Sanders, one will switch their allegiance to Trump in the general election and two say they would not support either candidate. Only three of every six say they would support Clinton as the party's nominee. Sanders' campaign has long accused party leaders of favoring Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, for the presidential nomination in the face of his unexpectedly strong primary challenge.On Saturday, his supporters in Nevada became angry at the delegate selection process, booing, yelling and hurling insults, and at least one chair, toward the convention leaders.Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, said she and her family, including a 5-year-old grandson, have received death threats and numerous callers have disrupted her workplace.On Wednesday, Lange said she wanted Sanders to acknowledge the threats, and apologize.""His statement was pretty weak,"" she said on CNN. ""Until you say you're sorry, until you say what happened in Nevada should not have happened and it was wrong and it was fueled by your senior campaign staff people, then that's an apology and then I think there's some responsibility is taken.""

By Dustin Volz and Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. presidential campaigns face threats from hackers bent on espionage and other activity more nefarious than mere political mischief, the office of U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said on Wednesday, but did not provide details on specific intrusions.""We're aware that campaigns and related organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations - from philosophical differences to espionage - and capabilities - from defacements to intrusions,"" Clapper's spokesman, Brian Hale, said in a statement, deferring to the FBI for details on specific incidents.Earlier, Clapper said the U.S. intelligence community had ""already had some indications"" of hacking attempts against presidential campaigns.""As the campaign intensifies we'll probably have more"" attacks, Clapper said at a morning event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.The hacking efforts against the campaigns are considered so serious that some congressional committees have been briefed on the activity, a government source said.""Given the intense scrutiny paid to the 2016 campaign, and the broad implications for U.S. foreign policy, it's no surprise that actors are launching cyber attacks against presidential campaigns,"" Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement.The U.S. Secret Service, which is charged with protecting the presidential candidates, said in a statement that it works to prevent and detect cyber security threats and makes the candidates aware of vulnerabilities.
Cyber attacks against political candidates occur in countries around the world. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama's campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes.U.S. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to Chinese hackers. Matthew Prince, co-founder and chief executive of CloudFlare, which has provided internet security services to Donald Trump and other presidential candidates, said his company has seen a ""surprisingly civil cyber landscape"" in the United States compared with elections in other countries where it has worked, such as Turkey or Mexico.	
""We have not seen anything (in the United States) that would suggest a level of sophistication that you would see if a nation-state actor threw its full weight behind it,"" Prince said.Clapper said the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working to educate ""both campaigns"" about cyber threats, likely referring to the campaigns of Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.A U.S. security official said foreign hackers would likely seek information about a candidate's foreign policy intentions and team and about the campaign's internal operations.The Republican and Democratic candidates for president will begin receiving intelligence briefings after their official nominations at party conventions this summer. 
Clapper said the two candidates would receive ""exactly the same"" briefings. He said the sessions would not be used to try to persuade Trump to soften his stance about a proposed ban on Muslim immigration, which some national security professionals have said is counterproductive to fighting Islamic extremism.""We've been doing this for many years, it's not designed to shape anybody's world view,"" Clapper said.Because the candidates are briefed in person, U.S. intelligence officials said they are not concerned about hackers eavesdropping on the sessions. But they are worried that Trump or Clinton might share information with aides, advisers or supporters using email systems that are less secure than those the government uses for classified information. One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cited Clinton's previous use of a private email server when she was secretary of state and noted Trump's reputation for speaking, and tweeting, off the top of his head.

By Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. banking lobbyists said on Wednesday they disagree with presidential candidate Donald Trump's call for a wholesale repeal of President Barack Obama's financial reform law, even though they share his view that it is overly burdensome.U.S. banks do want changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law but after spending millions of dollars to bring themselves into compliance with it, they are wary of Trump's call for it to be essentially scrapped.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, vowed on Tuesday to dismantle most of the law. ""Dodd Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,"" he told Reuters in an interview.Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a Washington trade group, said he appreciated Trump's interest in changes to the financial regulatory system. ""It certainly needs some perfecting,"" he said.""To have an outright repeal of Dodd-Frank I don't think would serve the banking industry or consumers,"" Hunt said, adding that it would create a messy regulatory environment. For instance, he said repealing Dodd-Frank would end the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created by the law, and it would be unclear which agency would take over its oversight of consumer products such as mortgages.       The wariness within the industry about gutting Dodd-Frank came as critics of Wall Street slammed Trump's proposal as a gift to big banks.
Congress passed Dodd-Frank in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In addition to creating the new consumer agency, the law restricted banks' ability to make risky investments and gave regulators new power over Wall Street executives' pay.In addition to seeking legislative changes to Dodd-Frank, the U.S. financial industry has spent much of the last six years wielding its clout in a quieter way by trying to push regulatory agencies to implement the law in ways they consider manageable.Banks still want tweaks to the rules, such as simpler capital requirements - which limit banks' reliance on debt for funding - and carve-outs from the toughest rules for small- and mid-sized institutions.
There could be risks for the banking industry should Trump or a Democratic successor to Obama push for a reopening of Dodd-Frank following the Nov. 8 election. Anger at Wall Street has been a potent theme in the election so far and resonates strongly with both Democratic and Republican voters. One reason banks fear pushing for a complete overhaul of the Dodd-Frank law is the possibility that it could be replaced by even tighter regulations, said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Guggenheim Partners, in a note to clients on Wednesday.For instance, some bank critics on both sides of the political spectrum have called for replacing Dodd-Frank's litany of regulations with much tougher restrictions on banks' debt.""The odds favor Trump's solution being even more onerous for large financial firms than the status quo,"" Seiberg said.    
A source who has advised banks on regulatory issues told Reuters that Trump's scathing critique of Dodd-Frank far overstated the problems with the law.""Most thinking people in the industry would dispute these characterizations,"" the source said. ""Are some pieces of Dodd Frank problematic? Yes. But there is, on balance, more good than bad.""   Former U.S. Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat for whom the law is named, said Trump's comments could backfire because of voter antipathy toward Wall Street.""He says he'll be enemy of Wall Street, and he's giving Wall street what it most wants,"" Frank told Reuters.

A Texas judge identified by Donald Trump on Wednesday as one of 11 people he would consider nominating to the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly mocked the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on social media.Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett last month likened Trump to ""Star Wars"" villain Darth Vader in a Twitter post.""'We'll rebuild the Death Star. It'll be amazing, believe me. And the rebels will pay for it.' --Darth Trump,"" Willett tweeted last month with a photo of the Death Star, the giant spherical spaceship built to carry a planet-destroying weapon in the first ""Star Wars"" movie.

Willett also linked Trump to liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
""Can't wait till Trump rips off his face Mission Impossible-style & reveals a laughing Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"" Willett posted on Twitter last August.Last June he mocked Trump's judgment on picking a nominee to the high court.""Donald Trump haiku-- Who would the Donald Name to #SCOTUS? The mind reels. *weeps--can't finish tweet*"" tweeted Willett (@JusticeWillett) on the same day Trump launched his candidacy. SCOTUS refers to the Supreme Court of the United States.
Asked to comment on Willett's Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, ""Mr. Trump's sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles.""Alabama U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a key Trump backer, was asked on Fox News Channel about the judge's Twitter posts, replying, ""I doubt he cares."" Sessions said it was more important to ask whether Willett ""follows the Constitution,"" is a good scholar, has integrity and meets the high standards expected of a Supreme Court justice.
Willett's enthusiastic tweeting would be a pivot from the current social media presence of Supreme Court justices. None of the eight sitting justices has a verified Twitter account.Willett did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.

By Alister Doyle and Valerie Volcovici
| OSLO/WASHINGTON

OSLO/WASHINGTON Donald Trump's vow to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected U.S. president caused dismay abroad on Wednesday, with supporters of the deal saying it was in his interests to embrace a plan that seeks to end dependence on fossil fuels.U.S. insistence on renegotiation could unravel a 195-nation compromise to curb greenhouse gas emissions reached in Paris in December after fraught talks between nations as different as China, the United States, small island states and OPEC members.""The Paris Agreement is as much in the United States' interests as any other country,"" said Tony de Brum, ambassador for climate change of the Marshall Islands who, as his country's foreign minister, helped broker the U.N. deal.""Seeking to unravel it would not only threaten the U.S. economy, damage its environment, and weaken its security, but it would do a great disservice to all of humanity,"" he said.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told Reuters on Tuesday he was ""not a big fan"" of the climate accord. He said China and other countries would not stick to the ""one-sided"" deal, which seeks to transform the world economy from fossil fuels in coming decades to slow global warming.""I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else,"" he said.Trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business.
Government officials meeting in Bonn, Germany, from May 16-26 to find ways to implement the deal, raised concerns about Trump's comments but doubted he would take serious action.That's because the deal imposes no real constraints on the United States - it lets all nations define their own actions for fighting climate change. President Barack Obama has promised to cut emissions by 2025, but his successors will face no penalties if they do not comply, meaning little incentive to challenge the U.N. deal.Many officials also say it is in U.S. interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions, partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels also means less air pollution, a big cause of disease. Even many nations traditionally sceptical that man-made greenhouse emissions stoke climate change, like OPEC countries, have gone along with the Paris Agreement.
RENEGOTIATING UNTHINKABLE
George David Banks, a senior climate change adviser to President George W. Bush and a Trump supporter, said Trump could try to force countries like China to pledge deeper emissions cuts by renegotiating the agreement.That's wishful thinking, according to John Coequyt, director of green group the Sierra Club's international climate campaigns.""You can't get more than 190 countries to renegotiate a deal they are implementing,"" he said.
The Paris Agreement will formally enter into force when 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. China and the United States, representing 38 percent, say they will join this year.If the deal enters into force before the next U.S. president takes office next year, it will in theory be harder to pull out. Article 28 says any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of entry into force - the length of a U.S. presidential term.Trump's easiest option is to neglect the deal if elected, legal experts say. Trump could ignore the targets set by Obama and promise instead to help developing nations cope with global warming.The Paris Agreement's flexible approach, allowing all to set their own goals, is radically different from the U.N.'s 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which set mandatory targets for developed nations to cut emissions until 2012. The United States did not take part in Kyoto - President George W. Bush denounced it as an economic straitjacket that, he said, unfairly omitted targets for developing nations led by China and India.Former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who helped broker the Paris deal, said this month that the U.S. election was critical to its future. ""If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption,"" he said.But U.S. chief climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said last week that other nations were likely to push ahead with the Paris Agreement whoever wins the White House.
