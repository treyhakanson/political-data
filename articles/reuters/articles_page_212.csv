WASHINGTON The District of Columbia's city council approved a $15-an-hour minimum wage on Tuesday, a rate adopted by a growing number of U.S. cities and states seeking to battle income inequality.The council voted unanimously to pass the measure boosting the minimum hourly wage to $15 by 2020, with subsequent hikes tied to inflation. A final vote will come later this month, and Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has backed the bill.Once approved, the U.S. capital will join California and New York in making $15 the hourly minimum. At least eight cities, including Seattle, have also approved the $15 base.""Raising the minimum wage will help address the issues of  residents being pushed out of the District due to rising costs of living and income inequality,"" Council member Vincent Orange, a sponsor of the bill, said in the hearing.He and other supporters say Washington's robust economy and growing population mean it can support a higher minimum wage. 
The District of Columbia's base wage is $10.50, and will go up by $1 on July 1 under existing law. The federal minimum is $7.25 an hour.The $15 minimum is estimated to raise wages for 114,000 workers, or about 14 percent of the District of Columbia's workforce, according to an analysis for the council by the non-profit Economic Policy Institute.
The higher pay proposal was supported by unions but was opposed by the District's Chamber of Commerce. It said the District should not raise wages until neighboring suburbs do.The District of Columbia's booming restaurant industry also opposed it. Restaurant owners and the local restaurant association said that higher costs would lead to layoffs.Some lawmakers said the measure did not go far enough to address a widening income gap and 18 percent poverty rate. Council member David Grosso added an amendment requiring the government to study a minimum income system to help the poorest residents.
""Raising the minimum wage is a good thing, but is $15 enough? Or should the number be $35, or $50 an hour?"" he asked.Under the measure, the minimum for workers who get tips, like waiters and bartenders, would also be $15 an hour by 2020. Following talks with unions, restaurateurs and community activists, employers would have to make up the difference between a base for tipped workers that will be $5 an hour in 2020, up from the current $2.77, Orange said.

WASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday disavowed Donald Trump's criticism of a Hispanic judge, saying such remarks were the ""textbook definition of a racist comment.""Ryan, speaking at an event to unveil U.S. House Republicans' policy proposals, said the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's comments were absolutely unacceptable and indefensible.

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday rejected a barrage of criticism from his own party over his allegations of bias against a Hispanic judge, insisting his concerns were valid.""All I want to do is figure out why I'm being treated unfairly by a judge. And a lot of people agree with it,"" Trump said on Fox News.Trump has been on the defensive since his comments last week about Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against Trump University, the New York businessman's defunct real estate school.He has also been castigated by Democrats, including the party's likely presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.""I don't know what else you could call these attacks other than racist, other than prejudiced, other than bigoted,"" Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC on Monday. ""It's just plain wrong, and certainly wrong coming from someone who is vying to become President of the United States.""Trump told campaign supporters in a conference call they should stand by him in his attacks on the judge, Bloomberg Politics reported. It said during the call Trump distanced himself from a memo his campaign sent supporters on Sunday that urged them to avoid the issue.Asked for comment, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: ""It was a very positive call to discuss overall messaging.""Two Trump supporters, Tana Goertz and Scottie Nell Hughes, told CNN that former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer had said on the call that she wanted the campaign to go on the offense against expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Goertz said Trump told his suppporters not to be afraid to ""call out the media"" when TV reporters suggest that Trump is racist. 
Trump has suggested that Curiel's heritage is influencing the judge's opinion about the case because of Trump's campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, has pledged to seal the U.S.-Mexico border with a wall, and has said Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States.Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, joined the chorus of criticism. In an interview with Orlando's WFTV, Rubio called Trump's comments wrong and said he had to stop.""I ran for president and I warned this was going to happen,"" Rubio said.Trump has regularly stirred up controversy on the campaign trail and has frequently dismayed Republican establishment leaders. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn a fresh wave of criticism, including concern in his own party.
On Sunday he was asked if - by the same token - he believed a Muslim judge would be biased against him based on Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. ""It's possible. Yes,"" Trump said on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""Republican leaders including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have distanced themselves from Trump's comments, saying they are worried the tone of his presidential campaign could enrage Latinos, who are a growing U.S. voting bloc.'BIG TROUBLE'
""If this doesn't change we're in for big trouble,"" Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, said on MSNBC on Monday. ""I hope to be able to support the nominee. I certainly can't now,"" said Flake, whose state has a large percentage of Hispanics.
A former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ohio Governor John Kasich, called on Trump to apologize to Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents. ""Attacking judges based on their race (and/or) religion is another tactic that divides our country,"" Kasich wrote on Twitter. ""More importantly, it is flat out wrong.""It was unclear what, if any, effect the latest furor would have on Trump's unorthodox candidacy. States with significant Hispanic populations including California, New Mexico and New Jersey hold nominating contests on Tuesday.Trump fought back against his Republican critics on Monday, with especially sharp words for Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker.Gingrich, mentioned as a possible running mate to Trump, on Sunday called Trump's comments inexcusable.""I was surprised at Newt,"" Trump told the ""Fox & Friends"" program. ""I thought it was inappropriate what he said.""

NEW YORK Online media outlet BuzzFeed has pulled out of an advertising deal reported to be worth $1.3 million with the Republican National Committee over objections to the party's presumptive nominee Donald Trump.In an e-mail to employees on Monday, BuzzFeed founder and CEO Jonah Peretti wrote: ""We don't run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we won't accept Trump ads for the exact same reason.""""The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs,"" Peretti wrote in the note, which was posted to BuzzFeed.com. 
BuzzFeed declined further comment.Neither BuzzFeed nor the RNC would confirm the exact value of the deal, reported by Politico to be $1.3 million.
According to an RNC official who declined to be identified, the deal was less than 1 percent of the party's ad budget of about $150 million and was effectively a reservation for ad space, not a firm commitment to place ads with BuzzFeed.Trump's campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she had ""nothing to add.""   
The RNC provides national leadership for the Republican Party. Trump is expected to be officially nominated as the party's candidate for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election at the Republican National Convention in July.  (Reporting by Angela Moon; Editing by Dan Burns and Andrew Hay)"

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich remembers the day 23 years ago when Hillary Clinton, notebook in hand, came to see him and other senior Republicans to talk about ""Hillarycare.""It was early 1993. Clinton, on behalf of her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, was leading a healthcare reform drive that vaulted her onto the national stage.Hillarycare would famously collapse after a fierce debate. In interviews with Reuters, some participants looked back on it as a crucible for the Democratic presidential front-runner that helped shape her approach to politics and governing.The experience, they said, may have tempered her ambitions for the capacity of government and made her more of an incrementalist. ""Back then, she seemed to have more of a taste for the big theory and the big plan,"" said Republican activist and editor Bill Kristol, who wrote anti-Hillarycare strategy memos for Republicans in the 1990s.Kristol said that since then, Clinton, who is vying to face off against presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 U.S. election, seems to have learned that ""the appearance of a massive government imposition on the citizenry doesn't go over well in America.""'WHATEVER SHE WANTED'
Clinton walked into the 1993 meeting with Gingrich and said she wanted to learn from him and other leaders who were already studying healthcare. He was then the Republican whip in the U.S. House of Representatives. She was the highly accomplished wife of the Democratic Party's new superstar and a Yale-educated lawyer. Gingrich's advice to her was simple: Do a series of small reforms year to year. Don't do a comprehensive plan.
""You won't be able to pass it,"" Gingrich said he warned Clinton in the meeting, also attended by then-House Republican Leader Bob Michel and then-Representative Dennis Hastert.""It will fall of its own weight ... She listened to us carefully and promptly went off and did whatever she wanted to,"" recalled Gingrich, now a political commentator often mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate to Donald Trump.Later that year, the Clinton White House delivered an ambitious and complex, 1,342-page proposal for universal health insurance for all Americans. The first lady led the charge and testified in a series of lengthy congressional hearings.She wowed lawmakers with her energy and intelligence. But she could not convince enough of them to back the plan.Conservatives and healthcare industry interests attacked it. One negative TV ad campaign paid for by health insurers memorably featured the fictional couple Harry and Louise.
In the end, Hillarycare failed, and never even received a floor vote in the House or Senate, although both chambers had Democratic majorities.Aided by the backlash that followed against ""big government"" Democrats, the Republicans in 1994 won a majority in the House for the first time since the 1950s, and Gingrich became speaker in early 1995. Even Clinton supporters acknowledged that the size and scope of Hillarycare unsettled some Americans. ""She has learned that excessive disruption in this country creates great angst. And also division,"" said Chris Jennings, who was the first lady's congressional liaison during the 1993-94 battle, and is now an informal adviser on healthcare to Clinton's campaign.Reuters did not speak with Clinton for this story. But Clinton wrote in her 2003 autobiography ""Living History"" that ""our most critical mistake was trying to do too much, too fast. That said, I still believe we were right to try.""Clinton has also pointed out that while she was still first lady, she rebounded from the Hillarycare setback by urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a health insurance program for children in low-income families. 
CAUTIOUS SENATOR
Clinton was elected in 2000 to the U.S. Senate, where she displayed bipartisanship and caution, said Jim Manley, who was a junior staffer for Senator Ted Kennedy in 1993-94 and later the spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid.""Once she got to the Senate, she was determined to work with Republicans,"" Manley said. ""The senator I saw was someone who was very cautious. She picked an issue and worked very hard to build consensus.""Now, having run unsuccessfully for president in 2008 and having served as secretary of state, Clinton is on course to take on Trump, a former reality television personality and luxury real estate developer.On the campaign trail she talks about building on President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, which made health insurance more accessible to millions of Americans.She favors a ""public option,"" or government-run plan, being added to the Affordable Care Act. She also has suggested allowing some working Americans to buy into the Medicare government health insurance system for the elderly.""What she (Clinton) doesn't believe at this moment in time is that we can or should just start all over again"" on healthcare, said Jennings, her former congressional liaison.

By Karen Freifeld and Jim Christie
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Lawyers for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump asked the California federal judge he attacked last week as biased based on his Mexican heritage to end the Trump University fraud class action currently scheduled to go on trial in November. In filings late on Friday, Trump's lawyers argued the case should not continue as a class action including all students who took the classes in California, New York and Florida. The lawyers claimed the students' cases were too dissimilar to be heard as a class because they were exposed to different marketing and advertisements and were told different things by Trump University employees.San Diego U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel is overseeing two class action lawsuits over Trump University. Last week, the presidential candidate said Curiel had treated him unfairly because he was a Mexican opposed to Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents.Trump's lawyers on Friday sought permission from Judge Curiel to renew an earlier motion to decertify the class. The judge previously ruled the case could proceed as a class action on the issue of liability, though each student would have to prove damages separately.
In April, Trump's lawyers also filed a motion to decertify the class in the other California case. The judge has not yet ruled on that motion.If the judge were to decertify the classes, former Trump University students would have to bring individual lawsuits. 
Trump and his for-profit real estate seminars have been accused of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 for an opportunity to learn the businessman's real estate investment strategies. The students claim they were defrauded, including by false claims that he had handpicked instructors to teach them his secrets. ""Given TU students' radically different experiences, plaintiffs cannot show that TU students were exposed to the same 'core' misrepresentations,"" Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Trump, wrote in Friday's filing. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to comment on the filing. (Reporting By Karen Freifeld and Jim Christie; Editing by Anthony Lin, Bernard Orr)"

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama welcomed the Denver Broncos to the White House on Monday to congratulate the Super Bowl champions for their victory over the Carolina Panthers and send off retiring quarterback Peyton Manning with words of praise. ""I have to say I'm so pleased to be able to host Peyton here at the White House before I left. Anybody who has been a football fan has watched what is one of the greatest Hall of Fame careers ever,"" Obama said, with the team standing behind him in the White House Rose Garden.""We were all obviously a little disappointed to see him hang it up this spring. But as somebody who is just a little bit older than he is, I was sympathetic to the idea that running around with these guys, it takes its toll,"" Obama, 54, said of Manning, 40.
Obama leaves office in January.As he often does, Obama noted he remained a fan of his hometown team, the Chicago Bears, but he conceded that the Broncos had a good year.
""I will continue to root for the Bears,"" he said to laughter. ""But I've got to give this organization credit for having done an extraordinary job. And this is a well-deserved celebration of an extraordinary season.""
The Broncos won their third National Football League championship with a 24-10 win over Carolina in the Super Bowl in February. The following month, Manning retired after an 18-year career with the Indianapolis Colts and Denver that established him as one of the game's greatest quarterbacks. (Editing by Peter Cooney)"

By Joseph Ax
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA A U.S. appeals court on Monday heard nearly two hours of argument on whether to release publicly a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the ""Bridgegate"" criminal case involving allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.The three-judge panel at the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia did not immediately rule, and a rapid-fire volley of skeptical questions aimed at lawyers for both sides made it difficult to predict how the court was leaning.A lawyer representing an individual on the list, identified only as ""John Doe,"" urged the court to throw out a lower judge's decision to release the information sought by a group of media companies.""It's not about what they would like to know,"" said Doe's attorney, Jenny Parker. ""It's about what they are legally entitled to know.""But Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for the media, argued the public's right to know was paramount.
""This is an extremely important issue that goes to how deeply this conspiracy went into the government,"" he said.The list could shed light on the extent of the scheme to shut down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in 2013 in what prosecutors claim was an act of political revenge against a local mayor.Christie, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination this year, has denied any knowledge of the plot, but the scandal has remained a source of embarrassment.
The list includes individuals that prosecutors believe were part of the conspiracy but are not facing criminal charges. Prosecutors have given defense lawyers the information as part of pretrial proceedings.Monday's argument largely focused on a technical issue: whether the list was a ""bill of particulars,"" a document that can be subject to public release, or an informal discovery letter that would normally stay sealed.Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, argued in support of Doe's position, saying prosecutors should be allowed to hand over such information to defendants without fear it will be revealed.
As an alternative, the court is considering whether to release all the names but that of John Doe, an option both Doe and the government oppose.Three people have been charged in the case. William Baroni, a former official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, are scheduled to face trial in September.David Wildstein, also a former official at the Port Authority, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating.
