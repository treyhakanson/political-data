By Deena Beasley and Toni Clarke
| LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON Americans' growing alarm over rising prescription drug costs will pressure a new U.S. administration and Congress to take action on pharmaceutical pricing, industry executives and healthcare experts say.Drugmaker stocks, battered in recent months, soared this week after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's victory. Democratic rival Hillary Clinton had vowed to take on pharmaceutical ""price gouging,"" and some pundits predicted the Democrats would gain control of the Senate, giving her a stronger hand.The Republican sweep of Congress eliminated those fears, while boosting chances for other measures, such as corporate tax reforms that would benefit industry.However, the vote did not change a key dynamic: U.S. consumers are paying more of the cost of drugs through higher health insurance deductibles and copayments, making them more sensitive to manufacturer price hikes.Most recently, a sixfold increase in the price of Mylan NV's EpiPen stoked outrage for families who rely on the lifesaving allergy shot and prompted investigations by state attorneys general and Congress.If a manufacturer sharply raises the price of a drug, ""it will be in the headlines. I don't think it matters which party is in office,"" said Sandra Hunt, principal at PricewaterhouseCooper's health industry practice.Republican lawmakers have taken up drug pricing alongside Democrats. Republicans Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Representative Jason Chaffetz, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, led inquiries into Mylan's EpiPen pricing.""A very strong majority of Republican voters want the Congress to address drug prices,"" said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, which campaigns for lower prices.An October Kaiser Family Foundation survey showed that 74 percent of respondents said making drugs for chronic conditions affordable should be a top health care priority for the federal government. Among Republican respondents, 68 percent put drug prices as a top priority.
A poll conducted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that 64 percent of voters - including 78 percent of likely Clinton voters and 48 percent of Trump supporters - believe the federal government should be able to limit pharmaceutical drug price hikes.BIGGER PRIORITY THAN OBAMACARE
Trump and Republican leaders have vowed to repeal President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, known as Obamacare, which has extended medical insurance to more than 20 million Americans. Despite complaints about Obamacare insurance premium increases, just 37 percent of Kaiser poll respondents said that overturning it was a high priority.
Chaffetz is ""evaluating his next steps"" on the drug pricing issue when the next Congress convenes, an aide said. A representative for Grassley said he would press forward with a scheduled Nov. 30 hearing into Mylan's EpiPen pricing.""The U.S. has always been a country that supports innovation ... and we hope it will remain the same,"" said Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca Plc, which sells drugs like cholesterol-fighter Crestor. ""But we also believe we will continue to have to deal with price ressures.""  Clinton's proposals to curb drug prices included capping consumers' monthly out-of-pocket costs. In the past, Trump has suggested allowing the government's Medicare health program for seniors to negotiate prices and making it easier to import drugs from countries where they sell for less.A Trump administration also could provide extra funding to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to speed approval of generic drugs, which still tend to cost far less than their brand name equivalents, health policy experts said.Capital Alpha Partners analyst Kim Monk, in a research note on Wednesday, said she expects advisors and Congress to steer Trump toward ""more Republican-oriented ideas,"" including pricing drugs based on their relative health benefit and requiring more disclosure of pricing details.
Consumer advocate Rother cited the FAIR Drug Pricing Act, introduced in September by Senators John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrat, as a potential vehicle for federal action. The bill would require manufacturers to explain annual price increases of more than 10 percent.""It is a bipartisan bill consistent with traditional Republican health policy based on transparency and competition,"" Rother said.In California, voters on Tuesday rejected a ballot measure that would have require drugmakers to provide state health plans with discounts similar to those given to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA pays the lowest prices in the country.   Drugmakers spent more than $106 million on a campaign to defeat the measure.     A similar measure will go before Ohio voters, who backed Trump in the election, next November. The coalition behind California's proposition on Wednesday urged legislators to come up with ""a more comprehensive solution to lower sky-rocketing drug prices.""

By Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON After years of rising U.S.-Russia tensions over Ukraine, Syria, cyber attacks and nuclear arms control, Donald Trump's election as U.S. president may offer a narrow window to repair relations as he and Russian President Vladimir Putin size up each other.But Trump's ascent to the White House carries the risk of  dangerous miscalculation if the U.S. president-elect and Putin, two willful personalities and self-styled strong leaders who have exchanged occasional compliments, decide they have misjudged one another, according to Russia experts and others.U.S. officials and private analysts predict that Putin, who has reasserted Moscow's military and political muscle from eastern Europe to the Middle East, will avoid openly provoking Trump before he takes office.""Putin has the ability to advance his interests in many different ways. Sometimes tactical diplomacy can help,"" said Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank.""We're in temporary truce phase,"" said Hill, who has served as the U.S. national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations and co-authored a book on Putin.Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, said Putin likely will wait to see if he can reach some accommodation with Trump to allow the lifting of Ukraine-related sanctions imposed by Washington and the European Union that have contributed to Russia's growing economic woes.During the campaign, Trump was criticized by his Democratic Party rival, Hillary Clinton, for praising Putin as a strong leader and saying ties with Russia should be improved at a time when Moscow and Washington are at odds over Syria and Ukraine.Trump rattled Washington's European allies with comments questioning NATO's mutual self-defense pledge and suggesting that he might recognize Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.Putin last year called Trump ""a really brilliant and talented person"" and the Kremlin said on Thursday that the U.S. president-elect's foreign policy approach was ""phenomenally close"" to that of the Russian leader.Putin ""has a future president who has expressed a desire to cooperate, who has expressed a desire to move away from the Obama policies. Why would you screw that up with a provocation?"" asked McFaul, now at Stanford University.In Syria, a U.S. official said, Putin appears to be extending a ""humanitarian"" pause in air strikes against moderate rebels holding the eastern side of Aleppo to give Trump an opportunity to affirm the willingness he expressed during the campaign to seek a more cooperative U.S.-Russian relationship.
""I think they were holding their fire for the purpose of decreasing the international pressure on them, and now, like the rest of the world, they may be taking stock of the current situation,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.But U.S. officials caution that Russia still may feel compelled to launch more attacks after dispatching a naval task force led by the aging aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov to the eastern Mediterranean in a show of force.CONFLICT IN CYBERSPACE
The U.S. government has publicly accused Moscow of hacking the Democratic National Committee and other party organizations during the election campaign, which Russia has denied. Trump declined to blame Russia, and the Election Day Russian cyber attacks that some officials feared never materialized.
Trump has not laid out a detailed Russia policy, and many in his party, including potential top advisors and cabinet officials, have taken a hawkish view of Moscow.Former House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally rumored for a senior post, lambasted in 2014 what he called Obama's weak response to Russia's land-grab in Ukraine. Putin, Gingrich wrote, is ""a ruthlessly determined leader motivated by nationalism and an imperial drive.""And while there was celebration in Moscow after Trump's victory over former secretary of state Clinton, who has been sharply critical of Putin, some Russians cautioned against euphoria.""The idea that it will be easier to strike a deal with Trump than Clinton is wrong. ... Everything will be tested when we get down to business,"" analyst Vladimir Bruter told the daily pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda before Tuesday's election.Some experts and U.S. officials say there is a high risk of miscalculation or even confrontation, given Trump's history of  taking slights and challenges personally. ""That's actually where reality is going to intrude,"" Hill said. ""Putin's pretty thin-skinned, too.""
Putin has a penchant for challenging adversaries, particularly when he senses weakness, and he has long made it clear that he intends to reassert what he considers Russia's rightful global role.Suspending a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium last month, Putin listed conditions for resuming Russian participation that amounted to a laundry list of grievances against the United States.The demands included lifting Ukraine-related U.S. economic sanctions, compensating Moscow for those sanctions and reducing the U.S. military presence in NATO's eastern European states to the levels of 16 years ago.Russia's bedrock concern ""is whether they believe the threat of U.S.-promoted regime change is abating under a President Trump,"" said Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Everything else is a secondary, lower-order problem.""Putin has accused the U.S. government of promoting widespread street protests in Russia following its 2011 elections, as well as the ""color revolutions"" in Georgia, Ukraine and elsewhere.On specific issues, Weiss said, there are few if any easy opportunities for rapid U.S.-Russian agreements.""The agenda's really threadbare,"" he said. ""We're basically at a standstill.""       (This version of the story fixes a typo in paragraph two) (Additional reporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow. Editing by John Walcott and Stuart Grudgings.)"

BELGRADE British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, setting aside his previous hostility toward Donald Trump, said on Thursday the U.S. Republican's presidential election victory offered economic opportunities and there was no need for Europeans to be despondent about it.""I may respectfully say to my European friends and colleagues that it's time we snapped out of general doom and gloom about this election,"" Johnson said after meeting Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic.      ""He is after all a deal maker. He wants to do a free trade deal with the UK,"" Johnson told reporters.Trump's upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton has delighted far-right politicians in France, the Netherlands and Austria but worried some mainstream politicians who fear it may be part of a populist, anti-establishment trend.""I believe that this is a great opportunity for us in the UK to build on that relationship with America that is of fundamental economic importance for us but also of great importance for stability and prosperity in the world,"" Johnson said.
Johnson was one of the leading proponents of the successful Brexit campaign to get Britain out of the European Union. Trump aligned himself with the Brexit movement during his campaign.   On Wednesday, Johnson, the former London mayor, congratulated Trump on his victory and tweeted that he looked forward to continuing the partnership between the two nations.
Johnson said last year that he feared going to New York because of ""the real risk of meeting Donald Trump"" after the New York businessman said parts of London were now so radicalized that police officers feared to go there.Later on Thursday, Johnson said on his Twitter account he had spoken to U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence.
""We agreed on importance of the special relationship & need to tackle global challenges together,"" he tweeted. (Additional reporting by Eric Walsh in Washington; Reporting by Ivana Sekularac; Editing by Mark Trevelyan and Peter Cooney)"

By Valerie Volcovici and Sue-Lin Wong
| WASHINGTON/BEIJING

WASHINGTON/BEIJING The election of climate change skeptic Donald Trump as president is likely to end the U.S. leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion: China.China worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in France's capital.By contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obama's measures to combat climate change. He has appointed noted climate change skeptic Myron Ebell to help lead transition planning for the Environmental Protection Agency, which has crafted the administration's major environmental regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and efficiency standards for cars and trucks.Beijing is poised to cash in on the goodwill it could earn by taking on leadership in dealing with what for many other governments is one of the most urgent issues on their agenda.""Proactively taking action against climate change will improve China's international image and allow it to occupy the moral high ground,"" Zou Ji, deputy director of the National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and a senior Chinese climate talks negotiator, told Reuters.Zou said that if Trump abandons efforts to implement the Paris agreement, ""China's influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance, which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase China's global standing, power and leadership.""Chen Zhihua, a representative of the Chinese delegation and official in the climate change division of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's economic planning agency, said Chinese and other countries' efforts will not change if the United States withdraws from the agreement. ""Action by the international community will not stop because of the new government of the United States. We still have confidence the international community will join hands and continue our efforts on climate change,"" he told reporters at the 200-nation U.N. meeting being held in Marrakesh to start fleshing out the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement.The Paris Agreement seeks to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Each country has put forward national plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
Some have raised concerns that without involvement and financial support from the United States, emerging economies like India may feel inclined to back out.One of the key advisors to Obama's team on climate change said he hoped China would take on the mantle and keep the global climate deal alive. Beijing should ""continue to work in the spirit that we worked together in and before Paris,"" said Andrew Light, former senior adviser to previous U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Change Todd Stern.CHANGING ROLE

It is an ironic twist for the government of the world's second-largest economy. For years, Beijing fought attempts by foreign governments to limit carbon emissions, claiming it should be allowed the same space to develop and pollute that industrialized nations had.But with its capital often choked by smog and its people angry about the environmental devastation that rapid development has wrought across the country, Beijing has become a proponent of efforts to halt global warming rather than a hindrance.""China is acting on climate for the benefit of its own people,"" said Erik Solheim, executive director of the UN Environment Programme.""I am confident China will take a lead role.""China has powerful domestic and global imperatives to play a high-profile role in continued global climate change talks, meant to avert more heat waves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels that could cause trillions of dollars of damage by 2100.
China sees a perceived role as global climate leader as way to bolster its aspiration to become a ""clean energy superpower"" by leading in renewable energy technology such as wind and solar power and asserting itself as a key geopolitical power.        Dealing with the pressures of continued urbanization in some of the world's largest cities has already put China ahead, said Andrew Steer, the president of environmental think tank the World Resources Institute. Beijing is innovating to build low-carbon cities, he said.    ""It sees carbon as an indicator of economic inefficiency,"" Steer said.Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton darkened the mood of delegates attending the current round of climate talks in Marrakesh.    Some delegates at the talks say that China is already setting an example.    ""China is surprising us daily. Whatever they've promised they're delivering,"" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, of Democratic Republic of Congo, who heads the 48-nation group of least developed countries at the talks.

By James Mackenzie
| KABUL

KABUL With so much riding on American support, Afghanistan is waiting anxiously to see if President-elect Donald Trump matches his maverick image and reverses policy or keeps to a path that has cost billions and committed thousands of troops to propping up a fragile ally.Much to the private annoyance of officials in Kabul, America's longest war barely featured in the election campaign, but few were expecting the billionaire property developer to beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.""It's been a complete surprise,"" said one senior Afghan official closely involved in national security issues. ""I think everyone was expecting the opposite result.""It (Afghanistan) wasn't a priority in the campaign, that's obvious. No one talked about Afghanistan at all. At least with Mrs. Clinton, though, you knew more or less what you were getting.""Afghanistan will nonetheless present the incoming Trump administration with one of its most intractable foreign policy challenges.The United States has spent some $115 billion in aid for Afghanistan, but 15 years after the hardline Islamist Taliban were toppled after the Sept. 11 attacks, a third of the country is out of government control and security forces are struggling.As recently as last week two U.S. service members were killed fighting the Taliban near the northern city of Kunduz, and expectations that Afghan security forces could survive without extensive foreign assistance have proved illusory.Faced with a mounting Taliban insurgency, Obama dropped his original aim of pulling out of Afghanistan entirely. In July, he decided to keep 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, shelving earlier plans to bring the numbers down to 5,500 and leaving it to his successor to decide how to move forward.
Before the election, U.S. officials told partners that Afghanistan, whose war-ruined economy depends heavily on billions of dollars in foreign aid, will not be neglected by the new administration and that ties will remain strong and close.""You can be assured that Afghanistan will remain at the highest levels of our foreign policy agenda,"" Ambassador Michael McKinley told an election day party at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, before the final results of the ballot were in.LITTLE INTEREST
However, Trump's ""America First"" doctrine has left many wondering if he will be willing to continue spending billions of dollars funding Afghanistan, particularly given his declaration that: ""We're getting out of the nation-building business"".
Among Afghans who use social media, a sense that the incoming president is opposed to their old enemy Pakistan made some hope his election would be good for Afghanistan, but there is little to go on for those trying to parse his public remarks.So far, he has shown little interest in Afghanistan, although his most recent comments suggested he favored keeping troop numbers at around 5,500, the level they were intended to reach by the end of the year before Obama shelved the plan and set the number at 8,400.But in other comments, he has described America's involvement in Afghanistan as ""a terrible mistake"" and appeared to set conditions on the U.S. commitment to NATO, which leads the Resolute Support advise-and-assist mission in Afghanistan.Security officials in Kabul say the threat that Islamic State militants could build their presence in Afghanistan should act as an incentive to keep a U.S. force in place, although they admit they remain in the dark about Trump's intentions.
""As Trump promised during his campaign that he would eliminate Daesh (Islamic State), we don't think he would withdraw American forces from Afghanistan as Daesh is a new threat for Afghanistan and the region,"" said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.""But we are still in a state of uncertainty and we will wait and see what Trump has for Afghanistan,"" he added.The decision will be vital for a country that is likely to depend on American support for years to come.""The United States will almost certainly continue to be the leading source of both military and civilian reconstruction aid to Afghanistan for years to come,"" the latest report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a Congressional oversight body, said only last month.In an interview with CNN television last year, Trump himself appeared to accept that it was too late to pull U.S. forces out.""And at this point, you probably have to stay because that thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave,"" he said, in the interview in October, 2015.

By Ellen Wulfhorst and Sebastien Malo

NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The election of Republican Donald Trump to be the next U.S. president raises questions about the impact his administration  could have upon immigrants in the United States and the nation's immigration and refugee policies.During his campaign Trump took a hardline position, proposing to build a wall along the United States' border with Mexico and deport millions of undocumented immigrants.He also said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria and that Muslims should be banned from entering the United States, a proposal he later reworded as a call for a limit on immigration from ""terror-prone regions"".Here are some experts' views:Jennifer Gordon, professor at Fordham Law School in New York and an expert on immigration policy:""Trump campaigned on a promise to deport over 10 million undocumented immigrants. To carry this out would require staggering resources. But given his attacks on undocumented people, one thing seems near-certain: he will exercise his authority to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that President Obama put in place to protect young undocumented immigrants. This will leave many hard-working undocumented teachers, housekeepers, lawyers, construction workers, students, health aides and doctors in a tremendously vulnerable position. Our country is richer in every way for their presence. We must fight with every tool at our disposal to defend the core American value of inclusion.""Lavinia Limon, president, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Washington:""We encourage our new president to continue the tradition of the best of American values including equal protection and respect for every member of society. Worldwide, millions are denied basic human rights and we are strengthened as a country when all of humanity is recognized. America has always been the beacon of hope for the oppressed and this must continue.""Throughout our history refugees and immigrants have been welcomed to America by presidents from both parties in war and in peace and the current global refugee crisis is no time to shrink from this leadership.""Gal Adam Spinrad, economic empowerment program coordinator, Refugee Women's Network Inc., Decatur, Georgia: ""The words immigrant, refugee, Muslim, walls and terrorism have ignited fear, hostility and division throughout the 2016 presidential election cycle.
""Refugees are scared right now. Their safety and future here feels more tenuous, and the messages they have heard throughout this election have in many cases revictimized and retraumatized them. They are concerned their missing family members won't be allowed to join them in America. They fear they will lose their green cards or be deported. Like their American counterparts, they worry about how they will get health insurance, whether they will be able to go to college, if their food stamps will be lowered, if they will lose the Social Security disability coverage they began receiving after an injury at one of the local chicken factories where many of them work.""Our hope is that the incoming presidential administration - supported by the legislature on both sides of the aisle - will retain a spirit of inclusion that makes refugees feel not only welcome, but safe.""Doris Meissner, director of U.S. immigration policy program, Migration Policy Institute, Washington:""The Trump administration can be expected to chart a very different course on immigration and refugee policy, as the candidate's views of immigration as a security and economic threat were central to his campaign. The most immediate changes are likely to be over refugee resettlement and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.""Mr. Trump has made clear his intent to end the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and it will be within the president's authority to set refugee allocations by country and overall. He also pledged to terminate the DACA program, which provides relief from deportation to more than 700,000 unauthorized immigrants whose parents brought them here as children. He has also pledged to increase deportations of unauthorized immigrants.""
Stephen Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice,  Cornell Law School, Ithaca, New York:""Donald Trump made immigration restrictions a big part of his campaign. Now we will see if he follows through on his immigration plans. Some actions, like reversing President Obama's executive actions that protect millions of young immigrants from deportation, can be done unilaterally. Others, like building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, will require Congress to change current law or spend billions of dollars.""Although Republicans will control Congress for the next two years, it is always difficult to enact significant immigration changes because immigration is so complex and controversial. Moreover, some of his immigration changes could be challenged in court. President-elect Trump stated in his victory speech that he will be fair to everyone. Let's hope he keeps that promise to immigrants.""  Jim DeMint, president, Heritage Foundation, and former U.S. Senator from South Carolina:""Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to reverse the liberal policies of the Obama administration and pursue a largely conservative agenda, and securing our borders was his signature campaign issue. While pundits focused on 'the wall' and who would pay for it, his proposals were more comprehensive. For instance, people overstaying their visas account for 40 percent of the nation's illegal immigrant population. Trump pledged to address that problem by fixing the nation's entry-exit tracking system.""As for refugees, President Obama announced plans to admit 110,000 refugees - 40,000 from the Middle East and South Asia regions - in fiscal year 2017. Trump's preferred plan is to establish 'safe havens' in Syria. He argues that this approach would safeguard ten times as many refugees as could be accommodated in this country.""
Mark Krikorian, executive director, Center for Immigration Studies, Washington:""A Trump administration will restart routine immigration enforcement. This is a major change from the Obama policy of ignoring most non-violent immigration offenders. This means more border fencing, penalizing crooked businesses and implementing a check-out system for foreign visitors to prevent overstays (the main source of new illegal immigration).""Regarding legal immigration, refugee resettlement from the Middle East is likely to be suspended, pending a bottom-up review of the system. Foreign-worker programs will be modified so they can't be used to replace American workers, as now. And over the longer term, our legal immigration system is likely to be shifted from its emphasis on family ties to one that focuses on skills.""Marielena Hincapie, executive director, National Immigration Law Center, Los Angeles:""The election of a candidate who staked his presidential bid on racist, xenophobic and misogynistic rhetoric has left our country more polarized than ever. President-elect Trump touted draconian changes to our immigration system, which should gravely concern everyone who cares about our values of fairness and equality. ""Many of Trump's immigration proposals don't square with our Constitution. Our communities have successfully beaten back similar ill-conceived proposals in states like Arizona and Alabama, and we will continue [to] fight - in the courtroom, if necessary - to ensure that the rights of immigrant and refugee communities are protected across the country.""David Bier, immigration policy analyst, Cato Institute, Washington:""Donald Trump promised to limit the flow of Muslim refugees. Current law leaves refugee admissions up to presidential discretion, and he could accomplish this on Day One. Compared to a religious test, barring refugees from countries with large Muslim populations would be easy to enforce and, assuming no reallocation, could reduce refugee flows by 40 percent. This would exclude Christians, however, whom he promised to save, and that could lead to pushback from Congress.""Trump may adopt one solution to which some Republicans have expressed openness: allowing Americans to sponsor their refugee family members. This could help Christian refugees while overcoming Trump's security objections for certain Muslims, since DNA could verify their U.S. connections and sponsors could receive thorough vetting.""

By Lisa Lambert
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, already in legal limbo after an October court decision, could find its powers scaled back by President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican-led Congress, according to members of both political parties, lobbyists and lawyers. That may mean the end of many of the agency's rule-making actions that have enraged critics, including a proposal to stop companies from blocking customers from class action lawsuits and another one to limit payday lending.Creation of the CFPB was authorized in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law enacted in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis. The agency began operations in 2011.An agency to protect consumers' finances was the idea of liberal Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Its creation is considered one of Democratic President Barack Obama's top domestic policy achievements.A Trump administration is expected to be hostile to the agency as it is currently formulated.""The election spells very bad news for the CFPB,"" said Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group at law firm Ballard Spahr. Many Republicans opposed the agency's creation. They now say they dislike its structure and believe it oversteps its authority in enforcement.""It's a very fragile thing. It was birthed in controversy and is under constant attack,"" said consumer attorney Deepak Gupta, who worked at the CFPB in its early days. ""It may not survive the way we know it through this administration.""A single director leads both rule-making and enforcement, and can be dismissed only for cause. Furthermore, the agency is funded by the U.S. Federal Reserve system, which means it is not dependent on the typical congressional appropriations process.
The Republican-led House of Representatives Financial Services Committee in September passed legislation without any Democratic votes that would change the name and structure of the agency and would create a five-member commission to govern it.Republicans also have pushed for the agency to receive funds from Congress to make it accountable to elected leaders.Both of those proposals would greatly weaken the power of Richard Cordray, the agency's original and current director.Obama has blocked these Republican efforts with veto threats.Trump, though he has not directly addressed the CFPB, has said he wants to roll back parts of Dodd-Frank. Trump could, if he wanted to, fire Cordray on the first day of his presidency, especially following an October ruling by a three-judge federal appeals court panel that found the agency's structure unconstitutional and that the president should be able to dismiss the director at will.
That ruling was put on hold while the CFPB decides whether to petition the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for a review or appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. The agency has until Nov. 25 to decide. Trump's administration could withdraw any appeal, letting the decision stand.Cordray, appointed in 2013, is halfway through his five-year term.Few in the banking industry think the entire agency will be eliminated. Democrats who support the agency will have a large presence in the Senate. Warren, who was Obama's first choice to head the agency, has promised that Democrats will fight efforts to defang it.Even some bankers want to see it stay. Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said his group would fight to maintain the CFPB in some form because it consolidates consumer banking rules under one regulator. 
A DIFFERENT DIRECTOR
Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Cordray could be replaced early in 2017, said Mark Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. Trump's transition team is already looking into Cordray replacements, he said.The law allows for the president to terminate a director over inefficiency, malfeasance or neglect of duty, which leaves room for Trump to find cause regardless of what the appeals court decides, Calabria added.Cordray has set precedent with enforcement cases that Calabria and other critics have called backdoor rule-making. ""Cordray has left the CFPB vulnerable to what his successor may want done because he didn't hardwire rule-making,"" Calabria said.If Cordray quits or is removed, statute calls for his deputy to step into the job temporarily. Acting Deputy Director David Silberman, also a strong consumer advocate, would likely continue to carry out the current agenda, said Quyen Truong, a partner at Washington law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.

SAN DIEGO The U.S. judge overseeing a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump and his Trump University told both sides they would be wise to settle the case ""given all else that's involved.""Lawyers for the president-elect are squaring off against students who claim they were they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing ""secrets"" from his ""hand-picked"" instructors. Earlier on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel tentatively rejected a bid by Trump to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign out of the fraud trial.Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students' court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business. Trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 28, and Curiel told lawyers he was not inclined to delay the six-year-old case further. Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said he would ask to put the trial on hold until early next year, in light of the many tasks the magnate has before his inauguration.Curiel said he would allow both sides to file briefs on whether to delay the case. He also indicated they should consider making a deal. 
""It would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that's involved,"" Curiel said.Petrocelli told reporters after the hearing that Trump might have to be a ""little more flexible"" about settling the case now that he is president-elect, although the lawyer wasn't sure his client would was willing.Curiel said that he would allow Trump to testify via video given his presidential obligations. 
In the tentative ruling Curiel, based in San Diego, said Trump's lawyers can renew objections to specific campaign statements and evidence during trial. Trump's attorneys had argued that jurors should not hear about statements Trump made during the campaign, including about Curiel himself.Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trump's pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Trump's lawyers argued that Curiel should bar from the trial accusations about Trump's personal conduct including alleged sexual misconduct, his taxes and corporate bankruptcies, along with speeches and tweets. They argued the information is irrelevant to the jury and prejudicial to the case. 
In court papers, lawyers for the students claimed that Trump's statements would help jurors as they weigh the Republican's credibility.""Defendants have not identified specific evidence that they wish to exclude,"" Curiel wrote on Thursday. ""Accordingly, the court declines to issue a blanket ruling at this time.""The judge also barred Trump lawyers from telling jurors that the university had a 98 percent approval rate on student evaluations. That rating is irrelevant as to whether Trump University misrepresented itself, Curiel wrote.Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit by New York's attorney general is pending. (Reporting by Dan Levine in San Diego and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Cynthia Osterman)"

By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump met on Thursday for the first time, setting aside the deep rancor that dominated the long campaign season to discuss the transition to the Republican's inauguration on Jan. 20.Their 90-minute meeting in the White House Oval Office, with no aides present, took place just two days after Trump's stunning election victory over Hillary Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state.Obama, who vigorously campaigned for his fellow Democrat to succeed him, had repeatedly called Trump unfit for the president's office, while the businessman had often dubbed  Obama's eight-year tenure a ""disaster.""But in separate post-election remarks on Wednesday, both men appeared to seek to help the country heal from a bitterly divisive campaign, and that tone continued into the White House meeting. Seated next to Obama after their talks, Trump told reporters: ""We really discussed a lot of situations, some wonderful, some difficulties."" He said Obama explained ""some of the really great things that have been achieved,"" but did not elaborate.""It was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future,"" Trump said, with a tone of deference.Trump, a real estate magnate who has never held political office, later met congressional leaders, including U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who has had a strained relationship with Trump.""A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry,"" Trump said on Twitter late on Thursday.Amid the efforts to bury hatchets, there were protests in a string of U.S. cities against Trump for a second day on Thursday as demonstrators expressed concern that Trump's election would be a blow to civil rights.""Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!"" Trump tweeted.Obama said he had offered assistance to Trump over the next couple of months, and urged the country to unite to face its challenges.
""We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,"" Obama said, adding he and Trump discussed a range of domestic and foreign policy issues and details related to the transition period.""The meeting might have been at least a little less awkward than some might have expected,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.    The two men's relaxed, cordial demeanor in front of the cameras was in stark contrast to the months of harsh rhetoric during the campaign.Trump used Obama as a punching bag during his campaign speeches, repeatedly attacking the president's policies from healthcare to an Iran nuclear deal. Both Obama and first lady Michelle Obama attacked Trump as temperamentally unfit for the White House and dangerously unprepared to have access to U.S. nuclear codes.Asked at a White House briefing on Thursday whether the meeting had eased any of the concerns about Trump that Obama expressed during the campaign, Earnest said: ""The president was never in a position to choose a successor. The American people chose his successor.""         
ON THE HILL
Trump went from the White House to Capitol Hill for meetings with Republican congressional leaders, most of whom had a frosty relationship with Trump during a campaign where he tore into the Washington establishment. Republicans retained control of the Senate and House in Tuesday's election, meaning at least some of Trump's agenda may find friendly terrain in Congress.Trump emerged from meeting Ryan, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to tell reporters: ""We're going to lower taxes as you know."" He added, in reference to Obama's signature healthcare reform of 2010 that is a common target of Trump and congressional Republicans: ""We're going to fix healthcare and make it more affordable and better."" Ryan has sought to smooth over his relationship with Trump and his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said he was ""excited for the potential for unified Republican government and eager to get to work with Mr. Trump.""
Trump also met for an hour with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, saying afterward that he had told the senator his top three priorities were better control of immigration and the borders, healthcare and jobs.In what seemed like a possible early pivot by Trump, controversial campaign proposals, including his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, disappeared for a while on Thursday from the president-elect's campaign website. His campaign later blamed a technical problem and the statements were returned to the website. Trump declined to respond when asked by reporters after meeting with McConnell if he would ask Congress to ban Muslims from entering the country.On another Trump campaign pledge, a top Trump aide, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NPR he did not expect him to spend much time trying to make Mexico pay for a proposed wall along the U.S. southern border, but ""it was a great campaign device.""Such proposals, along with his free-wheeling tone and frequent insults of critics and rivals, earned Trump the disapproval of not just Democrats but many in the Republican establishment during the election campaign.Trump's camp also showed signs it was beginning building a government, with names for top Cabinet positions being leaked. Steve Bannon, Trump's campaign chief, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus could be named chief of staff. Trump has long hinted that his Treasury secretary could be campaign finance chair Steven Mnuchin, formerly of Goldman Sachs, but there were reports U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling and J.P. Morgan's Jamie Dimon were also being considered.Thursday's start at fence-mending also included meetings between Vice President Joe Biden and his future successor, Pence, and between the current and future first ladies. Michelle Obama met privately with Trump's wife, Melania, in the White House residence. Michelle Obama has raised two daughters in the White House and the Trumps have a son, 10 year-old Barron. The two women discussed raising children at the White House, Earnest said.""Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!,"" Donald Trump said on Twitter.
