WASHINGTON U.S. Democrats' liberal firebrand, Senator Elizabeth Warren, threw down the gauntlet to President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday, telling labor union members there are financial and social issues where her party will fight him and continuing to blast the Republican.Battling bigotry is the first job for Democrats after the election, said Warren, of Massachusetts, giving a sense of how her party will operate now that it no longer controls the White House and remains the minority in both chambers of Congress.""We will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African Americans, women, Muslims, immigrants, disabled Americans - on anyone,"" said Warren, who sparred frequently over Twitter with Trump and criticized him on the campaign trail in the weeks leading up to Tuesday's election. ""Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this, not now, not ever.""She said Trump had ""encouraged a toxic stew of hatred and fear"" and during the campaign ""regularly made statements that undermined core values of our democracy."" 
In the speech to the AFL-CIO labor federation, Warren also said Democrats will resist attempts to loosen financial regulation, ""gut"" the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). ""If Trump and the Republican Party try to turn loose the big banks and financial institutions so they can once again gamble with our economy and bring it all crashing down, then we will fight them every step of the way,"" she said.
Warren did highlight areas of agreement. She said ""count me in"" on Trump's support of a new Glass-Steagall law to separate investment and retail banking, reforming trade deals, maintaining Social Security benefits, helping on childcare and college costs and rebuilding infrastructure.Warren rose to lead the liberal wing of the party during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. After Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's attempt to appoint her as the first director of the CFPB, she won a seat in Congress. 
In 2015, progressive groups and a political action committee pressed her to run for president. Since Trump's victory on Tuesday, many have already renewed their calls, for the 2020 presidential election. (Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)"	['Trump', 'Warren']	[]

By Alex Dobuzinskis and Joseph Ax
| LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Officials in New York and Los Angeles on Thursday said they hoped President-elect Donald Trump would not follow through on a campaign promise to withhold federal funds from ""sanctuary cities"" that shield people who are in the country illegally.The nation's two largest cities have sharply limited their cooperation with U.S. immigration authorities seeking to deport undocumented immigrants.President Barack Obama's administration has used so-called detainer requests to target undocumented immigrants convicted of criminal acts, especially violent ones.New York and Los Angeles do not hold undocumented inmates in jail at the request of the U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unless the detainer request is accompanied by a judge's order, officials said.Trump said during a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in October he would seek to deport major drug dealers. ""We have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out,"" he said. Trump early in his campaign pledged to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States and also threatened to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference on Thursday that New York would continue to defend undocumented immigrants.""We are not going to sacrifice a half million people who live among us, who are part of our community,"" de Blasio said, referring to an estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants living in New York. ""We are not going to tear families apart."" De Blasio said Trump's threat to withhold funds from sanctuary cities was ""dangerous,"" but it was too soon to tell whether the president-elect intended to follow through on all his proposals.
A spokeswoman for Trump did not return emails or a call.In Los Angeles, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti also voiced hopes over how Trump would proceed on the issue.""We comply with federal immigration agencies, but insist that detainer requests be handled constitutionally,"" Connie Llanos, the spokeswoman, said in an email. 
""It is Mayor Garcetti's sincere hope that no president would violate those principles, the very foundation of our nation, by taking punitive action on cities that are simply protecting the well being of residents."" California is one of five states that limit compliance with ICE detainer requests and similar policies are in place at 37 cities nationwide, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.Last month, a federal judge in Illinois found the ICE detainer requests were unconstitutional, but the ruling did not apply nationwide.

By Yeganeh Torbati and Phil Stewart
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama's foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor Donald Trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen.Due to take office on Jan. 20, Trump, the winner in Tuesday's election, campaigned at times to dismantle Obama's nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions Obama eased on Cuba. Trump also disagreed with foreign policy decisions that included the way Obama has deployed troops abroad to combat Islamist militant groups.In his most notable foreign policy achievements, Obama, a Democrat, used executive authorities that offered a convenient legal path around a Republican-controlled Congress committed to blocking his agenda.The U.S. Constitution gives a president broad executive powers to enact foreign policy. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have sought to exercise those powers by issuing executive orders, presidential memoranda and what are called findings.""He (Obama) relied on executive authority to build a foreign policy legacy,"" said Thomas Wright, director of the Project on International Order and Strategy at the Brookings Institution. ""That is all vulnerable to countervailing executive authority by a Trump administration,"" Wright said.Obama had hoped to pass his legacy on to Democrat Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state, but she lost the presidential election to Trump, a Republican businessman who has never held public office or served in the military. TRUMP PLANS UNCLEAR
Often contradicting himself during the campaign, Trump made it difficult to know for sure what policies he would pursue. Major constraints include budget caps, laws he cannot reverse without Congress, and the pressure that will emerge to replace policies he chooses to abandon.Trump said in an October speech that he would ""cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama"" on his first day in office, without saying who would determine their constitutionality.A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday on his latest plans.
EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ENACTED & RESCINDED
Perhaps nowhere has Obama faced more congressional opposition than in his pursuit of the 2015 deal with Iran, which Republicans and some Democrats said put too few restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in return for too much sanctions relief. Trump has vowed to dismantle it, although his statements on the deal have been contradictory. A president may tighten and relax economic sanctions by executive order.""Anything enacted by executive order can be rescinded by executive order,"" said Zachary Goldman, a former U.S. Treasury official now at New York University.Obama drew enough support from Democrats to block a Republican-led resolution rejecting the Iran deal, achieving a political victory but falling short of a consensus. Trump will have the added advantage of working with a U.S. Senate and a House of Representatives controlled by fellow Republicans.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he hoped Trump would ""see how much he can undo the unilateral actions the president took all by himself, which would not require us.""CUBA, DRONES
Breaking with longstanding U.S. policy on another issue, Obama restored diplomatic ties with Cuba in 2015. But facing opposition in Congress to lifting a broad economic embargo, especially from Republicans, he used executive actions to ease some U.S. sanctions.Obama capped his Cuba efforts last month with a sweeping  ""presidential policy directive,"" which also is reversible and sets forth mandates for government engagement, people-to-people exchanges, and greater U.S. business ties.Trump has taken contradictory positions on whether he supports the embargo or not.
Obama's aides said the easing of restrictions was aimed at securing enough benefits for U.S. businesses and travelers that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for any Republican president to reverse the opening to Cuba.Trump could roll back Obama's efforts to create greater transparency about drone strikes. Obama issued an executive order in July requiring annual disclosures about such strikes.MILITARY POWER
As commander-in-chief, Trump will wield the power to mobilize the U.S. military on short notice and without first seeking approval from Congress.Obama deployed U.S. troops to Iraq, Syria and Libya to help fight the Islamic State militant group by relying on the authority Congress granted President George W. Bush to battle al Qaeda. That same authority would allow Trump to ramp up U.S. deployments in fights against Islamist militants if he chose to do so.One former U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president can approve covert action and needs only to brief relevant leaders in Congress once the operation is under way.Trump's powers, however, are limited.He pledged to expand the Army, grow the Marine Corps, boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise the number of Air Force tactical aircraft from 1,100 to 1,200. For starters, that would require that Congress scrap government spending caps under the Budget Control Act.Trump's support for water-boarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, also would meet opposition. Congress last year passed legislation barring the use of waterboarding and other ""extreme interrogation techniques"" widely considered torture. Obama signed the measure into law last November.

By Peter  Eisler
| BETHLEHEM, Pennsylvania

BETHLEHEM, Pennsylvania The unraveling of the coalition that was supposed to carry Hillary Clinton to the White House had a lot to do with voters like Jim McAndrew in counties like Northampton, Pennsylvania.McAndrew, 69, a retired steel worker, voted Democrat in every presidential election for half a century. This year he stayed home. And Northampton County, a heavily white, heavily Democratic, largely working class area that backed President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, went for Donald Trump, a Republican.McAndrew, who voted for Obama in the two previous races, was intrigued by Trump, but decided eventually that ""all he does is insult everybody ... women, black people, white people, rich, poor. He's an idiot."" He considered Clinton, but was concerned by the scandal over her handling of classified material on a private email server as secretary of state.""I hated both of them, so I just said, 'the hell with it,'"" McAndrew said. His wife, also a life-long Democrat, went to the polls without him - and voted Republican. ""First time ever,"" he said.Trump's ability to flip reliably Democratic counties like Northampton helped drive his victory in the presidential election this week. It was critical to his win in Pennsylvania and other Rust Belt states, a bulwark in the Democrats' electoral strategy for winning the White House, and it helped fuel his victories in critical swing states, such as Florida and North Carolina.It's not that Trump's economic populism and ""America First"" messages generated widespread enthusiasm; he won some of those counties with far fewer votes than Mitt Romney captured as the Republican nominee in 2012. Nationwide, Trump's 59.7 million votes are about 1.2 million behind the 60.9 million Romney got when he lost four years ago, based on initial projections.But Clinton's troubles holding on to Democratic voters were far more stark. Some crossed party lines for Trump or backed an independent. Many just stayed home. Clinton won the popular vote with 59.9 million votes, 6 million fewer than the 65.9 million Obama won in 2012. And her weakness in traditionally Democratic areas helped cost her the electoral college that chooses the winner of the election.Clinton came across as a status quo candidate unlikely to shake up the Washington establishment, says Mike Sly, 74, a retiree and independent voter in Pinellas County, Florida, who backed Obama in 2012 and voted for Trump this year. Clinton's message failed to convince him that she would address his concerns about the state of the economy and rising health insurance premiums under Obama's Affordable Care Act.The race ""came down to basically what change do I think is going to happen, and how I think it is going to happen,"" Sly says. ""I felt that Hillary really carried too much baggage to be trusted.""
NEW COALITIONS
Clinton's loss in Florida, a key battleground state, stemmed partly from her inability to hold voters like Sly in white, middle- and working-class areas that previously went Democrat. In vote-rich Pinellas, a beach community popular with retirees in the Tampa Bay region, Trump won 48 percent of the vote, besting Clinton's 47 percent. In 2012, Obama won 52 percent.Nationally, initial projections show low voter turnout of just over 55 percent, the worst since the contested election of 2000, when Republican George W. Bush defeated then-Democratic Vice President Al Gore. In Obama's first victory, turnout was more than 62 percent.Clinton beat Trump among black and Hispanic voters, but her effort to forge a winning coalition by leveraging that strength in diverse, urban areas was upended by Trump's strength among whites. Meanwhile, Trump still managed to hold roughly the same level of minority support that Romney got in 2012.The pattern held true not only in rural areas, but also in many suburbs, particularly in the Rust Belt and the South, that tipped towards Obama in the previous two presidential races.""It was pretty much a base election, but one group was better at turning out their voters than the other,"" says Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida political science professor.
In Gates County, North Carolina, Trump's vows to crack down on illegal immigration and police Muslim communities for radicalism resonated, says Eric J. Earhart, 49, pastor of the evangelical Upper Room Assembly church. ""There has been a definite shift over the past eight years away from us being a Judeo-Christian nation,"" Earhart adds, and many congregants worry about that.The rural county of 12,000 people went for Obama in 2012 with 52 percent of the vote, but it flipped into Trump's column in this year's race, giving him 53 percent.Thomas Hill, 38, chairman of the Gates County Republican Party, says voters also were attracted to Trump's blunt speaking and his pledge to bring back manufacturing jobs that went overseas. Trump's economic message, which included a promise to kill free trade agreements that are unpopular among many working-class voters in industrial areas, also succeeded in Macomb County, Michigan, a predominantly white area north of Detroit. The number of voters casting ballots in the county jumped by more than 14,000 over 2012, and Trump captured 53 percent of the vote to Clinton's 42 percent.Four years ago, Obama won the county with just under 52 percent of the vote. ""You've got a lot of blue collar workers here (and) ... a lot of union guys, and they went Republican,"" says David Phair, 59, a construction worker and Trump voter who didn't cast a ballot in 2012. ""They're tired of politicians.""Phair also liked Trump's promise to end illegal immigration. ""I'm looking forward to how he's going to handle illegal aliens.""
DEFYING EXPECTATIONS
In Pennsylvania, Northampton County and neighboring Lehigh County, once reliant on steel companies, have bounced back from the industry's decline.In Bethlehem, which straddles the two counties, new development has mushroomed around the old steel mill, including a Sands casino resort with 2,400 employees. E-commerce companies, white collar firms and big corporations, such as Olympus, the Japanese imaging giant, have also  moved to the region. Lehigh and Northampton counties have a larger share of households than the state as a whole that earn more than $75,000, about 36 percent.All that suggests ripe country for Clinton. But the counties also are whiter and older than the country as a whole. And Trump dominated voting among older whites.Around the table where McAndrew has a weekly poker game in the basement of the United Steel Workers office in Bethlehem, the retired men of the city's steel mills have different opinions on why Clinton failed to match Obama's success in the region.But they agree that she didn't offer a compelling message. Among the five at the table, all lifelong Democrats, only three cast votes for Clinton.""She was going to continue everything the way it is and a lot of people think there are things that need to be changed,"" says Ken Rayden, 80, who voted for Clinton, but mainly out of party loyalty. ""She didn't show the people anything new."" (Additional reporting by Letitia Stein in Florida, Howard Schneider in Washington, DC, Gary Robertson in North Carolina, and Tim Branfalt in Michigan.

4	4	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-polling-industry-idUSKBN136015	Pollsters who predicted Trump win benefit from industry's miss	"


By David Ingram and Jeffrey Dastin
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A handful of small public opinion polling companies that bucked consensus and accurately called the U.S. presidential election for Republican Donald Trump are reporting being flooded with calls from investors and clients seeking their services. Most pollsters wrongly forecast Democrat Hillary Clinton as leading Trump ahead of Tuesday's election in the latest fiasco to hit the $20 billion public opinion research industry, only months after it failed to predict the British vote to leave the European Union in a June referendum.Among the few that got it right was a new industry player using a different method, South African firm Brandseye, which analyzes social media posts.With offices in Capetown and Johannesburg, Brandseye took an entirely different approach from traditional polling.The data-miner pays people around the world to sift through social media for relevant posts, a process known as crowd-sourcing, and then uses a computer algorithm to rate consumer sentiment about products or politicians. Its method pointed to a Trump victory. It also correctly called Britain's Brexit vote.""My phone has not stopped,"" CEO and part owner JP Kloppers said in a telephone interview on Thursday.Kloppers said venture capitalists have been calling about investing in the firm, and polling companies have inquired about its methods. Kloppers said the company was open to licensing its technology.Existing clients include ride-sharing firm Uber, banks, telecommunications firms and some government agencies, he said. He declined to identify the governments.""Elections come every couple of years, but there are companies and governments that need to understand every day and every week what's driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction,"" Kloppers said.
New methods, if successful, are of high interest to polling companies that are having difficulty reaching cellphone users or survey-weary Americans. ""The answer is ongoing research,"" said Krista Jenkins, director of the PublicMind survey research center at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. ""It's basically digging in as an industry and comparing the findings from your traditional telephone polls to data that is collected online.""POLLSTER ERRORS
Traditional pollsters base their results on questions posed to randomly selected people, often in interviews conducted live over the telephone. Among other errors that pollsters made ahead of the U.S election, they almost universally miscalculated how turnout would be distributed among demographic groups.
High-profile London-based polling agency YouGov PLC's stock dropped 4 percent on Wednesday after its new method of surveying people online failed to accurately predict the U.S. presidential election's outcome. Analysts were split on the reason behind the drop, and YouGov stock partly recovered on Thursday, closing up 2 percent in London trading. No one from YouGov, which primarily does research for corporations, was immediately available to comment on the business implications of the polling miss, a spokesman said.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project gave Clinton a 90 percent probability of winning the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the election. On its website, one of the possible scenarios was how Trump could win the election by adjusting turnout levels. Ipsos SA will assess what it got wrong, said Clifford Young, president of the French research company's U.S. public affairs unit.Election polling is generally not a big money-maker. Many polls are done by universities or the media, while private research companies use it to market themselves to corporate clients that provide more profitable work.Pioneering U.S. pollster Gallup last year abandoned head-to-head polls for the presidential race, saying it wanted to focus its resources on polls about issues.
The outfits that wrongly foresaw a Clinton victory will suffer damage to their reputation, said Alex DeGroote, a London-based analyst at Peel Hunt LLP who follows the industry.""They attach their brand to these polls. If these polls continue to flop, it's not going to help their brand credibility,"" DeGroote said.Among this year's winners may be Remington Research Group. The Kansas City, Missouri-based pollster correctly predicted that Trump would win the election battleground states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, although it missed Trump's surprising Wisconsin victory.The company, which frequently works with Republican politicians, conducts a mix of automated phone interviews and live phone interviews. It may have done relatively well because other firms were afraid of standing out from the crowd, said Titus Bond, the group's director.""A lot of pollsters, they want to be at the same number as everyone else,"" Bond said.Bond said he received three calls on the morning after the election from corporate clients in the pharmaceutical and fertilizer industries and three others from advocacy groups, all seeking to do business.

By Dan Freed and David Henry

JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want America's most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street.A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is traveling outside the United States, could not be reached.Trump's close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive.A person familiar with Trump's personnel efforts said the transition team's list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump.Trump's controversial rhetoric and behavior during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization.Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry ""got away with murder"" and would not be let off the hook.Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House.
At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trump's advisers would get ""the best and brightest"" to run the economy.Hensarling's office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job.""Serving in his Cabinet is not something I've indicated an interest in and it's not something I am pursuing,"" the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis.Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages.
A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon ""the worst banker in the United States.""However, Dimon has managed to retain a reputation within the banking industry as a distinguished leader, in part by the way he handled those scandals and the way he talks about JPMorgan's role in society as the largest U.S. bank.For instance, Dimon decided to have JPMorgan make big investments in Detroit, calling it a civic duty to turn around an economically challenged city. His memos, speeches and letters to shareholders are often sprinkled with patriotic language.""America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done,"" the 60-year-old chairman and CEO said in a memo to JPMorgan Chase employees following Tuesday's election. ""No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy.""
However, Dimon has said as recently as September that he would not want a role as Treasury Secretary. If he holds to that, it could put him and JPMorgan in an awkward position.Saying ""no"" to a presidential request to join the cabinet is unusual, and the bank would then be overseen by appointees from an administration Dimon rejected.Even so, his associates do not expect Dimon to say ""yes."" Dimon has said his determination to act would make it hard to make political compromises. Talking before an audience in September, he said the only job in government he would want is the one Trump is about to get.""I would love to be president of the United States of America,"" Dimon told the Economic Club of Washington. ""Until Donald Trump got to where he was, they said you'll never see a rich businessman who's never been in politics be president. I clearly was wrong about that.""

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday sent a request to Congress for an additional $11.6 billion in supplemental war-related funding, which would include money to fight Islamic State militants and sustain high overseas troop levels.The request, detailed in a letter released by the White House, seeks an additional $5.8 billion for the Pentagon for military operations in Afghanistan and fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and an $5.8 billion for the State Department and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for fiscal 2017.Obama made the request just before Congress returns to Washington for its ""lame duck"" session before the new Congress starts in January.""For the Department of Defense, this plan reflects the evolving nature of our military campaign against ISIL and our efforts in Afghanistan,"" U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.
