By Steve Holland
| YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO

YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has previously accused the Federal Reserve of keeping interest rates low to help President Barack Obama, said on Monday that the U.S. central bank has created a ""false economy"" and that interest rates should change.""They're keeping the rates down so that everything else doesn't go down,"" Trump said in response to a reporter's request to address a potential rate hike by the Federal Reserve in September. ""We have a very false economy,"" he said.""At some point the rates are going to have to change,"" Trump, who was campaigning in Ohio on Monday, added. ""The only thing that is strong is the artificial stock market,"" he said.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month that the U.S. central bank was getting closer to raising interest rates, possibly as early as September, saying that the Fed sees the economy as close to meeting its goals of maximum employment and stable prices.The Fed raised interest rates last December for the first time in nearly a decade, and at that time projected four more hikes in 2016. The Fed later scaled back that projection to two rate hikes this year in the wake of a slowdown in global growth and continued financial market volatility.
Trump, during the primary campaign, as he took on 16 Republican rivals, had called Yellen's tenure ""highly political"" and said the Fed should raise interest rates but would not do so for ""political reasons.""The Fed has been a target of some conservative critics in the U.S. Congress, who say the bank risked sparking inflation with its easy monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis.
Fed officials say their independence is critical to making sound policy decisions. (Reporting by Steve Holland in Youngstown; Additional reporting and writing by Amanda Becker in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

JERUSALEM Israeli supporters of U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have opened a campaign office in the occupied West Bank, saying they hope to get as many American expatriates as possible to cast an absentee ballot for their candidate.There are about 300,000 U.S. citizens in Israel, according to the non-profit group Republican Overseas Israel, which opened the office in the Jewish settlement Karnei Shomron on Monday. It estimates as many as 80,000 of them live in the West Bank, though it is not clear how many are eligible voters.The initiative has no official ties to the Trump campaign or the Republican National Committee (RNC), and the Israeli group opened the West Bank office, and a handful of others throughout Israel, with its own funds, said co-chairman Marc Zell.""We are however in close coordination with the Trump campaign and RNC to the extent that it's feasible,"" said Zell.A poll of Jewish Israelis conducted in May found 40 percent of respondents backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and 31 percent supported Trump. The poll did not specify whether those who responded were eligible to vote in the U.S. election.
Trump has accused the administration of President Barack Obama of lacklustre support for Israel. He has also rejected last year's nuclear deal with Iran, Israel's arch-foe, and has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.The new office in the West Bank is not staffed full-time but will be used as a ""logistical jumping-off point"" for outreach activity, Zell said.
Israel captured the West Bank, land where Palestinians hope to establish an independent state, in the 1967 Middle East war.Most countries view Israeli settlements built there as illegal and an obstacle for peace. Israel rejects this, saying Jews have been living in the territory for thousands of years.

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine on Sunday defended Hillary Clinton against criticism over her handling of classified information as secretary of state, saying she was unaware of the sensitivity of some information she exchanged over email because it had been ""improperly labeled.""In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation rebuked Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, for her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, saying she was ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified information.According to records released by the FBI on Friday, Clinton told the bureau's investigators in a July interview that she could not recall getting any briefings on how to handle classified information or comply with laws governing the preservation of federal records.Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, told ABC's program ""This Week,"" that the volume of information received by government officials often makes it difficult to know what information has been declared classified. ""There were emails that contained classified information that had been improperly marked. So when she received the email, the material that was classified - which is supposed to be flagged and identified as classified - in many instances was improperly labeled,"" Kaine said.
""We look at so much material, unless it is specifically pulled out and identified, it is difficult to know sometimes whether a statement or a paragraph is classified or not,"" he added.Kaine likened Republican Donald Trump's recent call for Russia to ""find the 30,000 emails that are missing"" from Clinton's server to the 1972 burglary at the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office in Washington that upended Richard Nixon's presidency.""He has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyber hacking to try to find more e-mails or materials, and we know that this cyber attack on the DNC was likely done by Russia,"" Kaine told the Sunday television program. ""This is serious business.""
Trump was referring to some 30,000 emails deemed personal by Clinton's lawyers that she has repeatedly said she chose ""not to keep"" while returning thousands of other work emails to the government in 2014. This has been widely interpreted as meaning that Clinton deleted the personal emails, but her staff have declined to confirm if this is the case.Clinton, who is facing Trump for the White House in the Nov. 8 election, has been dogged for more than a year by the fallout from her decision to use an unauthorized private email account run from the basement of her Chappaqua, New York, home.She repeatedly said she did not use it to send or receive classified information. The government forbids handling such information outside secure channels.
Contradicting Clinton's comment that she never exchanged classified information over her private email server, the FBI said that at least 81 email threads contained information that was classified at the time, although the agency said the final number may be more than 2,000. While the FBI has scolded Clinton over the handling of classified information, the agency recommended that no criminal charges be filed against her.Clinton has said that in hindsight she regretted using a private email system while secretary of state. Opinion polls show that voter concerns about Clinton's honesty and trustworthiness are among her biggest vulnerabilities. A series of surveys show the race has tightened over the past few weeks. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken during the week of Aug. 26 to Sept. 1, Trump had the support of 40 percent of likely voters while Clinton had the backing of 39 percent. Clinton's support has dropped steadily in the weekly tracking poll since Aug. 25, eliminating what had been a eight-point lead for her. (Editing by Caren Bohan and Alan Crosby)"

WASHINGTON A close ally of Donald Trump said talks about the cost of building a wall with Mexico was not supposed to be part of the discussion during Republican presidential candidate's recent meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.After the two met in Mexico last Wednesday, Trump told reporters they did not discuss his demand that Mexico pay the cost for construction of a wall on the border between the two countries.Hours later, however, Pena Nieto said on Twitter he did raise the issue of the cost of the wall.""At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,"" Pena Nieto said in a tweet.Speaking on CNN's State of the Union, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who accompanied Trump on the visit and was in the room during the meeting, said ground rules had been set prior to the discussion and advisers to the Republican presidential candidate and Pena Nieto's team had agreed the cost of the wall would not be part of the conversation.
""We were not going to discuss paying for the wall because that's not something we're going to agree about,"" he said.Giuliani acknowledged that the subject nonetheless was brought up by Pena Nieto.
""Maybe the president's staff didn't brief him on it, maybe he forgot about it, so he brought it up,"" Giuliani said. ""It wasn't right at the very beginning, it was sort of in the middle and I just briefly said 'that's not on the table.'""Trump has characterized Mexican immigrants to the U.S. as rapists and drug dealers. In a newspaper article a day after the meeting, Pena Nieto said he made clear to Trump that ""in Mexico, we feel offended and hurt by his pronouncements about Mexicans.""
Instead of focusing on what they didn't agree on, Giuliani said the ""very productive conversation"" focused on issues the two countries had in common, such as trade-related issues with China.""All the same complaints you hear from Donald Trump, President Pena Nieto would say exactly the same thing,"" he said. ""The same kind of dumping, the same kind of violation of a lot of the trade rules and regulations."" (Reporting by Toni Clarke; Editing by Caren Bohan and Alan Crosby)"

TORONTO Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Sunday criticized Donald Trump's potential plan to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and said the U.S. presidential candidate will likely lose the Nov. 8 election. Speaking on CTV's ""Question Period"" politics talk show, Mulroney, who in the 1980s signed a Canada-U.S. free trade deal, said scrapping NAFTA will hurt the United States.""Millions and millions of jobs in the United States depend directly upon their trade with Canada and Mexico,"" Mulroney said. ""You tear that up - my mother used to say, 'You're cutting off your nose to spite your face.'""Republican presidential nominee Trump has railed against the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico as a U.S. job killer, saying that if elected, he would be prepared to scrap it if he could not negotiate much better terms for the United States. 
The North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994 during the administration of President Bill Clinton, the husband of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.    Trump also has a hardline immigration plan that emphasized deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes. His proposals include building a wall at the border with Mexico.
Mulroney said that while Trump's rhetoric ""carried him through the Republican primaries,"" he does not think ""something that negative carries you to the White House.""

By Julia Edwards and Jonathan Allen
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton, under questioning by federal investigators over whether she had been briefed on how to preserve government records as she was about to leave the State Department, said she had suffered a concussion, was working part-time and could not recall every briefing she received.Clinton, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, raised the health scare during her 3-1/2-hour interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department prosecutors on July 2, according to an FBI summary released on Friday.Besides the 11-page interview summary, the FBI also released other details of its investigation into her use of an unauthorized private email system while running the State Department, in which it concluded she mishandled classified information but not in a way that warranted a criminal prosecution.Clinton told investigators she could not recall getting any briefings on how to handle classified information or comply with laws governing the preservation of federal records, the summary of her interview shows.""However, in December of 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion and then around the New Year had a blood clot,"" the FBI's summary said. ""Based on her doctor's advice, she could only work at State for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing she received."" A Clinton campaign aide said Clinton only referenced her concussion to explain she was not at work but for a few hours a day at that time, not that she did not remember things from that period. The concussion was widely reported then, and Republicans have since used it to attack the 68-year-old candidate's health in a way her staff have said is unfounded.The FBI report, which does not quote Clinton directly, is ambiguous about whether it was her concussion that affected her ability to recall briefings.The FBI declined to provide further comment on the report.  Clinton, who is challenging Republican Donald Trump for the White House in the Nov. 8 election, has been dogged for more than a year by the fallout from her decision to use an unauthorized private email account run from the basement of her Chappaqua, New York, home.
Republicans have repeatedly attacked Clinton over the issue, helping drive opinion polls that show many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness. Trump's campaign issued a statement immediately following the FBI report's release saying the notes from the interview ""reinforce her tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty."" Clinton has said that in hindsight she regretted using a private email system while secretary of state.According to the report, Clinton told the FBI that she did not set up a private email server to sidestep the law requiring her to keep her business communications a matter of public record. At least one federal judge is examining whether this was the case as part of a lawsuit against the State Department concerning public access to Clinton's government records, which the U.S. government said it had no access to in response to requests from members of the public.The documents also show that Clinton contacted former Secretary of State Colin Powell in 2009 to ask about his use of a personal BlackBerry phone. 
In his reply to Clinton via email, Powell told Clinton to ""be very careful"" because the work-related emails she sent on her BlackBerry could become public record.""I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data,"" Powell said, according to the summary.After her use of a private email system became public knowledge in March 2015, Clinton repeatedly said she did not use it to send or receive classified information. The government forbids handling such information outside secure channels.The FBI has since concluded Clinton was wrong to say that: At least 81 email threads contained information that was classified at the time, although the final number may be more than 2,000, the report said. Some of the emails appear to include discussion of planned future attacks by unmanned U.S. military drones, the FBI report showed.""CLINTON believed the classification level of future drone strikes depended on the context,"" the FBI's interview summary said. The U.S. government requires that military plans be classified.
The FBI released its report on Friday afternoon before the Labor Day holiday weekend, a time many Americans are preparing to travel. State Department spokesman John Kirby said he would not comment on the FBI's findings because the department ""does not have full insight into the FBI's investigation.""He declined to say whether State Department officials still discussed the planning of future attacks using drones in unclassified emails. ""I'm not going to speak to past email practices,"" he said. ""We trust State Department employees to use their best judgment when conveying sensitive information, taking into account a range of factors.""The Clinton campaign released a statement welcoming the report's release. ""While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case,"" Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement.Some Republicans saw the files as confirming their belief that the Department of Justice should have prosecuted Clinton.""These documents demonstrate Hillary Clinton's reckless and downright dangerous handling of classified information during her tenure as secretary of state,"" Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement. ""This is exactly why I have called for her to be denied access to classified information.""

By Emily Stephenson
| DETROIT

DETROIT Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stepped up his bid to win over minority voters by addressing a largely black church in Detroit on Saturday and calling for a new civil rights agenda to support African-Americans.As scores of protesters outside chanted ""No justice, no peace,"" Trump said he wanted to make Detroit - a predominantly African-American city which recently emerged from bankruptcy - the economic envy of the world by bringing back companies from abroad.Trump separately met with about 100 community and church leaders, his campaign said, in his latest push to peel away minority voters from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.His outreach to minorities over recent weeks comes as he seeks to improve his chances in the Nov. 8 election and shake off months of offending the sensibilities of black and Hispanic voters with his hard line on immigration and rough-hewn rhetoric.  ""I fully understand that the African American community is suffering from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right,"" Trump said at the church which was half-full. ""I want to make America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world, and we can do that.""His address of over 10 minutes at the Great Faith Ministries International church received moments of applause, including when he said Christian faith is not the past, but the present and the future.
Accompanying Trump to the church was Ben Carson, the former Republican presidential hopeful who grew up in the city and whose childhood neighborhood Trump visited on Saturday.Trump has argued that his emphasis on job creation would help minority communities in a way that Democrats have failed to. But Clinton has accused Trump of aligning himself with racists. Opinion polls show Trump has low support among minorities.
""I believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time, one that ensures the rights to a great education, so important, and the right to live in a good-paying job and one that you love to go to every morning,"" Trump said.""That can happen. We need to bring our companies back,"" he added.Emma Lockridge, 63, said as she entered the church that she found his comments about Mexicans and Muslims ""hateful.""
""That's my major reservation with Mr. Trump is how he's treated those particular sets of people,"" said Lockridge, who is retired and an environmental activist. But she said she also had concerns about Clinton's support in the 1990s for crime legislation signed by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, which many black Americans say contributed to high incarceration rates in their communities.Vicki Dobbins, an activist protesting outside, said she was disappointed the church asked Trump to speak.""I believe that Trump coming to Detroit is a joke, and I'm ashamed of the pastor who invited him,"" she said. ""In my opinion, he stabbed everyone in the back.""

PHILADELPHIA Donald Trump sought to sell Americans on his tough approach to immigration on Friday, meeting in Philadelphia with the family of a woman who was killed in a 2007 shooting that involved people who came to the United States illegally.Trump this week unveiled a hardline immigration plan that emphasized deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes. His plan was cheered by other immigration critics, but some Hispanic backers and moderate Republicans felt it lacked compassion toward millions of people in the United States illegally.Trump often points to examples of people hurt by illegal immigrants to defend his tough positions, which include building a wall at the border with Mexico, though some studies have found immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes.On Friday, he met with the family of Iofemi Hightower, who was 20 years old when she and two others were killed in a schoolyard in Newark, New Jersey.
At least one of the people convicted in the 2007 shootings was in the United States illegally, according to a New York Times report in 2010 about the trials. Another had likely entered the country illegally and later gained legal status, the paper said.""These are people that shouldn't be in the country,"" Trump told reporters. ""A lot of people don't even know, they have no idea the consequence of these people coming in.""
Shalga Hightower, 55, Iofemi's mother, said her family endured seven years of legal trials, as well as a period of homelessness and job loss. Asked if she would be supporting Trump for president, she said yes.Her son, Jamar Hightower, 26, said Trump was the only person paying attention to the problem of crimes committed by people living in the United States illegally.
""I feel as though this man is the only one that's actually standing up to do something about it,"" Jamar Hightower said. ""This is not a problem that just started. They've been here."" (Reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

By Deena Beasley

Two key U.S. congressional committee members on Friday called for an investigation into whether Mylan NV, under fire for raising the price of its EpiPen device, overcharged the government's low-income healthcare program for the allergy treatment.In a letter to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Frank Pallone, both Democrats, seek clarification of whether EpiPen was classified as a generic, ""non-innovator"" drug, or a brand-name drug by the Medicaid program.Under current law, branded drugs, and generic drugs available from a single source, are required to pay a rebate amount of at least 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price. Generic drugs are subject to a much lower 13 percent rebate.Mylan, in an emailed statement, said it has complied with all laws and regulations regarding Medicaid rebates, and intends to file with regulators, by next April as required under new guidelines, for EpiPen to be classified as a ""non-innovator"" product.
The device jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, food allergies and bee stings. Mylan, whose tax address is in the Netherlands but which has corporate headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, has raised the U.S. price of EpiPen from less than $100 when it acquired the product in 2007 to more than $600.
Amid an outcry by parents, consumer groups and U.S. politicians, the company said on Monday it will soon launch the first generic version of the device for $300, half the list price of its branded product. Wyden, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Pallone, ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, said in the letter on Friday: ""It has recently come to our attention that Mylan has classified EpiPen as a generic drug"" under the Medicaid rebate program, even though it is considered a new drug by the Food and Drug Administration.
Shares of Mylan, which fell 4.7 percent to close at $39.97 on Friday, have dropped 19 percent since mid-August. (Reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"
