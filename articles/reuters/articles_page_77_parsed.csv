U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the border with Mexico, boost spending on the military and slap trade tariffs on China.Here are those positions and others the New York businessman, who has never held elective office, has put forward to convince the American people that he should be the next U.S. chief executive. (For a Factbox on Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton's proposals, please see)ECONOMIC POLICY
Trump has proposed collapsing the current seven income tax brackets to three with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. The current top rate is 39.6 percent. He also would eliminate the estate tax, and slash the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent.Trump has proposed increasing spending on the U.S. military and infrastructure but says he would reduce spending on other categories by 1 percent each year. However, the Social Security and Medicare programs for the elderly would be exempt from cuts.His plan would allow families to deduct childcare costs from income taxes and offer further support through an existing tax credit for lower-income people. He would also provide six weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers through temporary unemployment insurance. He has proposed paying for it by cracking down on fraud in the unemployment insurance program and through other changes to the system.Some economists questioned whether Trump's ideas for reducing spending would be enough to make up for major tax cuts, particularly since many Republicans believe Medicare and Social Security must be revamped to control government outlays.IMMIGRATION
Trump launched his presidential campaign with his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and has said he would insist that the United States' southern neighbor pay for it.He has promised to triple the number of immigration enforcement officers, hire more Border Patrol agents and boost penalties for overstaying visas.Trump has said he would prioritize the deportation of people in the United States illegally who have committed crimes and of those who have arrived recently or overstayed visas.He would require people seeking legal status to leave and reapply. Trump said that after his immigration goals are achieved, he would determine what to do about people still in the country illegally.
Trump has proposed ideological screening, or ""extreme vetting,"" of people coming to the United States to determine whether they share American values. He has proposed a ban on immigration from countries where vetting would be difficult.Initially, he proposed a temporary ban on all Muslims from entering the United States. Critics, including some of Trump's defeated rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, said that policy would be discriminatory and likely violate the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom of religion. Others have since said his ""extreme vetting"" idea might not be feasible.        
WALL STREET REGULATION
Trump has promised a ""dismantling"" of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details.The Republican Party's platform calls for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said in July that his campaign backed this change.Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall.
        
ISLAMIC STATE 
Trump has offered few details about his plans to fight Islamic State but has said he would ""knock the hell out of"" the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump has said if he wins, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017 to propose their own plans.Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create ""safe zones"" there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states.President Barack Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
RUSSIA
Trump has said he would have a ""very, very good"" relationship with Russia. He has said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was a better leader than Obama.Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab.Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense.  NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that country's behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism.CHINA
Trump has made criticism of China's trade practices a central campaign theme. He has vowed to formally label China a currency manipulator, impose tariffs on Chinese imports and bring unfair trade cases as punishment for what he believes are improper subsidies.Trump has called for a stronger U.S. military presence in the South China Sea.He has said he would pull the United States out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Though the trade agreement does not include China, Trump has said he is concerned it could try to enter it through the ""back door.""TPP supporters, including Obama, have said China hoped to reach its own deal that would make it the leader in Asian trade. They have said the pact would enable the United States to take a leadership role in the region instead of China.

By Kate Kelland, Health and Science Correspondent
| LONDON

LONDON Oct 6 Officials from the U.S. government's health research agency are to be questioned by a congressional committee about why taxpayers are funding a World Health Organization cancer agency facing criticism over how it classifies carcinogens.An aide to the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform told Reuters that National Institutes of Health officials have agreed to give an in-person briefing to the committee after questions were raised by lawmakers over its grants to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a semi-autonomous part of the WHO based in Lyon, France.The hearing will be in private, with NIH officials answering questions from committee investigators, the aide said. The committee is working with the NIH to schedule the briefing soon, the aide said, but no date has yet been set. The briefing comes after the committee's chairman added his voice to growing concerns among some senior U.S. lawmakers about the way IARC reviews and classifies substances.In recent years IARC has caused controversy over whether such things as coffee, mobile phones, processed meat and the weed killer glyphosate cause cancer.Its critics, including in industry, say it is sometimes too quick to conclude that substances might cause cancer, causing unnecessary health scares. It defends its methods as scientifically sound.In a Sept. 26 letter to NIH director Francis Collins, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz describes IARC as having ""a record of controversy, retractions, and inconsistencies"" and asks why the NIH, which has a $33 billion annual budget, continues to fund it. ""IARC's standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,"" Chaffetz wrote.The NIH confirmed in an email to Reuters that it had received Chaffetz's letter and ""will respond directly to the committee"".
The WHO referred Reuters to IARC for comment. A spokeswoman for IARC told Reuters that Chaffetz's letter contained ""misconceptions"" which IARC's director, Chris Wild, has sought to address in a letter of his own to the NIH director.Wild's letter, dated Oct. 5 and copied via email to Reuters on Thursday, rejects Chaffetz's criticisms and says IARC's classifications, known as ""monographs"", are ""widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and ... freedom from conflicts of interest"".Wild also defends IARC's evaluation of coffee and disputed Chaffetz's description of it as a ""retraction"". IARC's previous assessment of coffee as ""possibly carcinogenic"" was updated in June this year, when IARC said it had found ""no conclusive evidence for a carcinogenic effect"".""The (coffee) report in 2016 was not a 'retraction' but a re-evaluation based on an additional 25 years of scientific evidence,"" Wild said.
FULL DISCLOSURE
Chaffetz, however, asks the NIH to detail its standards for awarding grants and the vetting and oversight of grantees. It also asks for full disclosure of NIH funds to IARC or money spent in relation to IARC's activities.Questions over grants awarded by NIH to IARC could put a significant portion of IARC's funding at risk.IARC's resources are relatively modest. Its 2014 revenue was about 30 million euros ($33 million).In his letter, Chaffetz's cites the NIH's grant database as showing that it has given IARC more than $1.2 million so far this year. The database also shows that since 1992, NIH grants to IARC have totaled some $40 million.
The American Chemistry Council also joined those voicing concern, issuing a statement following Chaffetz's letter accusing IARC of ""a long history of passing judgment on substances through a fundamentally-flawed process that yields questionable results"".""We welcome the interest of the House Committee ... and hope it will shed light on the close and somewhat opaque relationship between IARC and NIH, including the use of taxpayer dollars and resources to support IARC's activities,"" it said.IARC is also in dispute with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and United Nations and United States regulators over glyphosate, a widely-used weedkiller developed by Monsanto. IARC says glyphosate is ""probably carcinogenic"", while EFSA and several other regulators say it isn't. This dispute prompted Robert Aderholt, chairman of the U.S.  congressional Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, to write in June to NIH's Collins questioning funding of IARC.In that letter, Aderholt says IARC's conclusions ""appear to be the result of a significantly flawed process"" and adds that ""some in academia have raised questions about the quality of the science and the transparency of the process"". The glyphosate dispute also held up a decision on whether to relicense the product for use in Europe.

WASHINGTON A U.S. Republican Party website selling campaign stickers and other political gear is among thousands of websites infected with a credit-card stealing virus that sent data to a server in Russia, according to a Dutch security researcher.    A page on the National Republican Senatorial Committee's  website selling stickers, T-shirts and baseball caps was infected with a hard-to-detect virus that collected all information entered on orders, including buyers' names and addresses, credit card numbers and merchandise ordered, according to the researcher, Willem de Groot.De Groot, co-founder of Dutch e-commerce company Byte, said that he learned of the infection after conducting a web scan to find sites infected with the virus. ""I don't think it was a targeted attack,"" de Groot told Reuters.Other victims include clothing retailers, car manufacturers and local shops. He declined to identify them, saying he had not had time to notify them of the infection. The NRSC took down the website on Thursday and acknowledged that it had been targeted by a ""skimming operation"". NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said a vendor discovered ""an issue yesterday that affected an extremely small number of supporters.""
""The problem was fixed immediately and we are contacting those who were affected,"" she said in a statement. She provided no further details. The NRSC, a party operation dedicated to getting Republicans elected to the Senate, said it found no evidence that its primary donation system was hacked. The numbers affected account for less than 0.0018 percent of online donations to the NRSC, a committee aide said.
The committee had received more than $65 million in political contributions for the 2016 campaign, as of Aug. 31, according to Federal Election Commission records.     Researcher De Groot documented the attack in a video on his blog, in which he demonstrates that entering an order on the NRSC site causes the malware to send its details to a server in Russia. bit.ly/2dxNS6zThe malware was embedded into the site's code, which can be viewed using a common web browser, according to de Groot. 
A search of archived versions of the set led him to determine that it had been infected since at least March of this year, he said. The infection was earlier reported by the Dutch website Follow the Money, www.ftm.nl.      (Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and Toby Sterling in Amsterdam.

3	3	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-lichtman-idUSKCN1251WM	A Trump loss would 'upset the verdict of history': Allan Lichtman	"

 (Corrects this Oct. 5 story's headline to conform with quote from professor that a Trump defeat would upset the verdict of history.)The forces influencing the U.S. presidential election favor Republican nominee Donald Trump to win the popular vote - but even proven prediction models face ""the most difficult election by far to predict accurately,"" a political forecaster with a three-decade winning streak said on Wednesday.History Professor Allan Lichtman of American University in Washington has accurately predicted the popular result in presidential elections since Republican President Ronald Reagan defeated Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in 1984.Although the number of ballots cast by voters for each candidate counts, it does not ultimately determine who takes the White House. In a process known as the Electoral College, the candidate who wins a majority of 538 electoral votes is the victor. Each state and the District of Columbia is allocated a certain number of those votes, and the candidates have to amass them state-by-state on Election Day.While Lichtman's ""Keys to the White House"" analysis predicts a popular victory by Trump, some other models, such as FiveThirtyEight's and The New York Times', have given Democratic rival Hillary Clinton a large probability of victory.Lichtman joined Reuters Global Markets Forum to discuss his take on Campaign 2016. What follows are excerpts from that conversation.
Question: Why is Trump your favorite to win?Answer: With respect to my prediction, my ""Keys"" system is based on 13 true/false questions where an answer of ""true"" favors re-election of the White House party - the Democrats. They have exactly six ""false"" keys against them, just enough to predict their defeat.However, I also noted that Donald Trump is such a dangerously precedent-breaking candidate that he could upset the verdict of history and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
The two candidates have been repeatedly fact-checked by independent sources, and his lies vastly outnumber hers.Q: How big is the immigration issue in deciding the election?A: I think immigration is a very important issue. America is a nation of immigrants and immigrants have been demeaned for more than two centuries, the French, the Irish, the Jews, the Asians, the Mexicans, and now the Muslims. The two candidates have fundamentally different approaches to dealing with the issue.
Q: What is your expectation for the next two debates?A: Trump has got to convince voters that he has the temperament, knowledge, and background to be a dependable and effective leader. He can try to do that without losing his base, which will never abandon him.The first debate was definitely a lost opportunity (for Trump), which may be hard to regain for him. Obama lost the first debate (against Mitt Romney) in 2012, but voters still did not have as many doubts about him as they do about Trump. In terms of temperament, he could take a lesson from Pence, but Trump has a great deal of difficulty preparing for a debate or keeping himself under control.

By Emily Stephenson
| HENDERSON, Nev.

HENDERSON, Nev. U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump backed off from praising Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, saying he was unsure of his relationship with the Russian president who he has described as a better leader than President Barack Obama.The day after running mate Mike Pence appeared to break ranks with Trump during a vice presidential debate and called Putin ""a small and bullying leader,"" Trump adjusted his own previously warm rhetoric toward the Russian.""I don't love (Putin), I don't hate. We'll see how it works. We'll see,"" Trump told supporters during a campaign stop in the swing state of Nevada. ""Maybe we'll have a good relationship. Maybe we'll have a horrible relationship. Maybe we'll have a relationship right in the middle.""Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has criticized Trump, who often praises Putin, as being too cozy with the Russian leader and questioned the Republican's business interests in Russia. Those charges were repeated by her vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine during a debate with Pence on Tuesday.In response, Pence denounced Putin for his interference in Syria's civil war and support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.""The small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States,"" Pence said. ""The greatest nation on earth just withdraws from talks about a ceasefire, while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria.""The vice presidential encounter set the table for a second presidential debate on Sunday in St. Louis between Clinton and Trump, who needs to rebound from a rocky performance in his first debate, one that gave Clinton a boost in national opinion polls with the Nov. 8 Election Day only five weeks away.        In Nevada, Trump suggested Russia could be a valuable ally in the fight against Islamic State, also known by the acronym  ISIS.
""I will say if we get along with Russia and Russia went out with us and knocked the hell out of ISIS, that's okay with me, folks,"" he said.Trump celebrated a strong debate performance by Pence, the governor of Indiana, and said his running mate had won on style and on the issues.""He's getting tremendous reviews from me and everybody,"" Trump told a group of pastors and leaders gathered at a Christian academy in Las Vegas.DEBATE ATTACKS

The encounter between Pence and Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, was the only such debate between the vice presidential contenders, and the two spent most of their time attacking each other's running mates.For more than 90 minutes at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, Pence sought to project an image as a reassuring presence, in contrast with the bombastic Trump, while Kaine tried to frighten voters away from Trump and make Clinton seem more trustworthy.A CNN/ORC snap poll declared Pence the winner with 48 percent support, compared with 42 percent for Kaine, who frequently interrupted his opponent.The television audience for the debate was 35.6 million viewers, according to preliminary data, about half the number who watched the first encounter between Trump and Clinton.    
Republican strategists said Pence's strong debate performance could provide lessons for Trump on how to approach the second debate - if he was willing or able to learn.""Trump should hopefully learn a lesson - don't get angry, don't lose your cool, answer the question you want to answer,"" Republican strategist John Feehery said. ""The biggest thing is to not get rattled and be able to smile when you are attacked.""Clinton met with advisers at her Washington, D.C., home on Wednesday and did not appear on the campaign trail. An aide said she spoke by phone with Kaine and congratulated him on his debate performance.""Mike Pence didn't want to defend Donald Trump, and as Senator Kaine said, if you can't defend the person at the top of the ticket, how can you ask people to vote for you,"" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told reporters outside her house.(This story corrects quote in 3rd paragraph to put Putin in parentheses) (Additional reporting by Amanda Becker; Writing by John Whitesides; Editing by Alistair Bell)"	['Pence', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]

America must work with all nations to build stronger economies, recognizing the inequalities that globalization can generate but refusing to give in to protectionism, U.S. President Barack Obama wrote in the Economist on Thursday.Months before he leaves the White House in January, Obama wrote that a certain anxiety over globalization had taken hold in the United States, not unlike the discontent leading to Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union. ""The world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease,"" the Democratic president wrote.""So we have a choice - retreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalization while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.""Calling capitalism the greatest driver of prosperity the world has ever known, Obama argued that trade had helped the U.S. economy much more than hurt it.
His enthusiastic advocacy for trade runs counter to the stated policies of both his potential successors, who say many trade deals hurt U.S. workers.The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal championed by the president is opposed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, Hillary Clinton, whom Obama has endorsed.
Obama listed four major structural challenges facing the United States - ""boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, ensuring that everyone who wants a job can get one and building a resilient economy that's primed for future growth.""Trumpeting the achievements of his eight-year presidency, led by preventing the 2007-2009 recession from turning into a depression, Obama said a foundation was laid for a better future.
""America must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,"" he wrote. (Reporting by Mohammad Zargham in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Confronted by Russia in Syria, Ukraine and cyberspace, the next U.S. president will be the fourth to face Vladimir Putin and the challenge of deterring a Kremlin often more willing than the White House to take risk and project power.Over the last four years, the Russian president has annexed Crimea and destabilized eastern Ukraine, stymied U.S. hopes to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and mounted cyber attacks that U.S. officials blame on hackers commanded or orchestrated by Russian intelligence agencies.In his latest gambit, Putin this week suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium.While the United States has imposed economic sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine, these have yet to force it to calm tensions in eastern Ukraine, let alone surrender Crimea.Some current and former U.S. officials argue the White House has failed to understand Putin's bitterness about the decade after the Soviet Union collapsed, at a time the Russian leader feels the West took advantage of Russia when it was down.Further, they say the United States has little influence over the course of democracy in Russia, or on its willingness to use force in Syria, Ukraine or elsewhere to achieve its ends.The result, critics say, could be that Syria festers, Ukraine stays off balance and unable to draw closer to Europe, and that even areas such as arms control and nonproliferation, pillars of cooperation during the Cold War, could deteriorate.""For Putin and most of the Russian leadership, it's a zero-sum world,"" said Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank.Weiss argued the Russian leader was unlikely to change his stripes before Russia's 2018 presidential election ""in an atmosphere where Putin's own domestic political fortunes depend on having this external enemy, namely the United States"". NO RESISTANCE SO FAR  

A U.S. official suggested Putin, who has yet to tip his hand but is expected to run again, is willing to use force to get his way while the White House, scarred by the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is not.""The administration never understood how bruised Putin and many, many Russians feel about the 1990s, or how determined they are to regain what they consider Russia's rightful place in the world, much less what Putin is willing to do to get there,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""He will keep pushing until he meets serious resistance, and so far he hasn't,"" the official added.In the eyes of many current and former U.S. officials, Syria is a case in point.The United States this week announced it was suspending  talks with Russia on a ceasefire, all but saying the Russian and Syrian assault on Aleppo had made a mockery of the peace effort.""Where they make a desert, they call it peace,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said, quoting the Roman historian Tacitus.
Analysts believe Aleppo is likely to fall but the war, now in its sixth year, will grind on with Assad surviving atop a shrunken, broken and fragmented country enduring the world's worst refugee crisis since World War Two.U.S. officials say the White House has yet to decide what to do next on Syria but few expect Obama to shift strategy in his waning months in office.It is not considering imposing further sanctions on Russia for now, two U.S. officials said.'RUSSIAN WEAKNESS IS REAL'

On Monday, Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signaling he is willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States.""If the relationship worsens, either side could be looking to exert leverage or score points in the nuclear arms control realm,"" said Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association.Another area where the United States is weighing its options is the stealthy war in cyberspace that is already under way with Russia and could escalate as relations worsen.U.S. officials anonymously say Russian intelligence services have interfered in the U.S. election process by launching cyber intrusions into the presidential campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and other U.S. political organizations and state election offices.The Kremlin denies the allegations.The White House has refrained from publicly accusing Russia. If hard evidence of Russia's involvement emerges, Washington has a dilemma in fashioning a response because, by going public, it could tip Moscow to its own intrusions, prompting retaliation.Two U.S. officials suggested critics are taking too short term a view, arguing it can take years to achieve an objective, such as the liberation of the Baltic states from Soviet rule.Cold War-like policies, such as using economic sanctions to weaken Russia's economy or deploying NATO troops to the Baltics and Poland in January to deter Russia, may work over time.""There's no quick fix with the Russians,"" said one official.

NEW YORK An estimated 37 million Americans watched the U.S. vice presidential debate between Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine on television, according to Nielsen data on Wednesday, less than half the number who tuned in to Donald Trump's first matchup with Hillary Clinton last week.The figure represented the average audience across nine channels during Tuesday's 90-minute encounter. Broadcaster NBC pulled in the biggest audience with 7 million viewers. Fox News Channel led cable networks with 6.1 million.  Last week's first debate between the presidential candidates for the Nov. 8 election, Republican Trump and Democrat Clinton, was watched by a record 84 million TV viewers.Vice presidential debates have traditionally attracted smaller TV audiences, with the exception of the 2008 encounter between Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin, which set a record for a VP debate of 69.9 million viewers.
The 2012 vice presidential encounter between Biden and Republican Paul Ryan was watched by 51.4 million Americans.None of the figures for the debates include those who watched online, through social media, or in bars and restaurants. 
Tuesday's 90-minute face-off between Pence, governor of Indiana, and Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, was the only debate between the vice presidential contenders before the election next month.

By David Shepardson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Ford Motor Co (F.N) Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said on Wednesday he has met with Donald Trump to talk about the Republican presidential candidate's extensive criticism of the automaker's investments in Mexico.Ford told the Economic Club of Washington that he thought Trump's criticism of the No. 2 automaker's foreign investments were ""infuriating and ""frustrating"" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States. Trump has threatened if elected to impose hefty tariffs on Ford imports from Mexico.Ford told reporters after the event that the session with Trump was a ""great meeting"" that took place a few months ago.""He was very thoughtful, asked good questions,"" Ford said of Trump. ""He certainly knows the facts."" Asked if Trump had changed his mind about his criticism, Ford did not directly answer but said, ""The campaign trail is a different animal than anything I'm ever familiar with.""A person briefed on the matter said the meeting took place in New York this summer at the real estate mogul's Trump Tower. The automaker had previously invited Trump to visit its headquarters at Dearborn, Michigan but he has not taken the company up on the offer.
Ford rejected the criticism from Trump, noting that it employs more U.S. workers and builds more vehicles in the United States than its rivals. ""We should be celebrated I think in some ways as the great American car company,"" Ford said. ""We make more cars and trucks here than anyone else.""Ford announced last month that all of the company's small-car production would be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from the White House hopeful. 
Ford has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move -- and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. Trump called Ford's decision ""horrible."" He has criticized Ford's Mexican investments for more than a year and vowed to pressure the automaker to reverse course if elected. ""We shouldn't allow it to happen,"" Trump said.Trump has also repeatedly misstated Ford's plans at times, wrongly suggesting last month Ford would ""fire all of their employees in the United States.""Many major automakers have announced big expansions in Mexico, where labor rates are much lower than what U.S. workers make.
A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately comment.Last year, Ford said that chief executive Mark Fields had written to Trump to explain its investments in Mexico. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Alistair Bell)"	['Trump']	[]
