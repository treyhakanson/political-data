WASHINGTON A Maryland man who is a delegate for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been indicted for illegally shipping explosives, owning a machine gun and producing child pornography, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.Caleb Bailey, 30, was indicted by a grand jury in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Wednesday. He was elected to be a delegate for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and is still listed as one on the state's board of elections website. Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, confirmed Bailey had been indicted and told Reuters the party was asking Bailey to resign from the delegation.""I don't know too much about him beyond what I've read,"" said Cluster, who declined to comment further.Bailey had hundreds of illegal weapons stored in a bunker beneath his garage, including dozens of machine guns, smokeless grenades and gas canisters, along with ready-to-eat meals, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.
Telephone calls and emails seeking comment from Bailey, from the Trump campaign and from the Maryland board of elections were not returned on Thursday.Trump has been working to unify the Republican party going into its presidential nominating convention in Cleveland in July.In March, a New Hampshire man who co-chaired Trump's veterans coalition in the state was extradited to Nevada to face charges of helping organize the high-profile 2014 armed standoff with federal agents at the ranch of Cliven Bundy.
The four-count indictment against Bailey alleges that he used a minor to ""engage in sexually explicit conduct to produce child pornography"" and illegally owned a machine gun.Authorities became aware of Bailey after he tried to ship explosives and ammunition from Maryland to Wisconsin through the U.S. mail in February, said an affidavit filed by a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
Some of the types of cartridges Bailey was sending to Wisconsin are no longer used by the U.S. military because they are too dangerous, the law enforcement official said, so shipping them was ""not only illegal, but posed a significant public risk.""The Wisconsin recipient is under investigation as well, according to the official.Bailey attempted to ship five such packages in total, but one broke open at the post office, prompting the facility to call law enforcement, according to the affidavit.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers are looking to use a defense policy bill to increase restrictions on military aid for Pakistan, expressing frustration with what they see as Islamabad's failure to crack down on Afghanistan's militant Haqqani network.The $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, passed by the House of Representatives late on Wednesday would block $450 million in aid to Islamabad unless it does more to fight the network, which lawmakers see as a major threat to U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The bill requires the Pentagon to certify that Pakistan is conducting military operations to disrupt the Haqqani network, not letting the network use North Waziristan as a safe haven and actively coordinating with Afghanistan's government to fight the network along their border.As they finalized the 2017 version of the annual bill, House members added three amendments related to Pakistan. All passed by unanimous voice vote.One added a fourth requirement to the release of the aid, that the administration certify Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani network senior leaders and mid-level operatives.
Another required that the Secretary of Defense certify  Pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment provided by the United States to persecute minority groups.And a third added a ""sense of Congress"" that Shakil Afridi is an international hero and calls for his immediate release from prison. Afridi is a Pakistani doctor believed to have helped the CIA hunt down Osama bin Laden.
Pakistan sentenced Afridi in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to a militant group, which he denies. That sentence was overturned and Afridi is now awaiting trial on another charge.Pakistan says its courts will decide Afridi's fate, and has angrily criticized U.S. politicians, including Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, over calls to release him.The House version of the NDAA is not the final version of the legislation. It must be combined with a Senate bill before being sent to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign, or veto.
However, there is also strong criticism of Pakistan in the Senate. This month, Senator Bob Corker used his authority as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to bar the use of any U.S. funds for Pakistan to buy American F-16 fighter jets.

By Daniel Bases and Susan Heavey
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers on Thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legislation to help address Puerto Rico's unpayable debt burden, which now threatens a full-blown humanitarian crisis.Released close to midnight on Wednesday, the House Natural Resources Committee's revised bill includes a strong oversight board to direct how and when the island pays its bills and leaves many earlier proposals in place. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its roughly $70 billion in debt while trying to cope with a 45 percent poverty rate among its 3.5 million U.S. citizens. In addition, it is reeling from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry.Language allowing Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, known as a ""cram-down,"" remains. The bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders, but the language remains muddied, one analyst surmised.""Tonight, we introduced legislation to responsibly address the crisis in Puerto Rico. The revised bill incorporates technical refinements and input from all stakeholders,"" committee Chairman Rob Bishop said in a statement.For a link to a factbox on the bill, click.While both Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives welcomed the bill after several delays, how more conservative Republican lawmakers view the legislation is an open question.A vote on the bill by the House is expected in the first week of June, ahead of a looming $1.9 billion debt payment due on July 1.In recent months, the debt crisis has threatened a deepening humanitarian crisis as hospitals close wards, social services decline and emigration saps more economic activity.""After long bipartisan negotiations, we believe we have achieved a restructuring process that can work,"" U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Thursday.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, who faces opposition to the bill from within his own Republican ranks, highlighted the bipartisan effort as he will need Democrat votes to get it passed.""Right now, the stability of the U.S. territory is in danger, as the Puerto Rican government continues to default on major loan payments. We have insisted that our response meet basic principles, and first among them is protecting taxpayers from a bailout,"" Ryan said in a statement.PROMESA
The bill, formally known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), seeks to return the island to solvency, rebuild a base for economic growth and maintain its ability to access capital markets in the future.
The White House called the bill an ""important first step"" in creating a fair process for restructuring Puerto Rico's debt and economy after a decade of recession.The U.S. territory's governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, said he was encouraged by the bill but chafed at the oversight board, which he believes undermine the island's self-governance.Choosing the members of the oversight board has been a sticking point in the talks leading up to the introduction of the bill.U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Thursday he was pleased the bill includes ""restructuring tools for Puerto Rico that are comprehensive and workable"" but expressed disappointment that proposals to promote economic growth were left out of what he called a ""tough bipartisan compromise.""       In the early drafts of the bill, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, said he was not satisfied, meaning a potential hurdle for passing the bill could remain.
A conservative Tea Party favorite, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, said he was reviewing the bill but told Reuters he thought a majority of Republicans would ""support it through both houses of Congress.""Many creditors lobbied for a bill that does not create new precedents for how they might be treated in a restructuring which would potentially set up future legal fights on the U.S. mainland that are far away from the island's current crisis.""The bill, which creates a control board and allows for bankruptcy, is highly controversial and does not definitively protect any creditors. We believe the legislation is more positive for both GO and COFINA creditors than the legislation previously under review,"" wrote Heights Securities analyst Daniel Hanson.Hanson said the bill lacks clarity over the treatment of constitutionally protected bondholders versus pensioners.A local bondholder group said it supported the bill. ""As imperfect as it may be, the bipartisan bill is the 'pause' that is desperately needed so everyone can come together to forge a bright future for all Americans living in Puerto Rico,"" said Jorge Irizarry, president of the Backyard Bondholders, which represents more than 60,000 resident bondholders in Puerto Rico.  GO, or General Obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the island and are senior to all debt, while COFINA debt is backed by sales tax revenues.""This territories-clause bill, which will bring all creditors to the table and establish a strong and independent fiscal oversight board, should appeal to conservatives who were concerned about a 'bailout' or 'contagion,'"" the COFINA Senior Bondholders Ad Hoc Group said in a statement. Investors bid up prices on Puerto Rico's benchmark July 2035 GO debt to 66, a gain of 0.50 point in price to yield 12.797 percent, according to MSRB data.

By Dave McKinney
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO The Illinois Senate on Thursday earmarked $227.2 million for low-income college students whose need-based financial aid has been imperiled by the state's 11-month budget impasse.But Republican Governor Bruce Rauner offered no sign of supporting the measure for Monetary Award Program recipients after members of his party pilloried the funding package as a ""farce"" because it did not identify a specific revenue stream to pay for it.Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelley declined to say whether the governor intends to sign or veto the legislation, saying only ""Governor Rauner remains committed to reaching a balanced budget alongside meaningful reforms in a bipartisan manner.""Illinois' public universities and community colleges and the MAP program have only received a fraction of what they had expected from the state since July because Rauner and the Democratic-led legislature have yet to agree on a Fiscal 2016 spending plan.
A stopgap $600 million higher-education funding package enacted by Rauner last month offered some relief, but an early-May effort to appropriate an additional $454 million on top of the April total stalled in the Illinois House of Representatives after passing the Senate.In fiscal 2015, the last year in which Illinois had a full operating budget, the state appropriated $357.1 million to the MAP program. That amount provided for income-based grants of up to $4,968 to 128,399 students, the Illinois Student Assistance Commission reported.  
State Senator Donne Trotter, a Chicago Democrat and the legislation's chief sponsor, said the package would ""ensure that our students can relieve themselves of some of the drama they've been going through this year because of the inaction by this body and the governor"" in passing a budget.But Republicans ripped the plan, with Senator Chapin Rose, a Republican from Mahomet, Ill., about 200 miles south of Chicago, accusing the Senate majority of ""writing a check that it darn well knows cannot be cashed.""
The Senate passed the bill 39-15, with two members voting present - enough to override any potential Rauner veto. But the 68-45 margin during a Tuesday House vote fell three votes short of a veto-proof majority, meaning Rauner could kill the measure if he chose to.

By Steve Holland and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pivoted to a general election match-up against Republican candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he is dangerously unpredictable and not qualified to be president.Confident that she is finally close to defeating U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination, Clinton turned heavy fire on Trump, who has been running about even with her in national polls of voters looking ahead to the Nov. 8 presidential election.On the Republican side, Trump promoted top aide Paul Manafort to serve as campaign manager and chief strategist, the Trump campaign said. Corey Lewandowski, the Trump aide who has been campaign manager, retains that title and will continue to oversee day-to-day operations, the campaign said.In addition, Trump has hired veteran Republican lawyer A.B. Culvahouse to help vet potential vice presidential running mates, a source close to the campaign said.In a CNN interview, Clinton used the example of the apparent downing of an EgyptAir plane from Paris to Cairo to say that Trump would lack the skills to bring together U.S. allies to respond to global threats.""I know how hard this job is and I know we need steadiness, as well as strength and smarts in it, and I have concluded that he is not qualified to be president of the United States,"" Clinton said.Trump, the Republicans' presumptive presidential nominee, has been intensifying his criticism of Clinton by lobbing personal attacks at her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, said she would resolutely refuse to respond to Trump's goading. ""He can say whatever he wants,"" she said.
But she said the EgyptAir crash reinforces the need for American leadership and that Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States has sent the wrong signal to countries that Washington will need to work with in the fight against Islamic militants.""He says a lot of things that are provocative, that actually make the important task of building this coalition, bringing everybody to the table and defeating terrorism more difficult,"" she said. ""It sends a message of disrespect and it sends a message that makes the situation inside those countries more difficult.""Clinton suggested the Democratic race was over because of her nearly insurmountable lead in delegates to the nominating convention, despite Sanders' insistence on staying in the race.""I will be the nominee for my party,"" she said. ""That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won't be.""
She said Sanders will have to eventually help her unify the Democratic Party after the prolonged nomination fight.""I am absolutely committed to doing my part, more than my part. But Senator Sanders has to do his part,"" she said.The Sanders campaign rebuffed Clinton's nudge to get out of the race, pointing to his recent victories.""In the past three weeks voters in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton. We expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree,"" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said.
Trump stepped up efforts to rally Republican loyalists behind his campaign after winning a divisive primary fight that left the party ruptured.On Capitol Hill, Manafort and other Trump aides met with conservatives in the House of Representatives who are members of the Freedom Caucus group and canvassed them for policy ideas.""Manafort was reaching out for ideas"" on policy, and several Freedom Caucus members made suggestions, said Republican Representative Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee.""It went very well, it was encouraging. I think the Trump team recognizes the relevance of the Freedom Caucus, and the influence they have. I think actually, despite some early skepticism by some members, I think the (Freedom Caucus) board received Manafort and his representation of Trump very well,"" DesJarlais said.Manafort also met with U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a Tea Party Republican who was a big backer of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for president. Lee has expressed some concerns about Trump's candidacy. A spokesman for Lee said U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a key Trump adviser, was also at the meeting.

By Sharon Bernstein
| SACRAMENTO, Calif.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. The California Senate on Thursday passed a sweeping package of gun control bills that would require background checks for ammunition purchasers, ban possession of high-capacity magazines and establish a firearms violence research center.The bills, whose passage through the Assembly are far from assured, are at the heart of a political duel between Senate leader Kevin de Leon and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, who are proposing competing plans in advance of key election campaigns.""Gun violence has reached epidemic proportions across our nation,"" de Leon, who represents Los Angeles, said as he introduced the bills on the Senate floor on Thursday. ""We cannot stand by while our communities suffer from this horrific violence.""The package of eight bills would ban the possession of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds, make stealing a gun a felony, limit the lending of guns among family members, and close a loophole in the state's assault weapons ban.
It is uncertain whether the bills will pass the Assembly, where Republicans and conservative Democrats have blocked some of the same measures in the past, or be signed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who has vetoed some gun control measures.The Senate bills were fast-tracked through the legislature this week, even as state officials are counting signatures and preparing to place on the November ballot a referendum by Newsom that would accomplish many of the same goals.The competing measures are a sore point between the two powerful politicians that could spill into the November election campaign as well as the race to replace Brown in 2018.
De Leon, who said Thursday that Newsom based his ballot initiative on de Leon's own proposals, has asked the lieutenant governor to agree to withdraw his ballot measure should the Senate bills pass.But Newsom, who is running for governor, has refused. His campaign strategist, Dan Newman, said Thursday that the initiative was more comprehensive than the legislative package and should go before voters in the fall.
Newsom is expected to make the gun control initiative a centerpiece of his campaign to replace Brown in 2018, along with a proposed referendum to legalize recreational use of marijuana.De Leon has not endorsed Newsom. He is close to possible Newsom rivals in the governor's race, including former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	[]	['guns']

By Daniel Bases and Nick Brown
| NEW YORK/SAN JUAN

NEW YORK/SAN JUAN The U.S. House Natural Resources Committee early on Thursday released long-delayed revised legislation to address Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis, which is threatening to become a full-blown humanitarian disaster.The bill, also known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), has two major aims: setting out a framework for restructuring the island's $70 billion in debt and putting the island's financial operations under the control of a federal oversight board.Severe economic decline, an accumulation of operating deficits, lack of financial transparency and management inefficiencies, combined with excessive borrowing, ""created a fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico,"" the legislation states.Puerto Rico's next debt payment of $1.9 billion, which its governor has said it cannot pay, is due on July 1. A vote in the House is expected the first week of June.OVERSIGHT BOARD     
* A Financial Oversight and Management Board, consisting of seven members appointed by the president of the United States from recommendations provided by the leaders of the U.S. House and Senate. One member is appointed at the sole discretion of the president. Appointments are due by Sept. 30, 2016.* The board has the authority to enforce balanced budgets and government reform if the Puerto Rican government fails to do so, including the sale of government assets, the consolidation of agencies and reduction of workforce. 
* The board's aims are to generate management plans that achieve fiscal responsibility, maintain access to capital markets and ensure funding for public services and pensions; and to help facilitate consensual debt restructuring talks between Puerto Rico and its bondholders.* The board will have subpoena power to seek testimony and information. Board members will not be paid a salary.* A fiscal plan should be no less than five years. It can be developed either by the governor, the Oversight Board or both in collaboration.* Neither the governor of Puerto Rico nor the island's  legislature can exercise control over the board or pass laws that would inhibit its functioning.
* The oversight board will dissolve once Puerto Rico has attained adequate and reasonable access to credit markets and achieves four consecutive fiscal years of budgetary compliance without spending more than it earned.CREDIT MARKETS AND DEBT
* The bill adopts certain provisions of U.S. bankruptcy law, including giving Puerto Rico access to a court-sanctioned debt restructuring law, under which it could, in certain circumstances, impose debt cuts without creditors' consent, so-called cram-downs. 
    * The bill also empowers the oversight board to hold consensual debt restructuring talks, in hopes of reaching  ""collective action compromises"" that do not require cram-down. For a restructuring to be approved under the bill's collective action clause, two-thirds of the outstanding principal amount of the bonds in each pool of debt must vote in favor of it.     * PROMESA does not directly put Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, under the bankruptcy laws enjoyed by U.S. states. This addresses concerns that actions taken in the commonwealth could bleed over and affect long-standing municipal bankruptcy laws.     * Any prior voluntary debt restructuring agreements will be left intact. This essentially leaves in place the current voluntary restructuring agreement between creditors and PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority)    * Certifying a restructuring of debt requires approval by five out of seven members of the oversight board.    * The U.S. government will not pledge its full faith and credit for repaying Puerto Rico's debt. This provision addresses concerns the bill would amount to a financial bailout by Washington. (Reporting By Daniel Bases in New York and Nick Brown in San Juan)"	[]	[]

By Gary Robertson
| RICHMOND, Va.

RICHMOND, Va. A U.S. federal judge on Thursday upheld a 2013 Virginia law requiring prospective voters to show an approved photo identification before they cast their ballots.The state's Democratic Party had challenged the law, signed by former Republican Governor Robert McDonnell, saying it was politically motivated and intended to deter young and minority voters from turning out on Election Day.""The court's mission is to judge not the wisdom of the Virginia voter ID law, but rather its constitutionality,"" wrote U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson in his decision.While he noted that the measure created an ""inconvenience"" for potential voters who did not have drivers' licenses or other government-issued ID, he said that was not enough to strike it down.""While the merits of this voter identification law, and indeed all aspects of Virginia's voting regime, can be reasonably debated, it remains true that Virginia has created a scheme of laws to accommodate all people in their right to vote,"" Hudson wrote. 
Lawyers representing the state Democratic Party said in a filing that the Republican-dominated state legislature passed the photo ID law ""to stall, if not reverse, the growing success of the Democratic Party in Virginia.""The state argued that ID was necessary to ensure that only registered voters cast ballots and to prevent voter fraud.In 2008, President Barack Obama became the first Democrat to carry Virginia in more than 40 years, in part because of turnout among black, Latino and young voters. Obama carried the state again in 2012.
In the most recent statewide elections, Democrats also swept all top offices: governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. Moreover, the state's two U.S. senators are both Democrats.Hudson acknowledged that Virginia, a former slave state, has ""an unfortunate history of racial and statutory artifice to hinder black voting.""The ruling comes a month after another federal judge upheld a similar requirement in neighboring North Carolina.
A federal court this week ordered Kansas to register thousands of eligible voters who have been blocked from registering.That ruling resulted from an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed on behalf of Kansas residents who tried to register to vote through the Kansas Department of Motor Vehicles and had been forced to provide additional documentation of citizenship.

WASHINGTON An election-year fight over addressing the spreading Zika virus intensified in the U.S. Congress as the Senate on Thursday approved $1.1 billion in emergency money one day after the House of Representatives voted $622.1 million financed through cuts to existing programs.The two chambers would have to reach agreement on a spending level before they can send it to President Barack Obama, who in February requested $1.9 billion. The White House has called the House measure ""woefully inadequate"" and has threatened to veto it.Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington State urged Congress to act quickly, saying, ""This is a public health emergency and Congress should treat it like one."" The Senate will enter negotiations with the House with a strong hand: a bipartisan 68-30 vote in favor of the emergency funds to battle Zika, a virus that has been spreading rapidly through the Americas, with more than 100 confirmed cases in the U.S. state of Florida.
However, the conservative group Heritage Action is lobbying against any Zika funding bill that is not paid for with an equal amount of spending cuts.The Senate's funding was attached to an unrelated transportation and housing appropriations bill that also passed the chamber on Thursday.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.    
Conservative Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah tried unsuccessfully to kill the Senate funding, saying the Obama administration already had enough money to deal with Zika.""What we should not do, however, is allow the Zika virus to be yet another excuse to run up the national debt,"" Lee said.
But Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican, countered that U.S. debt problems were rooted in the rapid growth in the cost of huge programs such as Social Security and Medicare and not so-called ""discretionary"" spending like on Zika.

By Ginger Gibson and Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled the names of 11 judges - eight men and three women, all white and all conservative - he would consider, if elected, to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.Six of them are judges who were appointed to federal appeals courts around the country by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other five serve on various state supreme courts.Scalia's replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, which now is evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. Scalia, who died in February, was one of the court's most conservative justices.""We're going to choose from, most likely from this list,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News. But Trump said he could deviate from the list and added, ""At a minimum we will keep people within this general realm."" All of Trump's 11 judges are listed as affiliated with the Federalist Society on the influential conservative legal group's website. The organization is known as a breeding ground for conservative legal thinkers.It is unusual for a presidential candidate to release names of potential Supreme Court or Cabinet nominees before winning an election.But Trump is working to assure conservatives in his own party that, if elected president on Nov. 8, he would not appoint a liberal or moderate to the court. Trump allies had encouraged him to announce the names of potential court nominees to allay fears among conservatives wary of a Trump presidency.Trump's list includes: Steven Colloton of Iowa, a judge on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Raymond Gruender of Missouri, also a judge on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.It also includes: Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, a judge on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals; William Pryor of Alabama, a judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin, a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The state supreme court jurists include: Allison Eid of Colorado; Joan Larsen of Michigan; Thomas Lee of Utah; David Stras of Minnesota; and Don Willett of Texas.Democratic President Barack Obama in March named centrist appellate court judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. But the Republican-led Senate has refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote, insisting that Obama's successor should get to select Scalia's replacement. Trump said in a statement that the 11 judges were ""representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value"" and said he would use the list as a guide for nominating a justice.Willett in the past year has posted several comments on Twitter mocking Trump, even referring to him as ""Darth Trump,"" a twist on the ""Star Wars"" villain Darth Vader. Willett last June posted about imagining Trump selecting a Supreme Court nominee.""The mind reels. *weeps--can't finish tweet*,"" Willett wrote, suggesting he was crying at the idea.
Asked to comment on Willett's Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, ""Mr. Trump's sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles.""SENATOR'S BROTHER
Lee is the brother of Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate.""I don't know everyone on the list, but those I do know would all be great Supreme Court Justices. Of course, I do believe one name on that list stands head and shoulders above the rest,"" said Mike Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would consider any nomination.
Sykes is the former wife of conservative Wisconsin radio host Charles Sykes, who posted on Twitter that she would make a great justice but added, ""I simply don't believe Trump.""Several of the judges have ruled against abortion and reproductive rights. Sykes, Colloton and Pryor have ruled against the Obama administration regarding religious objections to the contraception coverage requirement of the Obamacare healthcare law. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at his daily briefing that he would be surprised if any Democrat would describe any of Trump's picks ""as a consensus nominee.""""But the individual President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans have described as a consensus nominee,"" Earnest said of Garland, adding that it would be wise for the Senate to act on Obama's nominee.Liberal advocacy group People for the American Way said  Trump's list included ""conservative dream justices.""Most of the 11 judges did not respond to requests for comment. ""Joan Larsen is working along with the rest of Michigan's Supreme Court to provide common-sense, rule-of-law justice. That is her focus and will remain her focus,"" her campaign spokesman Stu Sandler said. Larsen was appointed to the post and is running for election to a full term.
