By David Ingram
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A federal appeals court fired skeptical questions on Monday at a lawyer for a U.S. congressional committee and a former staffer who argued that Congress is immune from having to cooperate with an insider-trading investigation.During a hearing, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to lean in favor of forcing Congress to comply at least somewhat with two subpoenas from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The case is a test of how far securities enforcers may go to police the murky world of ""political intelligence,"" in which firms seek to gather and sell information for traders. The SEC is investigating trading in Humana Inc stock in 2013 ahead of a government announcement about physician reimbursement rates, which affect Humana and other health insurers.In court papers, the SEC said it believes a congressional staff member at the time, Brian Sutter, ""may have been a source"" of an early leak to a lobbyist at the Greenberg Traurig law firm, who then passed the information to a Height Securities analyst, who in turn alerted clients.Lawmakers and their staff are not immune from prosecution under insider-trading laws. 
But Sutter and his former employer, the U.S. House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee, refused to comply with subpoenas for documents and testimony.Their lawyers argued that they should be shielded from such investigative tactics because, under the legal principles of sovereign immunity and legislative independence, they cannot be questioned without their consent. Circuit Judge Richard Wesley asked if Sutter went beyond protected activity in talking to the lobbyist.
""I don't care what his job was at the Ways and Means Committee; he wasn't in charge of insider trading,"" he said.William Pittard, a lawyer for Sutter and the committee, said it was not the court's role to question the motives of congressional staff.SEC lawyer Jeffrey Berger told the court that a ban on insider trading by Congress would be an ""empty shell"" if the regulator lacked the power to investigate.
The appeals court is expected to rule in the next several months.A Humana spokesman could not be reached for comment. A Greenberg Traurig spokeswoman declined to comment. Height Securities said in a statement it has not received a subpoena from or been formally investigated by the SEC. (Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Andrew Hay)"	[]	[]

By Karen Freifeld
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Lawyers for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday filed court papers opposing the release of video showing him being questioned under oath about his Trump University series of real estate seminars.They argued that making public the videos, for which written transcripts are already available, would prejudice Trump's case. The video is ""unnecessary, irrelevant and unjustified,"" lawyers for Trump wrote in court papers filed in federal court in San Diego.In legal proceedings, evidence is considered prejudicial if it may interfere with a judge or jury's objective consideration of the facts. Such evidence can still be presented if it is considered highly relevant to the case. The Republican candidate has already claimed the federal judge overseeing the case is biased against him because of the judge's Mexican heritage.
Trump may also have concerns about the impact the videos could have outside the courtroom. On Friday, CNN, CBS, the New York Times, and other media outlets asked for the complete deposition transcripts and videotapes to be made available. If released, the videos could provide fodder for campaign commercials against Trump.In lawsuits in California and New York, Trump has been accused of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 for an opportunity to learn the businessman's real estate investment strategies. Former Trump University students suing the billionaire claim that they learned little and that their instructors, supposedly hand-picked by Trump, had few qualifications. 
During deposition, Trump has admitted that he did not select instructors. His lawyers have argued the ""hand-picked"" claim amounted to mere sales ""puffery"" rather than fraud.In court papers arguing for the videos' release, lawyers for the students argued the images presented nuances not available in the transcripts. ""Trump's tone, facial expressions, gestures and body language... speak volumes to... Trump's complete and utter unfamiliarity with the instructors and 'instruction' that student-victims received,"" they said.
Trump has said the claims over Trump University are baseless and that students highly rated the programs. The case is Art Cohen v Donald J. Trump, 13-cv-2519, U.S. District Court, Southern District of California. (Reporting By Karen Freifeld; Editing by Anthony Lin and David Gregorio)"	['Cohen', 'Trump']	[]

| Orlando, Fla.

Orlando, Fla. A day before the Orlando, Florida, nightclub massacre, Luis Vielma, 22, updated his Facebook profile with a picture of himself standing with young people in front of a Disney castle and a caption that read: ""True friends who become family.""By Sunday night, his profile was altered to ""Remember Luis Vielma"" after police confirmed he was among 50 people killed in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.As authorities frantically tried to notify all the relatives, the Orlando Police Department began publishing the names of victims on a city website on Sunday afternoon.Among them was Vielma, who worked part-time as a rides attendant at the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey theme park ride, while studying physical therapy at Seminole State College, according to his Facebook profile.     Others included Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34, Stanley Almodovar III, 23, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20, Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22, Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36, and Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz, 22. Police killed the gunman, who was identified as Omar Mateen, 29, a New York-born Florida resident and U.S. citizen who was the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, and officials were probing evidence suggesting the attack may have been inspired by Islamic State militants.The sheer number of deaths appeared to overwhelm officials in Orlando, a city of 270,000 people. Orlando police asked mourners to hold off on vigils as they were understaffed to police them. 
""We understand our community is grieving and that vigils are being planned but PLEASE hold off on vigils - they represent a serious strain on our limited resources, which we need to dedicate to law enforcement and victims,"" the city posted on its official Twitter handle.Sotomayor was a marketing manager at a Sarasota, Florida-based gay-themed travel company. His boss, Al Ferguson, said Sotomayor's partner was outside the nightclub putting something in the car when the shots rang out.He got a text from Sotomayor telling him he was safe in the bathroom and not to come back into the club. Sotomayor texted again 20 minutes later to say he was OK. That was the last his partner heard from him, Ferguson said.    
Sotomayor was a legend in the industry, Ferguson said. He booked tours for entertainer and drag queen RuPaul and put together the first gay cruise to Cuba last year. He was going to announce a second trip on Sunday, but was killed.""Anyone who booked gay cruises knew Sotomayor,"" Ferguson told Reuters. ""He was a great man."" In an Instagram post published on Sunday, RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage called Sotomayor ""a joy.""""I loved you on so many levels. You were SO SO special and will never be forgotten,"" she wrote. ""I promise you that.""  
Neighbors of Almodovar, a 23-year-old pharmacy technician, said his parents had recently moved back to Puerto Rico after his mother became ill with cancer. He was the youngest in the family.The Facebook page for Almodovar, of Clermont, Florida, was flooded with shocked tributes. ""We'll miss you Stanley. You made an impact on everyone that you came around. A good person and friend,"" wrote Mark Nielsen of Deltona, Florida.Images posted to Almodovar's wall over the years showed him socializing with dozens of friends.""I will always remember you,"" Jeannette Molina wrote. ""Your beautiful personality and spirit."" (Additinal reporting by Amy Tennery and Angela Moon in New York; Editing by Chris Reese and Peter Cooney)"	[]	['gay']

WASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday warned Americans against pointing a finger at one religion or another after a gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group massacred 49 people at a gay night club in Orlando.""The worst thing we can do is engage in trying to point fingers at one group or one form of sectarianism or another or one religion or another. Those are not the values of our country,"" Kerry told reporters as he posed for pictures before a meeting with Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides.

By Jeff Mason
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration is not pursuing the use of an executive order to shutter the Guantanamo Bay military prison after officials concluded that it would not be a viable strategy, sources familiar with the deliberations said.The conclusion, reached by administration officials, narrows the already slim chances that President Barack Obama can fulfill his pledge to close the  notorious offshore prison before leaving office in January.The White House has said repeatedly that Obama has not ruled out any options on the Guantanamo center, which has been used to house terrorism suspects since it was set up in 2001 following the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington.Obama is eager to fulfill his 2008 campaign pledge to close the prison and could still choose to use his commander-in-chief powers, but the option is not being actively pursued, the sources said.Without executive action, the chances of closing the prison would hinge on convincing a resistant Congress to overturn a long-standing ban on bringing possibly dozens of remaining prisoners to maximum-security prisons in the United States. White House lawyers and other officials studied the option of overriding the ban but did not develop a strong legal position or an effective political sales pitch in an election year, a source familiar with the discussions said. ""It was just deemed too difficult to get through all of the hurdles that they would need to get through, and the level of support they were likely to receive on it was thought to be too low to generate such controversy, particularly at a sensitive (time) in an election cycle,"" the source said.Republicans in Congress are opposed to bringing Guantanamo detainees to U.S. prisons and have expressed opposition to transfers to other countries over concern that released prisoners will return to militant activities. They have vowed to challenge any potential Obama executive action in court.
At its peak, the prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba housed nearly 800 prisoners, becoming a symbol of the excesses of the ""war on terror"" and synonymous with criticism of detention without trial and accusations of torture. Obama has called it a recruitment tool for terrorists.OPTIONS NARROW
The number of Guantanamo detainees has fallen to 80 now, the lowest since it was opened. 
The administration is focusing on getting the number of detainees at the prison down to such a low number, perhaps 20, that the cost of keeping it open could prove unpalatable to Congress. Republican lawmakers remain unswayed.The Guantanamo prison and associated military commissions cost $445 million in fiscal year 2015. That works out to more than $5.5 million a year for each of the 80 remaining prisoners.Thirty of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo have been approved for transfer to foreign countries and the State Department says it will move all of them out this summer. Those who would be left include 10 being prosecuted in military commissions, and other detainees deemed too dangerous to release or transfer.""The administration's goal is to work with Congress to find a solution to close Guantanamo,"" said Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council.
He said the government had made ""substantial progress""  moving prisoners to foreign countries and was working to identify more countries for additional transfers. Reviews to determine whether certain prisoners need to remain detained to prevent a threat to U.S. security had been accelerated and would be completed in the coming months, he said.Obama, who issued an order to shut the prison within a year on his first day in office, released his latest plan to close it to Congress in February, but it has not gained traction.The White House has not publicly ruled out the executive order option in part to keep pressure on the Pentagon to move prisoners who have been cleared for release to other countries, one of the sources said.""If Congress ... would finally say no to the president's plan and the executive order option wasn't on the table, there was a concern that the wheels could grind to a halt,"" said the source familiar with discussions at the White House.Gregory Craig, who served as Obama's first White House counsel, said that without an executive order, Obama would likely need the cooperation of Congress to shut down the prison.""I think the odds are probably challenging,"" Craig said.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON As she waits for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law, Amy Hagstrom-Miller said she hopes she will not have to close up to three of the clinics she operates in the state, but is planning for it just in case.    Hagstrom-Miller founded Whole Woman's Health, which runs four facilities in Texas that provide abortions and led the legal challenge to the law.She said she has spreadsheets listing staffers who would be laid off if the court allows the law to survive, and is thinking about selling buildings and medical equipment as well as shutting her clinics in Fort Worth, San Antonio and McAllen.    ""I would be irresponsible if I didn't plan,"" Hagstrom-Miller said in an interview.The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on whether the Texas law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a woman's constitutional right to end her pregnancy as set out in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The court has not issued a major abortion-related ruling since 2007.    The law requires abortion doctors to have ""admitting privileges,"" a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. That provision has been implemented. A second provision, not yet in effect, requires clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities including extensive standards for such attributes as corridor width, room size, floor tiles and the swinging motion of doors.Supporters of the law, passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013, say it was enacted to protect women's health.    Abortion rights advocates say it imposes medically unnecessary regulations intended to shut clinics and has dramatically reduced access to abortion in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people.Getting a clear-cut ruling is complicated by the fact that the court is down to eight justices, split evenly with four conservatives and four liberals, following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia.
One possibility is a 4-4 split that would affirm a lower court's decision upholding the law but would not set a national legal precedent that could guide other states eager to pass similar statutes.Because it is unlikely one of the court's liberals would join the four conservatives, there is almost no chance of a  broad ruling upholding the law and giving other states a green light to enact similar measures. Numerous Republican-governed states have considered measures that would restrict abortion availability.'NOT A CATASTROPHE'

For abortion opponents, who no longer have Scalia to cast a fifth vote to tip the balance in their favor, a 4-4 split leaving the Texas law in place may be the best result possible.John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in California, an abortion opponent who filed a brief with the high court backing the Texas law, said if the justices cannot deliver a decisive ruling, ""It's not a catastrophe.""""I'd rather have women's health and safety in some parts of the country than no parts of the country,"" Eastman said.Legal fights over similar laws are ongoing in several states, including Mississippi, Louisiana and Wisconsin.    If the court leaves in place the lower-court ruling upholding the Texas law, the number of abortion clinics in the state would drop from the current 19 to nine, abortion providers said. Texas had 41 abortion clinics when the law was passed.
    ""A 4-4 decision would leave us in the untenable situation where a woman's ability to get an abortion will depend on where she lives,"" said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes restrictive abortion laws.     Another possibility is that the justices strike down the law, or invalidate one of the two provisions at issue while keeping the other. It may be more likely that the admitting-privileges provision, already in effect, would survive, while the hospital-grade facilities requirements, which the justices themselves temporarily blocked, would not.Justice Anthony Kennedy could be the key player in any such scenarios, which would require at least one conservative to join the four liberals. Kennedy is a conservative who in past rulings has endorsed Roe v. Wade, but has voted to uphold some abortion restrictions.""It comes down to Justice Kennedy, and during the argument he didn't show his hand too much,"" said John Seago, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life's legislative director, adding that the ruling could give abortion opponents ""ideas about what laws we could pass.""Another possibility is that the court returns the case to a lower court for further proceedings, as Kennedy suggested during March 2 oral arguments.""It's overwhelming for me when I think what could happen if it's not a favorable decision,"" said Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at two Texas Whole Woman's Health clinics. ""I try not to think about it every minute of every day."" (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Jilian Mincer; Editing by Will Dunham)"	['Lawrence', 'Roe', 'Kennedy']	['abortion']

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Sunday described the worst mass shooting in U.S. history as ""an act of terror"" and ""an act of hate,"" saying the massacre of 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida was an attack on all Americans.""Today as Americans we grieve the brutal murder, a horrific massacre of dozens of innocent people,"" he said in a statement at the White House. ""Although it is still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,"" Obama said.""We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united as Americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.""He ordered the flag at the White House to be flown at half staff to honor the victims. 
The shooter, who was identified as Florida resident Omar S. Mateen was killed by police at the nightclub. A top U.S. congressman said Mateen may have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group, but U.S. officials cautioned they had no direct evidence of a connection.  Fifty-three people were wounded in the rampage, which surpassed the 32 people killed in the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech university.
Obama said it was appropriate for the FBI to investigate the massacre as an act of terrorism and said he would ""spare no effort"" to determine whether the assailant had been inspired or associated with an extremist group.The president also termed the shooting a new reminder of ""how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub,"" a reference to other mass killings that have punctuated recent U.S. history. 
""We have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be,"" he said. (Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Sarah N. Lynch, Jason Lange, Ginger Gibson and David Morgan; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Chris Reese)"	['Gibson', 'Obama']	['gay']

By James Oliphant and Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gave an aggressive response to the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, quickly claiming the attack was the work of an Islamist militant while calling on President Barack Obama to resign and  for Democrat Hillary Clinton to exit the presidential race.For Trump, it was an attempt to frame the attack in Orlando in a light favorable to his campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Early on Sunday, when few facts were known about the shooting, he boasted on Twitter that it proved he had been right about his warnings over ""radical Islamic terrorism.""Trump canceled a planned Monday evening rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire late on Sunday, because of the shooting, but will go ahead with a major speech at St. Anselm's College on Monday afternoon.In a tweet just hours after the incident, he wrote:  ""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance."" Trump has made combating the threat of groups such as Islamic State a central part of his candidacy. It was last December's attack in San Bernardino, California that killed 14 people that led Trump to propose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump re-visited the proposal on Sunday after at least 50 people died in the attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.   ""What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.In a statement late Sunday, the businessman went further than U.S. officials investigating the shootings by asserting that the attack in Orlando was the work of a ""radical Islamic terrorist.""
Islamic State, which controls land in Iraq and Syria,  claimed responsibility for the shooting but U.S. officials said they had seen no immediate evidence directly linking the militant group to the massacre.The shooter, U.S.-born Florida resident Omar Mateen, was killed by police. Mateen, 29, called 911 on Sunday morning and made comments saying he supported the Islamic State militant group, officials said. A Trump supporter played Trump's speeches on a loudspeaker outside the Port St. Lucie, Florida home of Mateen's parent's.""I'm a Cuban citizen and I'm becoming an American citizen on July 6 and I'm going to vote for the first time in my life for Donald Trump,"" said Arisley Travieso, 36, who works for a shredding company.
Traveiso said he supported Trump because the Republican nominee sees ""the problem is Islamic terrorism. He (Trump) has been saying it nonstop.""    Trump ripped Obama for his long-standing refusal to refer to Islamic State and other extremist groups as in part representative of the religion of Islam.""In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam'. For that reason alone, he should step down,"" Trump said, adding that, ""if Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the presidency.""Trump's day-long barrage of tweets and statements contrasted  with more cautious approaches taken by Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and her fellow Democrat Obama.    
In remarks at the White House, Obama said the investigation into the shootings was ongoing and declined to speculate on the motives of the shooter. ""We've reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer,"" Obama said. ""The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism.  Similarly, Clinton, in a statement, called the attack an ""act of terror"" but did not speculate about the ideology of the gunman.""Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are hard at work, and we will learn more in the hours and days ahead,"" said Clinton, who expressed her sympathy for the victims and said ""weapons of war"" have no place on U.S. streets.Trump's campaign said that a speech scheduled for Monday that was to be devoted to criticizing Hillary and Bill Clinton would now be centered on national security and counter-terrorism.
