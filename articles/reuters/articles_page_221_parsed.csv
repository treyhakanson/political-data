By Dave McKinney
| SPRINGFIELD, Ill.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. Illinois' long-running budget stalemate was set to spill into the summer on Monday, as Democratic lawmakers worked to pass a 2017 spending plan that Republican Governor Bruce Rauner has threatened to veto, possibly jeopardizing public schools re-opening in August.As a midnight Tuesday deadline to pass legislation approaches, Rauner and his Democratic rivals who control the state legislature reported no headway toward ending the 11-month long dispute that has left Illinois as the only state without a full operating budget for the current fiscal year.The second-year governor says the budget is $7 billion short on revenues. He has insisted that the budget should be tied to a series of labor-weakening, business-friendly changes that Democrats argue will harm the state's working class.In recent weeks, legislative working groups convened by Rauner have tried to bridge differences between the governor and top Democrats.Rauner and the Democratic legislative leaders met for less than a half hour on Monday with House Speaker Michael Madigan declaring plans to keep his legislative chamber in session during June, when a tougher three-fifths majority vote is required to pass a budget.
""My view is that if there's no agreement (Tuesday) night, I would ask the governor to keep his working groups functioning on a regular schedule because the House is going to be in continuous session,"" Madigan told reporters after the meeting.Senate President John Cullerton signaled his chamber could vote on a budget bill passed by the House last week, or on an alternative plan he declined to outline. He also said he was trying to round up votes for the House budget bill.
""[Tuesday] would be a good day to call it,"" Cullerton said.Republican legislative leaders slammed Democrats for their refusal to accept pieces of Rauner's non-budgetary agenda or offer revenue sources to pay for their spending plan.""They're just forcing a tax increase. That's what they're doing,"" said Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno, adding that Democrats plan a post-November election tax hike vote.
Contained within the Democratic spending package is a $760 million increase in funding for Illinois' public-school system for the fiscal year that begins July 1.A complete Rauner veto of the package would mean schools would be left without adequate state funding in August when schools are set to open for the fall, a gambit Cullerton predicted the governor could not risk.

By Jeff Mason and Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A judge, called a ""hater"" by Donald Trump for his handling of a lawsuit related to the businessman's Trump University real estate school, has unsealed documents related to the case.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, is fighting a lawsuit that accuses his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaire's real estate investment strategies.In an order signed on Friday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said that materials, including Trump University procedures on dealing with students and the media, should be unsealed. He noted they had already been published by the media organization Politico and that a magistrate judge described them previously as ""routine"" and ""commonplace.""At a rally in San Diego on Friday, Trump criticized Curiel for his handling of the Trump University case.""I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He's a hater,"" Trump said.""We're in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama,"" Trump said, adding he believed Curiel was Mexican.
Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law.Legal scholars said Trump could face consequences for slamming the judge, although many speculated that Curiel was unlikely to sanction him formally. ""Mr. Trump's conduct could be subject to sanction for indirect criminal contempt of court,"" said Charles Geyh, a legal ethics expert at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law.
""He has impugned the honesty of the judge in a pending case, and has done so in the context of a political rally that seems calculated to intimidate by inciting anger among his supporters,"" he said.Arthur Hellman, an expert on federal courts and judicial ethics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, said the judge was in a difficult position.""He can't respond directly. He's not supposed to talk out of court about proceedings before him. Judges have gotten into trouble defending themselves from attacks. The judge's hands are really tied,"" he said.Trump has drawn criticism for his comments about immigrants from Mexico, some of whom he has said were criminals and rapists. 
He has proposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration and requiring Mexico to pay for it.Hispanics are a critical voting bloc in U.S. presidential elections.Last week, Trump knocked one of the highest-profile Hispanic women in the Republican Party, criticizing New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez for her handling of the state's economy. Her office said his criticisms were not substantive. Martinez has been touted as a potential vice presidential pick for a Republican ticket.

By Dave McKinney
| SPRINGFIELD, Ill.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. Just days before the end of the Illinois legislature's spring session, the governor said on Sunday he would veto a House-passed budget, which includes school funding, and fired back at an angry Chicago mayor.Lawmakers face a midnight Tuesday deadline to pass a fiscal 2017 budget and adopt a 2016 spending plan that has remained elusive for the past 11 months, leaving Illinois as the only state without a complete budget for the fiscal year ending June 30. The impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature showed strong signs of extending into fiscal 2017, with Bruce Rauner pushing for pro-business and anti-union reforms and Democrats in the House of Representatives last week passing a spending plan short about $7 billion in revenue. Adding fuel to the fire was Rauner's veto on Friday of a bill allowing Chicago to spread out payments to its public safety workers' retirement systems as the city struggles with a structural budget deficit and other pension woes.Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Sunday chastised the governor's ""callous decision,"" saying it would lead to a $300 million city property tax hike at the same time Rauner wants local property taxes capped.
Rauner, who needled Emanuel for not coming to the capital, Springfield, to address the city's pension-driven financial woes, called the bill ""terrible policy,"" saying it would cost Chicago taxpayers $18.6 billion more over the next 30 years by not fully funding pensions. ""Where is the mayor? He's not here, He's not asking for real reforms,"" Rauner told reporters outside his office.
He also confirmed previous statements from his staff that he would veto the House-passed budget if it was approved by the Senate. He urged lawmakers not to hold schools ""hostage,"" by sending him a clean bill to fund K-12 public schools. He also asked Democrats to break from longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan.""The speaker is perfectly fine having deficit spending and borrowing. He's perfectly fine crushing the economy, crushing our taxpayers. He's been fine with it, and we need his members to say: 'No, Mr. Speaker, no more,'"" Rauner said.Madigan said his members were prepared to be in continuous session through the summer, blaming Rauner for injecting non-budget demands into the process.
""We'll be here (Monday), Tuesday and through the remainder of the summer,"" he said.Passing a budget beyond Tuesday's deadline will require tougher-to-get three-fifth majority votes in each chamber. (Additional reporting by Karen Pierog; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Rauner']	[]

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON In a move to bolster support among veterans, Republican Donald Trump joined a leather-jacket-wearing, motorcycle-riding crowd in Washington on Sunday to honor fighters who served in foreign wars and advocate for those still missing in action.Riders from across the country converged on the National Mall near the Lincoln Memorial for the annual ""Rolling Thunder"" rally and to listen to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who hopes to be commander in chief next year.""We're going to rebuild our military and we're going to take care of our veterans,"" Trump told the crowd of thousands, many of whom wore leather vests, veterans' hats and biker insignia.Trump, the billionaire businessman who has promised to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico if he becomes president, said illegal immigrants in many cases got better care in the United States than military veterans.""We're not going to allow that to happen any longer,"" he said.
Trump, 69, who did not serve in the military, upset veterans last year when he said Senator John McCain of Arizona was not a war hero. McCain, a Navy fighter pilot who went on to become the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was imprisoned and tortured after being shot down during the Vietnam War.Trump made no mention of McCain during his remarks on Sunday, and the crowd cheered him enthusiastically, with some waving signs including ""Bikers for Trump"" and ""Make America Great Again."" Supporters cheered when Trump mentioned veterans and booed at the mention of Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
""I don't know if he can fix (veterans' issues), but he's the only one I think will try,"" said Leonard Westberry, 68, of Richmond, Virginia, a U.S. Army veteran who served in Vietnam in 1967. Westberry said he planned to support Trump in the Nov. 8 election.""It's awesome that Trump is here. ... That's a good thing,"" said Ralph Giannola, 65, who said he had not decided whether to support Trump in November.
""I just don't want to see any rioting. I mean, protests are OK. I don't want to see anybody get hurt,"" he said.There were no protest interruptions during Trump's nearly 20-minute address on Sunday, a rarity for similar events.""I know one thing, you're going to all behave yourselves, right?"" Trump said to positive affirmations from the crowd. ""And I know another thing - there won't be any paid agitators in this group,"" he added to cheers.

By Patrick Rucker

WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Sunday ruled out becoming Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate, but said he'd be ""honored"" to play some kind of a role in helping him win the White House.Rubio, who clashed bitterly with Trump in the brutal race for the Republican nomination, said his policy differences with the real estate mogul were too great for Rubio to join the ticket.""I wouldn't be the right choice for him,"" Rubio said in an extensive interview with CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""Donald deserves to have a vice president - he's earned the nomination - and he deserves to have a running mate that more fully embraces some of the things he stands for.""Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, ended his White House bid in March after an embarrassing loss in his home state.Trump, who has practically ensured he will emerge as the nominee from the Republican convention in July, derided Rubio as a lightweight and dubbed him ""Little Marco."" 
Rubio called the real estate mogul a con artist and quipped about his small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood.Rubio and Trump differed sharply on policy issues, with Trump eschewing the interventionist approach favored by Rubio and Rubio criticizing Trump's call for temporarily banning the entry of Muslims into the United States.
Ahead of the July 18-21 Republican convention, Trump has sought to unify the party behind him and gain the backing of other prominent party figures.Rubio said he expected to attend the convention and did not rule out a speaking role. He said he wanted to be helpful to Trump's presidential run because he wants to see likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton defeated in the Nov. 8 U.S. election.""I don't want Hillary Clinton to be president. If there's something I can do to help that from happening and it's helpful to the cause I'd most certainly be honored to be considered for that,"" Rubio said.
In another olive branch to Trump, Rubio said he regretted making the ""small hands"" remark about his former foe.""I actually told Donald at one of the debates. I forget which one - I apologized to him for that,"" Rubio said. ""I said 'I'm sorry that I said that.' It's not who I am. And I shouldn't have done it.""

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Latino groups have criticized the Democratic Party for relying too heavily on Republican Donald Trump's inflammatory comments on illegal immigration to drive Hispanic voters to the polls, calling instead for the party to do more to address Latino concerns, according to meeting notes seen by Reuters.""(W)e cannot rely on Trump as that will set us up for failure,"" according to notes summarizing a meeting on May 2 between Democratic Party officials and representatives of several Hispanic advocacy groups.""Our values... need to be uplifted,"" they continued.Hispanics make up around 17 percent of the U.S. population, making them a critical voter group in what is expected to be a tight race between Trump and the Democratic nominee. Democratic operatives have called Trump an ideal spur for getting out the Latino vote because of his hard-line approach to illegal immigration, with some canvassers even using his picture to help encourage Hispanics to register.. The New York billionaire and now presumptive Republican nominee made waves early in his campaign by saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers over the border. He has vowed to make Mexico pay for building a wall to block them and promised to round up and deport the millions of undocumented immigrants now in the United States.
By contrast, Democratic contenders for the White House, front-runner Hillary Clinton and rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both promised to provide undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. The have also promised to nominate Latinos to key posts in their prospective administrations.At least two Hispanics are also considered candidates to be the running mate to the eventual Democratic presidential nominee: Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.  ""While Latinos appear to be a solid part of the Democratic base right now, that can certainly change,"" said Brent Wilkes, the treasurer for the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda and the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, who was present at the meeting. 
In the last election in 2012, Latinos constituted 10 percent of the electorate and voted for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney by 71 percent to 27 percent, according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic Center.Many Latino advocates also stressed to the Democratic Party that, as members of nonpartisan organizations, their concerns are in addressing issues within their communities, such as education and the economy, rather than backing any one party or candidate.The Democratic delegation at the meeting, which according to the notes included the new Hispanic outreach director, Bridgette Gomez, assured the advocates their Latino outreach strategy was not merely Trump-focused, one participant said. 
""Donald Trump's candidacy fits into a much longer term and more thoughtful approach than just one election cycle,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Pablo Manriquez said on Friday. He added that the party is focused on broader issues such as voting rights and the concerns of Latino families for this election and beyond.   Participants at the meeting also told the party they didn't see enough Latinos in the pipeline for future leadership positions, including elected office around the country, according to the meeting notes.""It's not just infrastructure for political participation, but how to get people to run for office, how to teach people to run their own campaigns,"" said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, which had a representative at the meeting.

By Alex Dobuzinskis and Kim Palmer

The mayor and police chief of Cleveland next week will outline what security measures they would take for the Republican National Convention, officials said after a civil rights group and a police union criticized aspects of the preparations.  Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has drawn intense protests at campaign stops this year. At times the demonstrations have resulted in violence between his supporters and opponents.Officials in Cleveland are gearing up for the thousands of demonstrators expected outside the convention, scheduled from July 18 to 21. The event will culminate with the party anointing the billionaire real estate developer as its nominee for the November general election.Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson will join the police chief and other city officials on Tuesday to present a ""comprehensive overview of security preparations"" for the convention, the mayor said in a statement.""Despite rumors, the Division of Police is prepared and is on track with its planning goals,"" the statement said.
The announcement comes after the American Civil Liberties Union on May 19 accused the city of taking too long to issue permits to protesters planning demonstrations at the convention. The city has since said it will allow application for permits starting on Tuesday, the same day officials will outline security plans.The Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association also has objected to certain parts of the city's plan.
The union filed a grievance over an order prohibiting officers from taking vacations for several days before and after the convention. That prompted an arbitrator to order the city to pay overtime to officers who would lose out on vacation time, according to a copy of the ruling posted at news website Cleveland.com.Cleveland officials are marshalling a force of about 5,000 officers, including police from other law enforcement agencies, to provide security for the convention, City Council members have said.
Council members earlier this month raised questions about the lack of transparency in Cleveland's plans for the convention.But Police Chief Calvin Williams has said the city must withhold certain information to stymie anyone seeking to disrupt the convention. He has declined to say how many officers will be assigned to the event.Protests against Trump dogged his appearance on Friday in San Diego, where more than 1,000 demonstrators turned up and 35 were arrested, and on Tuesday night in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters threw rocks and bottles at police.

By Emily Stephenson and Marty Graham
| SAN DIEGO

SAN DIEGO Donald Trump brought his message of walls and deportations to the doorstep of America's busiest border crossing on Friday as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee greeted supporters in San Diego, amid one of the largest counter-protests organized against him.The scene inside the San Diego Convention Center during Trump's speech was relatively placid, while outside demonstrators opposed to his controversy-ridden White House bid marched and chanted, carrying signs criticizing his rhetoric against illegal immigration. Waving U.S. and Mexican flags, more than 1,000 people turned out for anti-trump rallies in San Diego, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border whose San Ysidro port of entry sees nearly 300,000 people a day cross legally between the countries.San Diego is considered a binational city by many who live and work on opposite sides of the border, and about a third of the city's population is Latino.During Trump's speech on Friday, some protesters outside the convention center scaled a barrier and lobbed water bottles at police. One man was pulled off the wall and arrested as others were surrounded by fellow protesters and backed away from the confrontation. After the convention center emptied, clusters of Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators began to mix in the streets, many exchanging shouted epithets and some throwing water bottles at one another. Police in riot gear declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse, herding the crowd out of the city's hotel and restaurant-filled Gaslamp Quarter.San Diego police said on Twitter that 35 arrests were made during the protest. No property damage or injuries were reported, police said. ""Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally,"" Trump tweeted to police afterwards. Trump has weathered months of blowback from all ends of the political spectrum for his immigration policy, which calls for the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants who reside in the United States.
Critics have said his plan is needlessly cruel and impossible to implement. At Trump's campaign stops, attendees often chant ""build the wall.""While Trump is running unopposed in the June 7 California Republican primary, his stance on border control and deportation seems unlikely to resonate with the electorate at large in a state where political fallout from a Republican-backed crackdown on illegal immigrants 20 years ago cost the party dearly.    Friday was not the first time Trump has been greeted by civil unrest in California, which is home to the largest Latino population in the country. Late last month, a visit to the California Republican convention set off days of protests in the area, leading to several arrests. WAITING FOR ""FIRST PLACE FINISHER""

Shortly before taking the stage in San Diego, Trump issued a statement ruling out a one-on-one debate with second-place Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, who was also in California, killing off a potentially high-ratings television spectacle.The suggested debate, an idea first raised during a talk show appearance by the New York billionaire, would have sidelined likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but given Sanders a huge platform ahead of California Democratic primary.    A day after saying he would welcome a Sanders debate, Trump called the idea ""inappropriate,"" declaring that he should only face the Democrats' final choice.""I will wait to debate the first-place finisher in the Democratic Party, probably Crooked Hillary Clinton,"" Trump said in a statement.Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, expressed disappointment on Friday, and sought to goad Trump into reconsidering.
""Well, Mr. Trump, what are you afraid of?"" he said in a video clip posted on ABC News' Twitter account.Trump suggested broadcast networks were unwilling to go along with his demand that at least $10 million raised from the encounter be donated to charity.""I'd love to debate Bernie,"" he told a rally in Fresno, California. ""But the networks want to keep the money for themselves.""    Sanders is trailing Clinton in the race to secure their party's nomination, but opinion polls show he is slicing into her lead in California.Clinton has shown no interest in debating Sanders before the California primary, which will be part of a final slate of nominating contests. It is possible she will clinch the nomination by winning New Jersey earlier that day, making the outcome in California superfluous. The former U.S. secretary of state has said she is looking forward to debating Trump later this year ahead of the Nov. 8 general election.Clinton leads Trump by 4 percentage points in the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. Democrats nationally remain evenly split between Clinton and Sanders.

By Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. immigration officials have kicked off a new round of raids intended to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children who have entered the country illegally, according to a legal group that works with the immigrants.Immigration enforcement officers as of Friday had arrested about 40 women and children encompassing at least 18 Central American family groups in Texas, North Carolina, South Dakota and possibly other states, said Laura Lichter, an immigration lawyer and a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.Reuters reported on May 12 that the raids were planned for May and June and likely would be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year after similar raids in which 121 people were arrested over two days in January.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea declined to confirm that the new round of raids had begun but defended the administration's deportation operations as a whole.""We stress that these operations are limited to those who were apprehended at the border after January 1, 2014, have been ordered removed by an immigration court, and have no pending appeal or pending claim for asylum,"" Elzea said.
The immigrants arrested in the latest raids have been sent to two ICE detention centers in Texas, according to Belle Woods, a spokeswoman for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.The deportation operations are intended to deter illegal immigration from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and curb crossings of the U.S.-Mexican border by Central Americans, U.S. officials have said.
Lichter said ICE was not following its own policy in the raids. ""It's the same thing we saw in January. These people deserve asylum, but didn't get a proper chance to have their cases heard,"" Lichter said.The issue of illegal immigration has figured prominently in the U.S. presidential campaign, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump promising to deport all roughly 11 million people who are in the United States illegally.The White House on May 13 defended its deportation policy after complaints from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and congressional leaders that the sweep targeting Central American illegal immigrants is inhumane.
""I'm against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities,"" Clinton said at the time. (Reporting by Julia Edwards; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Will Dunham)"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Daniel Wiessner and Daniel Trotta

A lawsuit brought by Texas and other states against the Obama administration's policy on bathroom access may move the United States closer to a resolution on transgender rights by putting the issue on a trajectory for the Supreme Court.Conservative officials from 11 states sued the federal government on Wednesday to overturn a directive that transgender students be allowed to use the bathroom matching their gender identity instead of being forced to use one corresponding to gender assigned at birth. The governor of a 12th state, Mississippi, said he planned to join the lawsuit.The country's high court has never ruled on a main question of the lawsuit: Do federal legal protections against sex discrimination apply to transgender people?The plaintiffs picked a path that could get them two quick wins in lower courts. The lawsuit is expected to be heard first by an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and if there is an appeal by a conservative federal appeals court covering Texas.If that appeals court ruled against the Obama administration, the Supreme Court may feel compelled to take up the matter because of a likely conflict with a ruling last month from a federal appeals court in Virginia. That ruling revived a transgender teen's lawsuit against his school district. The Supreme Court is more likely to agree to hear a case when there is a split among different federal appeals courts, and such a conflict does not yet exist on transgender rights. The plaintiffs have accused the administration of President Barack Obama of overreaching its authority and said the U.S. Congress, or individual states, should set policy. 
At least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. When lawmakers passed the education amendments, they did not consider that the law could one day be applied to gender identity, said Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group.""The (administration's) lawless interpretation ignores the will of Congress in enacting Title IX,"" Tedesco said. ""It's a clear case of federal overreach.""The Obama administration has argued that the education amendments encompass discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status. It said in a letter to school districts this month that their access to federal money depended on their compliance.
The states that sued have two paths to victory, Tedesco said: a ruling that the Obama administration did not follow proper procedure for making new regulations, which would leave the larger issue unsettled, or that its interpretation of Title IX is inconsistent with the law.Without clear guidance from the courts, the question of transgender rights would remain open to interpretation by federal agencies, meaning a future president could take the opposite view of Obama.The Republican-controlled Congress has the power to end the dispute immediately, either in favor of transgender rights or against them, but it has shown few signs of acting, especially with a Democrat, Obama, in the White House.
A series of decisions suggests courts are coming around to a more expansive definition of sex discrimination, said Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders.Federal agencies clearly have the authority to interpret civil rights law when its application is unclear, she said.""To characterize (the administration's position) as extraordinary or overreaching shows a complete misunderstanding of what these agencies do,"" Levi said.The states countered in their lawsuit that the federal agencies went beyond mere interpretation of civil rights law and in effect created new regulations that should have gone through a notice-and-comment procedure.A court could also find that the states' lawsuit was premature because the Obama administration has not yet moved to cut off funding to any state or school district, said Arthur Leonard, a professor at New York Law School and an expert on LGBT law.
