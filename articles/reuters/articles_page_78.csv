By Harold Meyerson

After going through a week reminiscent of Napoleon's at Waterloo, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will likely claim that Indiana Governor Mike Pence's performance in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate gave a boost to their campaign.That would be overstating it.The debate probably changed few votes in the 2016 presidential election. The question is whether it will change any votes in the 2020 contest.In this year's race, the debate was something of a wash. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, came across like an over-caffeinated prosecutorial chipmunk - interrupting at every occasion. And at moments that weren't occasions at all.A gentle soul who's uncomfortable in the attack-dog role that the Clinton campaign has assigned him, Kaine plainly overcompensated by piping up whenever Pence sought to evade debate moderator Elaine Quijano's questions.And because Pence spent the evening evading, Kaine spent the evening interrupting. Though at the start, the interruptions actually preceded the evasions, and often interrupted Quijano's interjections as well.Pence surely had the better podium manner (no great achievement), even if his response to all Kaine's and Quijano's questions about the true man of the hour - Trump - was to change the subject. Or, if pressed, to deny that Trump had said what, in fact, Trump had said.
When the 10-second clips are aired and re-aired, Kaine's attacks on Trump and Pence's non-responses will redound mildly to Clinton's advantage.But what does the debate tell us about the future of both parties? Pence was surely playing to the GOP's religious right on Tuesday, with his anti-choice religiosity.In that sense, he was trying to supplant Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the Holy Rollers' favorite son in the 2020 Republican primaries. (I'm assuming, of course, that Trump will not be running for his second term.)Pence would bring some clear advantages to this contest. Unlike Cruz, Pence didn't desert the party's nominee (though Cruz came slinking back last week and finally endorsed Trump). Pence hasn't waged a scorched-earth war against the Republican leadership. He doesn't bear a disquieting resemblance to Bela Lugosi. For all these reasons, Pence will likely be the religious right's candidate to take on President Hillary Clinton in 2020.
Should Pence become the nominee, however, the GOP standard-bearer would likely only widen the already-yawning gap between Republicans and a majority of the American electorate. The affirmation of traditional right-wing positions that Pence delivered last night - against progressive taxation and all regulation, against a woman's right to choose - would yield the party precious little support among millennials, who will be by far the largest age group in the 2020 electorate.As for Kaine, it's hard to think of any wing of the Democratic Party that would flock to him as a future standard bearer after last night's gravitas-free performance. It's increasingly unclear why Clinton chose him to be her running mate, because that apparently meant miscasting him as her surrogate Trump-attacker.In both his convention speech and his debate performance, Kaine has shown himself not up to the task. Some alternatives to Kaine - Labor Secretary Tom Perez comes to mind - would clearly have been better suited to the role. Perez would also have been better suited to help Clinton win more support from the one constituency that she most needs to do better: millennials. Many still don't see Clinton as signifying any change or embodying the values that Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders championed.
Kaine is a man of many virtues, and certainly could step into the presidency if he had to. But as a candidate and as a politician able to speak to younger voters and the Sanderistas - that is, the future of the Democratic Party - he's been distinctly underwhelming.Meanwhile, Quijano jumped around, one topic to another, almost as manically as Kaine. Moderating is no easy job, but it must be said that Quijano shaped an uncommonly disjointed evening.More important,, both her questions on the economy - still the American public's No. 1 concern - focused on the debt and balancing the budget. At a time when the disabling effects of economic inequality and the need for greater public investment in infrastructure are belatedly receiving the recognition they deserve - and when the candidates' differences on these and other economic issues are vast - the size of the debt was hardly the topic on which the public needed to hear from the candidates.Between Quijano's topic-hopping, Kaine's interruptions and Pence's evasions, the debate flashed by as cacophonously and at times as incomprehensibly as a game of pinball.Despite all the clamor, it was resoundingly clear by evening's end that Kaine is not the Democrats' future leader, and Pence, while he could be the Republicans', is not likely to be America's.

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Florida's rapidly growing Puerto Rican population heavily favors Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race, according to a poll released on Wednesday by groups with links to the Democrats. Seventy-four percent of Puerto Ricans now registered to vote in Florida said they would likely pick Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, versus 17 percent for Trump, according to the poll from the Center for American Progress Action Fund and Latino Decisions.Puerto Ricans, who traditionally lean toward voting Democratic in Florida, are a big enough group to swing the closely-fought state.Florida, the third-largest state in the country in terms of electoral college votes needed to win the White House, has seen an influx of people from Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, as the Caribbean island's economy has floundered in recent years. 
More than one million Puerto Ricans now live in Florida, according to the Pew Research Center, making up about 5 percent of the total population.The Center for American Progress Action Fund is a progressive non-partisan organization that has been critical of Trump in the past. Latino Decisions has consulted for the Clinton campaign.       Florida is currently too close to call between Clinton and Trump, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, and both candidates have been focusing their campaigns there heading into the election.
Trump angered many Hispanics when he launched his campaign last year by calling some Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers, and his hardline immigration policies have done little to attract Latino voters.The poll did not gauge the level of eligible Puerto Rican voters who have registered in Florida, an important measure given historically low Latino turnout. Latino voter registration lagged white and African-American voters in the 2014 congressional elections by 12 to 15 percentage points nationally, according to the U.S. Census.
But it said Puerto Rican voters now registered in Florida appeared motivated. Some 84 percent said they would definitely vote, with another 14 percent saying they would probably do so. Only 2 percent said they definitely would not.The poll included 504 registered Puerto Rican voters in Florida with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 17 to Sept. 26. (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Alistair Bell)"

By Suzanne Barlyn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The scandal over improper sales practices at Wells Fargo & Co extended to thousands of small-business owners, according to a U.S. lawmaker, raising questions about the scope of the bank's issues with unauthorized accounts.In a Sept. 29 letter viewed by Reuters on Tuesday, Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, demanded that Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf provide a ""full accounting"" of customers affected. Vitter is a member of the U.S. Senate's banking committee and also heads its small business committee.Discussions between congressional staffers and Wells Fargo ""have indicated that the fraudulent activity of your employees was not limited to Wells Fargo's consumer banking operations,"" Vitter wrote. ""Thousands of small business owners were impacted by this fraud.""A person familiar with Vitter's probe say Wells has identified about 10,000 small business accounts that were subject to improper practices. Vitter spokeswoman Cheyenne Klotz declined to comment on specifics about those practices.Revelations of Wells Fargo's problems with small-business customers come almost a month after it reached a $190 million settlement over opening as many as 2 million accounts in retail customers' names without their knowledge. The bank has said it fired about 5,300 employees for improperly opening the accounts.The disclosures have caused a public furor, with Stumpf facing heated questions before two congressional committees and other U.S. authorities launching investigations into the bank's sales practices, including the Justice Department and the Labor Department.""While the vast majority of accounts in the settlement were consumer accounts, to the extent there were small business accounts included, all were previously reported in the total number of potentially impacted accounts,"" said Wells spokeswoman Jennifer Langan. ""As stated earlier, Wells Fargo has already refunded 115,000 accounts. The impacted accounts, including Small Business, were part of our Retail Bank business.""A Consumer Financial Protection Board spokesman contradicted the Wells statement, however, saying its figure of nearly 2 million accounts being affected did not include small business accounts.Wells is also battling lawsuits from former employees, customers and shareholders related to the issue. In a second letter, Vitter requested that the Small Business Administration's inspector general, Peggy Gustafson, investigate Wells, too.
PACKAGES OF THREE
Senior bank executives have apologized for opening accounts customers did not request, but characterized the issue as limited to relatively few customers and employees in the retail bank. Early results from Vitter's examination are the first hard sign that problems may extend further.Reuters also spoke to a former Wells employee, and a lawyer representing former employees and a former and current Wells customer, who described abusive sales practices with multiple business accounts.     Jose Maldonado, a restaurant owner in Southern California who banked with Wells Fargo for 15 years, said he discovered seven accounts after enlisting the help of his accountant. He initially closed extraneous ones, and ultimately moved his remaining business to Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co.""I don't like Wells Fargo anymore. I don't feel comfortable,"" Maldonado said in an interview. ""In the past, there were sometimes crazy accounts without my permission.""
Langan declined to comment on Maldonado's accounts.An ex-Wells Fargo business banker, who declined to be identified, said employees at his former branch were required to sell products to small business customers such as hair-salon owners and carpet cleaners in packages of three - regardless of whether they needed them.Those typically included accounts for checking, credit card processing and payroll, and were often linked to additional savings accounts, said the former Wells banker. Bankers also tacked on business credit cards and were pressured to call a Wells insurance unit, with the customer present, to push business liability policies.    Langan, the Wells spokeswoman, said the bank discontinued those packages in April 2015.Attorney Jonathan Delshad filed two class-action lawsuits against Wells Fargo in September on behalf of former employees, including one business banker, who say they were fired for refusing to create fake accounts to hit sales quotas. Wells suspended those quotas on Oct. 1.
Other former Wells Fargo business bankers contacted Delshad after the lawsuit received media attention, he said. ""Business owners are also being ripped off,"" one wrote to him in a message he provided to Reuters.SOURED RELATIONSHIPS
Business and corporate governance experts say small-business customers can be as susceptible to fraud as any customer. Owners are typically knowledgeable about their business expertise but not about banking services, said Peter Conti-Brown, a financial regulation professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. For example, a new dentist who borrows from a bank to buy a practice may then need other services that she does not even know exist, such as payroll management or credit-card clearing.But the potential for abuse still exists, he said. A bank can sell multiple, unnecessary accounts and credit cards to sole proprietors whose needs rarely exceed making deposits and writing checks. The risk of abuse is greater when bankers are required to sell a certain number of products to meet performance goals.""The best case is that you will sour your relationship, and in the worst case, you'll get bankers committing fraud,"" Conti-Brown said. ""Wells Fargo has seen both of these things.""

HAVERFORD, Pa. Democrat Hillary Clinton slammed Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday for making disparaging comments about women's physical appearance, accusing Trump of taking the issue of female body image ""to a new level of difficulty and meanness.""Hours before vice presidential candidates Tim Kaine and Mike Pence face off in Virginia in their sole debate, Clinton urged women at an event in the Philadelphia suburbs billed as a ""family town hall"" to stand up to online bullying about how they look.""It's shocking when women are called names and judged solely on the basis of physical attributes,"" the Democratic presidential nominee said in response to a 15-year-old girl's question about the problem of body image and the ""damage Donald Trump does"" when he talks about how women look.""My opponent insulted Miss Universe,"" Clinton said, resurrecting her Republican rival's comments last week about former beauty queen Alicia Machado's weight gain after she won the Miss Universe contest in 1996.""I mean, how do you get more acclaimed than that? But it wasn't good enough,"" Clinton said. ""We can't take any of this seriously anymore. We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it.""Clinton, the first woman to be nominated for the presidency by a major U.S. party, has rushed to capitalize on Trump's public feud with Machado, whom he once called ""Miss Piggy"" because of her weight gain, and make inroads with women voters five weeks before the Nov. 8 election.Clinton's and Trump's running mates, Democrat Kaine, a U.S. senator, and Republican Pence, governor of Indiana, will meet in a debate in Farmville, Virginia, starting at 9 p.m. on Tuesday (0100 GMT on Wednesday.) The debate will provide voters their first extended chance to evaluate the No. 2's in the White House race and is the only showdown between the vice presidential candidates. Trump and Clinton will meet in their second debate on Sunday.Pence could find himself frequently on the defensive about Trump, a New York businessman who has been dealing with a torrent of bad news in the past week.
That includes a New York Times report that Trump took an almost $1 billion loss in 1995 that may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. While Democrats have slammed him over the report, Trump, who made much of his business acumen on the campaign trail, has said he ""brilliantly used"" U.S. tax rules to his advantage to limit his tax bills.Clinton disagreed, telling reporters on Tuesday it showed ""unequivocally"" that Trump was a failure at business for losing $1 billion to begin with.A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday said 67 percent of Americans believed it was ""selfish"" for a presidential candidate to pay no taxes, although 46 percent thought a candidate who paid no taxes was ""smart.""'HARMFUL COMMENTS'

Clinton also criticized Trump for appearing to suggest on Monday that veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress were not strong enough to handle the stress of war. Trump and his campaign said his words were taken out of context.""When people come back from war and combat, and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over - and you're strong and you can handle it - but a lot of people can't handle it,"" Trump told a veterans group on Monday.Clinton said troops deserved a commander in chief who understood their sacrifice.""Donald Trump's comments are not just ignorant, they are harmful because they give voice to the stigma that has led generations of veterans to hide their struggles instead of getting lifesaving help,"" she said.
On the campaign trail on Tuesday, Trump met with about a dozen energy executives in Denver, querying them mainly about their concerns about regulations he said had ""gotten out of control.""John Harpole, chief executive of Mercator Energy, said he did not understand why the Obama administration's response to the shale boom and Clinton's energy positions had not come up during the first presidential debate last week.Others told Trump they faced more immediate concerns with state-level regulators. Scott Stewart of Gilbert-Stewart Operating said his company had largely moved operations to Kansas because of stiff rules in Colorado.Trump also reveled in comments on Monday by Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, who said small-business people and people who make too much to get federal subsidies to help with insurance payments were ""getting killed"" by the federal healthcare law known as Obamacare.Trump has promised to repeal Obamacare, while Hillary Clinton has praised it but said she would work to improve aspects of it.""I bet he went through hell last night, can you imagine?"" Trump said of Bill Clinton during a rally in Prescott, Arizona. ""He went through hell, but honestly there have been many nights when he has gone through hell with Hillary.""Clinton has led Trump in national opinion polls in recent months. On Tuesday, an average of polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics website showed her with 48.1 percent of support compared with Trump's 44.3 percent.

An Illinois law allowing voters in highly populated areas to register to vote at polling places on election day was reinstated on Tuesday by a federal court, pending an appeal of a ruling declaring the statute unfair to people in smaller communities.The state is seeking to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan, which found that the law discriminates against voters in less-populated counties.The law, passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed into law in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, allowed election day voter registration for the first time, including at polling places.But the section of the law regarding polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more.
The conservative Liberty Justice Center, of Chicago, filed a lawsuit in August, saying the law was discriminatory. Der-Yeghiayan agreed, writing that the law provided an advantage to urban voters over their rural counterparts. The state of Illinois appealed the ruling last month, and in their order issued Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted the state's request to stay the order until the appeal was adjudicated, court records show.
U.S. voters will go to the polls to choose a president, Congressional representatives and other officials on Nov. 8. On Tuesday, the appellate court ordered attorneys on both sides to say by Thursday whether they would like the appeals process to be sped up due to the proximity of the election.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. regulations, proposed by the Treasury to crack down on companies that try to reduce taxes by rebasing abroad, have begun a White House review and could be finalized shortly, officials said on Tuesday.The regulations, which would make it difficult for U.S. business operations to avoid taxation while shifting profits overseas through a practice called ""earnings stripping,"" were received by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last week. The agency has up to 90 days to decide whether the rules should be finalized or returned to Treasury for further consideration.""We are satisfied we have addressed stakeholder feedback and are close to issuing final earnings stripping regulations,"" a Treasury spokesperson said.
The Obama administration has faced widespread criticism from the business community over its regulatory assault on tax inversions, which are tax-driven mergers in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller, foreign business in a low-tax country and shifts its headquarters there, if only on paper, to avoid higher U.S. taxes.   Business and industry groups have threatened lawsuits and called for the new rules to be withdrawn or heavily revised because of what critics say is the potential for unintended harm to business. Members of Congress have also accused the administration of overstepping its legal authority.
Earnings stripping occurs when an inverted company eludes U.S. taxes on its domestic operation by shifting profits overseas in the form of tax-deductible interest payments to its foreign parent. The new rules would change certain interest payments into equity dividends, which are not tax deductible in the United States. 
The regulations were proposed in April, along with a temporary rule to prevent serial inversion deals by foreign companies. That rule, which is already the target of a lawsuit, has not yet been forwarded to OMB. (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

NEW YORK Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says paying no income tax would make him ""smart."" While nearly half of Americans agree with him, more people think it is ""selfish,"" and ""unpatriotic,"" according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. Some 67 percent of Americans said it is ""selfish"" for a presidential candidate to pay no taxes, while 61 percent said it is ""unpatriotic,"" according to the poll, which allowed respondents to pick more than one adjective to describe paying no taxes.At the same time, the results showed some respect for a candidate who can figure out how to reduce their tax bill. Some 46 percent of Americans, including 35 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of Republicans, thought a presidential candidate who pays no taxes is ""smart.""Trump's taxes have become a big campaign issue after the New York Times released a portion of his 1995 tax returns last week and estimated that Trump likely paid no taxes for a number of years. The celebrity real estate developer, who is the first presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his full tax returns, didn't deny the report. He later said that he had ""brilliantly used"" U.S. tax rules to his advantage. During the first presidential debate with his rival Democrat Hillary Clinton last month, Trump responded to Clinton's allegation that he paid no federal taxes by saying that would make him ""smart."" 
""What is he trying to say: that those of us who pay taxes aren't intelligent?"" said poll respondent Yonna McNerney, 41, of Denver. ""I started working at the age of 16, and I've always paid taxes,"" she said. ""Not paying taxes, I don't think that's acceptable.""McNerney, a mother of three who works at a telecommunications company, remains uncommitted in the race and said Trump's comments about taxes haven't changed her mind one way or the other.April St. Aoro, 46, who works for a manufacturing firm near St. Cloud, Minnesota, was more understanding of Trump's point of view, though she also remains undecided in the race.
""I think all of us are trying to pay as little taxes as possible,"" St. Aoro said.Respondents were slightly less critical when asked to describe a private citizen paying no taxes.Some 64 percent agreed it was ""selfish,"" while just over half agreed it was ""unpatriotic."" Some 50 percent, including 37 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of Republicans, agreed that it was ""smart.""
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. Respondents were asked what they thought of ""a private citizen who has found a way to pay no income taxes,"" and given the choice to agree or disagree to the words ""smart,"" ""selfish,"" and ""unpatriotic."" They were then asked the same set of questions about a presidential candidate.The Sept. 28-Oct. 3 poll was part of a larger national tracking poll that tracks public opinion every day. It included 1,948 American adults, including 893 Democrats and 635 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample, 4 percentage points for Democrats only and 5 percentage points for Republicans.

By Emily Stephenson
| PUEBLO, Colo.

PUEBLO, Colo. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Monday he ""brilliantly used"" U.S. tax rules to his advantage in trying to limit the amount he paid in taxes, arguing it helped him survive a difficult period in the real estate market.""I was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of the real estate mess ... when few others were able to do what I did,"" Trump told a crowd in Pueblo, Colorado.It was Trump's first extended comments since a New York Times report said he had claimed a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax returns, which experts said might have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has seized on the report, arguing the tax records undercut Trump's business acumen. ""What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year? This is Trump to a T, he's taken corporate excess and made a business out of it,"" Clinton told a rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Monday.
Clinton has repeatedly called on Trump to release his full returns, as presidential candidates have done in the past. Trump was dismissive of the Times' story in his Pueblo remarks, saying the media was ""obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990s.""
The Trump campaign has not said, however, that the Times' story was inaccurate. Instead, his supporters, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have contended that Trump's aggressive use of provisions under U.S. law to minimize his tax liability was evidence of his ""genius"" as a businessman and real estate investor.Trump picked up on that theme on Monday. ""I have brilliantly used those laws,"" he told the crowd in Pueblo.The flap over Trump's taxes comes during what has been a difficult stretch for the candidate, who faced criticism for his performance in the Sept. 26 debate against Clinton and his subsequent public spat with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.
A Reuters/Ipsos online poll last week showed a majority of Americans felt Clinton won the debate, the first of three scheduled between the candidates..On Monday, the state of New York ordered Trump's charity, the Trump Foundation, to suspend raising money amid a probe into its activities.
