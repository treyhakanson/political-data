| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton has one of the strongest resumes of anyone ever to run for U.S. president, with stints as first lady, senator and secretary of state, but she is also a polarizing figure and a Washington insider with decades of political baggage.Should Democrat Clinton, 69, defeat Republican Donald Trump, 70, in Tuesday's election, she would become the first woman elected U.S. president, having already been the only first lady to win elected office and the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. party.Clinton fell short in her first presidential bid in 2008, losing her party's nomination to Barack Obama.Her time on the American political scene has come during an era of intense partisanship and gaping divisions in U.S. society. Americans hold dramatically differing views of Clinton.Clinton's admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist.Clinton entered the 2016 race as her party's odds-on favorite, but was an establishment figure, the ultimate insider with decades of political baggage, at a time when voters seemed enamored with outsiders. She staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, to claim the Democratic nomination in July.For decades Clinton has battled conservatives and Republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband Bill Clinton's infidelity, a failed Republican effort to remove him from office, investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She famously complained in 1998 during her husband's presidency about a ""vast right-wing conspiracy.""Many Democrats back her for championing women's rights at home and abroad, social justice and access to healthcare, but opinion polls show a majority of U.S. voters do not trust her. [polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM752Y15_2]Against Trump, she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to American democracy.As President Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she grappled with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Iran's nuclear program, China's growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Clinton was already running for president when, during a testy 11-hour congressional hearing in October 2015, she deflected Republican criticism of her handling of a 2012 attack by militants in Benghazi, Libya in which the U.S. ambassador died.That hearing and another in January 2013 while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of State Department security lapses related to the attack.'WHAT TO MAKE OF ME'
A mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted Clinton to keep her guard up.""The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part,"" Clinton said in accepting the 2016 Democratic nomination. ""I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.""At the same convention, Obama cited her years of experience and said, ""There has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill - nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States.""Republicans have accused Clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state. In July, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified information by email, but Obama's Justice Department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges.
""If I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently,"" Clinton said during a Sept. 26 debate with Trump, referring to her use of the private server as a ""mistake"" for which she took responsibility.The controversy flared again on Oct. 28 when Comey told U.S. lawmakers the FBI was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe, but said their significance was unclear.Trump seized on the probe into Clinton's email, deriding her as ""Crooked Hillary,"" saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant ""lock her up.""Clinton portrayed Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief.""Such a nasty woman,"" Trump retorted during their Oct. 19 debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy.MIDWESTERN ROOTS
Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was  the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a ""rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican"" and a mother who was a closet Democrat.She said she inherited her father's distinctive laugh - she called it ""a big rolling guffaw"" - and Americans have heard it frequently. She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club. 
In a Wellesley commencement address, she seized the spotlight by starting her speech with extemporaneous remarks challenging comments made by the preceding speaker, a U.S. senator.Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation. She attended the 1968 Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon, but soon became a Democrat.At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal.She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couple's only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980.As Arkansas' first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member.Most Americans were introduced to her during her husband's bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get ""two for the price of one"" if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who ""stayed home and baked cookies.""After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynette's song, ""Stand by Your Man.""""You know, I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,"" she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. ""And you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him,"" she added. Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values.
WHITE HOUSE CONTROVERSIES
Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was unusually exertive, diving into policy matters unlike many of her predecessors.Critics assailed her failed effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as ""Hillarycare.""At a 1995 U.N. conference in China on women, she declared that ""human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights."" She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky.Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted ""conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he 'knew about Whitewater.'"" In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behavior related to Whitewater.In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky.The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a ""Soviet-style show trial"" and condemned what she called ""an attempted congressional coup d'etat.""She also said she ""wanted to wring Bill's neck"" for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counseling.""All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does,"" she wrote in her 2003 book ""Living History.""Hillary Clinton soon launched her own bid for elected office. She bought a house in the town of Chappaqua to officially become a New York resident. She won election as a U.S. senator the same month her husband left office in January 2001. She served until 2009.She entered the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as the front-runner, but then-senator Obama won the party's nomination and beat Republican John McCain to become the first black president.In 2016, Obama campaigned vigorously for her against Trump.""What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn't stop caring, and she doesn't stop trying. And she never stops fighting for us, even if we haven't always appreciated it,"" Obama told a September rally.

By Emily Stephenson
| STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich.

STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told crowds in Michigan and Minnesota on Sunday his administration would not admit refugees without local support, using appearances in states with growing Muslim communities to criticize Democrat Hillary Clinton's support for accepting people fleeing Syria.Trump said in Minneapolis that people there had already seen the results of ""faulty"" vetting with Minnesota's community of Somali Muslims. He said what was happening in Michigan, home to several cities with Muslim communities, was ""disgraceful.""Trump held rallies in both states as part of his final push toward Tuesday's presidential election, even though Michigan and Minnesota traditionally support Democrats in White House races.""Here in Michigan, you've seen firsthand the problems caused with the refugee program ... it puts your security at risk and it puts enormous pressure on your schools and your community resources,"" Trump told an outdoor rally in Sterling Heights.""A Trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community.""
Muslim American groups have criticized Trump for comments such as endorsing police profiling as an anti-terrorism tactic. He initially called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, later changing it to bar immigration from what he called ""terror-prone"" regions until extensive vetting measures were in place.  Clinton has praised Democratic President Barack Obama's plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016 and said the United States could do more. Trump said her plan to admit refugees from Syria would import ""generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism.""
His vow to block people fleeing Islamic State violence in Syria and instead form ""safe zones"" in the Middle East has been a theme of his campaign. On Sunday, Trump framed the issue in local terms. What was happening in Minnesota was a ""disaster,"" he told the crowd at a Minneapolis airplane hangar. 
""Some of them, they're joining ISIS, they're spreading their extremist views all over the country,"" he said of refugees there, citing a September stabbing attack in St. Cloud, Minnesota, as justification for his proposals. Somalis began arriving in Minnesota in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fleeing a civil war in their Horn of Africa nation. There are about 39,000 living in the state, according to U.S. census data from 2014.Somali-Americans have expressed concern about how they are perceived after a trial earlier this year where three young men from the community were convicted of trying to join Islamic State.

MANCHESTER, N.H./STERLING HEIGHTS, MICHIGAN As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton criss-crossed the United States on Sunday in a final, frenzied burst of campaigning, the Republican said he was the ""last chance"" to fix a broken country while his Democratic rival said a ""moment of reckoning"" had arrived.The two candidates in Tuesday's presidential election presented starkly different views of the nation and evoked similarly disparate reactions from crowds gathered to hear them speak.In Iowa, Trump said he was the ""last chance"" to fix immigration and trade. Outside Minneapolis, he said the Somali refugee population there was a ""disaster."" Supporters near Pittsburgh booed a song by musician Bruce Springsteen, who is set to campaign with Clinton on Monday night. Chants of ""lock her up"" came in waves even as news broke that the FBI again said Clinton should not face prosecution for her email practices while secretary of state.As rocker and guitarist Ted Nugent warmed up a Trump rally in a Detroit suburb, he grabbed his crotch. ""I've got your blue state right here,"" Nugent said, referring to states that typically vote for Democratic candidates, including Michigan.
""By the way, my language is much, much cleaner, as you know, than Jay Z,"" Trump said at the same event. Trump has criticized crude language in a Friday night concert that rapper Jay Z and his wife, Beyonce, held for Clinton in Cleveland.""The most filthy language you've ever heard,"" Trump said at the Minnesota rally. One of his supporters there wore a t-shirt that said: ""Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some Assembly Required.""
Clinton began and ended Sunday with renditions of ""America the Beautiful."" The first was at a black church in Philadelphia, the second time performed by folk singer James Taylor at a get-out-the-vote rally in New Hampshire, where the crowd swayed and sang along, linking arms.Clinton walked onto the stage with Khizr Khan, whose son was a slain Muslim U.S. soldier. Khan addressed the Democratic National Convention in July, criticizing Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country and offering to loan him a U.S. Constitution. Some in Manchester held up miniature Constitutions in tribute.
""In a race that has been marked by ugly suspicion and insults and attacks of all kinds against immigrants, Muslims and so many others, Mr. Khan, I think, reminded all of us that we are Americans,"" Clinton said.Clinton called Tuesday a ""crossroads election"" and a ""moment of reckoning,"" echoing her earlier statements at a Cleveland rally with Cavaliers player LeBron James.""Our core values as Americans are being tested,"" she said.

By Amy Tennery
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The raucous, passionate and unpredictable 2016 U.S. presidential election is on track to notch another distinction: the most wagered-upon political event ever.With many opinion polls showing a tight race just one day before Tuesday's election, record numbers of bettors are pouring millions into online platforms from Ireland to Iowa in the hope of capturing a financial windfall from a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump. UK-based internet betting exchange Betfair said on Sunday its ""Next President"" market was set to become the most traded it had ever seen and expected to surpass even Brexit, the contentious UK referendum to leave the European Union.By Sunday, roughly $130 million had been traded on who will become the next U.S. president, compared with $159 million on the Brexit referendum, Betfair spokeswoman Naomi Totten said. The amount bet so far on the 2016 contest dwarfs the roughly $50 million laid on the 2012 race.""We think it is because (of) how raw the Brexit (vote) is in people's minds - they're not convinced yet that it's a done deal,"" Totten said.Most polls leading into Britain's June 23 referendum predicted Britons would choose to remain in the EU. Instead, they voted to leave by a 52 percent to 48 percent margin.Betfair's ""Next President"" market was by far the largest of more than 70 markets on the site related to the U.S. election. As of Friday, some $140 million has been put into play on markets ranging from who will win the popular vote to how many states each party will carry.On Ireland's Paddy Power, which merged with Betfair earlier this year, the U.S. presidential election ""is definitely on course to be the biggest political event,"" said spokesman Feilim Mac An Iomaire. The site has had about $4.38 million bet on the race so far.For Paddy Power, sporting events remain the site's ""bread and butter,"" with politics more of a ""niche market,"" Mac An Iomaire said. Nonetheless, he expects the 2016 race to be among the top 10-most-traded events on the site.Even people with no knowledge of politics know who Trump is, said Mac An Iomaire said, explaining the runaway popularity of the U.S. election in betting markets. ""Trump is such a huge celebrity.""
Ladbrokes, a UK-based gambling company, said about 5 million pounds, or a little over $6 million, had been bet on the 2016 presidential election since its markets on the race opened four years ago. A Ladbrokes spokesman said that amount was ""at least double"" the amount wagered on the 2012 election.The three sites all reported an 83 percent probability of a Clinton victory on Tuesday. Her probability shot up a few percentage points on Sunday after the FBI stood by its earlier recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted against Clinton in her use of a private email server. BACK IN THE USA
The vast majority of big-dollar political betting occurs outside America. Wagering on elections in the United States is limited by law to relatively small trading platforms connected to universities, which use data from the markets for academic research.
Still, the sites are abuzz with activity as the election nears, albeit in small amounts. On PredictIt, launched in 2014 and jointly run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and Washington, D.C.-based political consulting firm Aristotle International Inc, the five most-active markets all related to the presidential election.PredictIt is not legally permitted to disclose the amount of money traded, but its top three markets have all reached the maximum number of participants.Trading on the older Iowa Electronic Markets, launched by the University of Iowa in 1988, has also been brisk, although a spokeswoman said she could not say if 2016 was seeing substantially more volume than in 2012, when President Barack Obama won re-election against Republican Mitt Romney.The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clinton with a 5 percentage point lead over Trump in the national survey - 44 percent to 39 percent - while races in the swing states of Florida, North Carolina had shifted from Clinton's control to being too close to call.
The PredictIt market gave Clinton an 81 percent probability of winning the White House. IEM's ""Winner Takes All"" market showed her with a 71 percent chance .'SHE WILL WIN IN A LANDSLIDE'
Betfair said on Friday that Trump was emerging as the clear favorite among one group of players in particular - Brexit backers. Two-thirds of its customers who had supported a Brexit outcome were also backing Trump on Betfair.Paul Krishnamurty, a professional gambler for 15 years who works as an analyst at Betfair and a columnist at Politico, is not one of them. He told Reuters he stood to lose $28,000 if Trump wins on Tuesday.Krishnamurty, who said he had earned roughly half a million dollars during his betting career, has laid money on several election-related markets this year. He took a winning position on Trump's selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate and bet against Jeb Bush during the Republican nominating contests. He said he believed Clinton would likely to win both North Carolina and Florida and that a Trump victory was unlikely.""I personally believe she will win in a landslide,"" Krishnamurty said.

By Alana Wise and Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The FBI said on Sunday it stood by its earlier finding that no criminal charges were warranted against Democrat Hillary Clinton for using a private email server for government work, lifting a cloud over her presidential campaign two days before the U.S. election.FBI Director James Comey made the announcement in a letter to Congress, saying the agency had worked ""around the clock"" to complete its review of newly discovered emails and found no reason to change its July finding.""During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state,"" Comey said. ""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July.""A law enforcement source told Reuters the decision closed the FBI probe of Clinton's email practices. Comey informed Congress of the newly discovered emails more than a week ago, throwing the race for the White House into turmoil and helping to erode Clinton's lead over Republican candidate Donald Trump in the final stretch before Tuesday's vote.""We're glad this issue is resolved but for the record, this could easily have been learned before 1st letter was sent,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon wrote on Twitter.At a rally in Michigan, Trump questioned the thoroughness of the FBI review and said he was confident the issue would not go away.""The investigation will go on, the rank-and-file special agents won't let her get away with her terrible crimes,"" he told supporters in Sterling Heights, Michigan.
Clinton did not mention the FBI email decision during campaign appearances in Ohio and New Hampshire.U.S. stock index futures rose more than 1 percent after the FBI announcement, suggesting Wall Street was poised to end its longest skid in more than three decades. The U.S. dollar also jumped in Asian trading against the yen, euro and Swiss franc.U.S. Treasury futures dropped and Tokyo's Nikkei share average opened up 1.31 percent. Global financial markets slipped last week as opinion polls showed the presidential race tightening.DEMOCRATS NOT LETTING COMEY OFF HOOK

The latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe of former Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he allegedly sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.Federal investigators got a warrant to examine the emails to see if they were related to the probe into Clinton's private server. Democrats reacted angrily to Comey's intrusion into the race and demanded quick action in examining the emails.""I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time,"" Comey said on Sunday.But Democrats did not let Comey and the FBI off the hook. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said Sunday's announcement made Comey's earlier letter ""even more troubling"" and called for the Justice Department to review its procedures to prevent similar actions to influence future elections.
""By confirming that the new emails were meaningless, today's letter underscores the irresponsibility of Director Comey's original letter,"" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said.Republicans kept up their criticism of Clinton despite Comey's announcement.""She simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules,"" House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement, arguing that Clinton's use of a private email server ""compromised our national security.""Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus said that while the probe had not led to criminal charges, it produced evidence that Clinton broke the law and ""repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct.""News of the renewed probe had appeared to fuel a recent slide in Clinton's poll numbers. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clinton with a 5 percentage point lead over the New York businessman nationally - 44 percent to 39 percent support - while races in the swing states of Florida and North Carolina shifted from favoring Clinton to being too close to call.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project estimates that Clinton has a 90 percent chance of winning the election.
