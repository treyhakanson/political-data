By Joseph Menn, Mark Hosenball and John Walcott

Hackers targeted the computer systems of presidential candidate Donald Trump and Republican Party organizations as well as Democratic Party networks, sources familiar with investigations into the attacks said.At least one Trump staff member's email account was infected with malware in 2015 and sent malicious emails to colleagues, according to one insider for the Republican candidate's campaign and an outside security expert. It was unclear whether or not the hackers actually gained access to campaign computers.In the past month, U.S. security officials have said that starting last year, hackers infiltrated computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and her party's congressional fundraising committee.
U.S. officials said they have concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible, leading to calls by some Democrats and cyber security officials for the Obama administration to blame Russia publicly. Kremlin officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd, but there is anxiety in Washington over the possibility that a foreign power might be using hacked information to meddle in the Nov. 8 U.S. election.The Trump campaign has hired security firm CrowdStrike, which also is assisting the Democratic National Committee, according to one person briefed on the matter. The company declined to comment.A different outside security firm was hired to examine software the Trump and Clinton campaigns use to manage mailings, electronic outreach and other campaign efforts, another person who was briefed on the issue said.A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign declined to comment. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee could not immediately be reached for comment.
The tools and techniques used to hack Republican targets resemble those employed in attacks on Democratic Party organizations, including the DNC and Clinton's campaign organization, two sources said. That has led U.S. officials to reach a preliminary assessment that Russia's military and civilian intelligence agencies or their proxies have targeted both political parties.Attempts to hack into Republican political organizations over an extended period were reported in intelligence bulletins circulated by U.S. agencies, four sources said. They did not disclose the identities of the organizations.
Two U.S. security officials said the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have offered assistance to both political parties in identifying possible intrusions and upgrading their defenses against what one of the officials called ""constantly evolving threats.""

WASHINGTON A U.S. State Department video of a press briefing about secret U.S.-Iran nuclear talks was deliberately edited but there is no evidence to suggest the cut was intended to hide information, a U.S. spokesman said on Thursday after further details were released of an investigation into the incident.""We are confident the video of that press briefing was deliberately edited,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters, adding: ""What we were not able to determine is why the edit was made in the first place. There's no evidence to suggest it was made with the intent to conceal information from the public.""The excised portion of a Dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the United States was holding secret direct nuclear talks with Iran.
The State Department initially said it was caused by a ""glitch"" but later said it was a deliberate omission.Kirby said the investigation by the department's Office of the Legal Adviser could not rule out that a technical glitch might have deleted the portion of the video because of the ""choppy nature of the cut.""
He said the findings had now been shared with Secretary of State John Kerry and with congressional members.

WASHINGTON The U.S. State Department said on Thursday it released $400 million in cash to Iran under a tribunal settlement only once it was assured that American prisoners had been freed and had boarded a plane.""The payment of the $400 million was not done until after the prisoners were released,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters.""We took advantage of that to make sure we had the maximum leverage possible to get our people out and get them out safely,"" Kirby added.It was the first time the administration has said publicly that it used the payment as leverage to ensure the prisoners were released by Iran.Three of the five prisoners, including Jason Rezaian, the Washington Posts's Tehran bureau chief; Saeed Abedini, a pastor from Idaho and Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine from Flint, Michigan, as well as some family members, were part of a prisoner exchange that followed the lifting of most international sanctions against Iran following a nuclear deal in 2015.
One more prisoner, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, chose to remain in Iran, while a fifth prisoner, American student Matthew Trevithick, was released separately.   Both U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have denied that the payment was ransom for the release of the prisoners or tied to the Iran nuclear deal.The White House announced on Jan. 17 it was releasing $400 million in funds frozen since 1981, plus $1.3 billion in interest owed to Iran, as part of a settlement of a long-standing Iranian claim at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague.
The funds were part of a trust fund Iran used before its 1979 Islamic Revolution to buy U.S. military equipment that was tied up for decades in litigation at the tribunal.The payment was made by the United States in cash due to international sanctions against Iran.
The administration has maintained that negotiations over the funds and the prisoners were conducted on separate tracks and were in no way linked.Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has asked Kerry to appear at a future committee hearing to discuss the payment.

By Joseph Ax
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Thursday nominated the state's inspector general to serve as interim attorney general until November's election, temporarily replacing Kathleen Kane, who resigned the post earlier this week after her conviction for perjury.Bruce Beemer, who previously served under Kane as first deputy in the attorney general's office, will have to be confirmed by the state Senate.Wolf said in a statement that he had already conferred with both Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate and expected a quick confirmation. Beemer would hold the job until a successor is elected in November for a four-year term, and then return to his role as inspector general.Kane announced her resignation on Tuesday, a day after a jury convicted her of leaking sealed grand jury material to a news reporter in an effort to embarrass a political rival.The move will likely end a brief stint as acting attorney general for Bruce Castor, whom Kane had hired as her second-in-command earlier this year.
In a statement, Castor said the governor was fulfilling his duties under the law.""I will do all within my power to see that the office of attorney general is in the best possible shape for whenever the next attorney general arrives,"" Castor said.Castor, the former Montgomery County district attorney, made headlines earlier this year when he testified at a hearing for comedian Bill Cosby in his sexual assault case.
Castor said he had agreed not to prosecute Cosby if the entertainer testified in a civil case brought by his accuser. But a court ruled Castor's claims were not enough to prevent the current district attorney from bringing charges.Kane's conviction, meanwhile, ended what had once been seen as a promising political career.Prosecutors said Kane believed former state prosecutor Frank Fina was behind a 2014 newspaper article that said she had abandoned a corruption investigation into Philadelphia officials.
In an effort to take revenge, prosecutors said, Kane leaked sealed details about a separate investigation that Fina declined to pursue and then lied about having done so to a grand jury investigating the matter.Kane had portrayed the charges as politically motivated, after she revealed lewd emails exchanged among judges, state officials and prosecutors that she discovered while re-examining the Jerry Sandusky molestation investigation.Several officials, including two state Supreme Court justices, lost their jobs in the wake of the email scandal, dubbed ""Porngate.""

By Mark Hosenball, Dustin Volz and John Walcott
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Bill and Hillary Clinton's charitable foundation hired the security firm FireEye to examine its data systems after seeing indications they might have been hacked, according to two sources familiar with the matter.So far, no message or document hacked from the New York-based Clinton Foundation has surfaced in public, the sources said.One of the sources and two U.S. security officials said that like hackers who targeted the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democrats' congressional fundraising committee, the hackers appear to have used ""spear phishing"" techniques to gain access to the foundation's network.ELSEWHERE IN THE NEWSU.S. swimmers trying to return from Rio yanked off flightA desperate country crushes 2,000 guns in public, plans bullet registryThese techniques include creating bogus emails or websites in an effort to gain access to Clinton Foundation staffers' emails and then to the foundation itself.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the U.S. officials said the hackers used the same techniques Russian intelligence agencies or their proxies employed against the Democratic Party groups, which suggests that Russians also attacked the foundation.Kremlin officials dismissed as absurd the allegations of Moscow's involvement, which were made last month amid political party nominating conventions for the Nov. 8 election.Neither former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, the Clinton Foundation's principal lawyer, nor a spokeswoman for the foundation responded to requests for comment on the hacking and the precautions the organization has taken.Officials with FireEye said the company could not discuss its clients.
Although no documents have emerged, the attacks have left some Democrats and Clinton campaign officials worried that the hackers might have obtained emails and voice messages that could be used to reinforce Republican charges that donors to the Clinton Foundation were rewarded with access to Clinton and her aides while she was secretary of state or to her husband, former President Bill Clinton.Another concern: hackers or outlets such as the anti-secrecy WikiLeaks website could release documents and emails damaging to her presidential campaign, several people familiar with the foundation's activities said.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee convened a closed-door meeting on Wednesday to discuss best cyber security practices.The meeting, according to people familiar with it, included a recommendation that staff and lawmakers change their phone numbers and email addresses if that information was published online by hackers believed to be working for or with Russian intelligence agencies.
One of the U.S. officials said, however, that the spear phishing pattern used against several organizations, appears to reinforce the intelligence community's ""preliminary assessment"" that the attacks were intended more for espionage than for trying to influence the U.S. presidential election.So far, said a third U.S. official familiar with the attacks, there is no evidence that the hackers were able to follow any of the hacked emails into the State Department's classified email systems.Anxiety in Washington over the possibility that a foreign power might be using hacked information to meddle in the U.S. election has prompted some Democrats and cyber security experts to urge the Obama administration to blame Russia publicly.Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, said the United States should carry ""a big stick"" in cyber security matters. ""The U.S. government needs to be very clear, very direct, and hold these people accountable.""Current and former White House and intelligence officials said the Obama administration is unlikely to blame Russia publicly, given the difficulty of attributing the attacks without revealing American sources and methods, the geopolitical concerns at play, and a fear that doing so could risk aggravating cyber conflict.

By Steve Holland and Emily Flitter

U.S. Republican Donald Trump overhauled his presidential campaign team on Wednesday for the second time in less than two months, hiring the head of a conservative news website to bolster his combative image and try to reverse poor opinion poll numbers.Trump named Steve Bannon, head of the Breitbart News website, as campaign chief executive officer, a new position. He also promoted senior adviser Kellyanne Conway to the post of campaign manager. The latest shake-up combines Bannon, a conservative flamethrower, with Conway, a measured, data-driven analyst who might be able to broaden Trump's appeal to women and independent voters.    It offers Trump's team a chance to return to the ""let Trump be Trump"" style practiced by former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski that helped Trump, who has never held elective office, win the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election.    Lewandowski, ousted in the last campaign reorganization in June, said on CNN that Bannon was ""a street fighter"" like himself. A Trump campaign statement announcing the changes touted a Bloomberg Politics article that branded Bannon ""the most dangerous political operative in America."" Whether that style will work in the fight against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is unclear. Trump, a New York real estate developer and former reality TV host, has largely been unable to extend his reach beyond white middle-class voters who pack his rallies.Trump trails Clinton in national opinion polls and in many battleground states, potentially facing a big defeat that could also cost Republicans congressional races.        Trump, who relishes revving up crowds with off-the-cuff remarks, drew criticism for comments insulting women, Muslims and Mexican immigrants during the primary campaign for the Republican nomination. He has since faced a barrage of criticism from Republicans over his campaign style and his refusal to stick to a policy message. In particular, he has been rebuked for his prolonged feud with the family of a Muslim U.S. Army captain who was killed in the Iraq war. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump received his first intelligence briefing from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Retired U.S. Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser who attended the briefing at the New York field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the officials who conducted the two-hour session were ""absolutely professional"" and that it was ""a great conversation.""
Intelligence officials brief the major-party U.S. presidential candidates on foreign policy and national security issues but do not disclose ultra-sensitive information about ongoing U.S. undercover operations, methods or the identities of intelligence sources.DIFFERENT STYLES
Wednesday's campaign appointments amounted to a demotion for Paul Manafort, who was brought on as campaign manager in June to bring a more professional touch to Trump's campaign but has struggled to get the businessman to rein in his freewheeling ways.    Clinton, a former secretary of state who has called Trump temperamentally unsuited for the White House, said staff shake-ups did nothing to change the candidate and his rhetoric.
""Donald Trump has shown us who he is, he can hire and fire anybody he wants from his campaign, they can make him read new words from a teleprompter, but he is still the same man who insults Gold Star families, demeans women, mocks people with disabilities and thinks he knows more about ISIS than our generals,"" she told a rally in Ohio.Conway and Bannon may prove to be opposing forces in Trump's campaign. Conway is analytical and numbers-driven and often offers a more pragmatic approach to winning campaigns. She is expected to travel with Trump. Bannon likes to push the limits of polite conversation and revels in taking the fight up a notch, strategists say.""For Steve and I, we also recognize that we are different when we say we have different styles, but we have one vision,"" Conway told reporters. Bannon was a key figure in producing and promoting a movie called ""Clinton Cash"" that accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of doing favors for high-dollar donors to the Clinton Foundation charity, a theme that Trump has been touching on in his campaign speeches.""My guess is Bannon will be a bull in a china shop and Conway will be focused on messaging and paid media,"" said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak.The appointment of Bannon suggested Trump was aiming not to tone down his aggressive style but to be more disciplined in emphasizing themes that resonate strongly with the voters he is trying to court, such as his tough stance against illegal immigration and withering personal criticism of Clinton.
""I am who I am, I don't want to change,"" Trump told Wisconsin television station WKTB on Tuesday. ""If you start pivoting, you're not being honest with people.""The shift to new leadership may not be a good sign at this stage of a campaign, but some Republican strategists said it was not too late for Trump.""I've thought for a while that they've needed more smart, senior people and it looks like they just got them,"" said Republican strategist Charlie Black. ""It's only the middle of August. This race is going to be close in the end, but he does need to tighten up his performance.""Conway told Fox News she was advising Trump to take ""his case directly to the people."" ""With Donald Trump, he is still his own best messenger because people see him as very authentic."".She has worked to improve the Republican Party's standing with women voters and to push back on Democratic accusations that Republicans are waging a ""war on women."" Manafort drew unwelcome attention this week when The New York Times reported his name was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia. Manafort denied any impropriety on Monday.The current RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls puts Clinton six percentage points ahead of Trump, at 47.2 percent to his 41.2 percent.

WASHINGTON FBI documents about the agency's investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state were being reviewed on Wednesday in secure rooms of the U.S. Capitol.Lawmakers and select staff from some congressional committees could page through the material, parts of which are redacted, in large binders labeled ""secret"" that the Federal Bureau of Investigation turned over to Congress on Tuesday.Republican lawmakers requested the information last month after the FBI recommended no criminal charges against Clinton.""Last I heard, my colleagues had their turn with the documents at 1:30 p.m.,"" said a Senate Judiciary committee aide. ""There's only one set of documents for all the interested Senate committees, as I understand it.""She said those viewing the material were allowed to take notes. But if notes were taken on the classified parts, those notes had to be left in the secure area with the documents. Clinton has been dogged for more than a year by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nation's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013.Republicans have repeatedly hammered Clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness. She faces Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election.
The FBI said on Tuesday it had provided ""relevant materials"" to congressional committees looking into the matter.""The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence,"" the agency said in a statement.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday an initial review of the material showed most of it was marked unclassified.
Grassley, who has called for unclassified parts of the documents to be made public, wrote on Wednesday to the Senate Security Office, which has custody of the documents, asking them to provide his committee with an unclassified version.Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon in a statement also called for the public release of the documents, ""rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.""The documents on the Senate side of the Capitol are under the control of the Office of Senate Security, Senate aides said. In the House of Representatives, another set was being viewed in a ""Secure Compartmented Information Facility,"" an aide with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee said.
""Our investigators with (security) clearances have gone down there and looked at the documents,"" the Oversight committee aide said. It was unclear how many lawmakers had actually seen the material so far. Most members of Congress were not in town because of a congressional recess.The documents were made available to the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Appropriations committees in the Senate, and the Oversight, Judiciary and Appropriations committees in the House, aides said.  The Intelligence committees on both sides of the Capitol also have copies, so they do not have to join the line with the others.

By Diane Bartz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Two major mergers in agricultural technology and seeds could hurt competition in the industry and make it harder for smaller companies to compete, Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote in a letter on Wednesday sent to antitrust enforcers.Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, urged the Federal Trade Commission, which is reviewing the purchase of Syngenta AG by the China National Chemical Corp [CNNCC.UL], and the Justice Department, which is looking at the merger of Dow Chemical Co and DuPont Co, to coordinate on the two reviews.""It is important that these transactions not be reviewed in isolation,"" wrote Grassley. ""I urge the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to collaborate, as appropriate, with input from the Department of Agriculture, in their analysis of the agricultural biotechnology and seed industry and the impact of these proposed transactions.""
Dow and DuPont said in December that they would combine in an all-stock merger with plans to then break into three separate businesses. In February, China's state-owned ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] made a $43 billion bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta.The deals by some of farmers' biggest global suppliers concerned Grassley, who represents a largely agricultural state.
""I am concerned that the convergence of these proposed transactions - as well as others currently being discussed - will have an enhanced adverse impact on competition in the industry and raise barriers to entry for smaller companies,"" he wrote.""I also am concerned that further concentration in the industry will impact the price and choice of chemicals and seed for farmers, which ultimately will impact choice and costs for consumers. Finally, I am concerned that further consolidation will diminish critical research and development initiatives,"" added Grassley. 
The letter was dated Tuesday and sent to FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez and Renata Hesse, the acting head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by David Gregorio)"	['Grassley']	[]

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, helped a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia secretly move at least $2.2 million to two major Washington lobbying firms, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday.The AP, citing sources with direct knowledge of the effort, said the transfers were set up in ways to obscure the Ukrainian party's attempts to sway U.S. policies, using a nonprofit organization to distance funds from Ukrainian politicians.U.S. law requires American lobbyists to register and report in detail any ties to foreign political parties or leaders to the U.S. Justice Department.The heads of both firms - Podesta Group Inc and Mercury LLC - told the AP they had concluded their work did not merit disclosure to the department, according to the report.Representatives for Trump and Mercury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Podesta Group Chief Executive Officer Kimberley Fritts said its lawyers worked with those at Mercury to determine that registering under the Foreign Agent Registration Act was unnecessary. It also obtained a statement from the nonprofit in question saying it was not directly or indirectly involved with a foreign entity, she said in an emailed statement. The Podesta Group was founded in 1987 by Tony Podesta and his brother John, who now is campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. John Podesta has not been with the firm for several years, but his brother is its chairman.
The AP report comes less than three months before the Nov. 8 election and as polls show Trump slipping behind Clinton.Trump's campaign on Wednesday announced a staff shake-up replacing Manafort as campaign manager after just two months. He will remain chairman and chief strategist.The New York Times this week reported Manafort's name was found on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a Ukrainian party with Russian ties. Manafort has denied any impropriety. 
Ukrainian officials confirmed Manafort's name appeared on a ledger and that more than $12 million had been allocated as an expenditure but said the presence of his name did not mean he received the funds.Clinton's campaign has said Manafort's associations are a troubling sign of ties between Trump's campaign team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine.According to the AP, in 2012 Manafort and associate Rick Gates worked on behalf of Ukraine's then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, and helped steer the efforts of European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, an advocacy group that once included members of Yanukovych's party. 
The group paid at least $2.2 million to the Washington firms to push positions favorable to the party from 2012 until 2014, when Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, the AP said, citing sources. That work included efforts to counter a potential congressional resolution pressuring Yanukovych to release a political rival from prison, the AP reported.Gates, who also works for the Trump campaign, told the AP his actions were lawful. He said he and Manafort had introduced the advocacy group to the firms and sometimes consulted with the firms on Ukrainian politics, the report said.Podesta's Fritts said her firm was unaware that Gates was a consultant to the Ukrainian party when he introduced the advocacy group: ""Our assumption was that he was working for the Centre, as we were hired to do.""
