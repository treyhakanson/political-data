The Trump Organization said on Friday it was vetting new business structures aimed at transferring management control to three of President-elect Donald Trump's children and a team of executives.The Trump Organization said in a statement it was planning to transfer control of the portfolio of businesses to Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and other executives.Earlier on Friday, the three Trump children - the oldest of Trump's five children - were also named as members of Trump's Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee.  ""This is a top priority at the organization and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations,"" a spokesperson for the Trump Organization said in a statement.Federal conflict-of-interest law does not apply to the president, but most White House occupants in the last few decades have voluntarily placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid any suggestion of impropriety.Experts in government ethics said that giving over control to Trump's children would do virtually nothing to prevent potential conflicts of interest, since there's usually no daylight between one's personal interest and the interest of one's immediate family members.
""It doesn't meet any of the standards of a blind trust if the kids are running the company,"" said Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in advising political clients on compliance and ethics.Gross noted that the official transition team roles that Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump now have would appear to complicate matters further.""If they're going to be involved in government functions -  and they're starting down that road - and running the business, that's going to make it very difficult to separate the government and business functions and deal with the conflicts of interest,"" Gross said.
All three children already have roles in the Trump Organization, according to the company's website. Ivanka Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions, charged with domestic and global expansion of the company's real estate interests.Donald Trump Jr is an executive vice president, and works to expand the company's real estate, retail, commercial, hotel and golf interests nationally and internationally. Eric Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions, responsible for new project acquisition, development and construction globally.
Typically, a blind trust involves turning over assets to an independent financial manager with no prior relationship to the owner. In addition, a blind trust derives its name from the idea that the owner would no longer know what assets are sold or bought. For instance, someone with extensive stock holdings would have no way of knowing which companies' shares he or she still owned in a blind trust.Trump's portfolio includes interests in hundreds of limited liability companies, many overseas, as well as numerous real estate properties both domestic and foreign.Short of selling the entire Trump empire, experts said, he will find it difficult to create a trust sufficiently ""blind"" to avoid the possibility of any conflicts.

| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner reported personal income of more than $188.1 million in 2015, and 90 percent of the former private equity investor's earnings came from capital gains, according to income tax returns he released on Friday.Rauner, a Republican, and his wife, Diana, paid federal taxes of $51.6 million and $6.9 million in state taxes in 2015. Of the total income, $169.5 million was from capital gains, though no details were released on the source of those profits.""I believe as the good book says to whom much has been given from whom much is expected in return,"" Rauner said at a news conference when asked about his tax returns.Rauner, who has led a fight against Democrats controlling Illinois' legislature in the country's longest-running state fiscal impasse, and his wife contributed $21.7 million individually to various Illinois political campaigns this year to weaken Democratic control of the state legislature and dislodge the state's long-running budget stalemate, campaign records show.Illinois has not had a full operating budget for 17 months.
Republicans netted four seats in the Illinois House and two seats in the state Senate in Tuesday's elections, but Democrats retained control of both legislative chambers and defeated Rauner's choice for comptroller.A separate filing from Rauner's family's foundation showed $53.6 million in assets at the end of 2015 and $11.6 million in charitable giving for the year.In 2014, Rauner and his wife reported $58.3 million in earnings.
Because the Rauners' assets are in a blind trust, an aide said the couple is ""screened from all financial decisions"" and cannot explain the increase in their income.A spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan  declined comment on the governor's earnings, but a top Madigan ally said Rauner's wealth puts him out of touch with the electorate.
""I don't know how he can claim to ever understand the problems of regular, ordinary Illinoisans,"" said Democratic Representative Lou Lang.Madigan and Democratic Senate President John Cullerton, Chicago attorneys who maintain property-tax appeal practices, do not release their tax returns.

President-elect Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal he is considering retaining parts of President Barack Obama's healthcare law including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.The Republican businessman during the U.S. presidential campaign called for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and labeled the 2010 law ""a disaster.""In an interview published on Friday, his first since winning Tuesday's election, Trump told the Journal a big reason for his shift was his meeting at the White House on Thursday with Obama, who suggested areas of the Affordable Care Act to preserve.""I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that,"" Trump said.""Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,"" Trump told the Journal.
Some Republican lawmakers and advisers have recommended keeping those two provisions in place even if they are able to repeal the law in Congress, as they have attempted to do for years.The law has enabled millions of Americans who previously had no health insurance to obtain coverage, but Republicans oppose it and call it a government overreach.
Other urgent priorities during his first few weeks as president, Trump said, would be deregulating financial institutions to allow ""banks to lend again,"" and securing the U.S. border against drugs and illegal immigrants.Asked whether he would pursue a campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, Trump told the paper: ""It's not something I've given a lot of thought, because I want to solve healthcare, jobs, border control, tax reform.""
Trump also told the Journal he would create jobs through infrastructure projects and improved trade deals, and would preserve American jobs by potentially imposing tariffs on the products of U.S. companies that relocated overseas.

By John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Kathryn Stellmack expects the world from Donald Trump.After listening to his speeches and casting her vote for him, she expects Trump to toughen immigration laws, restore lost jobs, upend a corrupt political system, build a wall on the border, and be, as the millionaire put it, the ""greatest jobs president that God has ever created.""""We expect him to move forward on all the items he has promised to move forward on,"" said Stellmack, 69, a retiree in West Palm Beach, Florida.""And if he doesn't, we will hold his feet to the fire.""After a presidential race fueled by brash but constantly shifting policy proposals, Trump's millions of followers -- from social conservative activists to struggling blue-collar workers to hardline militant groups -- say if he does anything less than take a wrecking ball to business-as-usual Washington, they will be disappointed.""We'll be watching, Mr. Trump,"" said Stellmack.Trump's promises have been hard to pin down, with many policy details left elusive and vague. NBC News identified 141 ""distinct shifts"" on 23 major issues since Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015. Still, his fiery rhetoric had an unmistakable message of ending big government and the entrenched power of establishment elites in both parties.That inspired hope that Trump can break through Washington's gridlock to make progress on plans to invigorate the economy, eliminate terrorist threats, rip up trade agreements and repeal President Barack Obama's healthcare plan known as Obamacare.""I totally trust him,"" said Laura Czarniak, 56, of Manistee, Michigan, a Rust Belt state that leans Democrat in presidential elections but which flipped to Trump on Tuesday. ""I know he'll build the wall. I know he'll take care of the Syrian refugee problem. I know he'll get rid of Obamacare. There is not a chance in hell he won't do those things,"" she said.
But even with Republicans retaining control of Congress, Trump will have to accept limits and compromises on some of his plans. Many Republicans, for example, are wary of his proposals to scrap trade deals and boost spending on infrastructure improvements.Some of his plans have already been rolled back.Trump faces his highest expectations on the issue of immigration, given his intense focus on attention-grabbing campaign proposals like forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall, and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country.But he recently indicated he would at first deport only criminal undocumented immigrants, after previously pledging to deport all undocumented aliens, while the Muslim ban has softened into ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants from some countries.He told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that he would consider keeping parts of Obamacare intact -- easing off his calls for a total repeal -- after Obama spoke to him on the issue at the White House on Thursday.
MAY NEED TIME
Mark Morris, a leader of the Colorado-based Three Percent United Patriots militia group, said he understood Trump would need time on some issues, but he expected quick movement on repealing Obamacare and appointing a conservative Supreme Court justice to fill the seat of the late Antonin Scalia.He said he hoped Trump would stand with ranchers in their disputes with the federal government over fees charged for cattle grazing on public land - a call to arms for many in the patriot and militia movement.Morris warned Trump should not count on his followers to stay with him if he did not produce results.""People voted with a lot of faith that he will come through,"" he said. ""I don't think it is going to work out very well if he doesn't get the things done and he comes back at the end of four years and says I need four more years to accomplish what I need to accomplish.""
Trump had to take strong action on immigration given his rhetoric, said Roy Beck, head of Numbers USA, a group that favors reduced immigration levels.He said Numbers USA and other grassroots groups would pressure Trump to keep his promises to bolster enforcement and cut back on legal immigration and foreign workers, including eliminating immigration by low-skill and non-extraordinary-skilled workers.""There's no way he would have been elected president if he had not so boldly made immigration his top issue,"" Beck said. ""You have to come through on your top issue. The question is in the details.""He said many Trump supporters understood his talk about the border wall was ""shorthand"" for restoring the rule of law in immigration, although it was a promise by which he would be judged. ""We're in the best position we've ever been in since the 1950s to get control of this issue, but we still have big challenges,"" Beck said.For many activists in the anti-abortion movement who are suspicious Trump's promises are fueled by politics more than conviction, he still has plenty to prove.""I think we're seeing a mix of emotions, from excitement and some fear to somewhere in between,"" Jeanne Mancini, president of the anti-abortion group March for Life Education and Defense Fund said of Trump's election.""For us the most important thing will be to hold him to his campaign promises, particularly on the Supreme Court. We want to be sure he is true to his word,"" she said of Trump's vow to appoint justices who will vote to overturn Roe vs Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion.But Trump needs to move quickly, said Thomas Pyle, a Trump supporter and president of the free-market advocacy group American Energy Alliance.""Washington is a very, very difficult place to turn the ship. He has a limited window before the culture in Washington seeps in,"" Pyle said. ""But if he acts boldly, he can do a lot.""

By Lisa Lambert and Sarah N. Lynch
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON When Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chair of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, released legislation this summer to weaken the major financial law known as Dodd-Frank, many said it was a pret-a-porter plan that his party's nominee, Donald Trump, could easily adopt.Now that Trump is president-elect, he appears to be doing just that. Language about financial services posted on the Trump transition website, www.greatagain.gov, echoes the tone of Hensarling's bill, known as the CHOICE Act. It calls Dodd-Frank, passed in the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession, as ""a sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies"" and promises to dismantle and replace it with ""new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation.""Hensarling's legislation, which his committee approved in September, also takes a replacement approach.The Texas Republican had unveiled his proposal in Trump's hometown of New York in June, and then met with the businessman later in the day. At the same time, Hensarling was mentioned as a possible Treasury secretary by Trump's team. He has said he is  not pursuing a Cabinet position. ""The CHOICE Act accurately reflects the priorities that President Trump has placed on the Dodd-Frank problem,"" said J.W. Verret, an associate professor at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School and financial regulation expert. Verret regularly meets with and briefs members of Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission on financial regulation.
I think it is a great blueprint for everything that he has promised,"" said Verret, a former Republican congressional staffer. The Hensarling blueprint would primarily allow banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or meeting tougher capital requirements - primarily to maintain a ratio of tangible equity to leverage exposure of 10 percent. It would also reorganize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, throw out the Volcker Rule restricting banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate non-banks as ""systemically important."" It also differs from the Dodd-Frank legislation in the way it treats insolvent banks. Hensarling says his approach will prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to bail out failed institutions. 
Alongside Obamacare, Dodd-Frank is considered one of Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic policies.The most senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown, has been a vocal defender of it, as has liberal firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren. That means a Dodd-Frank revamp could stall in one chamber of Congress. Senate rules allow a single member to block a bill from proceeding to a vote.Trump said last May that he would dismantle Dodd-Frank, primarily because the law makes it hard for banks to loan money. 
But few have called for total demolition of it, with bank industry sources privately saying they would like to see an easing of Dodd-Frank rules. Trump campaign adviser Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street financier, said this week that the administration will review the law and ""the worst anti-business parts of it will be gutted.""Verret said he believes some components of the CHOICE Act will appeal to the populist anger felt by Tea Party members and Trump supporters toward big banks.One such provision, he said, would place limits on how central banks can lend to financial institutions in times of crisis, an in effort to prevent future bailouts.This kind of reform, he added, appeals ""to both populists and free market thinkers at the same time.""

By David Alire Garcia
| NOGALES, Mexico

NOGALES, Mexico Donald Trump's election victory and his plans to crack down on illegal immigration is so troubling for the groups of men gathered just south of a rusty, towering fence on the U.S.-Mexico border that some are even considering going home.For most poor Central Americans and Mexicans at travelers'  shelters in the desert town of Nogales, Trump's threats to build a wall along the whole border and deport millions of illegal immigrants have not made them abandon their harrowing journeys and hopes of a better life in the north. But for some like Juan Alberto Lopez, the prospect of living in a country they believe will become more hostile to people like them no longer holds enough appeal to make the risky crossing across the desolate Arizona borderland.""Now everything's changed,"" said the despondent Lopez, 25, as he sat staring blankly at the ground in outside one migrant center, under a cobalt sky.Lopez hails from the southern state of Chiapas, Mexico's poorest, and lived for two years in Arizona and Utah working in construction before being deported in January. Under one of Trump's proposals, he would face a two-year federal prison sentence for returning after deportation.He had decided to go back to the United States when Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was projected to win the election. Now, he plans to seek work in Nogales instead, or go home. ""They're going to detain all the migrants, and if it's like that, it's better to stay here with your own people, be happy, and just endure it,"" he added, echoing the sentiments of a third of more than a dozen migrants interviewed by Reuters in Nogales following Trump's victory.In running for president, Trump promised to deport millions of illegal immigrants as well as build a wall along the border to stop others entering the United States, and make Mexico pay for it.His uncompromising stance helped drive a rush over the U.S. border as some migrants calculated it was better to cross over before the election in case Trump won. That could continue in coming months even as some like Lopez decide they no longer want to live in the United States.During fiscal year 2016, which ended in September, the number of people detained along the U.S.-Mexico border surpassed 408,000, a 23 percent jump from last year, although it was less than in 2014, official U.S. data published last month showed.""I really don't care about President Trump. I'm always going to cross regardless of any walls he wants,"" said Alexi Solano, 20, a migrant from El Salvador, whose wife and young son are already in Los Angeles.
""That doesn't matter to us. What we want is to be together with our families.""Mexico's deputy interior minister for migration, Humberto Roque Villanueva, said he expected that flow to peak in 2016 as Trump will ramp up already tough deportation policies applied by President Barack Obama.""A certain radicalization of the North American immigration policy is coming,"" Roque Villanueva said.THUGS AND SNAKES     
In Nogales, a city of 230,000 dotted with factories of multinational firms like Motorola and B/E Aerospace, migrants say people smugglers typically charge $4,000 per person for a one-way ticket across the border.
As with long stretches of the 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border, a 25-foot-tall fence already exists along the international boundary here, built in 2011 and made up of thick rust-colored metal beams that follow the rocky terrain for miles to the west and east of the city. Beyond the fence on the U.S. side, a parallel set of wooden posts are topped with cameras and sensors. In the distance, U.S. immigration vehicles slowly patrol the border. Some 25 miles (40 km) to the east of town, the towering fence comes to an end and is replaced with a waist-high barrier that mainly serves to stop trucks plowing through the desert.While some migrants trudge around the barricade, risking weather exposure on foot through rugged terrain menaced by drug cartel thugs and poisonous snakes, others opt to ride hidden in trucks that drive through official crossings, a route made possible, several said, by bribes.Maria Engracia Robles, a Roman Catholic nun who runs El Comedor center for deportees and migrants within sight of the border fence in Nogales, thinks Trump's victory will likely bring more hardship and worries about the challenges that mass deportations would bring. 
""More anguish, tears, laments, and lots of people in Mexico without work, without anything to do and no place to go,"" said Robles, whose center provides free meals, clothes and basic medical care.Braced against the dry wind, dozens of hungry migrants line up around El Comedor's entrance for breakfast each morning. On Thursday, two men just inside the shelter could be overheard on mobile phones asking for a coyote, or human trafficker, to attempt another crossing.""Here there is no work, and salaries are terrible,"" said Robles. The U.S.-Mexico border is home to the largest per capita wage differential of any land border on the planet, with average U.S. wages about five times higher than Mexican wages. Further south, in Central America, incomes are even lower, and crime worse, fueling a surge of migration in recent years. More Central American migrants were apprehended on the U.S. southern border than Mexicans this year.  Jose Flores, 19, a Honduran migrant who set out for the United States three months ago, ticked off the perils posed by violent gangs and dismal job prospects in his home country.""I imagine it's going to get a lot harder to cross,"" he said. ""But what hasn't changed is we're looking for a better life.""(This story has been refiled to fix typo in 20th paragraph) (Additional reporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Kieran Murray)"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Nick Carey
| JANESVILLE, Wisc.

JANESVILLE, Wisc. Semi-retired Wisconsin pig farmer John Lader does not think much of Donald Trump as a messenger, but voted for what he described as the Republican president-elect's message of change and economic hope for America.""The last few years, there hasn't been much optimism and hope among working people in rural areas in this country,"" said Lader, 65, who lives in the farmland outside the southern Wisconsin city of Janesville.Around 65 miles (105 km) to the northeast in the state's biggest city of Milwaukee, Jose Boni, who cleans offices at a local university and rents out several homes, heard a different message: Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and vow to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the United States illegally, most of whom are Hispanic. ""He doesn't care about our community or working people, he only cares about himself,"" said Boni, 57, an Ecuador-born U.S. citizen.The different worlds of Lader and Boni help illustrate the rural-urban divide that was critical to the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.A country once defined by regional voting now is more clearly divided by the differences between rural and urban voters. The combination of a strong Trump turnout in the countryside and a weak showing by Democrat Clinton in the cities went a long way toward deciding the election.Rural and small-town working-class white voters, who already tended to vote Republican, propelled Trump. Urban areas, where black and Hispanic voters are concentrated along with college-educated voters, already leaned toward the Democrats, but Clinton did not get the turnout from these groups that she needed. For instance, black voters did not show up in the same numbers they did for Barack Obama, the first black president, in 2008 and 2012.Trump beat Clinton by 26 percentage points among voters who live in non-metropolitan areas, while Clinton bested Trump by about 7 percentage points in urban areas, according to the nationwide Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll.'THE PERFECT SLOGAN'

Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, said rural voters ""feel they've lost something, that America is moving away from them.""""Trump came up with the perfect slogan for them in 'Make America Great Again' because it hits them exactly where they live,"" Schier said.Democratic presidential candidates had won in Wisconsin in every election since 1988, until Trump's victory on Tuesday.In Wisconsin, overall turnout was lower than in the 2012 presidential election. Trump actually was a few hundred votes shy of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney's total in the state, but Clinton was around 240,000 votes short of Obama's 2012 tally. She ended up around 24,000 votes behind Trump in the state.""Those couple hundred thousand Democratic voters for whatever reason decided not to vote,"" Mordecai Lee, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ""They stayed home, and Wisconsin went Republican. I think that was the pattern around the country."" 
Turnout in Milwaukee's Hispanic neighborhoods was down 9 percent versus 2012, while citywide turnout in Milwaukee fell 14 percent. Clinton took 65.6 percent in Milwaukee County, which includes the city, to Trump's 28.6 percent. But Trump won in rural counties, for example taking 59.9 percent to Clinton's 33.6 percent in Fond du Lac County in the middle of the state and 71.4 percent to 25.1 percent in Florence County in the far north.In Milwaukee, Election Day canvassers found Trump's comments about immigrants were not enough to get people to the polls. Christine Neumann-Ortiz, director of community group Voces De La Frontera, said about 15 percent of the voters reached by the group in Milwaukee raised concerns about Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state or were undecided. ""If we reached people, we were able to convince them to vote, but I don't think we could ever have reached enough by ourselves to overcome Trump's advantage with white working-class voters,"" Neumann-Ortiz said.The rural landscape was rich Trump territory, with people concerned about a slump in commodity prices and layoffs among manufacturers. Rural areas, especially in the Midwest and Northeast, have also seen a demographic shift in recent years with the arrival of Hispanic immigrants.
Demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington said census data from 2008 to 2015 showed Hispanic populations in non-metro counties in the Midwest rose 18 percent while the white population fell 9 percent. The counties still are 84 percent white, but those voters are feeling the change, Frey said.""They're a little bit fearful of it, and if they're being hit hard economically, that can add to it,"" Frey added.Austin Arndt, a beef cattle farmer and neighbor of John Lader outside Janesville, hometown of Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan, said his vote was more against Clinton than for Trump.He said his vote was based on Trump's promise to cut taxes and repeal Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law, which has enabled millions of previously uninsured Americans to gain medical coverage but is detested by conservatives as a government overreach.""From the social point of view as candidates, they were both terrible people,"" said Arndt, 33. ""For me, it was all about the economics.""  (Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Will Dunham)"	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	['healthcare']

By Julia Harte
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Criminal justice reform advocates said they expect Donald Trump will embrace moderate change once he is in the White House, toning down the punitive but undefined ""law and order"" image he projected on the campaign trail.In another instance of experts trying to pin down Trump on an issue he used on the stump without offering much detail, two groups that have met recently with his staff said they expect him to back mainstream sentencing and corrections reforms.A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.In a meeting a few weeks ago, Trump's staff was ""very receptive"" to arguments that crime rates have dropped in states that have reduced prison populations through sentencing reform, said Holly Harris, executive director of the U.S. Justice Action Network, a bipartisan coalition that spearheads legislative efforts to lower sentences for nonviolent offenders.Democratic President Barack Obama, many Republicans in Congress and several of Trump's conservative mentors have embraced changing sentencing standards and better prisons.During the campaign, Trump denounced Obama as being too soft on inner-city violence and for extremist plots against the United States and attacks on police officers.
For instance, in the Oct. 19 presidential debate with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Trump said: ""We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs.""But in the same month, Trump's vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said he was proud that Indiana approved criminal justice reform during his tenure as governor. ""We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect an institutional bias in criminal justice,"" he said.
Tim Head, executive director of the conservative Christian Faith and Freedom Coalition, said his group has held advisory talks with the president-elect's staff in recent days.Head said Trump's Justice Department is likely to emphasize greater ""support for law enforcement, maybe deference for law enforcement"" than Obama did.But Head and Harris also both noted that Republicans close to Trump, such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have advocated for reforms such as lowering sentences for some nonviolent crimes, improving prison conditions and helping former prisoners find jobs and housing.
Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani are reportedly on a short list of conservatives whom Trump is considering for U.S. attorney general.Inimai Chettiar, director of justice programs at the Brennan Center for Justice of New York University, said Trump made some  ""troubling"" campaign-trail claims. One, she said, was arguing that rising crime justifies stop-and-frisk tactics and other police methods that critics say unfairly target minorities.However, she said, she also hoped the president-elect would fall in line with members of the Republican Party who support bipartisan criminal justice reform.

By Jonathan Allen
| ALGONAC, Mich.

ALGONAC, Mich. Back in April, there were already early signs in this quiet Michigan town of the rural American discontent that helped propel Donald Trump to election victory, even if it was underestimated by the Washington establishment, pollsters and Hillary Clinton's campaign.On a return visit after Tuesday's election, Reuters found that many of Algonac's 4,000 residents were jubilant that Trump had captured the White House, although there were also echoes of what some people said seven months ago: that he is an uncertain, high-stakes gamble.But the bare fact of his success drew only shrugs: Who else did city folks really expect would win?Reuters first visited this town on a bend of the St. Clair River in April after results from the Republican and Democratic parties' primary elections suggested it might be a hotbed of the  dissatisfaction with the status quo that would become a dominant force by November. (reut.rs/2fAVJQY)It was a town in a county in a state that all disproportionately turned out in the primaries for the unexpected outsider candidates: the Republican Trump, a rich real-estate developer and television star who had never held political office; and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, a  U.S. senator from Vermont who had emerged as Clinton's closest rival for the Democratic Party nomination.Trump went on to win his party's nomination, while Sanders was beaten by Clinton. Even though they came at the problem from very different perspectives, both men had fired up a town that was in a sour mood, striking a chord with their talk of a rigged economic system and their loud disgust at the decline of American manufacturing.Algonac leans Republican, and, on both visits, it took no time at all to find Trump fans, and only a little longer to find Sanders fans. But it took days of asking around to find someone with a warm word for Clinton. On Tuesday, the vote in Algonac was 68 percent for Trump, 27 percent for Clinton.STRUGGLING REGION
Residents of Algonac can easily list the relatives and neighbors who have struggled with the painful decline of manufacturing or who were forced to move after auto factories with well paid union jobs an hour away in the Detroit area shut down or moved abroad.
Older residents recall decades back when Algonac was still a proud self-sufficient manufacturing hub, employing scores of locals at the Chris-Craft factory, which turned out photogenic wooden boats that remain prized by wealthy collectors. Pete Beauregard has turned the factory into a harbor club where the town's summer visitors stow their boats. ""The rural area is going to want to be heard,"" he said, delighting in Trump's victory.Up the road, Jay DeBoyer was in a dive bar he had worked in as a younger man, drinking an afternoon glass of water and dressed in a suit he had worn to deliver St. Clair County's final elections results to the courthouse in his role as county clerk.""The center of the country is what put Donald Trump in office,"" he said. ""If the economy's okay, they shut their mouths and go to work,"" he said, describing the sort of people who live in places like Algonac, where 97 percent of residents are white. 
""But if you start to smack them, when you start telling the guys working in a coal mine in West Virginia, 'For the good of the country, we're going to put you out of a job, for the good of cleaner air we're going to put you out of a job,' then you start to create a constituency of people that fall into a category of 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend.'""CRUDE TERMS FOR CLINTON
Mentioning Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, tended to draw scorn among Algonac residents in April, even among some Democrats who said they viewed her as untrustworthy.Her election loss and emotional concession speech this week appeared not to soften this, with some expressing their ill-feeling in crude terms.
""Trump That Bitch,"" reads a tall wooden sign alongside the main road into town, evoking a familiar anti-Clinton slogan among Trump fans.Seeing it being photographed, Paul Paulus, 73, wandered out from the building where he was regreasing old tractors to boast he had built it entirely himself. Some of his neighbors, particularly women, had told Reuters on both visits that, even if they disliked Clinton, they despaired at the insults and coarse language that Trump and his fans had reveled in. Paulus described his victory over such qualms.""They had tried to get the township to take it down,"" he said, smiling at the memory of the fight as he looked up at his sign. ""But the township said it's not coming down as 'bitch' is not a bad word. It's a female dog.""Jan Evans, a devout 64-year-old Christian who runs a store making slogan t-shirts for the local schools' sports teams, said she thought there were better ways to talk about people. But she sympathized with the sort of anxiety that moved people to support Trump.She recently learned that her monthly health insurance premiums under Obamacare, a healthcare law that Trump has said he will repeal and replace, would go from $120 to $357. But she worried that Trump's victory would not help, either; she did not know what his healthcare plans were as he has not given details.She said that when she voted, she filled out down-ballot lines for local and state elections and left the presidential vote until the end to give her more time to think. ""Neither one really deserved it,"" she said of Clinton and Trump. Her pen hovered for quite a while, but she declined to say where on the ballot it landed.""Everybody, they're a little bit frightened, they're hopeful, they know we need change,"" she said of Trump's victory. ""But this is the change?"" (Editing by Jason Szep and Frances Kerry)"	['Sanders', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Allen']	['healthcare']
