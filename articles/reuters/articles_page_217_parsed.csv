By Peter Apps

It's the near future, and North Korea's regime is on the brink of collapse. As rumors swirl of palace coups, forces on both sides of the world's most militarized border are on heightened alert. The U.S. military faces a much bigger problem. Somewhere in the Pacific, a North Korean submarine is believed to be carrying nuclear warheads and the missiles to deliver them. And nobody knows where it is.It sounds like the plot of a ""Hunt for Red October""-style technothriller. But if Pyongyang's technicians continue at their current pace, experts say it is becoming ever more likely.One thing is certain: North Korea is plowing considerable resources into building its nuclear capability. And it is clearly making progress - even if Tuesday's failed missile test shows it still has a long way to go.Japanese officials said what appeared to be a conventional Musudan rocket, which theoretically has the ability to reach Japan and the U.S. territory and military base of Guam, exploded either as or shortly after it left its launcher. North Korea is estimated to have some 20 to 30 of the missiles - first deployed in 2007, but yet to be launched successfully.What North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wants, most analysts believe, is simple - a rocket that can fire a nuclear warhead at least to regional targets. His ultimate ambition, however, is to be able to hit U.S. cities on the West Coast, most likely from a submarine that could hide itself at sea.North Korea has been steadily improving its rockets - which can also carry conventional explosives - for decades. It detonated its first nuclear device in 2006 but most experts believe it has yet to build one small enough to be placed on a missile. Having the credible ability to do all of that and get the missiles to sea could take well over a decade, perhaps considerably more.Once it happens, however, it will be a strategic game changer. At worst, U.S. cities on the West Coast would have to deal with the prospect, however remote, that they might be struck by a North Korean atomic weapon. At the very least, a North Korea armed with nuclear submarines would hugely complicate the calculus for any U.S. president handling a crisis on the Korean peninsula itself.That, of course, is exactly the plan.
The fact that Pyongyang has conducted so many tests this year, some experts believe, suggests Kim is pushing his scientists harder than ever to deliver working rockets and warheads. North Korea is believed to have tagged the expertise of Russian Cold War-era scientists, and while its capabilities on both fronts lag well behind established nuclear states such as Russia and China, it is already believed to be well ahead of Iran.In April, South Korean and U.S. officials said a North Korean submarine successfully launched a ballistic missile that traveled some 18 miles -- a major step forward.Technical experts say TV footage appeared to show a solid fuel rocket successfully launching from underwater, essentially the same system used by Western forces to achieve the same goal.When she testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in April, the incoming head of the U.S. Northern Command - responsible for defending the mainland United States - delivered a stark warning.
""The North Korean threat is real,"" U.S. Air Force General Lori Robinson - previously head of U.S. air forces in the Pacific - told lawmakers. ""For now, it's a medium range but they are trying very hard to be able to hit the homeland.""It's impossible to know exactly how much money and expertise the North Koreans are expending. The scale of the effort, however, is seen as large - in many ways, the same level of commitment the United States gave to the Manhattan Project to build the world's first atomic bomb during World War Two. Pyongyang's reason is clear: building that kind of credible ability to strike is seen as central to the long-term survival of the Kim dynasty and its ruling party.Earlier this month, at the first meeting of its ruling party in 36 years, Kim said North Korea was a responsible nuclear weapons state and would never use its weapons - unless it were threatened. That seemed a clear warning to outside powers, particularly Washington, to steer clear of any attempts to destabilize or attack the regime.Getting a submarine-based deterrent would be a very big deal - and not just because it might allow the North Koreans to move the launch point much closer to the target. Submarines are central to what nuclear weapons states call a ""second strike"" capability, the ability to launch missiles even in the aftermath of an overwhelming and perhaps surprise preemptive attack.
The United States, Russia, Britain and France all retain what they call a ""continuous at sea deterrent,"" at least one submarine offshore at all times ready to fight back even if the homeland and all other military forces are completely taken out. Israel is also believed to have the ability to mount nuclear cruise missiles on its Dolphin-class conventional submarines, while China is now moving quickly towards new ballistic missile submarines for its own at sea deterrent.This technology isn't new - the United States and Russia developed it in the late 1950s based in part on plans originally developed to hit Nazi German U-boats in the dying days of World War Two. There is no good reason it should not eventually work for North Korea, too.If and when it does, Pyongyang is likely to try to keep its submarines very close to its coasts--and its home defenses--at first. Still, once the first nuclear-armed submarine exists, Japan and the United States might feel political pressure to destroy it.That would come with considerable risks. The North is known to have huge volumes of conventional artillery based along the South Korean border, much of it in range of Seoul and its 10 million residents. The risk of those weapons inflicting massive casualties is one of the key factors that has deterred multiple U.S. administrations from considering the kind of preemptive strike on Pyongyang's weapons programs that the United States has threatened against Iran.The Korean War - frozen by its 1953 cease-fire but never otherwise resolved - may not be over yet.

By Jack Kim
| SEOUL

SEOUL North Korea has backed presumptive U.S. Republican nominee Donald Trump, with a propaganda website praising him as ""a prescient presidential candidate"" who can liberate Americans living under daily fear of nuclear attack by the North.A column carried on Tuesday by DPRK Today, one of the reclusive and dynastic state's mouthpieces, described Trump as a ""wise politician"" and the right choice for U.S. voters in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.MORE FROM REUTERS:Tesla gets vote of confidence from a top investor at FidelityBreakingviews: Banking ghosts haunt Clinton in PhiladelphiaHow oil traders fell for Yahoo
It described his most likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, as ""thick-headed Hillary"" over her proposal to apply the Iran model of wide sanctions to resolve the nuclear weapons issue on the Korean peninsula.Trump instead has told Reuters he was prepared to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program, and that China should also help solve the problem.North Korea, known officially as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is under U.N. sanctions over its past nuclear tests. South Korea and the United States say its calls for dialogue are meaningless until it takes steps to end its nuclear ambitions.
DPRK Today also said Trump's suggestion that the United States should pull its troops from South Korea until Seoul pays more was the way to achieve Korean unification.""It turns out that Trump is not the rough-talking, screwy, ignorant candidate they say he is, but is actually a wise politician and a prescient presidential candidate,"" said the column, written by a China-based Korean scholar identified as Han Yong Muk.DPRK Today is among a handful of news sites run by the isolated North, although its content is not always handled by the main state-run media.
It said promising to resolve issues on the Korean peninsula through ""negotiations and not war"" was the best option for America, which it said is ""living every minute and second on pins and needles in fear of a nuclear strike"" by North Korea.The North has for years called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South as the first step toward peace on the Korean peninsula and demanded Washington sign a peace treaty to replace the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.Its frequently strident rhetoric also often threatens nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States.

By David Brunnstrom
| SINGAPORE

SINGAPORE The United States expects to maintain its strong security relationship with the Philippines, including a recent accord on the rotational stationing of U.S. forces, U.S. officials said on Thursday, despite signals from the incoming Philippine president that he will chart a more independent course.U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, speaking en route to a security conference in Singapore at which a case over disputed South China Sea territory brought by the previous Philippine government against China will be a key talking point, said Washington took its treaty alliance with the Philippines ""very seriously.""""It's long standing, it is, we say, ironclad,"" he told reporters.""They have a new government there and we look forward to working with them, talking with them about our alliance, about security affairs in the region.""Asked about an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) he signed in Manila weeks ago giving the United States rotational access to five bases in the Philippines, Carter replied: ""Our plans for EDCA and implementation are on track; we haven't changed our plans at all.""On Tuesday, Philippines President-elect Rodrigo Duterte, who is due to take over on June 30, signaled greater independence in dealing with China and broader security issues, when he told reporters future policy would ""not be dependent on America.""""We have this pact with the West, but I want everybody to know that we will be charting a course of our own,"" Duterte said, when asked if he would push for bilateral talks with China.
On Wednesday, Duterte's incoming foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay, told Reuters Manila would honor treaties with the United States, including the EDCA, but it ""should not be a lackey of any nation.""COURT RULING
The outgoing Philippines government has been one of Washington's staunchest supporters in its standoff with China over its expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, a vital global trade route.
Washington has been supportive of a case Manila has brought in the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague challenging China's claims.Carter is expected to urge regional nations attending the annual Shangri-la Dialogue to rally around the U.S. position that the court's ruling, which is expected to go in Manila's favor, must be binding.Another U.S. defense official, who did not want to be identified, said Washington expected to continue its strong alliance with the Philippines, but added: ""We certainly understand the Philippine desire to chart their own course and everything we do with respect to our alliance ... is designed to allow the Philippines to chart its own course.""
Asked whether the United States had detected any decrease in desire on the part of the Philippines to take part in joint South China Sea patrols or to commit to more force rotations under the EDCA, the official replied:""It's too early to tell. We'll get together with the government when they come in and I'm sure we will have very thorough discussions about all of this when the time comes.""""The first tranche of forces has rotated out. And we will be discussing with the Philippines possible future (deployments).""Duterte has yet to name a defense minister and Carter said he had no meeting planned with the Philippines delegation at the Singapore meeting. Carter also said he did not plan a separate meeting with the Chinese, but looked forward to seeing members of their delegation over the three-day conference from Friday.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The United States on Wednesday declared North Korea a ""primary money laundering concern"" and moved to further block its ability to use the U.S. and world financial systems to fund its weapons programs.The U.S. Treasury Department called for a prohibition on certain U.S. financial institutions opening or maintaining correspondent accounts, which are established to receive deposits from or make payments on behalf of a foreign institution, with North Korean financial institutions.Crucially, Treasury also prohibited the use of third parties' U.S. correspondent accounts to process transactions for North Korean financial institutions.The announcement came days after the latest failed missile launch by the isolated state. Tensions in the region have been high since January when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test and then followed that with a satellite launch and test launches of various missiles, in defiance of UN resolutions.Those efforts have all fueled calls in Washington, and abroad, for a clampdown on Pyongyang.U.S. law already generally prohibited U.S. financial institutions from engaging in transactions with North Korean institutions, but Treasury's latest actions would impose additional controls, especially the prohibition on the use of third-country banks' U.S. accounts to process transactions for North Korea.
""This is meaningful,"" said Victor Cha, Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""This is designating the entire country, which means essentially that any entity that is interested in interacting with U.S. financial institutions should no longer have any business with North Korea.""""Most, if not all, entities, if faced with the choice of having access to the U.S. financial system or doing business with North Korea, are going to make the obvious choice,"" Cha added.South Korea's foreign ministry on Thursday welcomed the move, which it said in a statement would boost the effectiveness of existing sanctions on the North and have a broader impact than a 2005 U.S. Treasury measure that targeted a bank in the Chinese territory of Macau.But China, North Korea's most important backer despite Beijing's anger at Pyongyang's nuclear program and support for U.N. sanctions, expressed concern.
""We have consistently opposed any county using its domestic law to impose unilateral sanctions on another country,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters.About $24 million of North Korean funds was frozen at Macau's Banco Delta Asia (BDA) after the U.S. Treasury accused it of helping to channel earnings from the North's illicit activities, leading to a frantic attempt by Pyongyang to retrieve the money.The North has since developed tactics to skirt financial restrictions by resorting to informal means to transfer money, including the use of bulk cash hand-carried by officials.     
Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said Washington expected other governments and financial authorities to make similar moves to prevent Pyongyang from ""abusing"" global financial institutions to support its development of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.""The regime is notoriously deceitful in its financial transactions in order to continue its illicit weapons programs and other destabilizing activities,"" Szubin said in a statement.The Treasury was required to assess North Korea's status as a money laundering jurisdiction under the ""North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act,"" passed nearly unanimously by the U.S. Congress in February.A U.N. Security Council resolution in early March also required member states to sever correspondent banking relationships with North Korean financial institutions within 90 days.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a golf resort developer who has railed against Mexico in the 2016 campaign, lost an important golf tournament to that country on Wednesday when the PGA Tour said it would leave his Trump Doral course in Miami.Although the PGA Tour said it was not a political decision, Trump said in a statement the move was akin to decisions by some U.S. companies to move jobs to Mexico, which has been a refrain of his presidential campaign.""The PGA Tour has put profit ahead of thousands of American jobs, millions of dollars in revenue for local communities and charities and the enjoyment of hundreds of thousands of fans who make the tournament an annual tradition,"" he said. ""This decision only further embodies the very reason I am running for president of the United States.""The PGA said the World Golf Championship event would move from Trump National Doral to a site in Mexico City and be sponsored by the Grupo Salinas conglomerate.PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said the move was necessary ""once it became apparent that we would not be able to secure sponsorship at levels that would sustain the event and help it grow at Trump National Doral.""
""From a golf standpoint, we have no issues with Donald Trump. From a political standpoint, we are neutral. The PGA Tour has never been involved or cares to be involved in presidential politics,"" Finchem told a news conference in Dublin, Ohio.Cadillac has been the title sponsor for the event in recent years including this year's tournament in March. Cadillac representatives did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump's son Eric Trump said Cadillac had been willing to continue.""Cadillac is ready, willing and able to continue as title sponsor for the tournament,"" he told Reuters. ""And I also can say that Cadillac is an amazing company and a longtime partner to the Trump Organization and we have an impeccable relationship.""The Doral tournament is one of the biggest pro golf events of the year, drawing top golfers from around the world competing for a $6 million purse. The Doral course has hosted a PGA tournament since 1962.
Trump, whose golf empire includes 18 courses, purchased the golf resort in 2012 and led a $250 million renovation of its Blue Monster course where the PGA tournament has been played.The news about Doral surfaced on the same day that Trump announced he would step away from the campaign trail later this month to travel to Scotland for the reopening of the Turnberry golf resort, which he bought in 2014.

ELKHART, Ind. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday the decision to direct public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice was based on the law and the best interests of the children.Speaking at a town hall event broadcast by the PBS television network, Obama, a Democrat, said the federal government waded into the controversial issue after school districts asked the Education Department for guidance.Republicans have blasted the directive as executive branch overreach, and more than a dozen states have sued the Obama administration to block it.    ""What happened and what continues to happen is you have transgender kids in schools. And they get bullied. And they get ostracized. And it's tough for them,"" Obama said.""My best interpretation of what our laws and our obligations are is that we should try to accommodate these kids so that they are not in a vulnerable situation,"" he said.
On May 13, the federal government told public schools they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity.The non-binding guidance contained the implicit threat of cuts in federal funding if it was not followed. It relied on an interpretation of Title IX, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education initiatives that receive federal financial assistance.
The directive came as the Justice Department and North Carolina battled in federal court over a North Carolina state law approved in March that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to the sex on their birth certificates. Other states are weighing similar measures.""We should deal with this issue the same way we would want it dealt with if it was our child and that is to try to create an environment of some dignity and kindness for these kids,"" Obama said.
Obama said there ""are a lot of things more pressing"" than the transgender bathroom controversy, including Islamic State, the economy and jobs.""Somehow people think I made it an issue. I didn't make it an issue,"" he said. (Reporting by Jeff Mason; Writing by Eric Beech; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Obama']	[]

By Amanda Becker and Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton's campaign on Wednesday signaled plans for a big assault on Republican Donald Trump, even as she battles to hold off rival Bernie Sanders in California.Clinton, a former secretary of state, is to deliver what her campaign described as a major speech on Thursday in San Diego to underscore what she feels would be the threat posed by Trump to U.S. national security if he is elected president on Nov. 8.Her language to describe Trump has grown more aggressive by the day. On Wednesday, she seized on testimony released in a lawsuit against Trump University, in which some former workers said they believed Trump's for-profit school was fraudulent.""Trump and his employees took advantage of vulnerable Americans encouraging them to max out their credit cards, empty their retirement savings, destroy their financial futures, all while making promises they knew were false from the beginning,"" Clinton told a campaign event in Newark, New Jersey.""This is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud.""Lawyers for Trump have said most students were satisfied with Trump University, dismissing the former workers' testimony as discredited.Trump, anticipating Clinton's foreign policy attacks on him, tried to raise doubts about her leadership skills at a rally in Sacramento, Calif.""She is a person with absolutely no natural talent,"" he said. ""All you have to do is watch her speak.""Repeatedly referring to Clinton as ""crooked Hillary,"" Trump sharply criticized her handling of foreign policy, including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamic militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador.
""She went to sleep,"" Trump added.Clinton's effort to define Trump as unfit to be commander in chief comes as she faces fierce opposition from Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who has insisted on staying in the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination despite Clinton's nearly insurmountable lead.California's primary next Tuesday is shaping up to be pivotal in the Democratic contest, with Clinton holding a 13-point advantage over Sanders, 51 percent to 38 percent, according to the Hoover Institution's Golden State Poll in the state. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll gave Clinton a much narrower lead of 49 percent, to 47 percent for Sanders.Clinton, with 2,312 delegates, needs 71 more delegates to reach the required 2,383 for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has 1,545. At stake in the California primary are 548 delegates who are awarded proportional to the vote. Five other states also vote next Tuesday, including New Jersey, which could also turn the tide for Clinton.
Despite Clinton's perceived advantage, there are lingering concerns among some Democrats about possible weakness, given the protracted battle with Sanders, a democratic socialist whose calls for free college tuition have energized young voters.Doug Schoen, a Democratic pollster, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that California voters appeared to be leaning toward Sanders in recent days.Sanders has been holding events every day this week in the state. Clinton canceled a New Jersey event planned for Thursday to go to California a day earlier than anticipated and is to stay there until Monday.""The inevitability behind Mrs. Clinton's nomination will be in large measure eviscerated if she loses the June 7 California primary to Bernie Sanders,"" Schoen wrote. ""That could well happen.""
'CAN'T IGNORE TRUMP'
Other Democrats expressed confidence in Clinton's position and her move to assail Trump on foreign policy.""I think she has to,"" said Democratic strategist Jim Manley. ""Leaving aside California, I think they can't just ignore Donald Trump in that they should be spending a majority of time focusing on him instead of Sanders at this point, because based on the math Sanders can't win.""Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has faced criticism for a variety of positions on foreign policy, such as his willingness to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his idea that Japan and South Korea might need to develop nuclear arsenals.On the other hand, past Republican presidents and current Democratic President Barack Obama have, like Trump, said NATO nations should pay more for their defense to ease the U.S. burden. Trump, however, has declared NATO obsolete and in need of reconfiguring.A Clinton aide said Clinton, the wife of former President Bill Clinton, would say Trump had not outlined a coherent foreign policy doctrine and had proven himself to be temperamentally unfit to serve as president.

By Sharon Bernstein
| SACRAMENTO, Calif.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. The California Assembly on Wednesday passed a package of gun control bills, including a measure to ban so-called bullet buttons which allow quick changes in the magazine of a military-style weapon.The bills, which lawmakers are pushing the Senate to consider this month, are among several gun control measures that leaders of both houses want to pass in advance of a gun control referendum headed for the November ballot. The measures include a ban on so-called bullet buttons which supporters say allow gun manufacturers to bypass the state's prohibition on removable ammunition magazines. Weapons owned by the shooters in December's San Bernardino massacre were equipped with bullet buttons.The bill passed on the same day that the University of California, Los Angeles campus was shut down in the wake of a murder-suicide shooting. 
Also passed was a bill to allow employers, co-workers, mental health workers and school employees to ask a judge to ban someone from possessing a gun for up to a year. The state already allows family members to seek such a ban, known as a gun violence restraining order, against relatives whom a judge rules are at high risk of committing violence against themselves or others with a firearm.A spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition was not immediately available for comment.     Last month, the California State Senate passed its own package of bills, which would prohibit possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require greater scrutiny of ammunition purchasers and seek to better keep guns out of the hands of violent felons.
Led by Senate Democratic leader Kevin de Leon, California senators are rushing to pass the gun control bills in part to defuse a ballot initiative on the same subject backed by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.Democrats in the Legislature fear that Newsom's measure, a centerpiece of his campaign so far, along with an initiative to legalize marijuana, will draw Republicans who oppose gun control to the polls, potentially influencing other races.
De Leon, who has not endorsed Newsom or announced his own plans for 2018, has said he believes that laws passed by the Legislature are more nuanced and easily adjustable than those instead created through a referendum.Second amendment advocates have steadfastly opposed all of the measures.

WASHINGTON Part of a U.S. State Department briefing video about secret U.S.-Iran nuclear talks was deliberately deleted at the request of an unknown official before it was posted to an online archive, the department said on Wednesday.The excised portion of the Dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the United States was holding secret direct nuclear talks with Iran.The State Department initially said it believed a ""glitch"" caused the gap but on Wednesday said an internal inquiry found it was a deliberate omission. However, it said no rules were broken because none existed governing the integrity of the briefing transcript and video. Rules are now being put in place.The inquiry was carried out by the department's Office of the Legal Adviser at the request of State Department spokesman John Kirby, who is also assistant secretary of the department's Bureau of Public Affairs.
""In so doing, they learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,"" Kirby told reporters at his daily briefing.The video editor who received the request by telephone ""does not remember anything other than that the caller was passing on a request from someone else in the (Public Affairs) bureau,"" Kirby added.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. State Department official said the editor discussed the request with her supervisor and concluded that it came from a ""level of credibility and authority"" high enough that they should act on the request.
Kirby said the video had been replaced some time ago with a full version that was archived with the Defense Department. He said the transcript of the briefing had always been available online and had not been modified.
