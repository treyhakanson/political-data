| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO Californians are expected to pass a ballot measure on Election Day legalizing recreational marijuana, and the prospect has cities and counties seeing dollar signs.Proposition 64 would impose state taxes on the cultivation and sale of marijuana. But it also allows local jurisdictions to add taxes of their own, something many cities and counties said they plan to do.Economists warn that burdensome taxes and fees on the nascent industry could backfire, fueling the black market and pushing marijuana businesses to decamp for towns where it's cheaper to operate. For many city and county officials across California, however, the promise of new revenue to fill budget gaps and fund services is too alluring to pass up. More than 60 local marijuana measures will appear on ballots across California in Tuesday's election. In Monterey, a scenic county along the state's rugged central coast, officials said new local marijuana taxes and fees, if approved, could bring in $30 million, nearly double the county's $16 million budget deficit.In Coalinga, a Fresno County community of about 13,000, officials hope to solve a $3 million budget crisis with marijuana taxes. Central California's King City anticipates new revenues of $1 million to $2 million, or almost 30 percent of the city's general fund.Proposed marijuana taxes in Gonzales, population 8,400, are projected to hit $1.6 million, more than the city collects annually in sales and property taxes combined. ""There is no other business that would generate this type of revenue,"" Gonzales City Manager Rene Mendez said. ""It's easy to see why this is something that communities want to pursue.""Some California communities have gone further, announcing plans to reinvent themselves as hubs for the industry.Desert Hot Springs in Southern California, a town that narrowly skirted bankruptcy after the financial crash, was one of a few cities to pass a marijuana tax in 2014. It is eager for marijuana revenue. The city passed an ordinance to allow for growing and processing businesses to legally operate.
Mayor Scott Matas said it's already having an effect - real estate prices on vacant and dilapidated industrial parcels have skyrocketed as investors stand poised to build manufacturing sites and open nurseries.Forecasts for local marijuana taxes - which will be collected in addition to state taxes - are staggering. Desert Hot Springs' current general fund is about $15 million. But city leaders project marijuana tax collections could reach $1 million next year and, eventually, climb to $50 million if all the available land gets fully built out.""If the industry takes off, the revenue could be life-changing for this community,"" Matas said.For more on U.S. states and marijuana, see this graphic:  tmsnrt.rs/2fBzYmV 
OUTSIDE ADVICE
Many of the California communities hoping to cash in on recreational marijuana formed their plans after meeting with David McPherson of HdL Companies, a Southern California consulting firm specializing in revenue strategies for local governments. The former Oakland tax administrator said he believes marijuana provides a rare opportunity for new job growth and tax revenue that could help struggling communities keep pace with rising pension costs and infrastructure and school funding needs.""It's almost like the next dot com,"" he said.McPherson is working with 40 communities on marijuana issues and has helped draft a dozen local tax measures for Tuesday's ballots. ""Cities have really struggled to balance their budgets,"" he said. ""This is a new industry that's going to increase significantly and create jobs and more employment in their communities."" 
Not all municipalities have embraced high marijuana taxes. Some said they hope to squash the black market by keeping taxes low, so legal businesses can better compete with the illicit supply.In Mendocino, a longtime marijuana-growing region in Northern California, county officials scoffed at initial projections by McPherson of up to $110 million in annual local taxes - a potential cash infusion equivalent to 60 percent of the county's general fund. Instead, the county proposed a measure with a much lower tax rate.""These numbers are designed to make government drool and say,'How much can we get out of our cultivators and farmers?'"" said Jude Thilman, a Fort Bragg resident and member of the Mendocino Cannabis Policy Council at a May meeting of the Mendocino County Supervisors. ""The farmers are not doing that well. People are barely getting by.""Nate Bradley, head of the California Cannabis Industry Association, worries that high taxes would encourage farmers to continue growing marijuana illegally. ""We want to pull these guys out of the hills. But if you're looking at them like they're ATM machines, they are not going to come out of the hills.""Some cities want to avoid the whole issue by banning all marijuana farming and sales within their jurisdictions, something allowed by the ballot measure. In Orange County south of Los Angeles, Placentia Mayor Pro Tem Craig Green said the city has no plans to allow marijuana sales or cultivation.""There are problems with the cannabis business,"" such as the increased costs to law enforcement, he said. ""It ends up costing more in the end."" (Reporting by Robin Respaut; Editing by Sue Horton and Lisa Girion)"

| FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.,/HERSHEY, Pa.

FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.,/HERSHEY, Pa. President Barack Obama chastised supporters at a rally for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in North Carolina on Friday, as tensions spiked when a supporter of Republican opponent Donald Trump began protesting.But that didn't stop Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, campaigning a few states away at the time, from telling a completely opposite version of what happened, condemning Obama for screaming at the protester.The incident happened in clear view of reporters covering the rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where a predominantly African American crowd was jammed into a gym at a state university to hear Obama stump for Clinton.Obama had just said Trump was unfit to lead the country when he was interrupted by a white-haired white man in a beret and suit jacket with what appeared to be military patches, who stood up in the stairwell of the bleachers, waving a Trump campaign sign.
The crowd turned its attention to the protester, screaming and booing at the man. Obama repeatedly told the irate crowd to ""focus"" and to ""settle down.""""Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second!"" Obama said. ""You've got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate,"" he said as the protester was led away.
""We live in a country that respects free speech,"" he said. ""It looks like he might have served in our military - we've got to respect that.""In Trump's version, Obama scolded the protester, not the crowd.
""He was talking to the protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him,"" Trump said.""By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester they would say, 'He became unhinged,'"" Trump said. (Writing by Roberta Rampton Ayesha Rascoe; Editing by Leslie Adler and Jacqueline Wong)"

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND As a perennial swing state and one that yields 18 electoral college votes, Ohio has long been coveted territory for U.S. presidential candidates who pour piles of cash every election cycle into wooing its voters.Since the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln just three presidents, and no Republican contender, have gone to the White House without winning the ""Buckeye State.""During this year's Republican party primaries, Donald Trump's pro-coal mining, anti-free trade message resonated with many of the state's 7 million voters, especially in southeast Ohio communities facing high unemployment.East Liverpool, known in the 1800s as the ""The Crockery City"" where more than half the country's ceramics were made, has fallen on hard times since the 1970s as the population dwindled and the local steel mill shut down.The town of 11,000, where almost a third of the population lives below the poverty line, has also become a center for the state's problem of opiate addiction.In 2014, Ohio reported more drug overdose deaths than any state except California. This September, a photograph of two adults passed out in a car from an apparent heroin overdose, with a 4 year-old boy in the back seat, went viral on social media after it was published by police.""It's the drugs,"" said one East Liverpool resident, Jeff Fischer, 23, standing outside a shop selling vape products. He bemoaned the lack of other activities for young people. 
""There is nothing to do,"" he said. ""There are drugs. That is pretty much it. It's a shame, it really is.""After reports that voters in Ohio's large urban areas, including the state capital Columbus, waited up to seven hours in line to vote during the 2004 presidential contest, Ohio passed a law making early in-person and absentee voting available weeks before Election Day.About one-third of eligible Ohioans, including many of the state's minority groups, voted early in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, securing wins for Democrat Barack Obama both times. This time around, more than 288,000 of the state's voters had cast early ballots in person for the 2016 race as of Oct. 31, according to Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted's office.Those numbers demonstrate a dip for Democrats of about 25 percent compared with the 2012 numbers, while registered Republican early voting has increased by more than 10 percent. 
Opinion polls ahead of next Tuesday's election show Ohio is a close race between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Democrats, however, believe higher early voting turnout by Republican voters does not automatically mean a Trump windfall, saying the increase in early voting is in urban areas dominated by moderate Republicans who may not support Trump or vote for him.The numbers overall may also be boosted by a ""Souls to the Polls"" drive that is being organized by churches, synagogues and mosques to encourage their parishioners to participate.The other big contest occupying many voters' minds in recent days has been the Baseball World Series, which pitted the Chicago Cubs against Ohio's Cleveland Indians. Chicago triumphed after a nail-biting game seven on Wednesday night.For some locals, it was still a welcome distraction from the responsibility of choosing the next U.S. president. According to an old Election Day saying, ""As Ohio goes, so does the nation.""
Some, of course, take that duty more seriously than others. ""I'm not leaning either way because I think it is a joke, to be honest with you,"" Fischer said.Click on reut.rs/2fn7k6m to see a related photo essay (Reporting by Kim Palmer; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Frances Kerry)"

The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego denounced one of its parishes on Friday after its worshippers were told that voting for Democrats is a ""mortal sin"" that could lead to an eternity in hell.The Diocese said the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the neighborhood of Old Town made the statement in an insert to a weekly leaflet given to churchgoers on Oct. 16, calling abortion, same-sex marriage, euthanasia and other political issues ""non-negotiables.""""It is a mortal sin to vote Democrat,"" the insert read, with the words underlined and bolded. ""If your bishop, priest, deacon or other parishioners tell you to do so, you must walk away from them. Your immortal soul and your salvation are at stake.""On Tuesday, voters will pick the next president after an often bitter contest that polls suggest has tightened considerably in the last week. While several states are too close to call, polls have shown Democrat Hillary Clinton leading over Republican Donald Trump for some time in California where the parish is located.Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy said in a statement that the parish, which will also serve as a polling place, violated its religious duties with the political comments. ""It is contrary to Catholic teaching to state that voting for a Democrat or Republican automatically condemns the voter to hell,"" the statement said. ""The Catholic Church does not endorse specific candidates, use parish media or bulletins to favor candidates or parties or engage in partisan political activity of any kind.""
The parish's pastor, Richard Perozich, did not respond to calls and an email on Friday.The Diocese also took issue with a column in the parish's Oct. 30 bulletin that railed against abortion and constraints on tax-exempt organizations from certain political activity, and blames elected officials for allowing U.S. society to be ""enslaved"" to sin.""Satan has deceived many Christians to convert to worldly values from Christian ones,"" the bulletin reads. ""The devil does this through the tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton has stated, 'And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,' to draw us away from God's teachings.""
Alinsky was a pioneer in community organizing in Chicago known for confrontational, though nonviolent, tactics to achieve social change.Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending first as child with her parents and later attending a Methodist church as first lady. Trump on the other hand has been backed by religious conservatives and evangelicals.Richard Schmalbeck, a professor at Duke University School of Law with expertise in non-profits, said the statements appear to violate requirements for tax-exempt organizations around political activity.
""Anything that clearly disparages a candidate is intervention in opposition to a candidate, and I think saying the devil operates through a person would count as disparagement,"" he said. Schmalbeck said it seems unlikely, however, that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service would aggressively pursue revoking the church's tax-exempt status given its recent history of not going after churches that have made similar comments.

By Keith Coffman
| DENVER

DENVER A federal judge in Colorado blocked enforcement of a 19th-century state law that bans voters from showing a completed ballot to others, the latest in a flurry of mixed legal rulings on whether to restrict election ""selfies"" on social media.U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello in Denver issued a preliminary injunction against an 1891 Colorado statute that makes it a misdemeanor offense to reveal the contents of one's ballot.The ruling came in response to two separate lawsuits by voters challenging enforcement of the law on grounds that it violates their free-speech rights.""By issuing an injunction in this case, Coloradans get what they are entitled to - clarity on an issue that implicates fundamental constitutional rights,"" Arguella wrote in her 26-page ruling.The controversy erupted last week after Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey reminded voters of the law, which he said would ""include posting your completed ballot to social media.""
However, prosecutors from several jurisdictions, including Denver, filed declaration with the court this week saying they would not enforce the misdemeanor law unless evidence showed that voter intimidation or coercion was involved.""Based on our review of applicable law and societal changes, including the ubiquity of social media ... the District Attorney's Office would not charge anyone with an offense ... for taking a photograph or video of a completed Colorado mail-in ballot,"" Denver prosecutor Joseph Morales wrote.
Colorado is among 18 states that have laws restricting the taking of photographs in voting booths or of completed ballots. Courts in other states and federal jurisdictions have issued mixed rulings against enforcing such bans.Federal judges in New York and California refused this week to block enforcement of state laws barring voters from taking photographs of marked ballots, saying it was too close to next Tuesday's presidential election to issue such injunctions.Colorado's attorney general cited the California and New York decisions in defending Colorado's law.
Lawyers for the Colorado voters said the state's mail-in voting system, which allows ballots to be filled out anywhere and then either mailed or dropped off, sets Colorado apart from California and New York, where voters must cast ballots at a polling place.Last month, a federal court sided with a voter who challenged a Michigan anti-selfie statute as a free-speech violation.

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The Clinton Foundation has confirmed it accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar while Hillary Clinton was U.S. secretary of state without informing the State Department, even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments.Qatari officials pledged the money in 2011 to mark the 65th birthday of Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton's husband, and sought to meet the former U.S. president in person the following year to present him the check, according to an email from a foundation official to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email, among thousands hacked from Podesta's account, was published last month by WikiLeaks.Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family's globe-straddling foundation in order to become secretary of state in 2009. The agreement was designed to increase transparency to avoid appearances that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by wealthy donors.If a new foreign government wished to donate or if an existing foreign-government donor, such as Qatar, wanted to ""increase materially"" its support of ongoing programs, Clinton promised that the State Department's ethics official would be notified and given a chance to raise any concerns.Clinton Foundation officials last month declined to confirm the Qatar donation. In response to additional questions, a foundation spokesman, Brian Cookstra, this week said that it accepted the $1 million gift from Qatar, but this did not amount to a ""material increase"" in the Gulf country's support for the charity. Cookstra declined to say whether Qatari officials received their requested meeting with Bill Clinton. Officials at Qatar's embassy in Washington and in its Council of Ministers in the capital, Doha, declined to discuss the donation.The State Department has said it has no record of the foundation submitting the Qatar gift for review, and that it was incumbent on the foundation to notify the department about donations that needed attention. A department spokeswoman did not respond to additional questions about the donation.According to the foundation's website, which lists donors in broad categories by cumulative amounts donated, Qatar's government has directly given a total of between $1 million and $5 million over the years. 
The Clinton Foundation has said it would no longer accept money from foreign governments if Clinton is elected president and would spin off those programs that are dependent on foreign governments.   ""MATERIAL"" INCREASE    
Foundation officials told Reuters last year that they did not always comply with central provisions of the agreement with President Barack Obama's administration, blaming oversights in some cases.(reut.rs/2fkHPCh)
At least eight other countries besides Qatar gave new or increased funding to the foundation, in most cases to fund its health project, without the State Department being informed, according to foundation and agency records. They include Algeria, which gave for the first time in 2010, and the United Kingdom, which nearly tripled its support for the foundation's health project to $11.2 million between 2009 and 2012.Foundation officials have said some of those donations, including Algeria, were oversights and should have been flagged, while others, such as the UK increase, did not qualify as material increases.The foundation has declined to describe what sort of increase in funding by a foreign government would have triggered notification of the State Department for review. Cookstra said the agreement was designed to ""allow foreign funding for critical Clinton Foundation programs"" to continue without disruption. The State Department said it has no record of being asked by the foundation to review any increases in support by a foreign government.
Asked whether Qatar was funding a specific program at the foundation, Cookstra said the country supported the organization's ""overall humanitarian work."" ""Qatar continued supporting Clinton Foundation at equal or lower levels"" compared with the country's pre-2009 support, he said. He declined to say if Qatar gave any money during the first three years of Clinton's four-year term at the State Department, or what its support before 2009 amounted to.  In another email released by WikiLeaks, a former Clinton Foundation fundraiser said he raised more than $21 million in connection with Bill Clinton's 65th birthday in 2011. Spokesmen for Hillary Clinton's campaign and Bill Clinton did not respond to emailed questions about the donation.     Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said that major donors to the Clinton Foundation may have obtained favored access to Clinton's State Department, but has provided little evidence to that effect. Clinton and her staff have dismissed this accusation as a political smear.Last month, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the Donald J. Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in the state, saying it had not registered to solicit donations.

By Dan Levine

A U.S. appeals court on Friday put a restrictive Republican-backed Arizona ballot-collection law on hold until after Tuesday's election, handing Democrats a victory in an intensifying state-by-state legal battle over access to the polls. Arizona's legislature earlier this year passed the law  prohibiting advocacy groups from collecting completed early ballots from voters and delivering them to election offices as part of get-out-the-vote efforts. Plaintiffs in the case, including the Democratic National Committee, argued the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly impacted the ability of minorities to vote.Polls have shown Republican Donald Trump with a small lead in Arizona over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race.The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this week agreed to revisit a ruling that had refused to block the law and hear the case before an 11-judge panel. That panel voted 6-5 on Friday to prohibit Arizona from enforcing the law now, court records showed.Arizona filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court later on Friday, asking it to reverse the 9th Circuit's order.
Democrats have accused Republicans of enacting state laws intended to make it harder for minorities and others who tend to back Democratic candidates to cast ballots. Republicans have called these laws necessary to guard against voting fraud.Judge Sidney Thomas, the 9th Circuit's chief judge, wrote that the court's action would not disrupt Arizona's ability to conduct the U.S. presidential election. ""It simply would enjoin enforcement of a legislative act that would criminalize the collection, by persons other than the voter, of legitimately cast ballots,"" Thomas wrote.
He was joined by five other judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Five dissenting 9th Circuit judges, all Republican appointees, argued that the court should not have interfered with Arizona law so close to Election Day, while early voting is already underway.The 9th Circuit covers nine Western states, including Arizona.""We are disappointed in this decision as it will confuse voters and depress turnout,"" Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan said in a statement.
A representative for the Democratic National Committee could not immediately be reached for comment.Acting in another voting case on Friday, a U.S. judge in Ohio ordered Trump's campaign not to verbally harass voters near polling places or take pictures of them in the key battleground state.

By Andy Sullivan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. judge in Ohio ordered Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign on Friday not to intimidate voters as voting-rights advocates scored a string of last-minute victories in several politically competitive states.The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge James Gwin creates the possibility of fines or jail time for Trump allies who harass voters, a significant victory for Democrats who had worried the real-estate mogul was encouraging supporters to cause mayhem at the polls on Nov. 8.The ruling also deals a blow to a Trump-aligned ""exit poll"" that seeks to mobilize thousands of supporters.The Trump campaign appealed the decision.On the campaign trail, Trump has warned that the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities. Democrats have launched a legal blitz in Ohio and five other battleground states to prevent that from happening. They are also trying to stop a paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, from conducting its own monitoring operation. Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare.Voting-rights advocates also won legal victories in three other states on Friday, building on a string of decisions that have rolled back election restrictions across the country.
In Arizona, a federal judge suspended a state law that prohibits advocates' ability to collect absentee ballots.""Having more options to turn in your ballot ensures that more people take part in the democratic process,"" said Spencer Scharff, voter protection director of the Arizona Democratic Party.In North Carolina, a judge ordered election officials to restore the voting rights of thousands who had been removed from registration lists in recent weeks.And in Kansas, a state court blocked a dual-registration system that would have prevented 20,000 registered voters from casting ballots for local offices because they were unable to prove U.S. citizenship.
The Ohio ruling does not prevent the state Republican Party from sending trained volunteers into polling places to make sure election laws are being followed. However, it does impose restrictions on Trump supporters who take it on themselves to monitor voting activity, saying they may not interrogate voters within 100 feet of a polling place, block them from entering, or photograph them as they come and go. Many of those activities are already illegal, but the judge's order means that anybody who engages in them could be held in contempt of court, exposing them to additional civil or criminal penalties.""It backs the law with the power of contempt,"" said Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California at Irvine.
The order also deals a blow to a Trump-allied ""exit poll"" that aims to mobilize supporters to canvass voters in an effort to sniff out instances of voter manipulation.The organizer of that effort, Republican operative Roger Stone, told Reuters he would fight the ruling regardless of the outcome of the election.""The Democrats' lawyers have perjured themselves and perpetrated a fraud before the court,"" he wrote in a text message.The order also applies to Democrats, who have focused their efforts on making sure their supporters can vote.""With this decision, Ohioans can feel confident that they will be able to make their voices heard in this election,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a prepared statement.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
