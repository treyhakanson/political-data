At least 12 women have accused U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of sexual advances and groping. Among his accusers are a Miss Utah beauty pageant winner, a businesswoman, a reporter and a receptionist. He has denied the accusations.In a 2005 video that emerged on Oct. 7, Trump boasted about grabbing women by the genitals and kissing them without their consent. In a U.S. presidential debate on Oct. 9, he said he was embarrassed by what he called ""locker-room talk"" but had not engaged in the conduct he described in the video. Trump has called ""absolutely false"" the allegations by several women of groping and other misconduct, reported by The New York Times and other news media. At a rally this month, after two more women made accusations of groping, he denounced all the recent allegations by a series of women, calling them fabrications and calling the women ""sick."" Following are some of the allegations against Trump: Jessica Leeds, 74, recounted in a video interview posted on The New York Times website on Oct. 12 that Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight to New York in or around 1980 when she was a 38-year-old traveling businesswoman. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication.Kristin Anderson, in a video posted on the website of The Washington Post on Oct. 14, said Trump put his hand up her skirt in a crowded New York nightclub in the early 1990s in an unwanted advance, when she had never even met him. ""He did touch my vagina through my underwear, absolutely,"" Anderson said in the video interview.Jill Harth, a former Trump beauty pageant business associate, filed a $125 million lawsuit in 1997 against Trump alleging that on Jan. 24, 1993, at Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump ""forcibly removed plaintiff to a bedroom, whereupon defendant subjected plaintiff to defendant's unwanted sexual advances."" A Trump spokesperson was quoted on Oct. 7 in The New York Times as saying, ""Mr. Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth."" The lawsuit was dropped in May 1997.
Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, said that Trump twice kissed her on the lips in greeting while she was a contestant for the Miss USA pageant in 1997, when she was 21 years old. ""What he did made me feel so uncomfortable that I ended up cutting my trip short, bought my own plane ticket, flew home and never spoke to him again,"" Taggart said at an Oct. 28 press conference in Salt Lake City with her attorney, Gloria Allred.Cathy Heller said that Trump in 1997 tried to kiss her during a Mother's Day brunch at Mar-A-Lago. Heller, her husband, her three children and her in-laws attended the event. When she was introduced to Trump, ""He took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,"" she told The Guardian newspaper. She said she leaned backward to avoid him and almost lost her balance. ""And he said, 'Oh, come on.' He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips."" She said she turned her head and Trump kissed her on the side of the mouth.
Yoga instructor Karena Virginia, at a news conference in New York City in October, said Trump approached her outside the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1998. They had never met, and she was 27 years old, she said. She alleged that Trump commented on her legs and then touched her breast before she was able to get into a car and be driven away. Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said the accusation was a publicity-seeking attack coordinated with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, and added: ""Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories.""Mindy McGillivray was cited in an article published in The Palm Beach Post on Oct. 12 that while she was a 23-year-old   photographer's assistant at a Jan. 24, 2003, event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump had grabbed her buttocks. The Palm Beach Post cited a Trump spokesperson as saying, ""This allegation lacks any merit or veracity.""Rachel Crooks, formerly a receptionist at a real estate firm, told The New York Times in a report published on Oct. 12   that Trump ""kissed me directly on the mouth"" in 2005 at Trump Tower in Manhattan when she was 22. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication.
Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter, wrote a first-person account that described Trump kissing her without her consent in December 2005 at Mar-a-Lago while she was working on an article about him and his third wife, Melania, for People magazine. In the account published by People on Oct. 12, Stoynoff said ""he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat."" In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump said the episode described did not happen.Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on Trump's reality show ""The Apprentice"" in 2006, said at a news conference on Oct. 14 in Las Vegas that Trump tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him when she met him in 2007 to discuss a possible job. Zervos said she complied with a request to sit next to Trump, and, ""He then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast."" Trump at a rally in North Carolina denounced the allegations made by a series of women in recent days, calling them fabrications.Ninni Laaksonen, a former Miss Finland, accused Trump of groping her in 2006 when she was representing her country in the Miss Universe beauty contest. Laaksonen told the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper that he had grabbed her behind before she appeared on a television show in New York with other contestants. ""He really grabbed my butt. I don't think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: 'What is happening?',"" she was quoted as saying in the newspaper. Jessica Drake, an adult film actor, accused Trump of pressuring her to have sex with him 10 years ago when they met at a golf tournament. After, she said, a man, possibly Trump, called to offer her $10,000 if she would have sex with him, which she declined. Trump's campaign said the accusations were false.

By Mark Hosenball and Jonathan Allen
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The FBI is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email system, it said on Friday, in a new twist that could damage the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential race.Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said in a letter to senior lawmakers that the agency would determine whether the additional emails contained classified information, adding that he did not know ""how long it will take us to complete this additional work.""The announcement came as Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump enter the final stretch of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 8 election. In a news conference late on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton urged Comey to release more details about what the FBI was looking for in the newly discovered emails.She leads Trump in opinion polls after a bruising campaign in which she has struggled to convince voters that she is trustworthy and honest. Fresh revelations about her use of email are unlikely to assuage those concerns, and questions around the FBI investigation will now likely dog her in the coming days as she campaigns across battleground states.U.S. stocks immediately fell sharply on the news, but went on to partially recover.The FBI spent about a year investigating Clinton's use of the unauthorized server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, while she was U.S. secretary of state after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails. Comey said in July that while ""there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.""Although Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, Trump has repeatedly said her email practices are criminal and should disqualify her for office. He seized on Friday's development at rallies in Maine and New Hampshire.""This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and I'm sure it will be properly handled from this point forward,"" Trump told a crowd in Lisbon, Maine.""We hope that all, all justice will be fully served,"" he said. Supporters cheered his words and chanted, ""Lock her up.""Clinton said she had learned of the newly discovered emails from news reports. 
""I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,"" she said. ""That's why it's incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what's going on.""WEINER
Two sources close to the investigation said the latest emails were discovered not during an investigation into Clinton, but rather as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.The FBI has been investigating illicit text messages allegedly sent from Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and found the Clinton emails on a device related to that investigation, the sources said.Abedin told federal investigators in April that she used several email accounts for her work, including a Yahoo email, according to a summary of the interview released by the FBI in September. She said it was difficult to print from the State Department's email system so she routinely forwarded documents to her private accounts when she needed to print them out, according to the summary. 
Abedin announced her separation from Weiner in August after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the U.S. Congress.Lawyers representing Abedin did not respond to questions sent by email on Friday. Weiner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and he did not respond to phone calls.Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who had previously advised former President Bill Clinton but has no role with Hillary Clinton's campaign, said the linking of Clinton's email woes with Weiner's sex scandals made it harder for her campaign to distinguish itself from Trump's sex scandals.""The whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption and scandal,"" he said. ""Nobody remembers the beginning of something, they only remember the end. What are they going to remember? They're all the same: sex, scandal, corruption, emails. People are going to have trouble sorting out all this information.""""EXTRAORDINARY""

Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, said it was ""extraordinary"" for the FBI to release the letter so close to the end of a hotly contested election.""The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining,"" Podesta said in a statement. ""We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July."" Clinton has repeatedly apologized for using the private email server in her home instead of a government email account for her work as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information.While the FBI probe of new emails will likely prove a distraction to Clinton in the coming days, it was unclear what impact it would have when Americans go to the polls. Election experts say about 20 percent of ballots have already been cast, as more Americans vote by mail or go to the polls early.""A lot of concern about the emails has already been baked into this electoral cake I think,"" said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. ""They know she did it, they know it was inappropriate and, failing some sensational revelation on Nov. 6, it's hard to see that it's going to make that big a difference.""Still, Republican lawmakers, who are facing a difficult fight to keep their majorities in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, leaped to condemn Clinton.House Speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his call that the Democratic nominee be barred from briefings involving classified information until the investigation is over. Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the FBI's decision to look into the emails shows ""how serious this discovery must be.""   Clinton did not respond to reporters' shouted questions about the news when she left her plane for a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.U.S. stocks declined in a volatile session on Friday but partially recovered from the sharp drop spurred by the FBI announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day down about 9 points, or .05 percent, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged on the day. The dollar also fell against major currencies.

WASHINGTON U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday renewed his call for U.S. intelligence officials to stop giving Hillary Clinton classified briefing typically given to presidential candidates in the wake of FBI Director James Comey's letter citing additional emails now under review.""This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved,"" Ryan said in a statement referring to the former secretary of state.

By Steve Holland
| MANCHESTER, N.H.

MANCHESTER, N.H. A stronger-than-expected U.S. economic report on Friday came at a good time for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, although Republican contender Donald Trump's campaign blasted the numbers as ""dismal.""The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, its fastest pace in two years and higher than the expected 2.6 percent, thanks to a surge in exports and a rebound in investment. With just 11 days to go before the Nov. 8 election, the report bolstered Clinton, who has positioned herself as the best candidate to continue years of economic expansion under President Barack Obama.More Americans say jobs and the economy are their No.1 priority when they decide who to vote for than any other issue.Trump argues that as a successful businessman and political outsider, he is the best person to take a new approach to rebuilding an economy that has sent too many jobs overseas and left many Americans struggling to find decent jobs.His campaign said the figures are still not good enough.""America can do better than the modest growth of 2.9 percent recorded for the 3rd quarter and the dismal growth of 1.5 percent for the past year,"" Dan Kowalski, Trump's deputy policy director, said in a statement.
""Growth hasn't risen above 3 percent for a full year in any year of the Obama presidency,"" he said.While many voters do not follow economic indicators closely, outside experts said the release was still a good one for Clinton. She is seeking to solidify her lead in opinion polls as the Democratic Party works to win as many seats as possible in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, where Republicans now control majorities.""Today's release will likely improve the perception of economic conditions in the U.S. and slightly increase the odds of a Democratic president remaining in the White House,"" said Brian Schaitkin, senior economist at the Conference Board.
Clinton's camp said Friday's report showed ""real progress"" since Obama took office in 2009, when the country was struggling to emerge from economic recession.""With more than 15 million jobs created since early 2010 and real median incomes growing more than 5 percent last year, it's clear we've made real progress coming back from the crisis,"" Clinton senior policy advisor Jacob Leibenluft said in a statement.But he added that there is still more that can be done.Clinton was campaigning on Friday in Iowa, where polls show she and Trump running neck-and-neck, and in Michigan, a traditionally Democratic state hit hard by the movement offshore of many formerly well-paying American manufacturing jobs.
Trump was holding rallies in Iowa as well as in another closely contested swing state, New Hampshire, and in Maine, where his campaign sees a chance to grab one of four electoral votes.In the last weeks of the campaign, Clinton has dramatically widened her advantage over Trump in ad spending, amid questions over the celebrity businessman's pledge to contribute more than $100 million of his own money.He spent $56 million through the end of September, and only $31,000 since, according to filings.  Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News reports that the candidate has stopped putting his own money into his campaign are not true. ""He has said publicly many times he is in for $100 million and he is happy to invest in his campaign,"" she said.

By Joseph Ax
| NEWARK, N.J.

NEWARK, N.J. Two former allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie deliberately closed access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in a ""vicious"" and unlawful political revenge scheme, a federal prosecutor said on Friday at the close of their criminal trial.Bridget Kelly, the governor's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, abused their power to create a massive traffic jam in order to punish a local mayor for failing to back Christie's re-election campaign, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes told jurors in Newark, New Jersey.""As cruel and callous as that scheme was, what makes it unlawful was that they misused government resources to carry it out,"" Cortes said in closing arguments at federal court in Newark, New Jersey.Baroni's lawyer is expected to deliver his closing argument later on Friday.The Port Authority operates the George Washington Bridge, said by the agency to be the world's busiest.
Kelly and Baroni are charged with fraud, conspiracy and depriving residents of Fort Lee, New Jersey, of their civil rights. Former Port Authority executive David Wildstein has pleaded guilty and appeared as the government's star witness.Christie has not been charged and has steadfastly denied any advance knowledge of the plan. But Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly all testified that they told the governor some details about the lane closures either beforehand or while they were occurring. The so-called ""Bridgegate"" scandal tarnished Christie's national reputation, damaging his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The trial has cast an unflattering light on Christie as a temperamental bully whose administration used the Port Authority to hand out favors, and penalties, to local officials.
Kelly and Baroni, both of whom testified in their own defense, said they were duped by Wildstein and his claim that the lane closures were part of a legitimate traffic study.But Cortes warned jurors not to be fooled by that ""preposterous"" assertion, pointing to Kelly's now-infamous email to Wildstein in which she wrote, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" as evidence of her guilt.
During his closing argument, Cortes showed jurors numerous messages sent among Kelly, Wildstein and Baroni suggesting they deliberately ignored Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's desperate pleas for help as the gridlock became untenable, delaying first responders and stranding school buses for hours.At one point, Wildstein told Baroni that his response to Sokolich should be ""radio silence.""

WASHINGTON Vice President Joe Biden tops a short list for secretary of state that is being compiled by the transition team of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, two media outlets reported.Politico on Thursday night cited an unidentified source as saying Clinton and her aides were discussing how to approach Biden about the post, should she win the Nov. 8 presidential election.Most national opinion polls show Clinton, who served as President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, leading Republican Donald Trump in the race for the White House.Biden became a respected voice on foreign policy during his 36 years in the U.S. Senate, where he was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and at one point served alongside Clinton, when she was a senator from New York.""He'd be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,"" the source familiar with Clinton's transition planning told Politico.
NBC News later confirmed that Biden was under consideration for the job of top U.S. diplomat.Biden, of Delaware, had considered running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. He has campaigned vigorously for Clinton in her race against Trump, a New York real estate tycoon and former reality television personality who has never run for office.
The vice president said at a campaign event for Clinton in Pennsylvania this week that he is frequently asked whether he wished he had been debating Trump, who has insulted women, Muslims and immigrants and thumbed his nose at political norms.""No, I wish we were in high school. I could take him behind the gym. That's what I wish,"" Biden said, prompting a similarly pugilistic retort from Trump a couple of days later.
In excepts from an interview released from CBS' Sunday program ""Face the Nation,"" Biden made it clear he wanted to continue his public service.""I'm not going away. I'm, you know, everything from this issue of violence against women, to income inequality, to the cancer moonshot, I'm gonna devote the rest of my life to this.""

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Most Republicans believe Russia is attempting to influence the U.S. presidential election, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, despite comments by the party's nominee, Donald Trump, downplaying the possibility.Some 55 percent of U.S. adults, including 51 percent of Republicans and 65 percent of Democrats, said they thought Russia was trying to tip the scales in the Nov. 8 presidential election, according to the survey. Most American adults - 62 percent of Democrats and 48 percent of Republicans - think Putin is supporting Trump for the White House, the poll found.Some 71 percent of those who suspect Russia of meddling believe Moscow is doing so through the recent hacks of Democratic emails, according to the Oct. 18-24 survey. But 57 percent of those who suspect Russian interference also believe Trump has ""no involvement in Russia's release of unflattering information"" on his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.The U.S. government has accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks targeting the Democratic Party that has led to the release of thousands of illegally obtained emails, revealing the sometimes unflattering inner workings of the party, Clinton's campaign, and her family's charitable foundation. 
Clinton has said she believes the Kremlin is trying to help Trump, calling her rival a ""puppet"" of the Russian leader. Trump has declined to implicate the country in any wrongdoing.""I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the (Democratic National Committee),"" Trump said during the first presidential debate last month. He suggested the culprit could be anyone from Russia, to China or even ""a 400-pound person lying in bed.""Russia has denied it sponsors or encourages hacking activity. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused U.S. politicians on Thursday of whipping up ""hysteria"" about a nonexistent threat in order to distract voters.
Putin, who has described Trump as ""very talented,"" said on Thursday the New York businessman ""behaves extravagantly"" to ""get through to voters' hearts."" Trump has said he is not close with Putin, but has also said he believes the Russian president is a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama.
Already chilly relations between the United States and Russia have deteriorated over disagreements over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. U.S. officials say U.S. agencies have concluded that two Russian intelligence agencies - the military's GRU and the civilian foreign intelligence agency, the FSB - are behind U.S. political hacking, particularly that directed against Democratic Party organizations and individuals.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English, and included 2,008 American adults. It had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. (Additional reporting by Yara Bayoumy; Editing by Peter Cooney)"
