WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders expressed disappointment on Friday after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he would not debate Sanders ahead of California's June 7 primary.""I heard that he was going to debate me, then I heard that he was not going to debate me, then I heard that he was going to debate me. Now you're telling me that he is not going to debate me. Well, you know, I hope that he changes his mind again,"" Sanders said in a video clip posted on an ABC News Twitter account.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. senators called on President Barack Obama's administration on Friday to impose targeted sanctions on officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo responsible for violence and rights violations amid rising political tensions.Hoping to increase pressure on the government of President Joseph Kabila, three of Obama's fellow Democrats, senators Richard Durbin, Edward Markey and Christopher Murphy, said on Friday they had introduced a Senate resolution this week calling on Kabila's government to fulfill its constitutional mandate for a democratic transition of power late this year.They called for targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, until Kabila publicly commits to a peaceful transition of power.Their action reflected growing international worry over the situation in the African nation. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday voiced concern about reports of rising political tension due to uncertainty about the presidential election. Dozens of Kabila critics have been arrested since last year as part of what the United Nations and rights groups say is an escalating crackdown on political dissent ahead of a presidential election scheduled for November.
Kabila is ineligible to stand for re-election after serving two elected terms, but opponents accuse him of trying to delay the poll to hold onto power. Congo's highest court ruled last week that the president could stay in power if elections did not occur by the end of his mandate.On Thursday, a protester and a police officer were killed in Goma, in the eastern part of the country, during protests against a possible elections delay. The United Nations said dozens of people were arrested.
Opposition leaders accuse Kabila of stalling the vote in order to extend his 15-year rule, which the president denies.Democratic congressional aides said they expected to add more co-sponsors for the resolution after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess on June 6.There is bipartisan support for U.S. action to address the situation. 
Republican Senator Jeff Flake, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's Africa subcommittee, told Reuters in a brief interview this week that he felt sanctions would be appropriate and had discussed them with U.S. State Department officials.""Hopefully we're together on this,"" Flake said. ""I think we will be. We just want to make sure that whatever we do, pushes in the right direction."" (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"	['Markey', 'Flake']	[]

By Hilary Russ

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday signed into law a package of legislation that provides distressed gambling hub Atlantic City with immediate cash help but also a potential state takeover if the city cannot fix its finances.The bills will help reform the city's ""overblown municipal government"" while protecting state and local taxpayers, Christie said in a statement while continuing to take shots at local officials.""We all agree that Atlantic City's government has not demonstrated the competence to properly manage the people's money without state guidance and oversight,"" he said. The legislation ""embraces my demand that Atlantic City immediately account for every dollar it receives and spends, and triggers a series of strict conditions and rigorous requirements the city must meet immediately,"" Christie said.
Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Friday, Guardian marked the opening of summer beach season for the seaside resort city.The bills provide a $60 million, six-month bridge loan from the state to the city and establish $120 million of payments annually from casinos in lieu of property taxes, a move aimed at stabilizing the city's volatile, eroded tax base.
In return, the city must prepare a balanced budget for fiscal 2017, which begins Jan. 1, and a five-year recovery plan. If it falls short, the state can move to take over operations and throw out collective bargaining agreements, among other powers.The package could prove positive for the city's credit rating, which is deep in junk territory at Caa3, because it provides much-needed financial relief and removes the immediate threat of default or bankruptcy, Moody's Investors Service said after the governor announced his signature.
But a bond restructuring, which Guardian has said the city will likely pursue, would be considered a default if it includes bondholder impairment, Moody's said.The city has about $240 million of bond debt outstanding.

By Ethan Lou
| TORONTO

TORONTO Toronto's Trump tower is close to being sold, a lawyer for its owner said on Friday, adding that the buyer could choose to drop the name, which has become more controversial since billionaire Donald Trump became the presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee.The Trump organization disagreed, saying the building must continue to carry the name.Symon Zucker, who represents Talon International Development Inc, said the 65-story hotel and condominium tower in the city's financial district has found a potential buyer and the sale will conclude ""hopefully shortly.""The building is operated for Talon by the Trump Hotel Collection, presided over by Trump and his children. Zucker said the current contract with Trump Hotel is ""exclusive with Talon"" and that ""the new owner can if he wishes retain a different manager and change the name of the hotel.""
Zucker declined to comment on the potential new owner's intentions or the specifics of the deal.Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten disagreed, saying the agreement is valid for ""another 16 years"" and calling Zucker's view ""100 percent false.""""The management's agreement between Trump and the condos would remain in full force and effect,"" he said in an email. ""We are not going anywhere."" 
Garten said if the new owner wants to change the name of the tower, the Trump Organization would take ""swift and appropriate action to prevent it and hold them liable for damages.""Talon Chairman Alex Shnaider has been trying to change the building's name through arbitration, though the sale is unrelated to that effort, said Zucker, who called the sale a routine business decision.""Alex is moving on to other deals,"" he said. ""This is just one more thing he's bought that he's going to sell.""
Zucker said the deal was done through the real estate firm CBRE, which declined to comment. The luxury building has had problems, and the intersection around it has been closed several times due to falling or unstable glass. The tower is also the subject of a Canadian lawsuit against Trump and associates by disgruntled investors who say they were misled in their deals. A judge ruled against the investors, and a Toronto court is scheduled to hear their appeal in June. Zucker called their case ""frivolous.""

By Dave McKinney
| SPRINGFIELD, Ill.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. Bipartisan talks to reach a fiscal 2017 budget for Illinois ahead of a Tuesday deadline have derailed as the state's Republican governor and top Democrat refused to budge from their demands.The two sides have been at an impasse since last year, leaving Illinois as the only state without a complete budget for the fiscal year that ends on June 30. Bipartisan, rank-and-file working groups pushed by Governor Bruce Rauner have been meeting, with sporadic reports that progress was being made on a budget for the new fiscal year.But following a short meeting on Friday with the governor, legislative leaders made it clear that common ground has not been reached.Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno accused Democrats of pulling the plug on negotiations.""They want to push the balanced budget issue reforms off into the fall, after the election,"" she told reporters. ""It's clear their priority is political and not for the good of the state.""
House Speaker Michael Madigan defended the budget passed by Democrats in his chamber this week, saying he is not willing to hold residents ""hostage"" while the governor expands his demands for pro-business and anti-union reforms.""There will be a complaint the state does not have sufficient money to pay for that budget,"" Madigan said. ""And I've said for the last year and a half, I'm prepared to negotiate with the governor to find the money to pay for those services.""House Republicans blasted the $14.1 billion general funds budget passed on Wednesday and again on Thursday by Democrats as being $7.2 billion short on revenue because the spending plan does not include big costs like pensions and debt payments.
Madigan, who has advocated a so-called millionaires' tax, said his first revenue choice would be taxing the wealthy through exclusions and deductions in the Illinois income tax code, including the earned income tax credit.Rauner contended negotiations were continuing. But he warned that the fifth-largest U.S. state must stop spending money it does not have. 
""We'll never have balanced budgets if we don't grow our economy and we need reforms to grow our economy, get more jobs and higher family incomes,"" he said. House Republicans pleaded with Democrats during Friday's session to break with Madigan and continue to work with them.""My request is that you don't give up,"" said House Republican Jim Durkin, who added that a deal was close.

By Valerie Volcovici
| TRENTON, N.D.

TRENTON, N.D. When Donald Trump laid out his plan this week to roll back U.S. environmental regulations to boost the ailing energy industry, it raised both the hopes and fears of the American Indians living near the heart of the country's richest oil fields.The Republican presidential contender's agenda, laid out at an oil industry conference on Thursday in North Dakota, could bring desperately needed jobs to depressed communities that have come to depend on the oil drilling industry, but could also trigger worse pollution of Indian lands. ""We would like to see more drilling,"" said Gene McCowan, human resources director for the Trenton Indian Service Area, which governs the six counties in North Dakota and Montana where 2,600 Turtle Mountain Chippewa live. ""But we are caught in a bind because people are concerned about fracking and how that will affect the earth and water,"" he said.The dilemma facing North Dakota's American Indians represents the broader tensions at play in the U.S. presidential election between jobs and the environment, as Trump and his likely Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, clash over energy and climate change. Trump on Thursday announced to a cheering crowd of roughly 7,700 people that he would sweep away initiatives by President Barack Obama to curb U.S. emissions and protect waterways from pollution, as ways to revive drilling and coal mining sectors that are in the middle of a steep downturn. Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, have advocated a sharp move away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources to cut pollution and slow climate change.The split is felt sharply by the Chippewa, people who have been hard hit by both the global oil market crash since 2014, as well as the environmental impacts of the preceding drilling boom that spread drillpads and pipelines across the landscape.
""Twenty percent of our people have been laid off or seen cuts in salaries and it's going to get worse,"" McCowan said, adding that he will likely support Trump as the best hope of reversing the crisis.Trenton is 14 miles southwest of oil boom town Williston. Until a year or so ago, locals were making $25-$30 an hour. Now, McCowan said, the number of people needing food stamps has risen 40 percent.Residents said Democratic candidate Sanders has the most to say about income inequality and Native Americans issues, but is also most likely to curb fossil fuel development, depriving people of what they see as their economic lifeline. 
""POCAHANTAS"" RANKLES 
Trump could be a hard pill to swallow for other reasons, other Native Americans in North Dakota said.Ahead of his speech on Thursday, Nicole Robertson, a 41-year-old Cree Indian and communications strategist for the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara nations - known as the Three Affiliated Tribes - tried to ask Trump if he would recognize tribal sovereignty when it comes to land where oil is produced. Trump said he would have to look into it. She later interrupted Trump when he launched an attack on Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, repeatedly calling her ""Pocahantas"" - a reference to her claim she is part Native American. Robertson shouted out that his comments were ""very offensive,"" interrupting his news conference.
She said afterward that she felt it was important that Native Americans be consulted on oil policy, both because of its economic importance and its environmental impacts.""A lot of opportunities have come with the boom in the Bakken region in North Dakota,"" she said. ""But we as indigenous people are original land stewards. It's in our genes."" She did not say who she would vote for in the election. American Indians make up around 5 percent of North Dakota's population.Kenneth Hall, a tribal councilman for the Three Affiliated Tribes, said he was also rankled by Trump's speech - even though it promised a much-needed economic revival.""We weren't even mentioned by Mr. Trump ... and nearly a quarter of oil production in the state comes out of our reservation lands,"" he said. He said the tribes requested a meeting with Trump ahead of his energy speech but that Trump's team did not respond.

By Emily Stephenson
| BISMARCK, N.D.

BISMARCK, N.D. Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders on Thursday explored staging an unconventional U.S. presidential debate  that would sideline Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and create a television spectacle that could attract huge ratings.The two men - a billionaire and a democratic socialist - expressed interest in a one-on-one encounter in California even though Republican and Democratic presidential candidates traditionally do not debate each other until the parties have selected their nominees.""I'd love to debate Bernie,"" Trump told reporters in North Dakota, after he secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. ""I think it would get very high ratings. It would be in a big arena.""Basking in his newly sealed nomination at a later campaign rally in Billings, Montana, Trump said he expected to put 15 states in play in the general election, compared with three or four for a traditional Republican. He named California, Washington and Michigan among others. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email there were no formal plans yet for a debate. But Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN there had been ""a few discussions"" between the campaigns about the details.        ""We hope that he will not chicken out,"" Weaver said. ""We hope Donald Trump has the courage to get on stage now that he said he would.""    Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is running far behind Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. But a nationally televised debate with the presumptive Republican nominee would be a big boost to his chances in the California primary on June 7, when Clinton is likely to clinch the nomination.        Trump said a debate with Sanders could raise up to $15 million for charity.""I'd love to debate Bernie, but they'll have to pay a lot of money for it,"" he said.
The idea was hatched during an appearance by Trump on ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" late on Wednesday. Kimmel said he asked Trump about the debate at the suggestion of Sanders.""Game on,"" Sanders tweeted. ""I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.""Sanders himself appeared on Thursday night on the talk show, where he said Kimmel made it possible for a ""very interesting debate"" between ""two guys who look at the world very, very differently.""Sanders added that the goal would be to have the debate in a stadium in California. He then had a warning for Trump. If I become the Democratic presidential nomination, he said, ""we're going to beat him and beat him bad.""
'NOT A SERIOUS DISCUSSION' 
Clinton, who backed out of an agreement to debate Sanders before the California vote, said she did not think a Trump-Sanders showdown would happen.""This doesn't sound like a serious discussion. I'm looking forward to debating Donald Trump in the general election. I really can't wait to get on the stage with him,"" she told CNN in a phone interview.A Fox News spokeswoman confirmed the network was trying to host a forum with Trump and Sanders. Representatives from other networks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""If it does come to pass, it would generate enormous ratings,"" said Alan Schroeder, a Northeastern University professor who has written extensively about presidential debates. ""They are from two different planets. You have a real personality contrast. It would dominate media coverage.""Sanders, who has promised to continue his campaign through the Democratic nominating convention in July, has said he will do everything he can to ensure that Trump does not win the White House.        ""Smart and bold move by Sanders,"" Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said. ""The Clinton people are furious but Bernie wins points for being so aggressive.""Clinton has tried to woo Sanders supporters as she turns her attention to the general election. But some Democrats worry his supporters - who are largely young, working-class and disillusioned with the Democratic Party establishment - will turn instead to political neophyte Trump, who has championed a populist agenda.    The debate would give Trump a national forum to criticize Clinton and try to win over Sanders supporters ahead of an expected Trump-Clinton general election contest, Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said.""I think Sanders should think long and hard about giving Trump a forum,"" Kofinis said. ""It crosses a line, but apparently in this election there is no line.""          Dale Ranney, 62, a Trump volunteer who has been to 21 of his rallies, said she would be delighted to see Trump and Sanders debate.""I think it's a great idea, any time you can get more information to the people, absolutely,"" Ranney said. ""Having Trump debate a socialist? Absolutely. Go for it.""

By Valerie Volcovici and Emily Stephenson
| BISMARCK, N.D.

BISMARCK, N.D. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, promised on Thursday to roll back some of America's most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he said would revive the ailing U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security.Among the proposals, Trump said he would pull the United States out of the U.N. global climate accord, approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and rescind measures by President Barack Obama to cut U.S. emissions and protect waterways from industrial pollution.""Any regulation that's outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers or contrary to the national interest will be scrapped and scrapped completely,"" Trump told about 7,700 people at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismarck, the capital of oil-rich North Dakota. ""We're going to do all this while taking proper regard for rational environmental concerns.""  It was Trump's first speech detailing the energy policies he would advance if elected president. He received loud applause from the crowd of oil executives.The comments painted a stark contrast between the New York billionaire and his Democratic rivals for the White House, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who advocate a sharp turn away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy technologies to combat climate change.Trump slammed both rivals in his speech, saying their policies would kill jobs and force the United States ""to be begging for oil again"" from Middle East producers. ""It's not going to happen. Not with me,"" he said.Trump's comments drew quick criticism from environmental advocates, who called his proposals ""frightening.""""Trump's energy policies would accelerate climate change, protect corporate polluters who profit from poisoning our air and water, and block the transition to clean energy that is necessary to strengthen our economy and protect our climate and health,"" said Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist.
But industry executives cheered the stance.""It's simple. If Trump wins, oil field workers will be happy. If Clinton wins, oil workers will be unhappy,"" said Derrick Alexander, an operations manager at oilfield services firm Integrated Productions Services.Trump hit Clinton hard in his speech, saying the former secretary of state would be more aggressive than Obama on regulations. He repeated several times Clinton's March comments that her policies would put coal miners out of work.""Hillary Clinton's agenda is job destruction,"" Trump said.
CANCEL PARIS
Trump said slashing regulation would help the United States achieve energy independence and reduce America's reliance on Middle Eastern producers. ""Imagine a world in which oil cartels will no longer use energy as a weapon,"" he said.The United States currently produces about 55 percent of the oil it uses, with another quarter of the total coming from Canada and Mexico, and less than 20 percent coming from OPEC, according to U.S. Energy Department statistics.Trump's advisers, including U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, have said they suggested Trump examine the role of OPEC in the global oil price slump since 2014, which has contributed to the demise of a handful of smaller U.S. oil companies. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have declined to cut production to support prices.         Until Thursday, Trump had been short on details of his energy policy. He has said he believes global warming is a hoax, that his administration would revive the U.S. coal industry, and that he supports hydraulic fracturing - an environmentally controversial drilling technique that has triggered a boom in U.S. production.
Earlier this month, he told Reuters in an interview that he would renegotiate ""at a minimum"" the U.N. global climate accord agreed by 195 countries in Paris last December, saying he viewed the deal as bad for U.S. business.He took that a step further in North Dakota. ""We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement,"" he said.Trump also promised he would invite Canadian pipeline company TransCanada (TRP.TO) to reapply to build the Keystone XL pipeline into the United States, reversing a decision by Obama to block the project over environmental concerns.""I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits,"" Trump said. ""That's how we're going to make our country rich again.""Trump's pledge briefly sent TransCanada's shares 29 Canadian cents higher to C$54.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, but the stock quickly leveled back off and close up 2 Canadian cents at C$53.86.In response to Trump's promise that he would seek more profits from the pipeline, TransCanada spokesman James Millar noted the project would create jobs, offer major contracts to U.S. suppliers and provide tens of millions in taxes for state coffers. ""The pipeline will benefit American workers longer term as the companies they work for have signed contracts to ship and refine oil through Keystone XL,"" Millar said in an email.

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Thursday she was confident voters would make the ""right decision"" despite concerns over findings by an internal government watchdog that her use of a private email server while secretary of state broke government rules.""I know people have concerns about this, I understand that,"" Clinton said in an interview broadcast on MSNBC, referring to the findings by the State Department inspector general in a report made public on Wednesday.The email controversy and a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into whether laws were broken as a result of Clinton's use of a server kept in her New York home have overshadowed the Democratic front-runner's campaign.The report concluded that Clinton would not have been allowed to use the server in her home had she asked the department officials in charge of information security.
Clinton said voters would look at the full picture of what she had to offer and the ""full threat"" that Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, posed to the country.

She said it was ""up to them"" whether to conduct the interview before the fall campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election.
Reiterating that the email arrangement was a mistake, Clinton said: ""I think the report has been consistent with what I have been saying, that the use of personal email was a practice by other secretaries of state and the rules were not clarified until after I had left.""

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON An effort in the U.S. Senate to expand the Federal Bureau of Investigation's authority to use a secretive surveillance order has delayed a vote on a popular email privacy bill, casting further doubt on whether the legislation will become law this year.The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday postponed consideration of a measure that would require government authorities to obtain a search warrant before asking technology companies, such as Microsoft  and Alphabet Inc's Google , to hand over old emails. A version of the Senate bill unanimously passed the House last month.Currently, federal agencies do not need a warrant to access emails or other digital communications more than 180 days old due to a provision in a 1986 law that considers them abandoned by the owner. But Republican party senators offered amendments Thursday that privacy advocates argued contravened the purpose of the underlying bill and would likely sink its chances of becoming law.Those amendments include one by Senator John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the Senate, that would broaden the FBI's authority to deploy an administrative subpoena known as a National Security Letter to include electronic communications transaction records such as the times tamps of emails and their senders and recipients.
Senators Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee, the Democratic and Republican authors of the email privacy bill, agreed to postpone the vote to give time to lawmakers to review the amendments and other provisions of the bill that have prompted disagreement. NSLs do not require a warrant and are almost always accompanied by a gag order preventing the service provider from sharing the request with a targeted user. 
The letters have existed since the 1970s, though the scope and frequency of their use expanded greatly after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. In 2015 requests for customer records via NSLs increased nearly 50 percent to 48,642 requests, up from 33,024 in 2014, according to a U.S. government transparency report.The Obama administration has for years lobbied for a change to how NSLs can be used, after a 2008 legal memo from the Justice Department said the law limits them largely to phone billing records. FBI Director James Comey has said the change needed essentially corrects a typo.
The Senate Intelligence Committee this week passed a bill to fund the U.S. intelligence community that contains a similar provision that would allow NSLs to be used to gather email records. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, voted against the proposal and said it ""takes a hatchet to important protections for Americans' liberty.""
