WASHINGTON Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump will present his views on law and order and the judiciary in separate policy speeches in coming weeks, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.Trump's speech on judges is planned in part to respond to unease among some conservatives that the billionaire real estate developer can be trusted with Supreme Court appointments, the Times said.Senate Republicans have blocked President Barack Obama's nomination of centrist appellate judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. With the ideological balance of the court at stake, the Republicans have said they want Obama's successor to fill the court's vacancy, hoping their party wins the White House.Representatives for Trump's campaign could not be immediately reached to confirm the speeches.Trump last week said he would consider ""wonderful, conservative, good, solid, brilliant judges in the form of"" Scalia to nominate to the Supreme Court, and plans to offer a list of potential nominees by July. 
Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News on Wednesday he was considering tapping former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to lead a commission to study his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering in the United States.""We'll figure it out and we will get it going, but we have to be extremely careful,"" Trump said.His campaign acknowledged this month that Trump is planning several policy speeches following his address last month explaining his foreign policy views. Trump offered few details in that April 27 speech in Washington but repeatedly vowed to put America first.
Trump effectively clinched the Republican Party's nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election last week.His planned remarks on law and order may offer more details on his views on issues including freedom of speech and police use of force. His large and raucous rallies often have drawn protesters and on occasion have been marred by violence. Trump has called protesters ""thugs"" and expressed regret that he and police officers could not respond to them more aggressively.
Trump has called for increased law enforcement surveillance of mosques in the United States and has said he would use an executive order to impose the death penalty for anyone who killed a police officer. Nineteen states do not allow the death penalty under state law.He has endorsed the use of waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning, and ""a lot more"" on terrorism suspects. Critics call waterboarding torture. Obama, a Democrat, banned its use days after taking office in 2009. (Reporting by Washington newsroom; Editing by Will Dunham)"	['Trump']	[]

By Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Former Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz returned to his job in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday with a warning to Washington that the turbulent primary race was a wake-up call.""All across this country people are hungry for change. This election cycle should be a wake-up call to Washington, D.C.,"" the senator from Texas said outside his office. ""The frustration and volcanic anger with Washington was echoed throughout this election.""Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders have upended expectations in their respective presidential campaigns, tapping into voter anger at establishment politicians in Washington. Cruz, a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, also tried to position himself as an outsider. However, he dropped out of the Republican race a week ago after a crushing loss in Indiana and a brutal campaign in which Trump attacked Cruz's wife and father and constantly derided the senator as ""Lyin' Ted.""Cruz ruled out a third-party candidacy, and said the democratic process had run its course.Earlier on Tuesday, Cruz welcomed the idea of tossing his hat back into the ring in a lighthearted exchange with a staunch supporter, conservative radio host Glenn Beck. 
Beck, who campaigned heavily for Cruz in the senator's quest for the Republican nomination, asked the 45-year-old Texan whether he would consider getting back into the race if he won Nebraska's primary on Tuesday.""I am not holding my breath,"" Cruz said to laughter on Beck's show on TheBlaze Radio Network. ""My assumption is that that will not happen. ... The reason we suspended the race last week is with Indiana's loss I didn't see a viable path to victory."" ""If that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.""
Trump's victory in Indiana last Tuesday pushed Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich out of the Republican race and put the brakes on the ""Stop Trump"" movements sparked by his unorthodox candidacy. Trump campaign adviser Sam Clovis dismissed the possibility of Cruz re-entering the race as highly unlikely.""I think if Ted has a future in Republican politics in this country, I think he'll want to preserve that,"" Clovis told CNN.
Cruz may be hoping to put his conservative imprint on the party's July 18-21 national convention in Cleveland. On Monday, he said he would not release delegates he had won in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, according to news reports. Trump needs 1,237 delegates, a majority of the delegates at the convention, to clinch the nomination on the first ballot, and it is not guaranteed he will win them in the remaining nominating contests.Asked if he would endorse Trump, Cruz said every voter needs to make their own choice and they do not need to make it now.""The Republican convention isn't for another two-and-a-half months; the election isn't for another six months,"" the senator said. ""I think we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do.""

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he had narrowed his potential vice presidential choices to five or six experienced politicians, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, told AP in an interview that he had not ruled out New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former rival now supporting Trump's bid for the White House.""I have a list of people that I would like,"" Trump was quoted as saying, adding he wanted his running mate to have political experience to help him ""with legislation, getting things through"" Washington if he wins the Nov. 8 presidential election.The New York billionaire businessman also said choosing someone who previously held elected office would make it easier to do background checks, in part because that person would have already been checked out by voters, the news media and to some extent, the government, according to the AP.
""For the most part, they've been vetted over the last 20 years,"" it quoted him as saying. 
Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is heading up the vetting effort, a campaign aide said on Tuesday.The vetting group includes former rival Ben Carson and Trump himself, the AP quoted the billionaire businessman as saying.

By Susan Heavey, Matt Spetalnick and Minami Funakoshi
| WASHINGTON/TOKYO

WASHINGTON/TOKYO Barack Obama will become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima in Japan later this month, but he will not apologize for the United States' dropping of an atomic bomb on the city at the end of World War Two, the White House said on Tuesday.Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize early in his presidency in 2009 in part for making nuclear nonproliferation a centerpiece of his agenda, Obama on May 27 will tour the site of the world's first nuclear bombing with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. With the end of his last term in office approaching in January, Obama will ""highlight his continued commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons,"" the White House said in a statement.""He will not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb at the end of World War II. Instead, he will offer a forward-looking vision focused on our shared future,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, wrote in a separate blog.The visit comes as part of a May 21-28 swing through Asia, which will include a Group of Seven summit in Japan and his first trip to Vietnam. The Asia trip seeks to reinforce his geopolitical ""pivot"" toward the region, though friends and allies there have sometimes questioned Washington's commitment.The Hiroshima tour will symbolize a new level of reconciliation between former wartime enemies who are now close allies. It will also underscore Obama's efforts to improve U.S.-Japan ties, marked by an Asia-Pacific trade pact as well as cooperation against China's pursuit of maritime claims and the nuclear threat from North Korea.On the final day of the summit in Japan, Obama and Abe will visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park near the spot where a U.S. warplane dropped an atomic bomb 71 years ago.
WHITE HOUSE DEBATE
The decision to go to Hiroshima was hotly debated within the White House. There were concerns a U.S. presidential visit would be heavily criticized in the United States if it were seen as an apology.The bomb dropped on Aug. 6, 1945 killed thousands of people instantly and about 140,000 by the end of that year. Another was dropped on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, and Japan surrendered six days later.
The majority of Americans view the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as justified to end the war and save U.S lives. Most Japanese see it as unjustified.Obama's press secretary Josh Earnest said it was ""an entirely legitimate line of inquiry for historians"" when asked why the White House had decided not to use his Hiroshima visit to issue an apology.He told reporters that while Obama understands the United States ""bears a special responsibility"" as the only country to use nuclear weapons in wartime, the president will emphasize Washington's responsibility ""to lead the world in an effort to eliminate them.""Abe, speaking to reporters in Tokyo, said he hoped ""to turn this into an opportunity for the U.S. and Japan to together pay tribute to the memories of the victims"" of the nuclear bombing. 
""President Obama visiting Hiroshima and expressing toward the world the reality of the impact of nuclear radiation will contribute greatly to establishing a world without nuclear arms,"" Abe added.Obama's visit will be a symbolic capstone for the nuclear disarmament agenda he laid out in a landmark speech in Prague in 2009. His aides tout last year's Iran nuclear deal as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy.But Obama has made only modest progress toward securing the world's loose nuclear materials, and there is no guarantee his White House successor will keep the issue a high priority.Lisbeth Gronlund, co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists' Global Security Program, said Obama must ""do more  than give another beautiful speech"" and should announce concrete action on nuclear disarmament when he visits Hiroshima.After U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Hiroshima last month, survivors of the bombing and other residents said that if Obama visits, they hope for progress in ridding the world of nuclear weapons, rather than an apology.

WASHINGTON/LONDON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, suggested he would make an exception for London's newly elected Muslim mayor, the New York Times reported.However, Sadiq Khan who was sworn in as mayor of the British capital on Saturday, dismissed Trump's response, saying the real estate billionaire and presumptive Republican nominee had an ""ignorant view of Islam"".""There will always be exceptions,"" the Times on Monday quoted Trump as saying when asked how his controversial proposal would apply to Khan, the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver and a seamstress.Trump said he was happy to see Khan elected, the Times reported, adding: ""You lead by example, always lead by example. If he does a good job ... that would be a terrific thing.""Trump put forth the idea of the ban after deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Paris and California last year. Muslim and human rights groups, Trump's Democratic rivals and many of his Republican presidential opponents condemned the proposal as divisive, counter-productive and contrary to American values.
Khan said Trump's view risked alienating mainstream Muslims and played into the hands of extremists, making both Britain and the United States less secure.""This isn't just about me - it's about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday.
""Donald Trump and those around him think that Western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam - London has proved him wrong.""Khan, 45, a candidate from the opposition Labour Party, defeated his Conservative rival by a record margin last week to secure the biggest individual mandate in British political history after an acrimonious campaign.
After his victory, he accused his opponents of using fear and innuendo about his alleged links to extremists to turn ethnic and religious groups against each other, which he described as ""something straight out of the Donald Trump playbook"".In an interview with Time magazine, Khan said he wanted to go to the United States to see the interesting programmes the mayors of New York and Chicago were implementing, but that he would have to visit before January in case Trump won the Nov. 8 election.

By Justin Madden
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Mel Reynolds, a former U.S. congressman from Illinois who has had numerous legal troubles, wants to plead guilty to federal income tax charges, he told a judge in a handwritten letter made public on Tuesday.""I request to come to court at the earliest time possible to enter my plea of guilty,"" he wrote on notebook paper to U.S. District Judge John Darrah. The letter was written last week and entered in the court's on-line filings on Tuesday. Reynolds, 64, is being held at a detention center in Kankakee, Illinois. He said he has no choice but to plead guilty because he has been unable to prepare for his case because he has been in solitary confinement due to death threats. Reynolds is representing himself after firing his lawyer in April. His next court date is a status hearing scheduled for May 19, and his trial is scheduled to begin June 20. Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, declined to comment on the court filing.
Reynolds was arrested by U.S. marshals last month at an Atlanta airport for violating the conditions of his pretrial release after he arrived from South Africa.Reynolds pleaded not guilty in July to misdemeanor charges of failing to file income tax returns for 2009 through 2012.
He was indicted in June and faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine for each of the four counts against him.A Rhodes scholar and one-time promising star of the Democratic Party, Reynolds was first elected to Congress in 1992.In August of 1994, he was indicted for having a relationship with a 16-year-old campaign worker but was re-elected in 1994 in his Chicago district without opposition. The case ended with a conviction on sexual assault and child pornography charges in 1995 and Reynolds resigned.
Before his scheduled release from prison in 1997, Reynolds was convicted of bank fraud and misusing campaign funds for personal use and sentenced to serve additional time. He was released in 2001.Reynolds tried politics again but in 2013 lost a bid for the U.S. House of Representatives seat of Jesse Jackson Jr., who had resigned before pleading guilty to fraud charges.

By Richard Cowan and Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The White House pressed forward on Tuesday with its uphill battle to win Senate confirmation of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, providing senators Merrick Garland's voluminous responses to questions about his background.The 141 pages of answers to standard questions posed to U.S. Supreme Court nominees, plus another 2,066 pages of appendices, filled six boxes that were wheeled into the U.S. Capitol building for reporters to see.""Now that we have this, let's have some confirmation hearings. We have never in my lifetime had a time when there's been a nominee for Supreme Court justice (that) they haven't been offered a hearing,"" said Senator Patrick Leahy, the 76-year-old top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.Senate Republicans have blocked consideration of Garland, the centrist federal appeals court judge nominated by the Democratic president in March, saying Obama's successor should fill the court's vacancy left by the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia.White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the questionnaire provided to the Senate ""an exhaustive picture of Judge Garland's distinguished career and impeccable credentials."" 
The questionnaire has become a tradition for Supreme Court nominees as part of the confirmation process. The process is anything but traditional this time around because of the Republican blockade, but at least three Judiciary Committee Republicans said they would read through Garland's material.One of them, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, said if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins the presidency on Nov. 8, the Senate should confirm Garland during a post-election legislative session before she takes office in January.While Flake said a ""conservative jurist"" should replace Scalia, Garland could be a better alternative than a potentially more liberal nominee from Clinton. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
""Most of us (Senate Republicans) believe Trump would appoint somebody more conservative than Hillary would,"" Flake said, adding, ""I'd like to be more sure of that.""Some Republicans are not sold on Trump's conservative credentials.
Garland's material provided insights into what the 63-year-old judge views as his career highlights.Garland cited a 2008 ruling he authored backing a Chinese Uighur detained at the Guantanamo Bay prison, and a 2015 ruling in which his appeals court upheld a long-standing ban on U.S. government contractors making campaign contributions in federal elections.Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, asked whether the White House should withdraw Garland's nomination if Clinton wins, allowing her to make her own pick, responded: ""I think he'd be a great addition to the court. He's a consensus nominee. And I am a Garland man.""

By Jonathan Stempel

A federal judge in New Jersey on Tuesday ordered the release of a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the criminal case against two former allies of Republican Governor Chris Christie in a 2013 scandal involving lane closures on the George Washington Bridge.U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark ruled in favor of several media organizations that sought the list, saying the public interest in seeing names linked to ""Bridgegate"" outweighed the privacy interests of those named.U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman had opposed the release, citing the potential harm to reputations and privacy, and saying the co-conspirator designation ""will become relevant, if at all"" only at trial.A spokesman for Fishman declined to comment.Last May, Fishman's office unveiled criminal charges against Bridget Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The defendants were accused of wire fraud and civil rights deprivation for arranging the September 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey, allegedly to punish the Democratic mayor there for not endorsing Christie's successful reelection bid.The closures snarled traffic for several days, causing big delays for drivers and hurting local businesses.Kelly and Baroni have pleaded not guilty. David Wildstein, another former Port Authority official, pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges.
Christie has not been charged, and has denied involvement in wrongdoing.In her decision, Wigenton said the scandal has received such extensive media coverage that ""very little"" remained private.She also called it likely that anyone on the list would be a public employee, or an elected or appointed official.
""Although privacy for third-parties is indeed important, this court is satisfied that the privacy interests of uncharged third parties are insufficiently compelling to outweigh the public's right of access,"" she wrote.Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for the media companies, on Tuesday asked the judge for the ""immediate"" release of the list.Christie made an unsuccessful run for the White House this year. He was chosen on Monday to lead the White House transition team for Donald Trump, the only candidate left in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.
