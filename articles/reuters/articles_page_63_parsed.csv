WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama said Donald Trump's embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin was unprecedented and said he was troubled that other Republicans were supporting the Republican presidential candidate's positions on Russia.""Mr. Trump's continued flattery of Mr. Putin and the way he appears and the degree to which he appears to model many of his policies and approaches to politics on Mr. Putin is unprecedented in American politics,"" Obama said at a White House news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.Saying ""Mr. Trump rarely surprises me these days,"" Obama said he was much more concerned to see support for the candidate's stance on Putin and Russia from Republican officials who historically had been anti-Russia.Historically, Republican politicians have often taken or appeared to take a harder line on Russia's predecessor, the Soviet Union, the United States' Cold War foe.
Obama said Russia's behavior has undermined international norms and said any suggestion that the United States has encroached on Russian interests is wrong.""We think that Russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage rather than part of the problem,"" Obama said.
""But their behavior has undermined international norms and international rules in ways we have to call them out on,"" Obama said, citing ""Russian aggression in Ukraine"" and other actions.
Russia has been internationally condemned for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its support of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

WASHINGTON Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Tuesday defended his campaign for a referendum on constitutional reforms, saying that such an overhaul would help simplify the nation's bureaucracy, offer greater stability and help make Europe stronger.    ""I'll do everything I can,"" to help the Dec. 4 referendum pass, Renzi said, speaking in Italian through an interpreter at the White House at a news conference with U.S. President Barack Obama. ""This is something to simplify things in our country.""

""It is a strategic interest of the United States to make sure that the migration crisis that's been taking place in Europe is solved,"" Obama told reporters following a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi at the White House.

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The top Republican in the U.S. Congress dimmed hopes that lawmakers might end the embargo on Cuba after President Barack Obama leaves office, saying on Tuesday he intends to keep the trade restrictions in place.""As the past two years of normalizing relations have only emboldened the regime at the expense of the Cuban people, I fully intend to maintain our embargo on Cuba,"" U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement.The Obama administration has been easing restrictions on dealings with Cuba since the surprise announcement in 2014 by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro that the long-time foes would move toward more normal relations.On Friday, the White House announced new measures to further ease trade, travel and financial restrictions, including allowing American travelers to bring home more of the country's coveted cigars and rum. 
But the half-century-long embargo can only be lifted fully by Congress, which is controlled by Ryan's Republicans. While some join most of Obama's fellow Democrats in backing the new policies, party leaders have opposed legislation to ease restrictions.Some lawmakers had hoped attitudes in Congress might soften after Obama leaves office in January, even if Democrats do not win majorities in the House and Senate, especially with Americans accustomed to two years of freer travel and business.
Cuban relations often come to the fore during U.S. election campaigns. Pro-embargo Cuban-Americans are an important Republican voting bloc in Florida, which often has close congressional races and is one of the swing states that can decide presidential elections.Ryan termed Obama's actions ""efforts to appease the oppressive regime"" in Cuba. He said they would strengthen its government and endanger U.S. companies' intellectual property rights.
Backers of Obama's policy say half a century of restrictions on trade and travel have not ended Cuban communism, and are not worth denying U.S. citizens freedom of travel and U.S. companies the chance to do business there.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama urged Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to ""stop whining"" about the Nov. 8 election being rigged, saying no serious person could suggest U.S. elections could be manipulated because of their decentralized nature.""I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It's unprecedented,"" the Democratic president said.
""I'd invite Mr. Trump to stop whining, and go try to make his case to get votes,"" Obama said at a joint White House news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.

BOSTON Former Boston Red Sox pitcher, failed video game entrepreneur and conservative political commentator Curt Schilling said on Tuesday he is considering running against Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in 2018.""I've made my decision. I'm going to run,"" Schilling said during an interview on WPRO-AM radio in Providence, Rhode Island, about 40 miles from Boston. He added that the decision would be contingent on his wife's approval. ""Ultimately it's going to come down to how her and I feel this would affect our marriage and our kids.""Schilling also fielded phone calls from listeners about a $75 million loan the state of Rhode Island made in 2010 to his video game company, 38 Studios, which went bankrupt in 2012.
""I'm sorry it ended the way it did,"" Schilling said, adding that if he had been governor of Rhode Island he would not have offered financing to that company.Schilling is still warmly remembered by Red Sox fans for undergoing a medical procedure that allowed him to pitch with an injured ankle and blood-stained sock during the American League Championship Series and World Series in 2004, helping the team win its first world series championship since 1918.
Despite being associated with a team from a politically liberal state, Schilling has long backed conservative politicians, most recently Republican presidential contender Donald Trump.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican U.S. congressional candidates worried that Donald Trump's struggling White House bid will damage them too have seized on one of President Barack Obama's signature foreign policy initiatives to try to ward off Democrats in the Nov 8 elections.With control of the Senate and perhaps even the House of Representatives in the balance, millions of dollars has been spent on campaign advertisements criticizing last year's Iran nuclear pact, even in districts where foreign affairs generally are not a top concern.Although Iran is unlikely to be most voters' main reason for choosing a candidate, strategists said the money could be well spent. Iran provides a distraction for Republicans concerned that the unpopularity of Trump -- whose poll numbers are dropping as he fights off several allegations that he groped women -- could also sink party members further down the ballot.One typical ad, for Iowa Republican Representative Rod Blum, uses apocalyptic imagery to tie Democratic challenger Monica Vernon to the Iran agreement.""Would you give billions to an Islamic Republic that burns our flag and chants 'Death to America?' Monica Vernon would,"" a male voice thunders over a video montage of marching troops, nuclear weapons and protesters burning U.S. flags.Vernon, a member of the Cedar Rapids City Council, has voiced support for the nuclear deal.Blum's spot is similar to dozens rolled out on behalf of Republican candidates who argue that America's influence is weaker because of Obama and by extension Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state who is now the Democratic presidential nominee.        
""Iran is a piece of the national security anxiety people feel,"" Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak said. ""Foreign policy's really complicated. Average voters don't understand it, don't follow it closely, but they know what bad foreign policy looks like.""POLITICIZED ISSUE
The agreement between Iran, the United States and other world powers curbs Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and the release of frozen Iranian assets.
Trump frequently criticizes the accord and promises to make much better deals, based on his business experience, if he wins the White House.The real estate magnate has hammered the Iran pact in both of his presidential debates with Clinton and it is likely to come up at Wednesday's third debate in Nevada.Reuters/Ipsos polling in May showed Americans preferred Republicans' plans for dealing with Iran by 37 percent versus 21.9 percent for the Democrats'.Every Republican in Congress opposed the Iran breakthrough. Many worried that Obama gave up too much to a country that sponsors terrorism and threatens Israel.
The issue has become more politicized recently, as congressional Republicans denounced the release of cash to Iran as a ""ransom"" payment and charged that huge Boeing Co and Airbus contracts to sell Iran jetliners could support terrorism.In the race for a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina on Nov. 8, a conservative spending group spent $1 million on advertising attacking Deborah Ross, the Democrat running against incumbent Senator Richard Burr, over the Iran deal.Israel also opposed the Iran accord, as did AIPAC, the main U.S. pro-Israel lobby group. Support for Israel is important to voters, especially evangelical Christians who are a wellspring of Republican support.There is more election advertising opposing the Iran deal than supporting it, but there is some backing for it.J Street, a smaller liberal pro-Israel group, spent $500,000 on advertising attacking Republican Senators Patrick Toomey and Ron Johnson, in tight re-election races in Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, for opposing the Iran pact.

By Emily Stephenson and Alana Wise
| GREEN BAY, Wis./WASHINGTON

GREEN BAY, Wis./WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Monday cited studies he said showed rampant voter fraud, saying the Nov. 8 election was ""rigged"" against him even as Republican lawyers called his allegations unfounded.Trump, a New York businessman making his first run for public office, has sought to raise fears of a flawed election as he has fallen in opinion polls against Democrat Hillary Clinton.""They even want to try to rig the election at the polling place,"" Trump told a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ""So many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is very, very common.""Trump cited Pew Trusts research from 2012 that called for updates to the voter registration system because about 24 million registrations were inaccurate. (bit.ly/1HN4uTF)He also referred to a 2014 article by two political scientists in the Washington Post that said non-citizens who voted could have accounted for Democratic victories in a few close elections in 2008, although the authors acknowledged the sample size of their study was small. (wapo.st/1pX17Bf)Numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is very rare.Republican campaign lawyer Chris Ashby said Trump's charges could foment unrest and were ""unfounded"" and ""dangerous.""""When you say an election is rigged, you're telling voters, your supporters, their votes do not matter,"" Ashby said in an interview. ""I think some of Donald Trump's comments could cause unrest at the polls.""Some Republicans have urged Trump to drop the assertions. Early voting and voting by mail have already begun in many states.Mark Braden, partner at Baker and Hostetler and former chief counsel for the Republican National Committee, said that any sort of election rigging at the national level ""just is impossible,"" citing the various systems in place that would make such an endeavor complicated and unfeasible. ""Our system is principally a system based upon each side watching the other side,"" Braden said in an interview. ""Our system is dependent on local volunteer participation. Our system has worked very well because we have people who get involved in the process and perform these functions.""Trump also pounced on the release on Monday of Federal Bureau of Investigation documents that he alleged showed ""felony corruption.""The documents cited an FBI official as saying a senior State Department official sought to pressure the bureau in 2015 to drop its insistence that an email from Clinton's private server contained classified information..
Clinton's decision to use a private server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 has drawn criticism that she was careless with national security.""This is worse than Watergate, what's going on with this,"" said Trump.He also proposed a package of ethics reforms, saying that if elected he would ban his administration officials from lobbying government for five years after leaving government.'NOT GOING TO BE RIGGED'
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Trump's assault on the voting system was an act of desperation.""He knows he's losing and is trying to blame that on the system. This is what losers do,"" Mook told reporters.
The RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls shows Clinton currently leading Trump by 7.1 percentage points, at 46 percent to 38.9 percent.The country's top elected Republican, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, tried to counter Trump's message about election fraud. Spokeswoman AshLee Strong said Ryan ""is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity."" In the traditionally hard-fought state of Ohio, the top elections official, a Republican, said concerns about widespread voter fraud were simply not justified. ""I can reassure Donald Trump: I am in charge of elections in Ohio and they're not going to be rigged, I'll make sure of that,"" Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted told CNN. In a report titled ""The Truth About Voter Fraud,"" the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law cited voter fraud incident rates between 0.00004 percent and 0.0009 percent.An August study by the Washington Post found 31 credible cases of impersonation fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014. Arizona State University studies in 2012 and 2016 found similarly low rates.
A number of Republican-led states, citing the need to prevent voter fraud, have passed laws with stricter ID requirements. But several have been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting.MELANIA TRUMP SPEAKS OUT
Trump's campaign has been shaken since the release 10 days ago of a 2005 tape showing him lewdly bragging about kissing and touching women without their permission. A series of women have since come forward with allegations about such behavior on his part, but he has denied those accusations.""They want to put nice sexy headlines up even though nothing happened,"" Trump said, blaming the media for trying to ""poison the minds of the voters.""On Monday, the allegations were in the headlines again after Trump's wife, Melania Trump, spoke publicly for the first time about the ""Access Hollywood"" tape.A former model who has mainly stayed off the campaign trail, Trump told CNN she was surprised by her husband's language and said she thought he had been ""egged on"" to ""say dirty and bad stuff,"" calling it ""boy talk."" Melania Trump told CNN that the allegations of unwanted touching from women were ""all organized from the opposition"" and said media did not ""check the background of these women.""In a separate interview with Fox News Channel, she said she had forgiven her husband for the comments in the tape.""Those words, they were offensive to me and they were inappropriate. And he apologized to me,"" Melania Trump said in an excerpt released by Fox News Channel.""I accept his apology. And we are moving on,"" she said.

8	8	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-melania-idUSKBN12I00S	Melania Trump calls taped comments by Donald Trump 'boy talk'	"

Melania Trump rose to her husband's defense on Monday, describing lewd comments the Republican presidential nominee made on a leaked 2005 video in which he bragged about groping women as ""boy talk.""     Trump, who has kept a low profile during her husband's presidential bid, gave her first television interviews since the Oct. 7 release of the tape that has shaken Donald Trump's campaign. He trails Democrat Hillary Clinton in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election.Melania Trump told CNN her husband was engaged in ""boy talk, and he was led on - like, egged on - from the host to say dirty and bad stuff"" in the conversation with ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush. NBC said on Monday that Bush was leaving the ""Today"" show, following his role in the taped conversation with Donald Trump.Melania Trump, a Slovenian-born former model, added in a CNN interview that aired on Monday night that she was surprised because she had never heard her husband use that kind of language before.  ""No. No, that's why I was surprised, because I said like I don't know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private,"" Melania Trump said. She told CNN that her husband behaved at times like an overgrown boy and that she saw his ""Access Hollywood"" remarks as in keeping with that behavior.""Sometimes I say I have two boys at home. I have my young son and I have my husband. But I know how some men talk, and that's how I saw it, yes,"" she said. 
Trump told CNN she agreed with first lady Michelle Obama that kissing or groping someone without consent constituted sexual assault, adding: ""But every assault should be taken care of in a court of law. And to accuse, no matter who it is, a man or a woman, without evidence is damaging and unfair.""'MOVING ON'
In partial transcripts from a separate interview with Fox News, she said she had forgiven her husband for the comments in the tape, which was first published by the Washington Post.
""Those words, they were offensive to me and they were inappropriate. And he apologized to me. And I ... accept his apology. And we are moving on.""They were her first public comments since a statement she issued after the tape's publication in which she said her husband's remarks did ""not represent the man that I know.""Melania Trump told Fox News that her husband, a New York businessman and former reality television star, was committed to running for office even though it was difficult because he had been ""in so many shows, so many tapes"" over the years.
Asked if it was fair for the media or her husband to bring up charges of infidelity in former President Bill Clinton's past, Melania Trump told Fox News: ""Well, if they bring up my past, why not?""After Trump denied during a debate with Clinton on Oct. 9 that he had actually done the things he bragged about in the tape, a number of women accused him of groping and kissing them without permission in incidents stretching back decades. He has denied the charges. Asked about those accusations, Melania Trump told Fox News: ""All these women are coming out and they are allegations but they are not true. Why now? Why three weeks before the election?""""I believe my husband,"" she told CNN. ""This was all organized from the opposition. With the details that they got, did they ever check the background of these women? They don't have any facts.""

By Lawrence Delevingne and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
| NEW YORK/BOSTON

NEW YORK/BOSTON Largely united in their dislike of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, some ultra-wealthy U.S. investors who play in conservative politics are warily weighing their choices, torn between third-party candidates, simply focusing on down-ballot contests or even voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton.As Clinton's lead over Trump has grown in opinion polls, some hedge fund managers who have traditionally donated big money to Republican presidential candidates see the congressional elections as their best hope.Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the best-performing hedge fund managers of all time, told Reuters he had recently given to Republican candidates for Congress in the hope of creating a ""firewall"" against Clinton's economic policies, including more government control of healthcare and what he described as ""astronomical disincentives"" to invest.Druckenmiller, who invests privately since closing his hedge fund firm in 2010, said Trump had an ""unstable personality"" that ruled him out as a candidate.""I might just vote on the down ballot part of the ticket and not bother with the top,"" he said.Public filings show Druckenmiller donated to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in August and the National Republican Congressional Committee in March.He disavowed long-shot Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, saying he was ""out the window"" after a couple of high-profile lapses on foreign affairs, including struggling to name an international leader he admired.
But some Republican hedge fund managers contacted by Reuters said they planned to vote for Johnson, who is polling in the single digits.Among them is Tiger Management founder Julian Robertson, according to spokesman Fraser Seitel. Robertson previously backed Republicans Jeb Bush and John Kasich.""I've heard from a lot of people who say they'll vote for Johnson or not vote at all because they don't want to be held responsible for having elected Hillary Clinton,"" one hedge fund billionaire said in describing industry views.The person, who requested anonymity because they did not want their political views to be public, plans to vote for Clinton. The person believes Clinton is the lesser of two evils and that no vote, or one for someone else, could help Trump.
Other conservative investors focused on congressional races instead of the next president include Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management and Paul Singer of Elliott Management, according to people familiar with the situation.Asness recently gave to the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and a political action committee supporting Pennsylvania Senator Patrick Toomey, according to public filings.Singer has also given to the NRSC, in addition to Together Holding Our Majority PAC, which recently sent money to two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Richard Burr of North Carolina.Asness and Singer declined to comment. Spokespersons for Trump, Clinton and Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
To be sure, Trump retains a band of loyal hedge fund industry boosters. They include Robert Mercer of Renaissance Technologies and economic advisers Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital, John Paulson of Paulson & Co, Stephen Feinberg of Cerberus Capital Management and Steven Mnuchin of Dune Capital Management. Mercer and Scaramucci have re-affirmed their support of Trump in public statements over the last week.Other investors have moved firmly into the Democratic camp: Billionaire Seth Klarman of Baupost Group and Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital Management are among investors who recently gave Clinton money after years of donations to candidates from both parties. Weinstein declined to comment and Klarman told Reuters in August that Trump is ""completely unqualified for the highest office in the land."" Attitudes against Trump have hardened since multiple women have accused him of groping them and the release of a 2005 video in which he boasts about such behavior. Trump has denied the accusations and has said his comments were just ""locker room talk.""One Republican hedge fund industry veteran said that his peers' revulsion with Trump has become so strong that they feel they have to vote for Clinton - if only to prevent the Republican nominee from winning. ""She at least represents predictability and seasoning,"" the person said. ""The difference between her and Trump is no contest.""
