By Dave McKinney
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Dozens of Illinois social service providers, starved of cash by the state's long-running budget stalemate, sued Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and six statewide agencies on Wednesday, seeking more than $100 million for unpaid work since July.The plaintiffs, who provide services for sex-abuse victims, the homeless, senior citizens and at-risk youth, are suffering ""acute financial hardship"" as a result of the unresolved budget fight, according to the lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court.It is the latest attempt at judicial relief by groups hurt by the state's record-setting, 11-month budget impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats controlling the legislature.The coalition of 64 organizations, calling itself Pay Now Illinois, contended that Rauner's June 2015 veto of appropriation bills amounted to an unlawful impairment of the their constitutional right to seek a legal remedy for non-payment by the state of their various contracts.""We've had to deal with this uncertainty now for the 11th month, over 300 days, without being paid,"" said Andrea Durbin, chairwoman of Illinois Pay Now. ""We're seeking to be paid in full for the work we've done.""
Rauner's office expressed empathy but urged state lawmakers to approve a spending plan.""While we understand that frustration is driving many worthwhile organizations to seek solutions anywhere, including the courts, the only solution is for the General Assembly to pass a balanced, reform-oriented budget as soon as possible,"" Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said.
In another budget-related development, a plan to change how Illinois taxes its residents and businesses stalled in the House of Representatives after a successful lobbying push by Rauner.The proposed constitutional amendment would have stricken the state's flat income-tax rates and allowed state lawmakers to impose new, multi-tiered tax rates tied to an individual or company's level of income. Supporters said it would raise an additional $1.9 billion annually for the state.But facing a Wednesday deadline to pass the House, one of the measure's sponsors, State Representative Christian Mitchell, said lobbying by the governor's office convinced up to five Republicans whose backing was needed for passage to withdraw their tentative support.
""It's disappointing because this could have helped us with our budget crisis,"" Mitchell, a Chicago Democrat, told Reuters.Rauner's administration said the measure would cost the state 20,000 jobs in four years and lead to a migration of 43,000 high wage earners from Illinois.

By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will meet in Ottawa for a North American leaders' Summit on June 29, the White House said on Wednesday.The ""Three Amigos"" summit, with two key U.S. trading partners, comes as Obama grapples with a wave of anti-free-trade sentiment that has stalled ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping 12-nation pact that includes Canada and Mexico.Obama hopes the U.S. Congress will ratify the deal before he leaves office on Jan. 20. But trade has become a lightning rod issue in the presidential election campaign to replace him.Republican Donald Trump, now his party's presumptive nominee for 2016, has attacked the TPP and describes the tripartite  North American Free Trade agreement as a disaster that needs to be renegotiated or broken.
In the Democratic campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders has opposed the trade deal, and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has also expressed concerns.Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States and would suffer greatly if a future president moved to clamp down on free trade.Trudeau, asked how he would deal with a President Trump, said the leaders of both countries would always agree on the need for growth and prosperity. One important way to achieve this was through trade, he added.
""The level of integration between the Canadian and American economies is unlike anything else ... in the world,"" he told a news conference in Ottawa.   The last ""Three Amigos"" summit was in Toluca, Mexico in 2014. Canada was supposed to host the meeting early last year but canceled it amid tension between then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline.
Obama will address Canada's Parliament during the visit, the White House said. He last came to Canada for a bilateral visit in February 2009, the first foreign trip of his presidency.Ottawa's relations with Mexico are strained over Canadian rules, introduced under Harper, that impose visas for visiting Mexicans. Trudeau said he hoped to be able to announce within weeks that the requirement would be scrapped.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday held firm on his refusal to act on President Barack Obama's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court even as some conservative activists called on senators to confirm Merrick Garland now that Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.""The leader's position has not changed on Garland,"" McConnell spokesman David Popp told Reuters.Since Obama nominated Garland in March, McConnell has refused to allow a confirmation vote, saying it should be up to the next president to fill the court's vacancy left by the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.Some conservatives on Wednesday urged the Senate to confirm Garland, a centrist federal appeals court judge, now that Trump appears in line to win the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. They are concerned Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton will defeat Trump in the election and pick a far more liberal nominee than Garland for a lifetime court appointment.Other conservative voices urged McConnell to hold firm, saying that doing otherwise would alienate core Republican voters, hurting the party's election chances in the fall.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who backs McConnell's hard-line stance, has refused to hold hearings on Garland's nomination.With his victory in Tuesday's Indiana Republican primary, Trump solidified his position to land the party's presidential nomination at its July convention in Cleveland. His closest challenger, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, quit the race after being drubbed in Indiana.McConnell has repeatedly refused to say which Republican he supports for president. In an interview with Newsmax on Monday, before the Indiana vote, McConnell would say only that he intends to support the party's nominee, ""whomever that may be.""
Trump has said he would consult with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank on possible Supreme Court nominees if he is elected president.Leon Wolf of the conservative RedState website predicted that Republicans will lose the White House race in November with Trump as their nominee, and likely lose control of the Senate as well.
Wolf wrote in a blog post, ""The choices, essentially, are to confirm Garland ... or watch as President Clinton nominates someone who is radically more leftist and 10-15 years younger"" than the 63-year-old Garland.But Erick Erickson, writing for the conservative website The Resurgent, said Republicans should ""resist the temptation"" because rushing to confirm Garland might ""further depress Republican (voter) turnout"" that is important to keeping the Senate under Republican control.

| MONTERREY, Mexico

MONTERREY, Mexico A maverick Mexican state governor on Wednesday tipped presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to win the upcoming U.S. election, likening his own shock victory last year to the billionaire's ascent.An outspoken rancher known as ""El Bronco"" (the gruff one), Jaime Rodriguez became the first independent governor in modern Mexico, capitalizing on widespread disaffection with established parties to win Nuevo Leon state on the U.S. border.""I made a bet ... I said that Trump's going to win,"" Rodriguez said the day after Trump's main rival for the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz, dropped out of the race. ""What's Trump doing? He's taking advantage of the anger. The whole world says Trump is mad; that's what they said about me.""Speaking in Nuevo Leon's capital, Monterrey, Rodriguez said he was not a Trump fan, and would not vote for him if he had a ballot.
But, he added, he had met with a group of Mexican migrants in the last few days who also told him they thought Trump would win. They had faith in a Trump presidency as the real estate mogul is known as a job creator, Rodriguez said.Once a member of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Rodriguez won a landslide election victory in one of the country's wealthiest states last June after breaking with the PRI and running an anti-establishment campaign.The week after Rodriguez's victory, Trump launched his bid for the U.S. presidency, putting Mexico in his crosshairs and leaving the Mexican government struggling to come up with an effective strategy to counter his rhetoric.
Claiming Latin America's No. 2 economy is ""killing"" the United States on trade, Trump has threatened to disrupt bilateral commerce worth some $500 billion a year and punish companies that move operations offshore.He has also promised to deport millions of undocumented migrants from Mexico and Central America, and force Mexico to pay for a wall on the border between the two countries.
Trump's path to becoming the Republican presidential nominee received a further boost on Wednesday when U.S. media reported his last remaining challenger, Ohio Governor John Kasich, was suspending his campaign.Rodriguez is seen by political analysts as a potential candidate for the Mexican presidency in 2018.

CHICAGO Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel tried to reassure municipal credit analysts on Wednesday that the city and its public school district are not falling into a financial abyss.""I will not rest until we fix the fiscal position of both the city and (Chicago Public Schools),"" the mayor told the National Federation of Municipal Analysts annual conference.But some attendees said his speech did little to alleviate their worries about the city's sinking credit.""I'm very concerned. I don't see them making any headway,"" said Susan Dushock, a senior vice president at SunTrust Private Wealth Management, referring to an ongoing political impasse that is hindering Chicago's efforts.The battle between Illinois' Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, and Democrats who control the legislature has left the state without a fiscal 2016 budget and has stymied Chicago's efforts to seek pension relief.Chicago continues to struggle with a structural budget deficit and a $20 billion unfunded pension liability. Rulings by the Illinois Supreme Court both this year and last year have made it much more difficult to enact pension changes to lower that liability.
Emanuel likened those rulings to putting ""a straightjacket around us,"" but vowed to continue negotiating with unions to reach a deal that ensures pensions are paid in a manner that is responsible to taxpayers.He also touted the diverse economy of the nation's third-largest city, its ability to snag relocating corporations, and educational improvements at schools.
""(Emanuel) didn't focus on how to solve the current fiscal crisis,"" said Richard Ciccarone, who heads Merritt Research Services.CPS is also betting on state solutions for escalating pension payments that have left it with a $1 billion budget gap. The district is calling for a bigger share of state funding to cover pensions and the costs of educating poor children.The city and CPS have been hit with downgrades that pushed their credit ratings closer to or into the ""junk"" level and both are paying a huge penalty in the U.S. municipal bond market.
Chicago general obligation bonds due in 22 years were trading at 287 basis points over Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A yield scale, while the so-called credit spread for CPS bonds due in 15 years was 463 basis points, according to MMD.

BUENOS AIRES An Argentine TV station is lampooning U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump's comments about illegal immigration from Latin America to promote next month's regional Copa America soccer tournament in the United States.""Our country is in serious trouble!"" Trump says to ominous music in the commercial made by TyC Sports channel, which will broadcast the June 3-26 centenary tournament in the soccer-obsessed South American country.""We are having people coming in through the border that are not people that we want,"" the candidate adds, against images of Lionel Messi and other top Argentine players descending from a plane and fans massed in national blue-and-white colors.The comments used in the advertisement are taken from Trump's speeches. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the 71-second spot. The billionaire real estate mogul has caused indignation south of the U.S. border with his views on immigration and promise to build a ""great wall"" along the Mexican border.  
""They're coming from South America,"" Trump says in another clip from his speeches used by TyC, against a backdrop of Argentine stars from Sergio Aguero to Gonzalo Higuain pounding in goals against stumbling defenders.""These are total killers,"" Trump says as the spot shows a close-up of Messi looking mean on the field. ""These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think. We have no protection."" Argentina, which has not won the Copa America since 1993, is among the teams favored to win the tournament, as are Brazil and Chile.
""They're unchecked, and then they're being sent all over the United States,"" Trump intones while the names of tournament host cities like Seattle and Houston flash on the screen. At the end, the TyC ad shows a line of text, also in blue and white, that teasingly aligns itself with Trump: ""It's true. The best thing you can do is not let them in.""
This is the first year the tournament, referred to in English as the 2016 Centennial Copa America, will be hosted outside of South America. It also marks the 100th anniversary of the world's oldest international soccer competition.Former reality television star Trump won a commanding victory in Indiana's Republican primary on Tuesday, forcing his main rival, Ted Cruz, to drop out of the race.

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Several Republicans took to social media Wednesday to declare they will never back Donald Trump for U.S. president even after Ted Cruz, the billionaire businessman's closest rival, dropped out of the race for the party nomination.The anti-Trump declarations came from a range of quarters, including at least one Republican U.S. senator and a number of political commentators who have been leading voices of the #NeverTrump movement that has resisted his candidacy.Trump's victory in the Indiana primary on Tuesday prompted Cruz's surprise decision to suspend his campaign and left Trump a largely uncontested path to securing the roughly 200 delegates he still needs to lock down the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election.""Reporters keep asking if Indiana changes anything for me. The answer is simple: No,"" U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said on Twitter. Sasse included a link to a February Facebook post in which he appealed to Trump backers to drop their support.Mark Salter, a former speech writer for Senator John McCain, said he would support former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, over Trump.
""The GOP is going to nominate for President a guy who reads the National Enquirer and thinks it's on the level. I'm with her,"" Salter (@MarkSalter55) tweeted, referring to a common rallying cry among Clinton supporters. But the high-profile ""Stop Trump"" or ""Never Trump"" effort launched by conservative Republicans failed to significantly slow Trump's momentum and appeared not to have achieved its mission as the date nears for the Republicans' convention in July.After Trump's Indiana victory on Tuesday night, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for the party to back Trump.
""@realDonaldTrump will be presumptive @GOP nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton,"" Priebus (@Reince) tweeted.Still, it was clear that Trump faces some difficulty bringing all Republicans on board.Bill Kristol, a neoconservative and editor of the Weekly Standard, offered a scathing retort to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's call to back Trump.
""If you're for Trump you functionally are for a man unfit to be president, & for the degradation of [American] conservatism,"" tweeted Kristol (@BillKristol) early Wednesday.""Never ever ever Trump. Simple as that,"" tweeted Tim Miller (@Timodc), former campaign communications director for Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the White House race earlier this year.Several Republican voters said on Twitter that they were changing their party affiliation, while some posted photos of their voter registration cards lit ablaze.

By John Miller
| ZURICH

ZURICH Companies should not blame U.S. sanctions for stopping them investing in Iran, a State Department official told businesses on Wednesday, saying there were many other risks putting off would-be investors.The United States and Europe lifted sanctions in January under a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program, but U.S. sanctions unrelated to the nuclear issue remain, banning dollar transactions with Iran and making it harder for companies to access finance for business in the Islamic Republic.Jarrett Blanc, the State Department's deputy lead coordinator of last year's nuclear deal, said companies should tell their Iranian partners that it was not just those remaining sanctions that were holding up business deals.""Many times, in the past 100 days, we have found international firms who have said to Iran: 'Only U.S. sanctions are preventing you from doing business',"" Blanc told 400 people at a forum for European business with Iran in Zurich.""But when we dig a little deeper, and seek to answer questions about precisely your concerns, it turns out that your business decisions, not surprisingly, in fact take into account concerns well beyond sanctions."" 
Iran has signed billions of dollars of deals with European firms since the nuclear sanctions were lifted, including a $27 billion aircraft order from Airbus. But deals requiring investment inside Iran have moved slowly.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most powerful figure in Iran, has blamed the delays squarely on the United States.""The U.S. Treasury ... acts in such a way that big corporations, big institutions and big banks do not dare to come and deal with Iran,"" Khamenei said in March.
Iranian businesses at the Zurich forum said European banks were staying away due to U.S. pressure, and said that could put European companies at a disadvantage to their Asian competitors.""They are going to lose opportunities soon,"" Majid Ghassemi, president of Bank Pasargad, told Reuters. ""It is against the benefits of European investors, this kind of barrier that the Americans have put up against the banking system in Europe.""Parviz Akbaroff, international business manager at infrastructure consulting company Rah Shahr, said European firms had ""become subservient to U.S. interests"".
While the United States does not prohibit foreign banks from doing business with Iran, many are wary after facing multi-billion dollar fines during the sanctions era. Nonetheless, lawyers and consultants have consistently warned would-be investors of a wide range of other risks including complex regulations, unclear dispute mechanisms, labor issues, and corruption.Blanc said investors who acknowledge these concerns privately should communicate them to their Iranian partners. ""Don't take the easy way out, by just saying 'U.S. sanctions, U.S. sanctions, U.S. sanctions',"" he said. (Additional reporting by Joshua Franklin; Editing by Sam Wilkin and Robin Pomeroy)"
