WASHINGTON The Clinton Foundation, the family philanthropy of Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, should shut down or transfer operations to another charity despite its good work to avoid perceptions of ""pay-for-play,"" The Washington Post and USA Today said in editorials on Wednesday. Despite plans announced earlier this week to reorganize the Clinton Foundation if Hillary Clinton wins the Nov. 8 election, USA Today said the global charity must close for the Democratic candidate to avoid any appearance of unethical ties. ""The only way to eliminate the odor surrounding the foundation is to wind it down and put it in mothballs, starting today, and transfer its important charitable work to another large American charity such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,"" the paper's editorial board wrote.  The Gates Foundation declined to share its thoughts on the idea. ""We really can't speculate about the future of the Clinton Foundation,"" Amy Enright, a Gates Foundation spokeswoman, wrote in an email.The newspaper also published an editorial by Donna Shalala, the Clinton Foundation's president, in which she argued that the foundation helps millions of people, especially in developing countries, and so scaling down its work was not simple.""This suggestion ignores how global philanthropy works, and the reality that there are human beings around the world who would be affected by these decisions,"" Shalala wrote.
The foundation announced on Monday that it would stop accepting at least some foreign and corporate donations if Clinton wins the presidency and that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, would resign from the foundation's board.The Washington Post said in its editorial that these changes were insufficient and should have happened sooner, before Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.""The foundation undoubtedly does worthwhile work,"" the Post's editorial board wrote. ""Should Ms. Clinton win, all of that work and all of the foundation's assets should be spun off to an organization with no ties to the first family."" The Clintons' daughter, Chelsea Clinton, remains on the board of the charity, the full name of which is the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
The call from two leading U.S. news organizations came as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and other members of his party have taken to calling for a special prosecutor to investigate what they say is corruption. The Clinton campaign has dismissed such calls as groundless political smears.Republicans see attacking Clinton over the organization as a way of unifying conservatives divided over Trump, who has never held elected officer and who often deviates from conservative orthodoxy.Democrats hope the controversy comes too late to make a difference in the election, in which most national public opinion polls show Clinton ahead. 
The foundation has said Hillary Clinton was not involved with the group while serving as the nation's top diplomat. The Clinton campaign denies Clinton ever took any action because of donations to the foundation.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told MSNBC on Wednesday that Clinton does not have a conflict of interest with charitable work, and pointed to her rival's business interests with Wall Street, China and Russia.""Donald Trump and his bottom line and his networks are directly connected to all kinds of international entities ... and nobody's asking him to disclose or divest,"" Mook said of the New York businessman. Trump has responded by saying it is Clinton, not he, who has close ties to Russia.

Since announcing her presidential bid last year, Hillary Clinton has had to field questions about the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, her family's global philanthropy. The non-profit group has been praised by health experts for helping to negotiate lower prices for HIV medicine in the developing world. But ethics experts and Clinton's Republican opponents say its reliance on millions of dollars from foreign governments and powerful businesses makes her vulnerable to charges her donors could expect favorable treatment from the White House, which her campaign says is unfounded.* THE FOUNDATION'S HISTORYBill Clinton established the Clinton Foundation in 1997 to raise funds for his presidential archive in Little Rock, Arkansas, as he prepared to leave the White House. It has since grown into a complex global philanthropic organization, working to improve health and prospects in dozens of countries and to fight climate change.After leaving her job as U.S. secretary the state in 2013, Hillary Clinton joined the foundation's board, and the organization was renamed the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Later in 2015, Hillary Clinton left the foundation to run for president and in the August 2016 her husband said he will step down from the board if she wins. Their plans to remain with the foundation.* THE FOUNDATION'S WORKThe foundation typically raises more than a quarter of a billion dollars each year in grants and donations. It spends about $200 million each year on programs and other expenses.
The biggest program is the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which accounts for about two-thirds of the foundation's annual expenses and focuses on reducing the cost and increasing the availability of medicine for HIV, malaria and other infections in developing countries. The foundation also is involved in an array of other causes. It helps farmers in Africa increase yields and profits and tries to stop poachers from killing elephants there. It encourages American parents to read to their toddlers and schools to provide healthier environments for their students. It also helps Americans get access to loans to make their homes more energy efficient.Under the name Clinton Global Initiative, the foundation throws regular glitzy multi-day gatherings where people from politics, corporations and non-profit organizations to discuss philanthropy projects. CGI will hold its last such meeting in September before ending.
*CRITICISMS OF FOUNDATION
In 2015, foundation officials admitted the charity breached an ethics agreement Clinton signed with the White House in order to become secretary of state. Under the agreement, she promised she would annually disclose the names of all donors to the charity and that it would seek State Department approval before accepting new money from foreign governments. The charities said not complying with the promises was a result of oversights.
The foundation also admitted it had wrongly completed half a dozen annual tax returns that gave misleading figures about the amount of support it got from foreign governments, among other errors. After Reuters discovered the errors, the foundation apologized and refiled the returns.The foundation continued to accept money from foreigners, including foreign governments, and corporations while Clinton was secretary of state but has said it will introduce at least some limits on such donations if she becomes president. Emails by Clinton and her staff released by the State Department show it was not unusual for foundation officials to help donors get access to Clinton, prompting experts in government ethics to raise concerns that the foundation gives rise to an appearance of a conflict of interest. Donald Trump, Clinton's Republican rival for the presidency, has called for a special prosecutor to look into the foundation. Clinton's campaign says any donor who expected special favors from Clinton in return would have been disappointed. (Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Bill Trott)"	['Clinton']	[]

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Immigration advocates on Thursday mounted a long-shot effort to revive part of U.S. President Barack Obama's plan to shield millions of immigrants from deportation by filing a lawsuit challenging the national scope of a court order that blocked it.With favorable court rulings, the lawyers filing the lawsuit say it has the long-term potential to unravel decisions that blocked Obama's November 2014 plan nationwide. The White House program, if it had been fully implemented, could have allowed up to four million people with no legal immigration status to obtain work authorization.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York on behalf of Martin Batalla Vidal, 25, an immigrant from Mexico who has lived in the United States since he was seven and has benefited from the program. 
He initially received a three-year work authorization, which has now been revoked due to a Texas judge's ruling in February 2015 that blocked Obama's plan. Texas and 25 other states had challenged it.Vidal would still be eligible for a two-year work authorization under an earlier program, which has not been challenged and was not covered by the injunction.
Vidal's lawyers at the National Immigration Law Center say that if he wins, the ruling could have broad implications because it could help to eventually reinstate Obama's program for up to 60 percent of potential applicants in parts of the country not covered by the Texas ruling. The Texas judge's ruling was upheld on appeal. On June 23, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on the case, leaving the appeals court decision in place. 
The court is currently one justice short following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to rehear the case once it has a full complement of justices. (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Alistair Bell)"	['Lawrence']	[]

By Amanda Becker
| PALO ALTO, California

PALO ALTO, California Democrat Hillary Clinton will accuse Donald Trump of embracing a brand of U.S. political conservatism associated with white nationalism and nativism when she makes a Nevada campaign stop on Thursday. Aides said Clinton will link Trump's statements about immigration and religion to the rise of a political fringe movement in the U.S. known as the ""alternative right"", which opposes multiculturalism and immigration.Clinton's speech is an effort to keep attention focused on what a top aide called Trump's ""divisive and dystopian vision"" as he tries to reverse his slumping position in opinion polls in key battleground states before the Nov. 8 presidential election.Her campaign said Trump's recent installation of a new campaign leadership team was no indicator that he would move away from past statements criticizing the objectivity of an American judge of Mexican heritage or proposing to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.""Trump's newly installed brain trust,"" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in a statement, ""completes Donald Trump's disturbing takeover of the Republican Party.
""Republicans up and down the ticket are going to have to choose whether they want to be complicit in this lurch toward extremism or stand with voters who can't stomach it,"" he said.Trump's campaign declined to comment on Clinton's campaign speech, but at a Mississippi rally on Wednesday, the Republican nominee called Clinton a ""bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings.""Trump is set to meet with African-American leaders in New York City on Thursday and said he would unveil an immigration proposal within the next two weeks.
In comments broadcast on Fox News on Wednesday night, Trump backed farther away from his hardline stance on deporting millions of illegal immigrants, saying he would be willing to work with those who have abided by U.S. laws while living in the country.When asked by CNN to respond to Trump's charge that she was a ""bigot"" on Wednesday evening, Clinton said he was ""taking a hate movement mainstream.""He's brought it into his campaign. He's bringing it to our communities and our country,"" Clinton said. ""I will have more to say about this tomorrow.""
Her campaign cites Trump's decision to bring on Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon as his new campaign chief as a sign Trump is strengthening his ties to the alternative right movement.During Bannon's tenure, Breitbart News increased its coverage of alt-right issues, and Bannon told the magazine Mother Jones during the Republican National Convention last month that the website was ""the platform for the alt-right"".The term ""alt-right"" is used to describe a faction of political conservatives that have used the Internet in recent months to advance views of white supremacism, anti-Semitism and nativism.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. senator seen by Silicon Valley as one of the technology industry's main foes in Congress is fighting for his political life as Donald Trump's slumping poll numbers threaten to damage Republican candidates across the board.         Senator Richard Burr from North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is facing a strong and unexpected challenge from Democrat Deborah Ross.     Though tech policy is unlikely to decide the race, a Burr defeat would remove from the scene a lawmaker who has feuded with U.S. tech companies over digital privacy and encryption.Ross, a former head of the state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, is fighting an uphill battle. North Carolina has voted Republican in every presidential election from 1980 until 2008, when it backed Barack Obama by a thin margin. The state went for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012.Burr, 60, was not expected to face a challenge this year, in what he has said will be his last congressional campaign. But Republican presidential candidate Trump's numbers have slumped nationwide and in North Carolina, a battleground state in the Nov. 8 presidential election.Declining support for Trump, a property developer and television personality who has never held elected office, has put Burr, who endorsed Trump, and other Republicans in jeopardy, said Carter Wrenn, a Republican consultant in North Carolina.""We're not sure it's a wave here for Democrats, but it's beginning to look that way,"" Wrenn said. ""Any Republican running down here ought to be very concerned about Trump's impact.""A poll from NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist in early August showed Ross leading Burr 46 percent to 44 percent, though other polls have given Burr a narrow edge.Burr has been in Congress for more than 20 years and is distantly related to Aaron Burr, U.S. vice president in the early 1800s. If Burr were to lose, Democrats would be one seat closer to reclaiming a Senate majority from Republicans.
APPLE VERSUS BURR
The concerns of companies such as Apple Inc, Google and Facebook are not a key issue for North Carolina voters, but the race's outcome could affect future handling of data encryption and privacy matters.For a year, Burr has been crafting legislation that would force Apple and other companies to weaken the security of their products in a way that would give U.S. law enforcement access to encrypted devices and communications. [uL2N18L28M]The FBI has said that the growth of strong default encryption makes it more difficult for investigators to access communications of criminal suspects, even with a warrant.Silicon Valley, cyber security experts and civil liberties advocates say strong encryption is essential to ward off hackers and maintain the overall security of the Internet.The encryption debate is decades old, but it boiled over earlier this year due to a dispute between Apple and the FBI over unlocking an iPhone linked to one of the shooters in a San Bernardino, Calif., rampage in 2015.
Several U.S. tech companies and privacy groups, asking not to be named because they do not typically take public positions on candidates, told Reuters they are eager to see Burr lose.His efforts to require encryption backdoors in U.S. technology products are the main reason. While other lawmakers have been critical of Silicon Valley in the encryption debate, none has been as antagonistic as Burr, the sources said.Andrew McLaughlin, a former White House technology official who now is head of content at the publishing site Medium, tweeted in May: ""Trump's win endangers GOP Senators. America's tech community should rally to defeat Richard Burr, for his idiotic war on Internet security.""McLaughlin declined an interview request from Reuters. Burr spokeswoman Becca Glover Watkins said the senator had worked closely with California Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel on the encryption issue.
She said the two had worked on a ""number of bipartisan national security issues including their encryption proposal"" and Burr planned to continue engaging with tech companies ""on the challenges posed by encryption and cyber threats.""ROSS UNCLEAR ON ENCRYPTION
Ross, a lawyer and former state legislator, has not clarified whether she sides with Apple in its dispute with the FBI. In a statement to Reuters, she said that ""protecting our law abiding citizens' privacy doesn't mean sacrificing our security.""Tech interests, so far, have not donated sizeable amounts of money to Ross, according to a review of contributions.However, Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, in June made an unspecified donation to Ross, according to U.S. Federal Election Commission records.The political action committee that supports Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, vocal defender of encryption and frequent opponent of Burr, gave $5,000 to Ross this year. Burr's PAC later gave $5,000 to Wyden's Republican challenger in Oregon.At a national level, Apple CEO Tim Cook and other tech executives have helped raise money for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Silicon Valley has almost universally shunned Trump, troubled largely by his rhetoric on immigration and his stated desire to shut down the Internet to fight extremists.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump threatened on Wednesday to slap tariffs on Chinese products to show Beijing that the United States is ""not playing games anymore"" when it comes to leveling the field on trade.Addressing a rally in Tampa, Florida, Trump said that if he was elected in November, he would instruct the U.S. trade representative to bring cases against China both in the United States and at the World Trade Organization. Tariffs would be necessary in some cases ""because they have to understand that we're not playing games anymore,"" he added. Trump had previously pledged a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.Trump said on Wednesday that the trade deficit with China was more than $500 billion, although the figure given by the U.S. government put it at $367 billion in 2015. The United States has brought cases against China at the WTO, and U.S. officials have frequently slapped antidumping and countervailing duties on Chinese products under U.S. law based on complaints brought by U.S. producers.
""We believe that whoever wins the U.S election, future U.S. leaders will continue to adopt a basic policy of mutual cooperation with China that accords with U.S. interests and the interests of the U.S. people,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters on Thursday.
Trump, who is running behind Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in opinion polls, has pledged to return manufacturing jobs to America, although many economists believe that the ""China shock"" has long since passed.Economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere estimate that the ""China shock"" in the wake of the country's accession to the WTO cost 800,000 to 1 million jobs in the United States. By way of comparison, U.S. manufacturing has shed 5 million jobs since 2000.
