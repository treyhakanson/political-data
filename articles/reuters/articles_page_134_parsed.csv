Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign has settled a legal dispute with former aide Sam Nunberg, according to a court document filed in New York on Thursday.Trump had sought $10 million in damages from Nunberg in arbitration proceedings. Trump accused Nunberg, who was fired in 2015, of violating a confidentiality agreement.The one-page filing with a New York state court did not give the terms of the settlement.Nunberg's attorney, Andrew Miltenberg, said ""the matter was amicably resolved"" but he declined to comment further. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nunberg said in court filings in July that Trump accused him of being the source for a New York Post story in May that recounted a public argument between Corey Lewandowski, who was then the campaign manager, and Hope Hicks, Trump's spokeswoman.In the affidavit, Nunberg said the argument was part of a ""sordid and apparently illicit affair"" between the two. He denied being the source for the New York Post story.
Lewandowski was fired by the campaign in June, a move apparently unrelated to the Post story. A Trump Organization lawyer, Alan Garten, last month called Nunberg's allegations ""categorically untrue.""
The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in August 2015 after the discovery of Facebook posts that critics deemed racist. Nunberg has denied he wrote the posts. (Reporting by Eric Beech in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Trump']	[]

By Julie Steenhuysen and Toni Clarke
| CHICAGO/WASHINGTON

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has shifted $81 million in funds from other projects to continue work on developing vaccines to fight Zika in the absence of any funding from U.S. lawmakers.In a letter addressed to Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said she was allocating $34 million in funding to the National Institutes of Health and $47 million to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to work on Zika vaccines.Burwell said the funding was intended to keep Zika vaccine research going despite the lack of funding from U.S. lawmakers, who left for summer recess before allocating any funding to Zika research and preparedness.The mosquito-borne Zika virus has spread to more than 50 countries and territories since the outbreak began last year in Brazil. On Thursday, Governor Rick Scott said state health officials have identified three additional people in the affected area with locally transmitted Zika, bringing the total to 25.The Obama administration in February requested $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but congressional lawmakers have been considering a much smaller sum. A bill providing $1.1 billion was blocked by Democrats after Republicans attached language to stop abortion-provider Planned Parenthood from using that government funding for healthcare services, mainly in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico.The Republican legislation also would siphon off unused money under President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law to combat Zika. In addition, Democrats balked at a Republican provision that they said would gut clean water protections.The new bolus of funds from HHS comes on top of the $589 million in repurposed funds previously allocated for Ebola efforts. HHS has said these funds will run out at the end of August.
At a press briefing in Washington, Dr. Anthony Fauci,  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he needs $33 million to prepare to move the first potential Zika vaccine to the second phase of human clinical trials. The first phase of that testing is expected to end in late November or December.Fauci said the health secretary has the authority to transfer 1 percent of NIH's $33 billion budget per year from one Institute to the other. He said the director of the NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, will decide which existing programs the funds will be drawn from.""He will probably do it on a prorated basis across the Institutes,"" he said.
Fauci said the budget transfer will not fill the longer-term NIH funding needs to fight the virus and to develop a second or third potential vaccine candidate. Drugs frequently fail to realize the promise they show in early trials.""We still need about $196 million more,"" he said.Fauci said the health secretary's action was essentially one of desperation given the failure of Congress to authorize additional funding.Taking money from other research programs ""is extremely damaging to the biomedical research enterprise,"" he said. ""We're taking money away from cancer, diabetes, all those things.""
Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said at the briefing that local health authorities are similarly siphoning off money from other programs.""We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" he said. In her letter, Burwell said the $47 million in funding for BARDA will allow the agency to enter into contracts with key partners to develop vaccines. But, she said BARDA will need an   estimated $342 million in additional funding to continue its work with outside partners in the development of vaccines, diagnostics and pathogen inactivation technology used to protect the U.S. blood supply.

2	2	http://reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-qanda-factbox-idUSKCN10M2HP	Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm	"

Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas. The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak:How do people become infected?Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found.How do you treat Zika?There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said early in 2016 that it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots.A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine.How dangerous is it?The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years.According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years.Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257.Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2.Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue.
What are the symptoms of Zika infection?    People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito.How can Zika be contained?Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika.How widespread is the outbreak?
Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh)Africa (1): Cape Verde Americas (45): Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curacao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Cacos, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela.Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga. What is the history of the Zika virus?The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO. 
Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact?The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is ""relatively common"" and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant.The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners.But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner.A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said.CDC's expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner.British health officials reported Zika was found in a man's semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade.The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk.The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission. What other complications are associated with Zika?Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue.

4	4	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-evangelicals-idUSKCN10M2D4	Trump acknowledges tough fight in usually Republican Utah	"


By Steve Holland
| ORLANDO, Fla.

ORLANDO, Fla. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump acknowledged on Thursday that his campaign was struggling in Utah, a usually rock-solid Republican state, on a day in which he briefly set aside his self-confidence for a rare display of doubt. Trump made the comment in urging conservative Christian evangelicals to organize support for him in several key states where the Nov. 8 election is likely to be decided, such as Ohio, Florida and Virginia.The wealthy New York businessman has suffered a number of self-inflicted wounds in recent days that have given the advantage in the campaign to Democrat Hillary Clinton.""We're having a tremendous problem in Utah,"" Trump told a conference room filled with evangelical pastors, blaming a ""false narrative"" that has been built up around his candidacy. He has repeatedly blamed the news media for dishonest tactics.A SurveyUSA opinion poll conducted for the Salt Lake Tribune in June showed Clinton and Trump tied. Other polls have given Trump a lead but not the type of advantage that previous Republican nominees have enjoyed in the state.The normally confident Trump never apologizes and is loathe to admit that he might face difficulties. But in talking to the National Association of Home Builders earlier in Miami Beach, Trump admitted his past years before he became a politician could be causing him problems now.""If I had planned for it, I wouldn't have had such a rocky path,"" he said. ""I wouldn't have spoken to Howard so much.""
That was a reference to his many appearances on the ""Howard Stern Show"" radio program. He has been estimated to have appeared on the show more than two dozen times over 20 years, and the conversation frequently turned ribald. Trump, who is trailing Clinton in Virginia, a formerly Republican state that Democratic President Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012, urged evangelicals to help him in that state as well.In doing so, Trump pledged to rewrite the so-called Johnson Amendment, the 1954 change in the U.S. tax code that prohibits church leaders from using the pulpit for political purposes.
""If we get those people to vote, we're going to win in Virginia,"" he said. ""If they don't vote, it's not going to happen.""Trump also said ""we need help in Ohio,"" the state where he held his Republican National Convention last month.Ohio Governor John Kasich, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary race, has refused to endorse Trump.""We're very close in Ohio, but we need help,"" Trump said.
Trump has seen a steady stream of moderate Republicans vow not to support him, such as U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and 50 Republican national security experts signed a letter opposing him. All this is evidence of fissures in the party over the bellicose rhetoric and positions of Trump, who on Wednesday called Obama ""the founder of ISIS,"" the acronym for Islamic State, and Clinton ""the co-founder.""Trump joked that winning the White House and doing a good job as president might be his only way to salvation.""So go out and spread the words and once I get in, I will do the thing that I do very well,"" said Trump with a smile. ""I figure it's probably maybe the only way I'm going to get to heaven, so I better do a good job."" (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Ruthy Munoz and Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Thursday he believed Hillary Clinton would stick with President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee if she won the Nov. 8 presidential election.Some Republican conservatives were concerned that if Democratic presidential candidate Clinton won the White House, she would pick a more liberal judge than Obama's nominee,  Merrick Garland, for a lifetime appointment to the high court. Garland is a centrist federal appeals court judge whom a number of Republicans have praised.""I would think that she and all the people around her would say, 'Why do we need to rock the boat here? Let's get him confirmed quickly and move on to the next one, whenever that comes,'"" Reid said on a conference call with reporters.Clinton has urged the Senate to confirm Garland. Her  campaign did not immediately return a request for comment on Reid's remarks.
Senate Democrats may try to force a vote on procedural motions that, if successful, would lead to a vote on Garland before the new president takes office in January, Reid said. He invited along Republicans who want to distance themselves from their party's controversial presidential candidate, Donald Trump.""We have a couple of options and we are deciding when to do that. And if we should do that. When and if,"" Reid said.The leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, Mitch McConnell, has refused to schedule hearings on the nomination of Garland, saying the winner of the Nov. 8 presidential election should choose the Supreme Court justice. Obama nominated Garland on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13.
""The majority leader has been clear: the next president will make the nomination for this vacancy,"" Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff for McConnell, said in an email.A number of Republican senators in tough re-election fights are trying to distance themselves from their party's controversial nominee, yet they refuse to hold a vote on Garland, Reid said. 
He said those Republicans should call on McConnell to confirm Garland, not hold the Supreme Court seat for someone as ""radical and unfit"" as Trump, a New York businessman who has never held public office.""They spend a lot of time these Republicans, spending a lot of energy trying to separate themselves from Donald Trump. But as long as they're holding a Supreme Court seat open for him, they're his minions. They're his enablers,"" Reid said.

By Amanda Becker and Susan Heavey
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will release her 2015 tax returns and her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, will release the last 10 years of their tax returns within days, according to a source close to Clinton.The returns will show Clinton paid an effective tax rate of 35 percent and gave about 10 percent to charity, CNBC reported.The release comes as Republican Donald Trump is facing criticism for not releasing his tax returns - a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973.""He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns,"" Clinton said on Thursday in an economic speech in Michigan.  Clinton's campaign has already released tax returns going back to 2007. In addition, tax returns are publicly available for the eight years her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was in the White House. Prior years were released by his campaign.
Tax returns filed by the Clintons have been made public, in some form, for every year back to 1977.Trump, a New York businessman, has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. He has said he is unlikely to do so before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have blasted Trump for failing to disclose his tax rate and raised questions about what his returns say about his net worth and various business ties, particularly in Russia.    
Asked in a television interview in May what tax rate he pays, Trump replied ""It's none of your business.""The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. Besides showing sources and amounts of income, tax returns show what percentage tax rate a person ultimately pays, as well as how much they claimed in deductions and the amounts given to charities.  
Earlier this month, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to make his returns public.""I'm under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election,"" Buffett said. ""I'll bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions.""Trump has declined to do so.

WASHINGTON U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the Obama administration may announce as early as Thursday that it is shifting more money into fighting the Zika virus.""Maybe today or tomorrow,"" Pelosi told reporters in a hallway on Thursday. She did not give an amount, but said, ""I think they are going to try to do it a piece at a time, hoping that something else will happen,"" an apparent reference to the administration's request that the Republican-led Congress approve a funding bill to combat the virus.The Obama administration in February requested $1.9 billion to fight the virus, which was first detected in Brazil last year and has spread rapidly in the Americas. Before going home on summer recess, lawmakers were discussing a $1.1 billion measure, but the bill stalled amid partisan bickering.
House Democrats at a news conference urged the Republicans to reconvene Congress to address the virus. Florida is grappling with at least 21 cases of locally transmitted Zika, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million to fight the virus.But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will spend all of its remaining funds by the end of September, while two other agencies will exhaust their resources for Zika by the end of August, Representative Rosa DeLauro said.

WASHINGTON In response to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's accusation that Democrat President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton were ""co-founders"" of Islamic State, Clinton's campaign called the remarks a ""false claim."" ""This is another example of Donald Trump trash-talking the United States,"" senior policy advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement. ""What's remarkable about Trump's comments is that once again, he's echoing the talking points of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and our adversaries to attack American leaders and American interests, while failing to offer any serious plans to confront terrorism or make this country more secure.""

WASHINGTON U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said the recent cyber attack on Democratic politicians was ""broad"" and that Russians were clearly behind the breach, adding that the damage was still being investigated.""It is the Russians,"" Pelosi told reporters at a news conference, referring to the recent breach affecting the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Pelosi called the attack, made public last month, an ""electronic Watergate"" akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office that upended the Nixon presidency. ""This is a break-in.""Pelosi's comments come on the heels of a New York Times report on Thursday that the cyber attack targeting Democrats was wider than first thought, with more than 100 party officials and groups were affected.
The Democratic National Committee and U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign was also affected. Asked if she was personally targeted, Pelosi said she did not know.""We are assessing the damage,"" Pelosi told reporters, adding that she could not speak to the impact on any Democratic governors.The Obama administration has not publicly named Russia as behind the attack, but investigators have concluded the attackers were directed by the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service, and the FSB, the civilian espionage agency. Clinton has also pointed to Moscow.
Russia has denied involvement in the breach.A U.S. official familiar with the investigation said no evidence has been found so far that indicates the hackers got into Clinton's personal server or any classified systems, but their footprints suggest they ""paid special attention to accounts they thought might lead them to information of national security interest.""
The official said the hackers apparently proceeded beyond the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton campaign, and the Democrats' House of Representatives campaign committee to individual email accounts and probably other Democratic groups and individuals who emailed people using the accounts they first hacked.""The pattern fits what has come to be standard hacking practice,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation by government as well as private agencies. ""You go as far as you can, hoping you find something useful.""
