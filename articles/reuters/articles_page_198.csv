By John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton formally concluded the U.S. Democratic presidential race on Tuesday with a win in the District of Columbia primary, then turned her focus to uniting the party during a 90-minute private meeting with defeated rival Bernie Sanders.Clinton, who secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination last week, met with Sanders in a downtown Washington hotel as the sometimes bitter primary combatants searched for common ground ahead of the Nov. 8 election against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Sanders has resisted pressure to bow out and endorse Clinton in a show of party unity, choosing to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions from Clinton on his policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process.Both camps described the meeting as ""positive"" and said the two noted their shared commitment to stopping Trump and pursuing issues such as raising the minimum wage, eliminating undisclosed money in politics, making college affordable and making healthcare coverage more accessible.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said the meeting was ""a positive discussion about how best to bring more people into the political process and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation.""Also attending were Sanders' wife Jane, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the two campaign managers, Jeff Weaver for Sanders and Robby Mook for Clinton.
Sanders had promised to stay in the Democratic race until the final vote was cast in the Washington, D.C., primary, although in the past week he has stopped talking about capturing the party's nomination and instead focused on ways to advance his policy goals.He scheduled a national video address to supporters on Thursday night, telling them in an email message that ""the political revolution continues.""At a news conference before the Washington meeting, Sanders said he would also demand changes to make the Democratic nominating process more equitable, including replacing the Democratic National Committee leadership, letting independents take part in the voting and eliminating superdelegates, who are unelected and are free to support any candidate.""The time is long overdue for a fundamental transformation of the Democratic Party,"" Sanders said.
Clinton easily beat Sanders in the District of Columbia, winning 79 percent to his 21 percent in a primary that closed the more than four-month, state-by-state battle for the Democratic nomination that began on Feb. 1 in Iowa.During a visit to Capitol Hill earlier on Tuesday, Sanders told Democratic senators he would take his message of progressive values and party reform to the convention.""I'm open to that, I think we should all be open to that,"" Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois told reporters afterward. ""It's not a surprise that the American people are skeptical of all of us in political life. And we ought to step back and reassess why, and what we can do about it.""
Top Democrats have taken steps in the last week to begin rallying behind Clinton and ease Sanders out of the race without alienating his supporters. President Barack Obama endorsed Clinton on Thursday, hours after meeting with Sanders at the White House. Clinton also secured the endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leader of the party's progressive wing.Clinton already has turned her attention on the campaign trail to the race with Trump, rejecting the New York businessman's renewed calls for a ban of the entry of foreign-born Muslims into the United States after the mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, by an American man who claimed allegiance with Islamic State militants.""I have clearly said that we faced terrorist enemies who use a perverted version of Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them, and we will,"" Clinton said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. ""But I will not demonize and declare war on an entire religion.""

By Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that ""nobody wants terrorists to have firearms"" and that he was open to suggestions from experts on legislation that could address the problem, following the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.McConnell, a Republican, made his remarks amid blistering attacks by Democrats on the lack of action in Congress on legislation to prevent suspects on ""watch lists"" from purchasing guns or explosives.While there was no firm evidence of Republicans and Democrats in either the Senate or House of Representatives moving toward a compromise, there were hints they at least might be willing to talk.""Maybe we can find some middle ground. I hope so,"" said Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat.The debate in Congress over firearms was reignited on Sunday after a gunman in Orlando, Florida, armed with an assault rifle killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and injured 53 others before he was shot to death by law enforcement officers.The assailant, New York-born Omar Mateen, had been investigated by the FBI for 10 months in 2013 and 2014 over possible connections he had to foreign militant groups.Democrats are pressuring Republicans in the Senate and House to quickly bring up legislation closing a loophole that allows those on ""no fly"" watch lists to purchase weapons in the United States.
The Democrats are targeting a Justice Department appropriations bill this week, hoping to add an amendment prohibiting such gun sales. A similar effort last December failed.""There's no excuse for allowing suspected terrorists to buy guns,"" said Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid.McConnell took a swipe at the Democrats, saying: ""Our suspicion is this is basically a politically motivated effort that we're likely to see"" on the Justice Department spending bill.
The Republican leader added, however: ""We're open - nobody wants terrorists to have firearms - we're open to serious suggestions from the experts as to what we might be able to do to be helpful.""On Wednesday, senators from both parties will have an opportunity to speak directly to some experts when Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson are scheduled to brief them on the Orlando attack.The officials briefed House members on Tuesday and several House Democrats brought up the watch list issue.""There was some question about procedures going forward,"" said Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee.
But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in that chamber, told reporters that law enforcement was already being notified if people being investigated for terrorism try to buy firearms. ""If you listen, they are being notified.""Durbin said he and his colleagues might pursue other gun-related amendments as well, including tougher background checks on gun buyers, closing some gun show loopholes and possibly new limits on assault rifles like the one used in Orlando.

By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic President Barack Obama denounced Donald Trump for his proposed U.S. ban on Muslim immigrants on Tuesday, joining Hillary Clinton in portraying the Republican presidential candidate as unfit for the White House.Clearly annoyed, Obama responded to Trump's proposed suspension of immigration from countries with a ""history of terrorism"" after Sunday's killing of 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub. Obama and Clinton, the Democrat he has endorsed to succeed him in a Nov. 8 election, made nearly simultaneous speeches. The gunman was U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, whose parents immigrated from Afghanistan.Trump had criticized Obama for not using the term ""radical Islamic terrorism"" to describe Islamic State militants.""What exactly would using this label accomplish, what exactly would it change?"" Obama replied. ""Someone seriously thinks we don't know who we're fighting? ... There's no magic to the phrase 'radical Islam.' It's a political talking point. It is not a strategy.""""Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction,"" said Obama, criticizing the ""yapping"" and ""loose talk"" he said he hears from Republicans.TRUMP UNRELENTING
Obama, who canceled a joint campaign appearance with Clinton planned on Wednesday in Wisconsin due to the events in Orlando, appeared to be enjoying his role in the campaign to select his successor. He tangled with Trump in 2011, producing his birth certificate to refute Trump's claim that the president was not born in the United States.""We now have proposals from the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States to bar all Muslims from immigrating to America. We hear language that singles out immigrants and suggests entire religious communities are complicit in violence,"" Obama said. ""Where does this stop?"" 
On Tuesday, Trump was unrelenting in his criticism of Obama, saying in a statement that Obama ""claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people.""""When I am president, it will always be America first,"" said Trump. Aides said Trump, who on Monday said Obama should resign for failing to handle the threat properly, would have more to say at a rally later in Greensboro, North Carolina.The crossfire overshadowed the last Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. Clinton was to meet rival Bernie Sanders late in the day with Sanders apparently inching toward ending his candidacy.Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state, addressed supporters in Pittsburgh. The candidate said Trump's proposal bolstered her case that he was temperamentally unfit to serve as president, saying the commander in chief ""is a job that demands a calm, collected and dignified response"" to events like the Orlando massacre.Clinton said Trump seemed to suggest on Monday in a television interview that Obama might have somehow been responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, a point that Trump said he did not make.""I have to ask: Will responsible Republican leaders stand up to their presumptive nominee or will they stand by his accusation about our president?"" she said.
The biting criticism was likely to increase the discomfort among many establishment Republican leaders about Trump with little more than a month until party figures gather in Cleveland July 18-21 to formally nominate him.RYAN CRITICAL
House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican who was his party's 2012 vice presidential nominee, on Tuesday distanced himself from the proposed Muslim ban in a further sign of establishment unease with Trump's agenda.""I do not think a Muslim ban is in our country's interests,"" said Ryan, who last year criticized Trump's original proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.
Ryan and like-minded leading Republicans have struggled to reconcile their desire to unify the party before a tough fight against Clinton while at the same time separating themselves from some of the positions and rhetoric of Trump, who defeated 16 rivals to win the presidential nomination battle.U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who sources say is among the Republicans that Trump is considering for his vice presidential nominee, said he was ""discouraged"" by the way the Trump campaign was going.""It wasn't the type of speech one would expect,"" Corker said of Trump's Monday speech in New Hampshire.Trump has been resolute in demanding tighter immigration policies, and the Orlando attack has prompted him to intensify his rhetoric as he tries to win more support from Americans with deep security fears.Trump noted that Mateen's parents were born in Afghanistan. Pointing to specific incidents such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he said threats were posed by people with roots in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia.Trump on Tuesday met at Trump Tower in New York with a host of Republican governors, including Oklahoma's Mary Fallin, who a source close to the campaign said was also on Trump's short list to be his vice presidential running mate.A Republican official said others in the meeting included the governors of Mississippi, Arizona, Arkansas, Nebraska and Tennessee, as well as New Jersey's Chris Christie, a close Trump adviser and former presidential rival.Trump was celebrating his 70th birthday on Tuesday. Clinton is 68. (Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell, Amanda Becker, Susan Heavey and David Alexander in Washington and Emily Flitter in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Howard Goller)"

By Steve Holland and Ginger Gibson
| MANCHESTER, N.H./WASHINGTON

MANCHESTER, N.H./WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump on Monday placed responsibility for a mass shooting in Florida squarely at the feet of radical Muslims, who he said were entering the country amidst a flood of refugees and ""trying to take over our children.""The presumptive Republican presidential nominee drew on the country's deadliest mass shooting to sharpen his vow to ban Muslim immigrants, proposing that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is ""a proven history of terrorism.""In his national security speech, Trump said it was time to ""tell the truth about radical Islam,"" the day after 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando by a gunman, likely self-radicalized, who had sworn allegiance to the rebel group Islamic State.His comments contrasted sharply to those of Hillary Clinton, the wealthy businessman's likely Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, who urged increased intelligence gathering and more airstrikes on Islamic State territory, and cautioned against ""demonizing"" American Muslims.""If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans - women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people - then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now,"" Trump told the crowd in New Hampshire.He went on to lambaste Clinton's policies, saying they would allow ""hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East"" to enter the United States without adequate security measures.There would be ""no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of... their children,"" he said. ""Not only their children, by the way. They're trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is, and we don't know what's happening.""Trump said that, if elected, he would use the executive authority of the presidency to impose stronger controls on immigration to protect Americans from attacks, fine-tuning his earlier campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of foreign Muslims to shore up national security.""When I'm elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats,"" he said.
He noted that the parents of the Florida gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, were born in Afghanistan. Pointing to specific incidents such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Trump said threats were posed by people with roots in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia.The immigration ban, he said would last until ""we are in a position to properly screen these people coming into our country. They're pouring in, and we don't know what we're doing.""Trump's hard-line proposals on immigration have helped fuel his surge in popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered heavy condemnation from minority and human rights activists, and his political opponents - many of whom have called his rhetoric racist.Trump has rejected the criticism, and has said he is often misunderstood by the media and his opponents.
'ANTI-WOMAN, ANTI-GAY'
In her response to the Florida massacre, Clinton, warned against demonizing Muslim Americans and called for increased efforts to remove Islamic State propaganda from the internet, more air strikes in areas held by the group and better coordination with allies in the region. ""The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very strong, and we must attack it,"" she said in a speech in Cleveland.She specifically criticized three U.S. allies - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait - for allowing its citizens to fund mosques and schools that train jihadists. 
She also proposed stricter gun control laws, reiterating previous calls to prohibit people on terrorism watch lists from buying firearms. She pointed out that while the Federal Bureau of Investigation was aware of Mateen as a possible threat, he was still able to purchase a gun legally. ""It's important that we stop the terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attacks, and that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino,"" California, Clinton said, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.Trump challenged Clinton to explain why she favored letting Syrian civil war refugees into the United States. He said his policies would better protect American women, gays and lesbians, Jews and Christians. Trump's support among women and gay voters lags far behind that of Clinton.""Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American,"" said Trump. He accused her of having ties to Saudi Arabia.""Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays,"" he said in a Facebook post. ""Hillary must return all money from such countries!"" (Additional reporting by Susan Heavey and Alana Wise in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Mary Milliken)"

By Ginger Gibson and Emily Flitter
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. Republican Donald Trump said on Monday he will no longer issue press credentials to the Washington Post, stopping the publication from gaining access to press areas at his presidential campaign events.The Washington Post, based in the U.S. capital, is one the country's the most influential newspapers and has one of the largest circulations. ""They have no journalistic integrity and write falsely about Mr. Trump,"" his campaign said in a statement explaining the decision. ""Mr. Trump does not mind a bad story, but it has to be honest.""Trump's campaign repeated criticism the candidate has made of Post owner Jeff Bezos, who also owns online retailer Amazon.com.It is unusual for a presidential campaign to refuse to issue credentials to news organizations. Credentials are needed for reporters, photographers and other staff to gain access to press seating, travel with the campaign and attend media-only events, like press conferences.
""Donald Trump's decision to revoke The Washington Post's press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press,"" the newspaper's editor, Marty Baron, said in a statement.""When coverage doesn't correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished. The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along -- honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly. We're proud of our coverage, and we're going to keep at it.""
A source close to the campaign said the ban could be temporary and pointed out that Trump has already barred other new organizations, including Politico, from obtaining press credentials and then reversed course.Ben Smith, executive editor of Buzzfeed, responded that his news organization, which targets millennials, is also banned from covering official Trump events. The Huffington Post posted on Twitter that its reporters are also barred.""A candidate for the highest elected office in the land doesn't get to choose what goes in a newspaper,"" said Committee to Protect Journalist Deputy Executive Director Robert Mahoney. ""It provides a ready-made excuse for authoritarian leaders to crackdown further on independent journalists. We urge Donald Trump to reconsider and let the Washington Post do its job.""
Trump's campaign took issue with an article that appeared on The Washington Post's website earlier on Monday with the headline, ""Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting' as their headline."" The headline was changed to ""Donald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting"" within an hour after it was published.The Washington Post has assigned a team of reporters to produce a book about Trump that is scheduled to be released later this year.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Monday that if elected, she would pressure U.S. technology companies to help intelligence agencies disrupt violent plots after a gunman inspired by radical Islamist groups killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub.In a speech in Cleveland, she articulated plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers. She is campaigning against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of the November presidential election. ""We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out,"" Clinton said.""That's why I've proposed an 'intelligence surge' to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home.""While Clinton did not detail what her effort would entail, she said she wants technology companies to be more cooperative to government requests for help in countering online propaganda, tracking patterns in social media and intercepting communications.
Clinton's comments will likely further stoke an international debate over digital privacy, which has flared  after attacks in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, California.Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old Orlando shooter and a U.S. citizen, was likely inspired by jihadist content online, but there is not yet evidence that he was part of any plot directed by others outside the United States, FBI Director James Comey said Monday.Facebook (FB.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) have all dedicated more resources to combating online propaganda and recruiting by Islamic militants within the past year. But they do so quietly to avoid the perception that they are overly cozy with authorities.
The companies rely heavily on users to flag problematic content, which is impossible to eliminate completely without creating a highly censored Internet, according to technologists. Counterterrorism experts have also long said so-called lone wolf attackers are difficult to track and stop because they often do not communicate their plans to others.
Twitter and Facebook had no immediate response to questions about Clinton's comments. Google declined comment.The Center for Democracy and Technology and Electronic Frontier Foundation, both digital advocacy groups, said they were waiting for more specifics from Clinton before commenting.Unlike Trump, Clinton did not call for blocking online content. She did not reiterate her previous push for a massive effort to break encryption, and she ruled out targeted surveillance of Muslim Americans as ""dangerous.""

By James Oliphant and Luciana Lopez
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida has allowed Donald Trump to seize upon a familiar issue he has used to great advantage -the threat of Islamist militants and his plan to limit Muslim immigration to the United States, offering him what could be a crucial moment to re-boot his sputtering presidential campaign. But while rank-and-file voters might respond positively to Trump's renewed call for a ban on some Muslims entering the country, his reaction to the massacre showed few initial signs of winning over Republican foreign-policy figures who have spurned the New York mogul.""It's a missed opportunity to present a different image,"" said Peter Feaver, a top National Security Council aide in the George W. Bush White House. ""He has doubled down on policies I oppose and that aren't going to solve the problem.""Trump said in a speech Monday in New Hampshire he would suspend immigration from countries ""where there is a proven history of terrorism"" against the United States. He said radical Muslim immigrants were ""trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS (Islamic State) is.""After the worst mass murder in modern U.S. history on Sunday left 50 dead, Trump's speech was hastily refashioned from a broad critique of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to a dire warning of the threat from Islamist militants.Although Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. officials have maintained that Omar Mateen's motives were unclear and that he had no known direct links with the Syria-based group. Mateen, they said, was likely radicalized over the Internet.A week ago, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's bid was taking on water. He was being battered by fellow Republicans for his comments about the Hispanic heritage of a federal judge, and Clinton was pulling away in the polls.A renewed focus on national security could provide Trump with the chance to expand his appeal both to undecided voters and to the Republican foreign-policy establishment.While Trump at times seems to relish being at odds with the establishment, the unhappiness among the party's hawks isn't just a matter of hand-wringing. It means if Trump does reach the White House, he could have a difficult time recruiting talented, experienced advisers. 
ALARMING THE MAINSTREAM
Max Boot, an influential conservative at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Orlando tragedy ""could have provided an opening for Trump to rally Republicans against terrorism."" But instead, Boot said, Trump has been ""partisan and petty.""Boot criticized Trump for suggesting on Monday that President Barack Obama may sympathize with radicalized Muslims and for reviving the proposed Muslim ban. ""His performance has been in character,"" Boot said, ""which is to say appalling.""Trump has alarmed some mainstream Republicans with vows to shred international trade deals, his demands that Mexico pay for a border wall and his questioning of U.S. foreign policy pillars such as its security commitments to NATO and Asian allies. 
Clinton struck a very different tone in a speech on Monday, urging ""statesmanship, not partisanship"" and ""clear, rational discussion"" on how to protect the United States from terrorist threats.Eliot Cohen, a top-ranking State Department official during the Bush administration, called Trump's reaction to the shootings ""opportunistic and shallow"" and ""not what Americans expect from a president.""  Lanhee Chen, a top aide to Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential campaign, suggested Trump will not be able to refine his image. ""While it would be true in most cases a big speech like this could reset the decks, I think the challenge with Donald Trump is always who he is at his core,"" Chen said.But voters are another matter. Trump's swift rise within the Republican Party was at least partly due to the strident tone he has taken toward immigrants and refugees.
When Trump responded to last year's terror attacks in Paris and California with a call for banning Muslims from entering the country, he surged in the Reuters/Ipsos poll in the weeks that followed, opening up a 30-point lead over his Republican primary rivals. Republicans continue to be strongly supportive of Trump's approach to handling terrorism. This month, two-thirds of Republicans said they agreed with Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Overall, 42 percent of Americans said they agreed with a Muslim ban while 50 percent said they disagreed, with another 8 percent not sure, according to another Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 17 to June 6. The poll of more than 6,000 people has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 1.5 percentage points.Combating Islamist extremism was on the mind of Texas billionaire Doug Deason, a major Republican donor who told Reuters he will meet with Trump later in the week to discuss his support. Nothing Trump has said since the Orlando shooting has caused him to re-think backing him, Deason said. Peter King, a U.S. congressman from New York, said his party's foreign-policy establishment will eventually have to get on board with Trump.""As one of the two major candidates for president, he will have to get advice or consultation with top national-security people,"" King said.

7	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-security-idUSKCN0Z1021	Trump adds new twist to immigration proposals, but legal doubts persist	"


By Matt Spetalnick and David Ingram
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal for suspending immigration from parts of the world with a history of terrorism could have a legal basis, but his assertion that it be part of a broader ban on Muslim immigrants makes it constitutionally untenable, legal scholars say.The new twist in Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric came in the aftermath of a weekend shooting massacre at a Florida nightclub by the American-born son of Afghan immigrants.In a fiery speech on Monday, he expanded on his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, vowing if elected to halt immigration from any area of the world where there is a ""proven history of terrorism"" against America or its allies.He also accused the Muslim-American community of broad complicity in attacks such as the Orlando shooting, which was carried out by a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State, and threatened ""big consequences"" for those who fail to inform on their neighbors.Many legal experts said Trump's proposal for a religion-based ban would be unlikely to pass the test of U.S. constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, due process and equal protection and would likely be struck down by the courts if he tried to implement them by presidential decree.However, a ban on immigrants from certain countries has some precedent and might pass muster. Some see that new proposal as reminiscent of the congressional Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was used for years to halt the influx of Chinese laborers and has been widely considered a black mark on America's immigration record.But Trump's overall immigration plan would go beyond that, targeting not just a country or a region of the world but also a religion, something that no modern U.S. president has done. ""This is an absurd proposal to build a Fortress America and pull up the drawbridges,"" said John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the Bush administration.President Barack Obama took a veiled swipe at Trump on Tuesday, saying such ideas represented a ""dangerous"" mindset.
But U.S. presidents have wide latitude on immigration matters, and some conservative scholars said that the fate of any proposed ban would hinge on how narrowly Trump framed it.They note, for instance, that Democratic President Jimmy Carter barred Iranian nationals from entering the United States during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.""If a Trump administration cut off immigration from certain countries, rather than certain religions, it would not violate the Constitution,"" said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California Berkeley and former Justice Department official who advised the George W. Bush administration on interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects.Herman Schwartz, a law professor at American University in Washington, said if Trump stuck to his proposal for a temporary prohibition on Muslim immigrants, that raises significant constitutional questions and ""shows his shaky command of the legal facts.""
MUSLIM BAN
In Monday's speech in New Hampshire, Trump showed little sign of scaling back his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which he first laid out in December after an Islamic State-linked deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.Debate over the legality of Trump's proposals was complicated by the vagueness of his pronouncement and questions on how broadly he would extend any immigration ban if elected.While legal experts say presidents have the power to ban immigrants from specific countries, the United States does not currently ban immigration from any country. Officials do give extra scrutiny to people entering from countries such Syria and Iran.Under the broadest interpretation of Trump's pronouncement,  immigration could be barred not only from the Muslim world but from U.S.-allied countries in Europe and Asia where militant attacks have taken place. This could include India, the source of many skilled engineers for the U.S. technology sector.
Critics say this would be impractical and counterproductive.""Is Mr. Trump proposing to stop issuing visas even for business or tourism or education to nationals of certain countries?"" said Bellinger. ""Rather than increase economic growth, Mr. Trump's plan could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars.""Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump foreign policy adviser, justified the candidate's pronouncement, saying ""it is perfectly appropriate for the country to refuse admission to those whose presence may be detrimental to the national interest.""But Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, when asked whether a president has the authority to ban immigrants based on religion, said: ""I'm not sure he does.""Legal experts also raised doubts about the legality of Trump's demand that members of the American Muslim community ""cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad"" or else they will be ""brought to justice"" themselves."" Critics have accused him of anti-Muslim fear-mongering to win votes.""Generally, the idea that knowledge in and of itself comes with criminal liability is antithetical to the way we talk about criminal law in the United States,"" said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor.If Trump tried to implement such prosecutions as president, he said, potential defendants could simply invoke their constitutional right against self-incrimination and continue to remain silent.

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama will meet the Dalai Lama at the White House on Wednesday, a move certain to anger China which considers the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader a dangerous separatist.Obama and the Dalai Lama will meet privately at 10:15 a.m. (1415 GMT), a White House statement said.Earlier on Tuesday, China warned the United States to stick by its promises not to support any separatist activities.In an interview with Reuters on Monday, the Dalai Lama had said it was possible he would meet Obama and on Tuesday Taiwan announced that its new president would make a transit stop in the United States next week.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said both issues touched on the ""one China"" policy, a basic diplomatic tenet referring to both Taiwan and Tibet being part of China that Beijing insists foreign governments recognize.
Lu said the United States had said it opposed Taiwan's independence and recognized that Tibet was an inseparable part of China.""We demand the U.S. government earnestly stands by its promises, conscientiously handle the relevant issue in accordance with the one China principle and not give any space to any individual or behavior which tries to create two Chinas, one China one Taiwan, or to split China,"" he said.Obama met the Dalai Lama when the latter visited Washington in 2014 and angered China then when he vowed ""strong support"" for Tibetans' human rights.
The Dalai Lama says he wants genuine autonomy for Tibet rather than independence.He told Reuters Obama was a ""a long-time friend"" whom he admired for his work to normalize relations with Cuba, on Iran and for his recent visits to former U.S. foe Vietnam and the site of the Hiroshima atomic bombing in Japan. Asked how Beijing (Peking) might respond to a meeting, the Dalai Lama said: ""I don't know - you should ask them. I think in Peking, we cannot as of now ... generalize. In Peking there are different views. Some people there have a more realistic view. Some are more hardline, which is more narrow-minded."" 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will transit in Miami on her way to Panama, one of the island's few diplomatic allies, and stop over in Los Angeles on her return, Taiwan's deputy foreign minister, Javier Ching-shan Hou, said.China is suspicious of Tsai, who assumed office last month, as she is also head of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.Travel abroad is sensitive for Taiwanese leaders who have angered China as it is seen as exerting sovereignty. Tsai's trip will run from June 24 to July 2 and include Paraguay. (Additional reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Bill Rigby)"

A Michigan judge on Tuesday dismissed charges against a former state representative, while ruling another lawmaker should stand trial after he tried to hide their extramarital affair, according to a prosecutor's office spokeswoman.Ingham County District Judge Hugh Clarke ruled that former State Representative Todd Courser should stand trial for perjury  and one count of misconduct for his attempted cover-up of the affair with fellow lawmaker Cindy Gamrat, said Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for the Michigan attorney general's office.Prosecutors originally charged Courser with three counts of misconduct while in office and perjury, but the judge dismissed two of the misconduct charges.Clarke also dismissed the two criminal misconduct-in-office charges against Gamrat due to insufficient evidence that she knowingly lied to House investigators about an email that Courser sent to distract from their affair, Bitely said.
Prosecutors will not appeal the dismissed charges against Gamrat, but they are reviewing their options regarding the charges against Courser that were not sent to trial, Bitely said. An attorney for Courser, Matthew DePerno, maintained his client is not guilty, and said he believed there was not enough evidence to support the perjury or misconduct charge.
Courser is due back in court in late June.     A lawyer for Gamrat, Mike Nichols, said the charges against his client stem from a house investigation that arose from a political dispute.
The former legislators faced charges of misconduct related to Courser's failed attempt to cover up their affair. He had devised a plan to distribute an email falsely claiming he had sex with a male prostitute in a move meant to blunt the political impact of the actual affair if it was ever revealed, according to the Detroit News. The two former lawmakers also were charged with misconduct for allowing their employees to forge their signature on proposed legislation. (Reporting by Justin Madden; Editing by Bill Rigby)"
