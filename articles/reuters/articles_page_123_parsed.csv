By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama will dramatically expand the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii on Friday, the White House said, an action that will ban commercial fishing from more than 582,500 sq miles (1.5 million sq km) of the Pacific Ocean.Obama will visit the protected area on Sept. 1 to draw attention to the threat that climate change poses to oceans, traveling to Midway Atoll - a remote coral reef that was the site of a pivotal World War Two battle and is now known for its sea turtles, monk seals, and millions of seabirds.Obama, who was born in Hawaii and spent most of his childhood there, made curbing climate change a central part of his time in the White House, which draws to a close on Jan. 20.Some of his efforts have been blocked by Congress or held up in court challenges. But preserving public space from development has been something Obama can do using his own power, and he had moved to permanently protect more than 265 million acres of land and water even before the expansion in Hawaii.Obama has also sought to use the star power of his office to raise public concern about climate issues. Trailed by camera crews, he has hiked on an Alaska glacier and walked through the Florida Everglades.His journey to Midway Atoll, a former naval base that is now a rarely visited refuge, is aimed at sending a hopeful message.""The best science shows that the ocean can recover, if you allow it to,"" said Senator Brian Schatz, who worked with scientists, environmental groups and native Hawaiians to urge Obama to expand the monument.
""As daunting as the problem of climate change is, and as troubling as the situation is with respect to our oceans, they show remarkable resilience, if you give them a chance,"" Schatz told Reuters.The monument was first established 10 years ago by former Republican President George W. Bush, who created the world's largest marine reserve at the time, protecting close to 140,000 sq miles of ocean around the Hawaiian archipelago and inspiring a series of similar projects around the world.The four-fold boost in territory will cover an area with more than 7,000 marine species, including a coral that is the world's oldest-known living organism at 4,265 years old.
""We think of Papahanaumokuakea's original designation as a catalyst, and we're hoping it will be again,"" said Seth Horstmeyer, a director with Pew's Global Ocean Legacy project. Only about 3 percent of the world's oceans have similar protections, according to Pew.Obama is set on Wednesday to address leaders of Pacific islands and a global conference of conservation officials and environmental groups in Honolulu.""We would like the other nations to follow suit,"" said Sol Kaho'ohalahala, a seventh-generation native Hawaiian. In an interview, Kaho'ohalahala explained that Papahanaumokuakea, considered a sacred place, figures large in the creation myths of his people.""We are part of this place, we're not the beginning of this place,"" he said. ""Our responsibility is really as a people now how to care for this place.""
Some Hawaiians had argued against the expansion. Longline commercial fishermen, who have been praised for sustainable fishing, have counted on the area for an estimated 3 to 13 percent of their annual catch of tuna, which is limited under quotas and governed by extensive conservation measures.""Excluding American citizens from American waters and forcing in this case fishermen onto the high seas to do their business - something just doesn't quite sit right,"" said Sean Martin, president of the Hawaii Longline Association, explaining the expansion could raise his costs.But Hawaiian Senator Schatz, who worked on a compromise plan to accommodate certain types of fishing and more Native Hawaiian involvement in managing the preserve, said there would be plenty of fish left for longline fishermen in other areas.""They will have very little difficulty fishing up to the limit under the tuna treaty, even with the new boundaries,"" Schatz said.

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Friday the Clinton Foundation was seeking other organizations to  partner with as it looks to wind down some of its charitable work, but defended her work as secretary of state as independent from her family's foundation.Clinton has come under fire in recent days amid questions over the charity and its donors given her role heading the State Department from 2009 to early 2013. Critics have accused her of running a ""pay-for-play"" operation, a charge she and the foundation have denied. Even some supporters have said Clinton faces a perception problem over the issue. ""I know the foundation is looking for partners, but that's going to take some time to carry out,"" Clinton said in an interview on MSNBC. ""Winding down some of these programs takes time. You don't just turn on and off ... a switch. Even trying to negotiate with partner groups takes a lot of serious effort."" ""My work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces. I made policy decisions based on what I thought was right to keep Americans safe and to protect our interests abroad. I believe my aides also acted appropriately,"" she said. 
Several media editorial boards this week noted the foundation's philanthropic efforts in areas such as global health and HIV/AIDS, but urged the foundation - formally called the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation - to transfer the work to other large U.S. charities.
Former President Bill Clinton, who helped establish the global charity after serving two terms in the White House, would resign from the board if his wife wins the Nov. 8  election, the foundation announced last week. It also said it would stop accepting some foreign and corporate donations.Hillary Clinton's Republican rival for the White House, Donald Trump, and other Republicans have called for a special prosecutor to probe the charity for possible corruption, an accusation her campaign has called a groundless political smear.

A U.S. judge ordered the State Department on Thursday to release by Sept. 13 any emails it finds between Hillary Clinton and the White House from the week of the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, among the thousands of additional emails uncovered by federal investigators.The order came after the Federal Bureau of Investigation gave the department a disc earlier this month containing 14,900 emails to and from Clinton and other documents it said it had recovered that she did not return to the government.Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has been criticized for using an unauthorized private email system run from a server in the basement of her home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, a decision she says was wrong and that she regrets.The issue has hung over her campaign for the White House and raised questions among voters about her trustworthiness. Judge William Dimitrouleas of the U.S. District Court in southern Florida made his order in response to a request by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which is suing the State Department for Clinton-era records under freedom of information laws.Spokesmen for Clinton did not respond to requests for
comment.At least one other judge has said the department will eventually have to release all the newly recovered work emails, and at least some are expected to appear before the Nov. 8 presidential election.After the system's existence became more widely known, Clinton returned what she said were all her work emails to the State Department in 2014, and the department released them in batches to the public, some 30,000 in all.
The FBI took her server in 2015 after it was discovered she had sent and received classified government secrets through the system, which the government bans. Clinton has said she did not know the information was classified at the time.
After a year-long investigation, FBI Director James Comey said last month that Clinton should have recognized the sensitivity of the information and that she had been ""extremely careless"" with government secrets. But he said there were not enough grounds for a prosecution, a decision criticized by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans.It remained unclear if there were any newly discovered emails that related to the September 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed.""Using broad search terms, we have identified a number of documents potentially responsive to a Benghazi-related request,"" Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. ""At this time, we have not confirmed that the documents are, in fact, responsive. We also have not determined if they involve Secretary Clinton.""

By Amanda Becker and Steve Holland
| RENO, Nev./MANCHESTER, N.H.

RENO, Nev./MANCHESTER, N.H. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump on Thursday of fuelling America's ""radical fringe"" with racist rhetoric, even as her Republican rival sought to soften his image with an appeal to minorities.Clinton needs to retain support from black and Latino voters to win the Nov. 8 election, the same coalition that helped propel Democrat Barack Obama to the White House in 2008. Trump, whose support comes mainly from whites, is unlikely to be victorious unless he can cut into that support.""Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia,"" Clinton said in a scathing speech in Nevada. ""He's taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of America's two major political parties.""""This is a moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the Party of Lincoln has become the Party of Trump,"" Clinton said, referring to Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation and championed the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution during the Civil War that led to the abolition of slavery in 1865. Trump, who trails Clinton in national opinion polls, has polled poorly with minorities and has been criticized for his proposals on immigration, which include deporting millions of undocumented foreigners, building a wall along the Mexican border, and suspending Muslim immigration to shore up national security.He described some Mexican immigrants as ""criminals and rapists"" in a 2015 speech launching his candidacy and more recently questioned the impartiality of an American-born judge of Mexican heritage.On Thursday, the New York real estate mogul-turned-politician criticized Clinton before her speech, saying she and her party had let black Americans down with failed economic policies and were falsely labeling Republicans as bigoted. ""When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument: You're racist, you're racist, you're racist,"" Trump told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire. ""It's a tired, disgusted argument and is so totally predictable.""At a Mississippi rally on Wednesday, Trump called Clinton a ""bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings.""
'SHAME ON YOU'
He argued on Thursday that Clinton's opposition to charter schools and vouchers locked minority students in failing jobs, that her tax policies would hurt black-owned businesses and that she would allow immigrants to take jobs from minorities.Trump said the Clinton attacks were not only an assault on him, but on all his supporters - people, he said, who want strong borders and security.""To Hillary Clinton, and to her donors and advisers, pushing her to spread smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words ... shame on you.""A Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll for the week beginning Aug. 15 found Clinton beating Trump among Hispanic voters by 15 percentage points, and by 57 percentage points among black voters.    Trump has tried recently to broaden his appeal to them, hinting at a softening of his hardline position on immigration.
In comments broadcast on Fox News on Wednesday night, Trump said he would be willing to work with immigrants who have abided by U.S. laws while living in the country, backing away from his insistence during the primaries that he would try to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants. Trump also met with black and Latino Republican leaders at his headquarters in New York City on Thursday morning.  Trump's efforts were unlikely to draw out minorities in his favor but could reassure some moderate Republicans worried about his views on race, said Bernard Fraga, a political science professor at Indiana University.""I don't think these efforts will do a lot to help him in minority communities,"" Fraga said. An association of 40 Latino organizations sent a letter on Thursday calling on him to ""cease"" his rhetoric and meet with their leadership to discuss ways he could improve his outreach to Hispanics. 
""As we have expressed numerous times, your rhetoric of relentless attacks against our community is an issue of serious concern and has had a significant impact, fuelling an alarming trend in our nation,"" the letter reads. CLINTON VIDEO
Clinton released a video on Thursday ahead of her Nevada speech tying Trump to white supremacist groups. The video shows a Ku Klux Klan member praising Trump and plays a recording of former leader Klan leader David Duke calling on white people to vote for Trump. The video also shows newly appointed Trump campaign chairman Steve Bannon, who ran the website Breitbart.com, which has been accused of stoking online racists.     Bannon told the magazine Mother Jones during the Republican National Convention last month that the website was ""the platform for the alt-right,"" a brand of U.S. political conservatism associated with white nationalism.Trump's campaign called for the Clinton campaign to withdraw the video. ""This type of rhetoric and repulsive advertising is revolting and completely beyond the pale,"" Mark Burns, an African-American pastor who supports Trump, said in a statement. ""I call on Hillary Clinton to disavow this video and her campaign for this sickening act that has no place in our world.""

By Toni Clarke and Ransdell Pierson

Mylan NV said on Thursday it would reduce the out-of-pocket costs of its emergency EpiPen allergy injection for some patients amid a wave of criticism from lawmakers and the public over the product's rapidly escalating price.The list price of the drug will remain the same, but the company said it would increase the maximum copay assistance program to $300 from $100 for patients who pay for the 2-pak in cash or who are covered by a commercial health insurer.The price of EpiPen has skyrocketed to $600 from $100 since it was acquired by Mylan in 2007. Mylan also said it is doubling the eligibility for its patient assistance program, which will eliminate out-of-pocket costs for uninsured and under-insured patients and families.Government paid programs are not eligible for the copay assistance program.Ronny Gal, an analyst with Bernstein, said when all is said and done he estimates a total price reduction for EpiPen of 32 percent. The price rose 27 percent in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same quarter a year ago.""Thus we are basically rolling back the increase of the past year,"" he said. ""In all, we estimate that today's news results in a 20-25 percent hit on EpiPen revenues."" He expects that to translate into a 3-4 percent hit to Mylan's earnings per share over the next few years.He estimates the company will earn $4.77 a share in 2016 and $5.58 in 2017.Mylan is the latest company to be caught up in the growing outrage at apparently egregious drug price increases. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and Turing Pharmaceuticals have both been publicly excoriated for similar price increases.
Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has spoken out against escalating drug prices, ""welcomes the fact that Mylan is now apparently open to taking steps to lower some of the cost sharing burdens imposed on families,"" Tyrone Gayle, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement.However, he added, ""discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of EpiPens are insufficient, because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums.""Clinton's view was echoed by Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, who said Mylan's move is nothing but a public relations stunt that does nothing to help the majority of patients who need the drug.""Offering a meager discount only after widespread bipartisan criticism is exactly the same tactic used by drug companies across the industry to distract from their exorbitant price increases,"" he said in a statement. ""Nobody is buying this PR move any more.""Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, defending the price in an interview on Thursday on CNBC, said her company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving EpiPen, including making its needle invisible, since acquiring the device from German generic drugmaker Merck KGaA. 
""When we picked up this product, they (Merck) weren't spending a dollar on it,"" said Bresch, Bresch said Mylan recoups less than half of EpiPen's list price because pharmacy benefit managers, which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers, are involved, along with insurers and others.Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar said Mylan's action was a ""welcome relief"" to many who are struggling to afford the medication, but said it does not address the root of the problem of rising drug costs.Earlier this year, Clinton chastised drug companies for exorbitant pricing and unveiled a plan that she said would cut costs, making the issue not only a hot election discussion topic but potentially an issue that could have policy implications if she is elected. On Wednesday, Clinton pressed Mylan to voluntarily cut the EpiPen price, sending the company's share price lower and pushing down biotech stocks.Mylan shares fell more than 10 percent this week before rising 3.2 percent on Thursday after announcement of the discount program.
EpiPens are preloaded injections of epinephrine (adrenaline) used in case of a dangerous allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis that could cause death if untreated.Anaphylaxis can occur in as little as a couple of minutes of exposure to the allergen, which can come in the form of food such as peanuts or insects such as bees. Certain medications or latex can also cause a severe reaction.Symptoms include itching, swelling of the lips, tongue and roof of the mouth, tight chestedness and difficulty breathing. People who are susceptible to such reactions are frequently advised to carry an EpiPen, which can deliver an immediate emergency jolt of adrenaline to reverse the symptoms.     A group of lawmakers said on Wednesday they had written the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asking about its approval process for alternatives to the EpiPen.FDA spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman said in a statement the agency is reviewing the questions posed in the letter ""and will respond directly to the Congressional members."" She noted that the FDA does not have the authority to review or approve drug prices.Bresch, daughter of Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said she contacted members of Congress over the past two days and asked to meet with them to discuss what she called an ""unsustainable"" drug pricing system.She said one of the calls was to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who recently wrote a letter to Mylan asking for an explanation of big EpiPen price increases.

By David Lawder
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday that the Senate will not vote on President Barack Obama's signature Asian trade deal this year, punting it to the next president for changes and consideration.The statement appeared to dash White House hopes for a vote to approve the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement after the Nov. 8 election and before Obama leaves office in January.McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who controls the Senate's voting agenda, has previously said that chances for a TPP ""lame duck session"" vote were ""slim"" or ""bleak.""""The current agreement, the Trans-Pacific (Partnership) agreement, which has some serious flaws, will not be acted upon this year,"" McConnell told a Kentucky State Farm Bureau breakfast in Louisville.""But it will still be around. It can be massaged, changed, worked on during the next administration. So, I hope America will stay in the trade business,"" McConnell said.
The Obama administration is in the midst of a major push to promote the TPP deal, with cabinet officials holding dozens of events this month across the United States to try to build political support. Obama is expected to tout the TPP in the next two weeks at summits of the Group of 20 major economies in China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos.A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office could not immediately be reached for comment on McConnell's statement.A number of senators in recent weeks have declared their opposition to the TPP deal in its current form, including Democrat Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is now the party's vice presidential candidate alongside Hillary Clinton.
Republican Senator Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is in a tough re-election race in a state hit by manufacturing job losses, has also said he cannot support the deal.Support for the TPP deal has been stronger in farming states, where proponents argue that it would boost exports of agricultural products.
Clinton has said she would seek to renegotiate the trade deal if elected and has criticized its lack of enforceable provisions to prevent currency manipulation. Her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, has said that he will not pursue multilateral trade deals, only bilateral deals.McConnell said that he hopes the United States will continue its tradition as a trading nation since its founding, adding: ""To do that, it's going to have to be done on a bipartisan basis.""Earlier this month, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said he saw no point in bringing up the TPP deal for a vote in any ""lame duck"" session of Congress later this year because ""we don't have the votes.""

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign is focusing an effort to win over Asian American voters on three states where it believes the small but rapidly growing group could make the difference in her race against Republican Donald Trump.    The push in closely fought Nevada, Virginia and Pennsylvania follows a broader national effort by Clinton's campaign to court minorities who are critical to her chances of winning the White House in the Nov. 8 election.Asians make up less than 3.5 percent of the U.S. population, but are the fastest-growing racial group in the country, according to the U.S. Census, due largely to net migration, making them more important than ever in an election. ""Secretary Clinton understands the importance of the AAPI community and has launched a program that reflects that, reaching AAPI voters in unprecedented ways,"" said Jason Tengco, the Clinton campaign's outreach director for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). The three states were targeted because Asian voters could swing the outcome in the tight races between Trump and Clinton there. The effort will include print, digital and broadcast advertising in a handful of Asian languages and more coordination among volunteer groups representing ethnic communities within the Asian American and Pacific Islander group, according to the campaign.Among the recent hires for the effort was Philip Kim, a Los Angeles native who previously worked with Senator Tim Kaine, Clinton's running mate, as outreach director for Asian American and Pacific Islander voters in Nevada. The campaign did not say how much the three-state push would cost.    
While small, the Asian population could eclipse the margin of victory in each of the states Clinton is targeting. Asians  make up some 2.1 percent of eligible voters in Pennsylvania, 5 percent in Virginia and 9 percent in Nevada, according to APIAVote, a nonpartisan group. Polling from Reuters/Ipsos shows Clinton with a mere 1 point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, a 6 point lead in Virginia, and a 2 point lead in Nevada. GETTING ASIANS TO THE POLLS 

The challenge will be to get Asian Americans to the polls.Asian American voters have tended to lean Democrat but register to vote much less frequently than whites and blacks. Asian registration was about 56.3 percent in 2012, according to the Census, versus 73.1 percent for black voters and 71.9 percent for white voters. The number of Asian Americans voting in presidential elections rose from 2008 to 2012, according to the Census, which showed 4.3 million Asian voters in 2012 and a turnout of 47.9 percent. ""A big part of what we're doing is voter registration,"" said Xochitl Hinojosa, a Clinton spokeswoman.
Clinton's campaign has already done significant Asian outreach. It launched the ""AAPI for Hillary"" campaign to engage Asian voters in January and has done phone calling in a range of languages for months.But the campaign said the latest push was the first with state-specific programs. The Clinton campaign is considering advertisements in Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Chinese. A spokesperson for Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment about its Asian outreach. The Trump campaign has, however, recently made some efforts to appeal to black and Latino voters to undercut Clinton, including a meeting on Thursday with Latino and black Republicans in New York.Trump has had problems with minorities in the past and has  angered some with his hardline anti-immigration rhetoric. He has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers over the border, vowed to build a wall to stop them and called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to shore up U.S. national security.Clinton leads Trump by 12 percentage points nationally among likely voters, bolstered by minority support, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.
