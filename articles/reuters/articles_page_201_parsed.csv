WASHINGTON Donald Trump on Monday said the United States needs to increase its military response against Islamic State in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting over the weekend, including additional bombings.The presumptive Republican nominee, in an interview on Fox News, said that he would address acts of terrorism in his speech at 2 p.m. EDT in New Hampshire, which he had earlier planned to use to target Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump faulted the Muslim community on Monday for not reporting people like the man who carried out the Orlando gay nightclub attack, killing 49 people and wounding 53 others.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, told CNN he thought Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen was known to people in the Muslim community as someone with a potential for violence.""You will find that many people that knew him felt that he was a whack job ... (that) something like this would have happened,"" Trump told CNN in a phone interview. ""People that knew him, the ex-wife, other people. They don't report them. For some reason the Muslim community does not report people like this."" 
Trump said the United States needed better intelligence-gathering to prevent such things from happening.""We have to look at the mosques ... and we have to look at the community,"" he said. ""And believe me, the community knows the people that have the potential to blow up.""

By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama lamented the ease with which extremists can get firearms in the United States as ""crazy"" and Hillary Clinton said ""terrorists"" were using assault weapons to kill Americans, as Democrats on Monday renewed an uphill push for gun control after the Orlando massacre.The worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, in which 49 people at a gay nightclub were killed and 53 wounded, reignited a debate in Washington over what types of guns should not be easily available and what types of buyers ought to be prohibited.The No. 3 Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, and other Democrats said they would try as early as this week to get votes on a measure preventing people on ""terror watch lists"" and other ""suspected terrorists"" from buying firearms or explosives.Senate Democrats are trying to resurrect a proposal that failed to win backing in December, after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by Islamic State-inspired militants.Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, asked by a reporter whether he expected Republicans to oppose the legislation again, said: ""Except (Senator Mark) Kirk ... one out of 54 I guess is better than nothing.""Kirk was the lone Republican who voted last December with Democrats.       FBI Director James Comey said the gunman in the Florida attack, New York-born Omar Mateen, had been on a terrorism watch list while he was under FBI investigation for about a year ending in May 2014, but he was taken off when investigators found no incriminating information.The weapons Mateen brought into the packed Orlando club were purchased earlier this month.Speaking to reporters one day after the mass shooting, Obama said the United States was ""going to have to make sure that we think about the risks we are willing to take by being so lax in how we make very powerful firearms available to people in this country.""
""The fact that we make it this challenging for law enforcement ... is crazy,"" the Democratic president said.Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, weighed in during a campaign rally in Cleveland. ""If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked,"" she said to applause.In a MSNBC interview earlier, she said: ""Now that we're seeing terrorists use these assault weapons, that has to be part of the debate.""Rapid-firing ""assault"" weapons were used by gunmen in shootings over the past year in Orlando, Florida, San Bernardino, California, and Garland, Texas.
STIFF RESISTANCE IN CONGRESS 
Efforts in Congress to curb weapons proliferation have gained some steam following past mass shootings, only to die amid opposition from the National Rifle Association gun lobby. An NRA spokesman did not immediately comment on Monday on the renewed calls for gun curbs.The December 2013 killings of 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school prompted a push for expanded background checks on gun sellers and banning assault weapons.The initiative collapsed in April 2014, when the legislation failed to get enough votes in the U.S. Senate to clear a procedural hurdle.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump used Sunday's shooting as an example of why Americans needed guns, and charged that Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election, wanted to leave ""only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.""Trump declared in a speech in Manchester, New Hampshire, that he would be meeting with the NRA, which has endorsed him, ""to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.""Mateen, who was shot and killed by police who stormed the club, had been investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for saying he supported two Islamist groups, a statement he later said he made only to disturb his co-workers.He was questioned again in July 2014 for his connection to an American suicide bomber for al-Nusra, an al Qaeda offshoot, but the inquiry was dropped after the FBI found only a ""casual"" relationship between the two men. U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said additional gun curbs would restrict Americans' freedoms without necessarily preventing attacks. ""He didn't commit this terrorist act for a couple years,"" after being taken off the watch list, Johnson said on CNN. ""The enormous challenge we have, the vexing problem is, what do you do with the not-guilty-yet?""

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives erupted in shouting on Monday as lawmakers held a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Orlando mass shooting as Democrats protested the Republican-led chamber's refusal to consider tighter gun regulations.After Speaker Paul Ryan, the House's Republican leader, called for the moment of silence, Representative James Clyburn asked for recognition to ask about guns. Clyburn, the number three House Democrat, is from South Carolina, where a gunman killed nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church a year ago on Friday.Ryan ruled Clyburn out of order, and the chamber erupted with shouts of ""No Leadership,"" and chants of ""Where's the bill? Where's the bill? Where's the bill?"" from Democrats.
Several Democrats had said they would not participate in a moment of silence to mark the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, in which a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando.
They said they were frustrated that Congress does not respond to mass shootings with more than symbolic gestures.

By Dan Whitcomb
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES A former California state senator accused of taking cash bribes and gifts from a businessman and from undercover FBI agents posing as Hollywood filmmakers to steer legislation in their favor has agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud, federal prosecutors said on Monday.Ronald Calderon, 58, a Democrat indicted in February 2014 on two dozen counts of bribery, fraud, money laundering and other charges, will enter his guilty plea this week, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles said.According to the plea agreement, prosecutors have agreed not to ask for a sentence of more than 70 months, although the statutory maximum for the charge is 20 years.Calderon's attorney, Mark Geragos, could not be reached for comment. The former lawmaker's brother, former state Assemblyman Thomas Calderon, pleaded guilty last week to a federal money-laundering charge in connection with the case.
The Calderon brothers were members of a political dynasty going back several decades in California before they were ensnared in the federal investigation.""The Calderons have acknowledged their roles in a bribery scheme in which money for them and their families alone was driving legislation that would have benefited only a few individuals,"" U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said. The 2014 indictment accused Ronald Calderon of taking bribes from California hospital owner Michael Drobot to preserve a legislative loophole that allowed Drobot to defraud the state's healthcare system out of hundreds of millions of dollars.
According to the plea agreement, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Monday, Drobot hired Calderon's son while he was in college, paying him some $30,000 for three summers of work.Drobot has agreed to plead guilty to separate federal charges and is cooperating in the case, prosecutors have said.
Calderon was also charged with accepting money from undercover FBI agents, who he thought worked for an independent Hollywood movie studio, in exchange for supporting an expansion of film tax credits in California.According to the plea agreement, Calderon had the undercover agent hire his daughter for $3,000 a month, make a $5,000 payment toward his son's  tuition, pay for $12,000 in Las Vegas trips and give $25,000 to a nonprofit group the lawmaker and his brother used to pay themselves.In exchange, Calderon agreed to vote for the film tax legislation and hire the undercover agent's purported girlfriend for his staff, according to the plea agreement.

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON A Republican-controlled oversight committee in the U.S. House of Representatives announced on Monday that it will consider a measure censuring the head of the Internal Revenue Service on allegations related to scrutiny of conservative groups.IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who is already facing a Republican-led impeachment effort, would be condemned for conduct inconsistent with ""trust and confidence"" under a measure due to come before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday.Republicans, including the committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, allege that Koskinen failed to comply with a House subpoena as lawmakers sought evidence that the agency targeted Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny. IRS actions came to light in early 2013, months before Koskinen arrived at the agency. 
IRS officials had no immediate comment. Koskinen has denied any wrongdoing.Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the oversight committee's top Democrat, accused Republicans of leap-frogging over the House Judiciary Committee, which is holding its own hearings to determine whether Koskinen committed any wrongdoing.
Cummings said government investigators have found no evidence that the IRS targeted conservative groups or that Koskinen obstructed the House investigation.The proposed censure legislation urges Koskinen's removal from office and would require him to forfeit his pension and other federal benefits. Committee approval would send it to the floor for a vote by the full House. 
Legal experts say a congressional censure would not pass constitutional muster if it imposed any penalty.   (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	['Chaffetz', 'Cummings']	[]

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who announced his retirement from the Senate after ending his Republican presidential bid in March, said on Monday he would reconsider his future after being urged to seek re-election in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre.  The Florida Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview that the worst mass shooting in U.S. history ""most certainly has impacted my thinking in general, at least, about a lot of things."" But Rubio said he has not considered the rampage from a political perspective.""When it visits your home state, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,"" Rubio said.""My family and I will be praying about all this and we'll see what I need to do next with my life in regards to how I can best serve.""  
Hewitt urged Rubio to remain in the Senate, describing the lawmaker who sits on the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees as one of the ""very few people"" who know the security issues raised by Sunday's rampage.News of the interview brought an attack on Rubio's voting record from Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who referred to the Republican repeatedly as ""the junior senator"" from Florida. ""How can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives?"" Reid asked on the floor of the Senate. ""That is how he voted. The junior senator voted against every gun safety measure.""
Rubio, who is also seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for Republican Donald Trump, announced that he would retire from the Senate and take a break from politics after losing Florida's presidential primary in March to Trump.Before Sunday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others had urged him to seek re-election, citing polling data that showed he would win re-election and help Republicans retain their Senate majority.
Rubio has backed his friend and fellow Republican, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera, in Florida's August primary contest for his Senate seat.   If he were to run for re-election, Rubio would have to decide by a June 24 filing deadline.

By Richard Cowan

Leading U.S. Senate Democrats on Monday urged quick passage of legislation defeated last year to impose additional gun controls in the wake of the weekend mass shooting in Florida.Four Democratic senators, led by Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, called for immediate passage of a bill preventing people on ""terror watch lists"" and other ""suspected terrorists"" from buying firearms or explosives.Last December, Democrats attempted to pass this legislation but were blocked by Republicans, who said the government could mistakenly place innocent people on watch lists.
The new push for legislation came after a man with an assault rifle entered a gay nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. The gunman subsequently was killed by law enforcement officers.Federal agents had interviewed the gunman twice in recent years.
Joining Schumer in calling for passage of the legislation are Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, Bill Nelson of Florida and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.Meanwhile, Democratic President Barack Obama on Monday blamed weak gun laws for allowing disturbed individuals to gain access to powerful weapons.
Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic candidate to replace Obama in the White House, said people on watch lists should be barred from buying guns and said there should be a debate about possible restrictions on assault weapons.Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, took a different approach, repeating his call for temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country.The Orlando gunman was born in the United States. His parents were Afghan immigrants."	['Blumenthal', 'Feinstein', 'Schumer', 'Nelson', 'Obama']	['guns', 'gay']
