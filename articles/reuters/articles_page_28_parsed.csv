By William Maclean
| DUBAI

DUBAI The future leader of the Middle East's top foreign ally is, in the words of a Saudi prince, an anti-Muslim ""disgrace"", openly disdainful of Arab security partnerships, who believes Saudi Arabia would cease to exist for long without the United States.Donald Trump's presidential election victory means he is the man Washington's Arab allies must deal with after his January inauguration, as they seek U.S. help to end wars from Syria to Mosul, manage humanitarian crises and provide jobs for their populations at a time of low oil prices.Trump's campaign tirades against Muslim migrants - the target of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's comments on Twitter - and against Arab allies who don't ""pay"" for U.S. support suggest the relationship could be delicate.How far Trump the president will differ from Trump the polarizing election candidate is not clear.Brief, congratulatory messages flowed quickly from Arab allies, including one from Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, who wished Trump success in ""achieving security and stability in the Middle East and the wider world"".But underneath the protocol, for many Arab rulers and royals Trump's victory is a source of anxiety. They now face a new America led by Trump who, they fear, could upend a regional order that has prevailed for decades.Some ordinary Arabs like Trump's no-nonsense style, and praise what they see as his capacity for tough leadership.""A strong leader ... that is what is needed here in the Middle East and all across the world,"" said Ali al-Muhannadi, 57, a Qatari owner of an electrical company, filling his car up at a petrol station in Doha on Wednesday.Muhannadi saw Trump as a useful ally in confronting the jihadist threat, saying he is ""very frank and not like a politician. Islamist radicals are bad for the West and for us too"".But privately there are concerns about a lack of clarity in Trump's policies for the world's most combustible region as it struggles to break free from war while trying to safeguard the free flow of its oil exports.DISAFFECTED ARAB YOUTH

In particular there are worries that Trump's hostile rhetoric towards Muslim migrants will play into the hands of Islamic State and al Qaeda, which are eager to recruit disaffected young Arabs to wage war on the regional governments they despise as stooges of Washington.Gulf Arab leaders want a U.S. president who understands their concerns after eight years of what they regard as diffidence under President Barack Obama, someone who did not provide the kind of personal contact they value.In particular they want help to push back against Iran, their main rival. But they fear Trump's public praise for Vladimir Putin will encourage Russia to expand its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran and an enemy of most Gulf Arab states.Apart from a commitment to Israel's security, a constant in U.S. foreign policy, and an isolationist tone to his comments, much in Trump's statements about the region remains vague and poorly thought out, diplomats and analysts say.Opinion is divided about whether Trump's remarks on the campaign trail will be enacted when in office. Among these is his comment that he would consider halting U.S. purchases of Saudi oil unless Riyadh provides troops to fight Islamic State.Faisal Al Yafai, a commentator at The National newspaper, said many people thought Trump had used his extravagant comments to win votes and once in office he would mellow.""I am unconvinced. I think he actually believes his rhetoric. It's quite worrying that he doesn't seem to understand how global politics works,"" he said. ""For example you don't go around saying 'if our allies were threatened we wouldn't intervene, why can't they build their own nuclear weapons?'"" 
""That sort of stuff doesn't help confidence. That collapse of confidence between the U.S. and its allies has a knock-on impact on the economies and in the decisions those countries take on a political level.""Yafai, whose newspaper is based in the United Arab Emirates, noted Iraqis were putting their lives on the line to regain  Mosul, Islamic State's main stronghold in the country. ""That is not just a war for the region, it is a war for the world,"" he said.Others are more sanguine.A senior Turkish official predicted continued strong relations with the United States and argued that ""comments in an election period always have a harder and more hawkish tone than is necessary. But they remain peculiar to the election period.""SAUDIS ""READY TO TAKE A RISK""

Prince Sultan bin Khaled al Faisal, a former Saudi special forces officer and now senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, said that in U.S. elections ""what they say and what they do are two totally different things"". ""Foreign policy is not made by one man,"" he said. ""But it's difficult to pinpoint what his policy actually is.""Trump's remarks have been combative, and eye-catching. He has said the United States should be reimbursed by the countries it provides protection for.Without America, ""Saudi Arabia wouldn't exist for very long,"" Trump told the New York Times in March.Trump's win drew a cautious welcome in Syria, which has entered its fifth year of war between rebels and Assad's forces.In Damascus, Syrian member of parliament Sherif Shehada said U.S. policy could shift Assad's way. ""We must be optimistic, but cautiously optimistic,"" Shehada told Reuters by telephone.Trump's statements on Syria, and his more open-minded stance towards Assad's ally Russia, have fueled rebel concern about the policy he may adopt on the conflict, in which the Russian air force has been bombing insurgents. But beyond all that, many officials and observers see another ominous consequence.Trump's win has not only delighted Western right-wingers but also jihadists who told supporters the election had revealed the true position of the United States towards Muslims.""The masks have slipped,"" one supporter said on Islamic State websites. ""(Trump's) moronic declarations alone serve us even if his decisions will be under the supervision of the Senate...,"" wrote another.

| MOSCOW

MOSCOW Russia is ready to do its part to fully restore ties with Washington following the election of businessman Donald Trump as the next U.S. President, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.Trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored rival Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's presidential election, ending eight years of Democratic rule and sending the United States on a new, uncertain path.Among those uncertainties will be the Trump administration's future relations with Russia. Ties between Washington and Moscow have become increasingly strained over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of Russian cyber attacks featured in the U.S. election campaign.
""We heard the campaign statements of the future U.S. presidential candidate about the restoration of relations between Russia and the United States,"" Putin said on Wednesday at a ceremony to receive credentials from new foreign ambassadors.""It is not an easy path, but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return Russian and American relations to a stable path of development,"" he added.
""This would be good for both the Russian and American people and have a positive impact on the climate of world affairs.""Trump is widely viewed as friendly to the Kremlin and Putin has said previously his future counterpart is a talented and colorful character.
The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday Russia hoped coordination with the United States over the war in Syria, where the two countries back opposing sides, would improve under the new U.S. president.

By Dave Graham
| MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY Mexico was pitched into deep uncertainty by Donald Trump's U.S. election victory on Tuesday after a bitterly divisive campaign, raising the prospect of major clashes over trade, immigration and security.The peso currency suffered its biggest fall in 22 years on fears Trump will stick to a campaign pledge to rewrite or dump a free trade treaty he says is loaded in Mexico's favor. Investors worry a trade fight could tip Mexico's economy into recession.The Republican candidate has threatened to deport millions of undocumented Mexican migrants, many of whom he described as rapists and drug runners, and to keep others out by building a massive border wall he says Mexico will pay for.Watching in homes and bars around the country as the New York real estate tycoon extended his lead over Democrat Hillary Clinton in one U.S. state after another, many Mexicans were gripped by disbelief and fear.""We have to start saving for that wall,"" said Rafael Garnica, a 29-year-old Mexico City technology entrepreneur. ""It's not just Trump that frightens me, it's that he represents a huge amount of people in the United States.""On Twitter, some Mexicans urged their government to seek dialogue with Trump, while others said they feared a rupture of ties with the United States.""Trump's victory is the antithesis of the fall of the Berlin Wall,"" tweeted Fernando Belaunzaran, a politician for the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution. Trump's victory coincided with the anniversary of the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.Trump has proposed blocking billions of dollars in remittances sent home by Mexicans working in the United States to make Mexico pay for his border wall.Pena Nieto, who likened Trump's rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, has dismissed the idea out of hand and his foreign minister reiterated on Wednesday the country had no intention of paying.On the campaign trail, Trump relentlessly attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, Canada and the United States as the ""worst deal ever"", vowing to scrap it if he cannot renegotiate it.NAFTA has been a cornerstone of Mexican economic policy since it took effect in 1994.
Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said in a news conference on Wednesday that uncertainty and volatility had increased since Trump's win, but that there was no immediate impact on trade rules between the two countries.Some business leaders say the U.S and Mexican economies are now so closely integrated it is impossible to take steps against one without damaging the other.""We will be facing months of volatility and uncertainty while the new government in Washington takes office and we see whether Mr. Trump is able to make good on his unfortunate campaign promises and rhetoric,"" said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister.Mexican officials hope to diversify export markets to try to reduce the country's dependence on U.S. consumers, and Pena Nieto has said he would work with the winner of the election.He was pilloried at home for inviting Trump to Mexico in late August in an effort to create some leverage for his government in case the businessman won.Trump softened his tone on the brief stopover he made to meet Pena Nieto, telling a news conference it was important to keep manufacturing in North America and describing Mexican-Americans as ""spectacular, hard-working people.""
But within hours of his departure, he and Pena Nieto got into a Twitter feud over who would pay for the wall.After Trump's victory, Pena Nieto said on Twitter he was ready to work with him, calling the neighboring countries friends who ""should continue to work together for the competitiveness and development of North America"".COOPERATION FEARS
Under NAFTA, four out of every five dollars made by Mexican exporters has come from the United States, and bilateral trade is now worth about half a trillion dollars annually.Trump has threatened to levy tariffs of up to 35 percent on Mexican-made goods, sparking fears of a massive hit to trade, especially in Mexico's northern border regions.
The U.S. president has the power to rescind NAFTA but policymakers on both sides of the border consulted by Reuters said Trump would come under heavy pressure from Congress and business leaders not to wreck trade.Some Mexicans whose livelihoods are linked to the trade ties between the two countries also expressed hope that Trump's bark would be worse than his bite.""We'll have to see, because there's no certainty that he's going to do everything that his campaign has been saying,"" said Jonathan Bolanos, night receptionist at the Hotel Fiesta Inn, based in an industrial park in the border city of Nogales. ""It's true he was very aggressive, very tough, but sometimes people have to act that way to reach positions requiring charisma.""Still, Mexican officials say Trump's hard line on trade blurs with his radical stance on immigration.""Trump's wall isn't just a message to Mexico about migrants. It's about imports too,"" said a senior Mexican government security official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Friction over trade could put bilateral cooperation over security, the fight against drug trafficking and curbing illegal migration under strain, which U.S. and Mexican officials say has improved steadily under Pena Nieto and President Barack Obama.Mexico's ambassador to Washington, Carlos Sada, said at an event in Los Angeles last month that Trump had dealt a blow to the United States' image south of the border and stirred up historic resentment.Alongside him, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, joked about how Trump's campaign had also made life difficult for U.S. diplomats south of the border.""I thought about just hiding until November 9th,"" she said.    ""The overwhelming, universal reaction to the Trump visit itself, and even to a lot in the election campaign, has been 'What the ... fff ... you know?'""""But the more concerning response, the much deeper response has been: 'We're afraid it won't go back to normal after this.'""

MEXICO CITY Mexico's foreign minister said on Wednesday the country's government would not pay for a wall along the U.S. border promised by president-elect Donald Trump.""Paying for a wall is not part of our vision,"" foreign minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu told local television.As part of his campaign, Trump vowed that he would build a massive border wall and make Mexico pay for it.
Ruiz Massieu said that the government had maintained communication with Trump's campaign team ever since his visit to Mexico in August.
""There has been a fluid, daily communication with different members of the campaign,"" she said.

PRAGUE Czech President Milos Zeman declared on Wednesday he was ""very happy"" with Donald Trump's election victory, saying he cut through political correctness and addressed key issues like migration.Zeman, who is head of the NATO and European Union member state but does not steer day-to-day policies, endorsed Trump in September.""I would like to cordially congratulate Donald Trump. I had, as one of few European politicians, declared public support for this candidate... because I agree with his opinions on migration as well as the fight against Islamic terrorism,"" Zeman told reporters in a rare press briefing at the Prague Castle.Zeman's reaction chimed with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban but contrasted with shock in many European capitals.
Unlike the current Czech center-left administration, Zeman shares Trump's warm relations toward Russian leader Vladimir Putin and opposition to liberal and academic elites.""I appreciate Donald Trump's public demeanor, he speaks clearly, sometimes roughly, but understandably, and avoids what is sometimes called political correctness,"" Zeman said.
He said the election showed American voters' resistance to manipulation by the media, another frequent target of both Trump and Zeman.The Czech president said he had sent congratulations to Trump and invited him to visit the Czech Republic, the birthplace of Trump's ex-wife Ivana.
Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said Trump had won on ""aggressive populism"" but added he believed the United States would remain a reliable partner and ally. (Reporting by Jan Lopatka)"	['Trump']	[]

By Joseph Ax
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Voters rendered a split decision on gun control measures in the election, approving universal background checks for private firearms sales in Nevada while narrowly rejecting them in Maine.Gun safety advocates had poured millions of dollars into backing the initiatives in an effort to combat the political might of the gun lobby's National Rifle Association.The measure was defeated in Maine by 51.0 percent of votes to 48.9 percent, or about 12,700 ballots, the Bangor Daily News reported. Nevada voters approved a similar proposal by 50.5 percent to 49.6 percent, state election officials said.Both ballot initiatives were backed by Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group founded by billionaire former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and polls had suggested the measures would pass. The votes were seen as a crucial test of the gun safety campaign's decision to adopt a state-by-state strategy after efforts to pass legislation failed in Congress.
Gun control supporters won victories in two other states. Washington state voters easily approved a measure giving judges the power to keep dangerous individuals, such as accused domestic abusers, from possessing guns. In California, residents backed a referendum that bans large-capacity ammunition magazines and requires some people to undergo background checks in order to buy ammunition.The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, and gun rights advocates fiercely contest any attempt to restrict it.
Opponents had said the background check laws were not clear and would do nothing to stop criminals.""We know today that the place where criminals are getting guns, the black market, they aren't subjecting themselves to background checks,"" said Ryan Hamilton, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association-backed opposition in Nevada, before Election Day. ""It doesn't target criminal behavior, it targets law-abiding behavior.""Proponents, however, said background checks would save lives.
Jennifer Crowe, a spokeswoman for the pro-initiative campaign in Nevada, previously told Reuters nearly one in 11 people in that state who purchased guns online would have failed a background check.Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group founded by billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, spent tens of millions of dollars in Washington state, Nevada and Maine, while the National Rifle Association focused much of its spending on supporting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

| JAKARTA/ISLAMABAD/CAIRO

JAKARTA/ISLAMABAD/CAIRO Many Muslims around the world expressed dismay on Wednesday at Donald Trump's election as U.S. president, saying they feared it might raise tensions between the West and Islam and contribute to radicalization.While Egypt's president made an early congratulatory call to Trump, ordinary Muslims were worried that his victory would be a propaganda gift to jihadist groups. Others were apprehensive that the president-elect will implement campaign pledges to clamp down on Muslims entering the United States.""Trump has espoused highly inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims. Voters there will expect him to fulfill his promises. That makes me worry about the impact on Muslims in the U.S. and in the rest of the world,"" said Yenny Wahid, a prominent mainstream Muslim figure in Indonesia.     The world's 1.6 billion Muslims follow a multitude of sects and schools of thought, constitute a majority of the population in countries as varied as Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Albania, and hold a vast array of political views.Yet Trump's previous comments about Muslims, that those from abroad should be barred entry or intensely scrutinized beforehand, and the presence of vocal anti-Islam activists among his supporters, has alarmed many.During a bitter election campaign, Trump also attacked his opponents for what he characterized as their denial about the threat posed by militant Islam, which he said was ""coming to our shores"", adding that he would quickly form a commission on it.Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was the first world leader to congratulate Trump on the phone, Sisi's office said.Many other Egyptians also welcomed his victory, saying his opponent Hillary Clinton's record in office had won her few friends in the most populous Arab country.Clinton, Secretary of State during the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, is unpopular with many Egyptians. Many of those who backed the revolt saw her as a long-standing supporter of Hosni Mubarak, the autocrat they toppled from power.But elsewhere, other Muslims saw Trump as a hostile figure.
""Whatever happens to America affects everybody and with all these promises of doom by Trump to the blacks, to the Muslims, the minority, so it's not something we're happy about,"" said Ganiu Olukanga, a Muslim resident of the Nigerian capital Lagos.             Some Muslims, including Wahid, said they feared his election as president might encourage a view that the United States held enmity for Muslims and that this would hinder efforts in Islam to counter radicalization. ""Trump's victory will be an enormous gift to a failing jihadist movement, that will have now have a renewed rallying cry,"" said Ammar Rashid, an academic and member of Pakistan's Awami Workers Party on Twitter. ""If jihadi ideology has a source of sustenance, it is the image of the US as the evil anti-Muslim crusader. They will milk Trump's win dry,"" he added. In jihadist social media forums, militants said Trump's election had merely revealed the true position of the United States toward Muslims. ""The masks have slipped,"" one wrote. 
But some other Muslims were more hopeful, including Umer Daudzai, former Afghan minister of interior, citing the record of Ronald Reagan who was U.S. president from 1981-89. ""Ronald Reagan ended the Cold War. I hope Donald Trump will end all wars and become hero of peace in the world,"" he told Reuters. ""NEGATIVE, CYNICAL""
Among some officials, there were also expressions of concern but the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the body that represents Muslim states, issued no statement early on Wednesday. In Indonesia, the most populous Muslim nation, an official from the faith's top clerical body there said Trump's election could create new tension between the United States and the Islamic world. 
    Trump had made ""negative, cynical"" comments about Muslims in the past, Din Syamsuddin, a senior official at the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), told reporters in Jakarta. ""He had forgotten that many Americans are immigrants.""    Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally that is both birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest places, issued a statement that it had congratulated Trump on his election win without making further comment. However, Awad al-Qirni, one of its most popular clerics with a Twitter following of two million, said in a social media post after the election - but without referring to Trump directly - that ""America declines into collapse"" and that ""its internal crisis will grow severely"". In Pakistan, Sherry Rehman, a senator and former ambassador to Washington, said Trump's proposal last year to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. had disturbed many. ""Pakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever America elects but his anti-Muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday. And in Bangladesh, a government official who asked not to be named said: ""I can't think what awaits us. Donald Trump was talking about fighting against Muslims. Are we going to see more wars?""Among private citizens in Dhaka, some said they hoped the pressure of office would temper Trump's views. ""It is just unbelievable and I am a bit tense. I hope there will be a difference between Donald Trump and President Donald Trump. President Trump will be more mature than individual Trump,"" Asif Iqbal, a private sector employee, said.

By Sharon Bernstein and Steve Gorman
| SACRAMENTO, Calif./LOS ANGELES

SACRAMENTO, Calif./LOS ANGELES A ballot measure to make recreational marijuana legal for adults was approved in California, opening the most populous U.S. state to a burgeoning commercial cannabis market in a major victory for supporters of liberalized drug laws.Proposition 64 passed easily as statewide returns from the election showed nearly 56 percent of voters favoring the measure and 44 percent opposed, according to results on Wednesday morning reported from more than 90 percent of precincts.California was by far the largest of five states with ballot measures seeking to legalize the use of marijuana for the sheer pleasure of its intoxicating effects, and approval there extends legalization to the entire U.S. Pacific Coast.Recreational marijuana was first approved in 2012 by Washington state and Colorado, and later by voters in Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia.Victory also was declared on Tuesday by supporters of a similar measure in Massachusetts, giving legalized recreational pot its first toehold in New England. Nevada voters also backed legalization for recreational purposes, but neighboring Arizona rejected a similar proposal. In the fifth state, Maine, the result was too close to call on Wednesday morning.The Marijuana Policy Project, the nation's leading organization supporting liberalization of cannabis laws, likewise projected passage of measures permitting medical use of marijuana in Florida, Arkansas, North Dakota and Montana.Before Tuesday, 25 states had already legalized cannabis in some way, whether for medical or recreational uses, or both. [here]
Approval in California alone, home to 39 million people, means that almost a fifth of all Americans live in states where recreational marijuana is legal, according to U.S. Census figures. California was the first U.S. state to legalize medical marijuana, doing so in 1996. 'BEING LIKE BEER'

The new measure, spearheaded by a coalition of supporters that included Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom and billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Sean Parker, allows adults to possess and use up to an ounce of pot for private, recreational use. It also permits personal cultivation of as many as six cannabis plants. Moreover, it would establish a system to license, regulate and tax sales of marijuana, while allowing city governments to exercise local control over commercial distribution within their borders.California voters defeated a similar initiative in 2010, but public opinion polls show attitudes have since shifted.Opponents of liberalized marijuana laws have argued that such measures carry major public safety risks and would make pot more accessible to youngsters.
Experts say the latest initiatives include more sophisticated regulatory mechanisms aimed at keeping cannabis away from children and banning the involvement of criminal gangs and drug cartels.They also point to the potential for hundreds of millions in additional state tax revenue from pot sales and billions in economic activity. Investors new to the sector said they are eager for a piece of a recreational marijuana market that by some estimates will reach $50 billion over the next decade.""It's changed in the minds of these voters from being like cocaine to being like beer,"" said University of Southern California political scientist John Matsusaka.Civil rights groups have also embraced legalization, arguing that current marijuana laws have led to a disproportionate number of minorities being incarcerated for minor drug offenses.
