WASHINGTON Election officials in three Pennsylvania counties said they believed no ballots had been wrongly counted as a result of computer malfunctions, despite reports on Tuesday that touch-screen voting machines in the state were switching votes.Officials in Cumberland, Perry and Butler Counties in Pennsylvania told Reuters that they had no reason to believe the mistakes were affecting voters from one party more than the other, and that voters were catching the mistakes on ""review screens"" before their ballots were cast.

LISBON Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said on Tuesday the group's publication of material linked to Hillary Clinton was not based on any desire to influence the U.S. election.""In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself,"" Assange said in a statement released by his legal adviser at the Web Summit, a tech conference in Lisbon.""This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election.""WikiLeaks has in the past few months published thousands of emails hacked from John Podesta, Democrat candidate Clinton's campaign manager. Assange said Wikileaks had obtained no inside information about Republican candidate Donald Trump.
""We cannot publish what we do not have,"" he said.""We are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us,"" Assange said.
""No-one disputes the public importance of these publications,"" he added.""It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election.""Assange said WikiLeaks would continue to publish sensitive information regardless of who wins the U.S. election.
""The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers,"" he said.Assange has been living in Ecuador's London embassy since mid-2012. A few weeks ago Ecuador's government acknowledged it had restricted his Internet access, arousing speculation it had been pressured by the United States because of the Clinton material.

In addition to picking the next U.S. president on Tuesday, voters in four states will decide on ballot initiatives related to energy and the environment.The results of the initiatives could offer a gauge of Americans' feelings about managing carbon dioxide emissions, regulating solar power, and handling local opposition to hydraulic fracturing.Here are descriptions of the various initiatives:WASHINGTON STATE CARBON TAX
Washington state voters will decide whether to adopt a measure to create the country's first carbon tax. Initiative 732 would slap a $15 price tag on a ton of carbon for utilities and refiners in 2017, with the price rising gradually each year until it reaches $100. The tax would be revenue neutral: money raised would replace old revenue from sales and business taxes.Supporters say the tax would bring down emissions without burdening state residents. But the measure has brought together unlikely allies from industry groups who say it would hurt businesses' bottom lines and environmental organizations like the Sierra Club who say it does not create new revenue to invest in clean energy and mass transit. Other groups argue it could hurt lower-income communities.FLORIDA SOLAR

Florida's electric utilities have sponsored a measure that could affect how the state regulates private use of solar energy. A confusingly worded Amendment 1 would alter the state's constitution to protect the right to own or lease solar equipment, while also ensuring that electricity consumers who do not use solar energy ""are not required to subsidize the costs of back-up power and electric grid access to those who do.""Supporters say it enshrines the rights of solar users, but opponents say it is a sneaky way of letting the state block 'net metering,' in which a solar user can sell unused energy on the grid at market value. Floridians for Solar Choice say the measure would ""choke off"" the state's nascent rooftop solar industry.COLORADO FRACKING 

Colorado voters will vote on a measure that would make it harder to change the state's constitution by requiring broad support across all state districts for signatories to petitions and a higher percentage threshold  to be approved. Opponents of hydraulic fracturing, an oil and gas drilling technique they say causes water pollution, claim Amendment 71 would make it harder for local communities to block fracking projects.The amendment was written and funded by oil and gas industry groups but does not directly address the controversial practice. Colorado is one of several U.S. states that has seen a surge in fracking in recent years. Scores of towns across the country, including several in Colorado, have tried to ban it.
NEVADA'S ENERGY CHOICE INITIATIVE
Nevada voters will decide whether to open up the state's energy market to competition by giving consumers the option to decide where they buy their power.The measure comes after state regulators last year approved a rate increase for customers with rooftop solar panels, causing solar companies to lay off workers. Currently, Nevada law allows investor-owned utility companies to be monopolies in their service territories.Supported by environmentalists as well as electric carmaker Tesla, MGM Resorts and other companies, the measure would let consumers choose an energy provider and sell the solar electricity they generate themselves. Big companies that want to leave the grid can do so by paying hefty penalties to state regulators.If passed, the measure would direct the Nevada Legislature to pass legislation to create an open, competitive electricity market by mid-2023.

By Luke Baker
| JERUSALEM

JERUSALEM Most of the world follows U.S. presidential elections closely, but Israel can seem particularly obsessive, endlessly assessing which candidate will better protect its interests and breaking down their every comment for policy clues.As America votes on Tuesday, a cartoon in the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz captured a sense of that fretfulness, depicting friends sitting outside a typical falafel stand and discussing in nerdy detail how the ballot will turn out. ""There's no way he'd lose Utah and Arizona, and you can't count on North Carolina,"" one says to the other. ""They'd need to win Pennsylvania and hopefully Florida,"" the other replies.The fact is, despite all the nervous introspection, both Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump are likely to be reliable for Israel, continuing the broad policy mix U.S. presidents have pursued since the 1980s. It's the Palestinians who may have more to worry about.Over the past four years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had a fractious relationship with Barack Obama, openly campaigning against the U.S. deal on Iran's nuclear program, including condemning it in a speech to Congress.But ultimately that did not stand in the way of the Obama administration's agreeing a new, $38 billion, 10-year military aid package for Israel. And while the U.S. president has criticized Israel for building more settlements on land the Palestinians seek for their own state, the censure has never gone beyond words, essentially leaving Israel free to build.
Analysts say that standoff-ish approach is likely to continue whether Clinton or Trump becomes president, and there are other reasons for Israel to expect a warmer embrace from the next administration than it has had from Obama.Netanyahu has been careful not to show favoritism, meeting both candidates and saying much the same thing afterwards.Clinton, a former New York senator and U.S. secretary of state, has repeatedly emphasized that she will protect Israel's interests. Trump has said he will move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a popular line that would all but enshrine Jerusalem as the country's capital.
""We enjoy and appreciate the strong bipartisan support we get,"" said Lior Weintraub, vice-president of The Israel Project, a pro-Israel lobby group, and a former chief of staff at the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC.""We believe either president will continue the tradition of the many presidents from both sides of the aisle of fostering the alliance on every front, from security to culture.""While polls show most Israelis favor Clinton, Trump has a hard-core following among some national-religious Israelis, many of whom are originally from the United States.When it comes to policy, Israeli analysts see Clinton as having a better handle on the issues, and the people who are likely to handle the Middle East if she is elected are more familiar faces than those in Trump's circle. 
The question is what it may mean for the Palestinians. With deep internal divisions and little prospect of a resumption of peace talks with Israel, Palestinian observers believe neither candidate has their best interests at heart.""Either of them will maintain the U.S. commitment to aid Israel, the two have publicly angered the Palestinians in electoral speeches,"" said analyst Hani Habib. ""The only difference was that Trump promised to move the U.S. ambassador to Jerusalem while Clinton kept silent.""Any betting on either of them is a losing bet,"" he said.(This version of the story was refiled to restore the dropped word 'will' in paragraph two) (Additional reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza; Writing by Luke Baker; Editing by Larry King)"

The Royev Ruchey Zoo in Krasnoyarsk, which released a video of the two, said the animals faced a tough choice as the pumpkins had been filled with fresh meat and fish, both favorite treats with Yunona and Felix.

By Linda Sieg and Gayatri Suroyo
| TOKYO/JAKARTA

TOKYO/JAKARTA Win or lose, Donald Trump's campaign has changed the way countries in Asia view their relationships with Washington.Final polling suggests the most likely outcome is a victory for Hillary Clinton. But even Clinton, an architect of the U.S. strategic pivot to Asia, has some work ahead of her in rebuilding trust, analysts and former officials in Asia said.""With or without Trump, this marks the end of U.S. leadership, in particular, moral leadership,"" said a former Japanese diplomat, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic.""I don't think it's a question of Trump as an individual, but a question of the U.S. society that produced this man as the Republican candidate.""Trump upended U.S. democratic traditions during his White House campaign, drawing enthusiastic crowds where people cheered his often provocative and outrageous remarks. Critics labeled him ignorant, uncouth, a racist, hypocrite, demagogue and a sexual predator, all accusations he denied. He described a dark America, knocked to its knees by China, Mexico and the Islamic state. Trump's harnessing of a populist backlash against immigration and global trade has challenged the ideal of benevolent American power that helped shape the global economy - and the forces of globalization - since the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.Now the United States faces a rising China, long an economic force and now becoming more assertive in geopolitics -  building its military capability and ignoring an international tribunal's ruling against its claims to most of the South China Sea.TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP 
Asia is most worried about trade protectionism - exports make up a quarter of Asia's GDP and a fifth of them go to the United States.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, championed by Barack Obama in part to increase U.S. influence in Asia, was to be an essential feature of Washington's strategic pivot to Asia - an ""economic NATO"".  It now looks dead in the water. Both Clinton and Trump oppose the deal, which would set up a free trade zone among 12 countries that excludes China.Former Indonesian finance minister Chatib Basri told Reuters the TPP ""is an important instrument for the U.S. pivot to Asia"".""There is some kind of a rivalry between America and China, and the way America can get into Asia is with TPP,"" said Basri,  now a visiting professor at Australian National University.With U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore among the biggest winners of an open trade regime, a more isolationist and protectionist stance will cost Washington influence in Asia. Ironically, it would be China, the subject of many of Trump's tirades, that could emerge the big winner as uncertainty over Washington's future commitment to Asia pushes countries into dealing more closely with Beijing.
""If the U.S. pulls out of TPP, that will certainly increase China's influence in Asia,"" said Kanti Bajpai, Professor of Asian Studies at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.""Already, U.S. criticism of domestic issues in Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia has alienated those countries and caused them to lean towards Beijing. Pulling out of the TPP will help China geopolitically.""      Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been particularly hostile towards Washington over its criticism of his lethal anti-drugs campaign, announcing a ""separation"" from the United States during last month's visit to China.Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak came back from a visit to China last week with $34 billion worth of deals and an agreement to buy four Chinese naval vessels.       SECURITY WORRIES

China has long been in Trump's sights, with promises to declare it a currency manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on imports. But any such moves could also hurt Asian exporters who ship components there for assembly and export to the United States, at a time when global trade is already weakening.Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics, said the Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea were the emerging Asia economies most vulnerable to a Trump presidency.""Perhaps the biggest risk to the region's economies, however, stems not from Trump's trade policies, but from his foreign policy,"" Leather said.Trump has created doubts over his commitment to security alliances, suggesting Japan and South Korea need to pay more for a U.S. military presence and that they should even develop their own nuclear capability to counter China and North Korea.Clinton, who was secretary of state when the Obama administration launched its Asia pivot, is expected to maintain Obama's foreign policy, with some seeing her as being more hawkish.The divisive U.S. presidential campaign has already done a lot of damage to the reputation of the United States in Asia, regardless of the election outcome, according to some analysts.""The broader question is whether the United States can assert global leadership,"" said Jesper Koll, CEO at fund manager WisdomTree Japan. ""All my Chinese friends say, 'We thought we would run the world in 20 years. Now it's going to be in January'. This is not a joke. It's the natural state of development,"" Koll said  (Additional reporting: Nicole Nee in Singapore. Writing by John Mair. Editing by Bill Tarrant.)"

By Peter  Eisler
| KOKOMO, Indiana

KOKOMO, Indiana The lettering is crude, scrawled in black spray paint on the sidewalk in front of Karen Peters' neatly kept home in the quiet, working class neighborhood where she's lived most of her life. But the contempt is clear.    ""KKK Bitch.""    The racially charged graffiti appeared in mid-October on cars, homes and telephone poles in the small city of Kokomo, Indiana. Many victims, like Peters, were African American, though some were not. Many also had lawn signs for Democratic candidates in this week's presidential election, and the signs at several homes were painted over with the Ku Klux Klan's notorious initials.    ""I think it's a political thing; it's getting out of hand,"" said Peters, who believes the heated tenor of the presidential campaign - and especially the aggressive, nativist rhetoric of Republican candidate Donald Trump - has emboldened extremists.    ""When you have (candidates) saying ignorant things, maybe other people think it's ok to do this stuff, and that's pretty doggone sad ... It seems like our country is going backwards.""    Police have no suspects in the attacks. Democrats, including the mayor and local party officials, believe they were politically motivated. Local Republicans are skeptical, suggesting the damage is the work of ignorant hooligans with no place in the party.         Across the United States, the inflammatory and confrontational tone of political rhetoric is creeping into public discourse and polarizing the electorate.    It's hard to quantify the impact; there is no national data that tracks politically motivated crimes or incendiary speech. However, the percentage of voters who believe insulting political opponents is ""sometimes fair game"" has climbed over the campaign season, from 30 percent in March to 43 percent in October, according to surveys by the non-partisan Pew Research Center. A majority of voters for both parties have ""very unfavorable"" views of the other party - a first since Pew began asking the question in 1992 - and trust in government is hovering near all-time lows.""These indicators reflect inter-group tensions that can translate into everything from coarse discourse or low levels of aggression all the way up to extremist acts,"" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University.     While much of the venom has been aimed at immigrants, African Americans and other groups typically aligned with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Republicans also have faced vitriol and hostility.Much of the debate over extremism has focused on the so-called Alt-Right, a loose-knit movement of white nationalists, anti-Semites and immigration foes that has emerged from the political shadows to align itself with the Trump campaign. 
    Trump's vows to build a wall on the Mexican border, deport millions of illegal immigrants and scrutinize Muslims for ties to terrorism have energized the Alt-Right community. Such rhetoric has helped legitimize the Alt-Right's concerns about an erosion of the country's white, Christian majority, said Michael Hill, a self-described white supremacist, anti-Semite and xenophobe who heads the League of the South, a ""Southern Nationalist"" group dedicated to creating an independent ""white man's land.""    ""The general political climate that sort of surrounds his campaign has been very fruitful, not only for us, but for other right-wing groups,"" Hill said.    Similar nationalist undercurrents have stirred other countries, from Russia to Japan to Britain. Last summer, as Britain's debate over leaving the European Union reached a fever pitch, Jo Cox, a pro-EU lawmaker, was shot and stabbed in the street. Murder suspect Thomas Mair proclaimed ""death to traitors, freedom for Britain.""    In the United States, reports of hostile political displays, vandalism and violence are cropping up regularly. In Mississippi, a black church was burned and painted with ""Vote Trump."" In North Carolina, a county Republican office was set ablaze last month and a nearby building spray painted with ""Nazi Republicans leave town."" In Ohio, a truck load of manure was dumped at a Democratic campaign office. In Utah, a man displaying Trump yard signs found KKK graffiti on his car. In Wisconsin, a fan at a college football game wore a President Barack Obama mask with a noose on his neck. Neither the Trump nor the Clinton campaigns responded to requests for comment.
EXTREMISM GOES MAINSTREAM
    Trump's positions are consistent with the Alt-Right goal of ""slowing the dispossession of whites,"" said Jared Taylor, a white nationalist whose website, American Renaissance, is a movement favorite. But the media is over-hyping his support within the Alt-Right ""in an attempt to discredit him,"" Taylor added.    Trump has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans for being slow to condemn the more extreme elements of the political right. But when a leading KKK newspaper ran a pro-Trump story on its front page last week, his campaign immediately issued a statement rejecting the ""repulsive"" article.    Taylor, Hill and other Alt-Right figures say they don't advocate or condone vandalism or violence. They dismiss the notion that their rhetoric constitutes hate speech, arguing that their vilification by the left is far more hateful.    Left-wing extremists do have a history of aggressive confrontation with people or groups seen as fascist or racist, says Heidi Beirich, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors extremist movements. ""There's usually more violence from the anti-racists than the racists,"" she said.
The free speech provisions of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment grant broad protections for inflammatory rhetoric. But state and federal statutes do give law enforcement agencies authority to investigate and prosecute ""hate crimes"" motivated by bias against a race, ethnicity, religion, disability or sexual orientation.    A 6 percent increase in hate crimes documented last year by the California State University researchers showed relatively little underlying change in attacks against most minority groups. But crimes against Muslims rose 86 percent.Some who study and work in the political arena believe there has been a general erosion in civility that began long before the start of the current presidential race.Craig Dunn, Republican party chairman for Howard County, Indiana, which includes Kokomo, says that a minority of extreme voices are being amplified over the Internet and social media, fueling ""a general breakdown in civility.""    Local officials worry about how their community is being affected.""The atmosphere is ""more volatile, there's more tension,"" said Kokomo Mayor Greg Goodnight, a Democrat. The graffiti attacks were deeply troubling, he adds. ""I don't remember anything like this ever happening here.""Monica Fowler, 43, who had ""KKK"" sprayed on her Democratic yard signs, is struggling with the attacks. ""It's okay to disagree,"" she says. ""But if what you're doing is going to scare or harm another person, how dare you.""(This story corrects in the ninth paragraph to state that trust, not distrust, in government is near all-time lows Note: paragraph 2 contains language that may offend some readers) (Additional reporting by Tim Reid in Los Angeles and Guy Faulconbridge in London.

By Joanna Zuckerman Bernstein  and David Alire Garcia
| TIJUANA/NOGALES, Mexico

TIJUANA/NOGALES, Mexico Mexicans on the U.S. border anxiously awaited the outcome of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, plagued by fears of economic disaster if Republican Donald Trump wins and tries to choke local industry, isolate the country and deport millions.Trump's campaign has been one of the most unpopular in living memory in Mexico, ranging from stinging verbal attacks on its migrants, threats against its trade agreements, to his repeated vows to seal off the country behind a huge border wall that he insists Mexico will pay for.Nowhere has the bad-tempered contest been felt more acutely than in the Mexican cities straddling the U.S. border, which hundreds of thousands of people cross for work every day, and acts as a bridge for $500 billion in annual bilateral trade.Trump launched his bid accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug peddlers across the border, prompting the government to accuse him of stirring up hatred and fanning concerns on the border that racial prejudice is becoming more acceptable.The tycoon says he could scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement that took effect in Mexico, the United States and Canada in 1994, and he has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on Mexican-made goods to help U.S. industry.""We're very worried. We know what Donald Trump is looking to do, which is limit the imports, he wants to manufacture everything in the States,"" said Marcello Hinojosa, president in the border city of Tijuana of industry group Canacintra. ""But this has been analyzed by both the United States and by Mexico and it's suicide for both countries.""Mexican business leaders say about 40 percent of the average Mexican factory export is made of U.S. content and argue the two manufacturing sectors are so closely intertwined that it is impossible to take steps against one without damaging the other.Trump, who polls show trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in a tight race, says Mexico is ""killing"" the United States on trade. However, commerce between the two has grown much faster than their respective economies since NAFTA, World Bank and U.S. data show.
Mexico sends more than 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says roughly 6 million American jobs depend on trade with Mexico.Trump has also blasted U.S. companies for investing in Mexico, which houses billions of dollars worth of manufacturing plants, especially around Mexico's northern border. Trump blames the Mexican factories for jobs losses in the United States.If protectionist policies gain ground, prices for products and services would go up, and jobs would eventually be lost in Mexico, putting pressure on people to migrate - or exposing them to the lure of violent crime, Hinojosa said.
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
Rarely have Mexicans expressed such strong views about U.S. presidential candidates as during the current campaign.Mexicans favor Clinton in the race by 10 to 1, according to a poll published in Mexico in late September. But the tightening of polls in the last two weeks has rattled their confidence she will win.""Personally, though I think I speak for many Mexicans, I hope Trump loses,"" said Rodolfo Monroy, 85, a restaurant owner in the border city of Nogales, opposite Nogales, Arizona. ""Why? Because he's rude, because of what comes out of his mouth. He doesn't like us Mexicans,"" he said, with a flash of anger on his face. ""We're going to be in real trouble (if he wins).""Wadih Kuri, Chief Executive of ABC Aluminum Solutions, a local aluminum company, recalled being labeled ""beaner"" as a Mexican studying across the border, the sort of prejudice he said Trump's campaign was encouraging again.
""Are we still at the same place where kids need to be ridiculed because they're from Mexico? And that's all he's doing. So If I'm nervous, I'm nervous for the culture that he's inspiring,"" said Kuri, who now lives in San Diego.Trump's threats to deport more than 11 million undocumented migrants living in the United States, roughly half of whom are Mexican, could also put Mexican authorities under strain, said Cuauhtemoc Galindo, the mayor of Nogales, Mexico.Nor was it wise economic policy, he added.""Having someone govern who feeds racism, hate, this sort of thing ... will also make a lot of Mexicans stop visiting (the United States) out of fear, out of a sense of pride, which will also hurt the U.S. economy,"" Galindo said.Crossing into the United States from Tijuana, one of the busiest thoroughfares in the hemisphere, construction worker Alejandro Ortiz said ""every aspect"" of his life would be affected if Trump wins - which he fears will happen.""This is going to affect me whenever I cross the border, they're going to investigate me more, just because of my color, because I speak Spanish,"" said Ortiz, 36, who was born in the United States but grew up in Mexico.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Senior Democrats said on Monday their chances of winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives had been hurt by the FBI's surprise announcement last month that Hillary Clinton's email practices were again figuring in a federal investigation.Voters will go to the polls on Tuesday to choose Democrat Clinton or Republican Donald Trump for president, but also to fill 34 U.S. Senate seats in the 100-chamber body and all 435 House seats.Both the House and Senate are currently controlled by Republicans.FBI Director James Comey's letter to Congress in late October that the agency would examine newly found emails that might pertain to Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state, ""had a tremendous adverse impact with our standing with independents,"" said Representative James Clyburn, a member of the House Democratic leadership, referring to independent voters.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, while calling Comey's action ""out of line,"" said it resulted in a spike in small campaign donations.But she added: ""We would be in a better place (without the letter) and in the manner he did it.""Clyburn's and Pelosi's remarks, seen by Reuters, were delivered during a phone call House Democratic leaders had with rank-and-file members. Continued Republican control of Congress could stymie the legislative agenda put forth by Clinton if she wins the presidency. A Trump win along with a Republican Congress could spell doom for Democratic President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law known as Obamacare, which has been the target of a sustained attack by Republican lawmakers.If voters hand power to Democrats in either chamber, 2017 will likely bring a more moderate bent to bills that lawmakers send to the new president for signing into law.A senior Democratic aide said the October controversy, which consumed U.S. political campaigns for over a week, could reduce by at least 10 the number of House seats Democrats may be able to capture from Republicans on Election Day.
Comey informed Congress on Sunday that he was standing by his July decision that no criminal charges were warranted against the Democratic presidential candidate in the emails investigation.But coming only two days before national elections, Comey's latest decision may have come too late for Democrats who were hoping for big wins on Tuesday to help them regain control of the House for the first time since 2010 and the Senate for the first time since 2014.""It's terribly damaging to us,"" the aide said, adding that Clinton's support in battleground states could be depressed, which in turn would hurt the party's House candidates.With that in mind, the aide said Democrats could end up gaining only 12 to 16 House seats on Tuesday, instead of the 30 or so needed to win back the chamber.Representative Tom Cole, a senior House Republican, said in a telephone interview he found it ""mystifying in how he (Comey) has interjected himself in the election on three different occasions in ways that were probably inappropriate.""Cole was referring to the initial announcement in July that Clinton would not be prosecuted, the late October letter to Congress that FBI agents were again reviewing the issue and Sunday's information that the agency would not change its July findings.
Of Sunday's good news for Clinton, the Oklahoma lawmaker said: ""I think it certainly takes a little steam out of the Republicans.""To win control of the Senate outright, Democrats would have to score a net gain of five seats. Republicans currently hold 54 Senate seats to 44 Democratic seats and two independents who align themselves with Democrats.For much of the autumn campaign, political analysts were projecting Democrats would pick up anywhere from four to seven Senate seats.TIGHT SENATE CONTESTS

The outcome of the presidential race is expected to have a major impact on the outcome of the congressional campaigns. In recent decades, the party that wins the White House has usually fared better in congressional races too.For most of the 2016 campaign season, the Senate races have been center stage, as Democrats fielded some strong challengers to Republican incumbents.Among them are Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, who is giving Republican Senator Roy Blunt an unexpectedly stiff challenge, and former environmental official Katie McGinty, who could unseat Republican Senator Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania.  John McCain, the Vietnam War hero and 2008 Republican presidential nominee who has served in the Senate for 30 years, appears headed to re-election in a race that has been unusually competitive for him.A possible 50-50 tie following Tuesday's elections would mean that the next vice president would cast the tie-breaking vote and determine which party controls the Senate.The Senate that will be sworn in on Jan. 3, whether it is held by Republicans or Democrats, will face a weighty decision early on: voting on a U.S. Supreme Court justice to replace the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February.Since that time, Senate Republicans have refused to consider Obama's nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland, arguing the next president should pick a nominee for Senate review.Other issues confronting Congress next year include illegal immigration and border security, the need to raise U.S. borrowing authority, something some conservative Republicans oppose without substantial budget cuts, and possible approval of free-trade deals with Pacific Rim countries and Europe if negotiations on the latter conclude successfully.
