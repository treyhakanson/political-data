| ELKHART, Ind.

ELKHART, Ind. President Barack Obama slammed Donald Trump's proposal to weaken Wall Street reforms and touted his own economic record on Wednesday during a trip to a city he visited three weeks into his presidency that has recovered from its recession lows.Obama's remarks in Elkhart, Indiana, foreshadowed the arguments he is likely to make on the campaign trail this fall against the likely Republican presidential nominee.Obama did not mention Trump by name, but he lambasted the billionaire's policy proposals, particularly his promise to dismantle most of the U.S. Dodd-Frank financial regulations.""How it is that somebody would propose that we weaken regulations on Wall Street? Have we really forgotten what just happened eight years ago?"" Obama said, sounding exasperated.""The notion that you would vote for anybody who would now allow them to go back to doing the same stuff that almost broke our economy's back makes no sense. I don't care whether you are a Republican, or a Democrat or an independent, why would you do that?""
Obama, who leaves office in January, is eager to have a Democrat succeed him to ensure his legacy on the economy, healthcare reform and climate change continues.By going to Elkhart, the president sought to illustrate the success of his policies in the face of Republican opposition. His trip to the city in early 2009 came in the middle of a fight for the U.S. Congress to pass a roughly $800 billion economic stimulus package.Elkhart had an unemployment rate as high as 19.6 percent in 2009, the White House said; it is now around 4 percent. 
Indiana's Republican Governor Mike Pence said the city had recovered despite Obama's policies, not because of them.""I believe the people of Elkhart ... have brought our economy back in spite of the burdens that higher taxes, mandates and increasing regulations from Washington, D.C. have placed on them,"" he wrote in an opinion piece published in ""The Elkhart Truth.""
Obama has not endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her race for the Democratic presidential nomination against Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, but he has made his eagerness to campaign for the winner clear.He name checked Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, by noting deficits had fallen under both of their administrations, and he said Republicans had helped the rich by blaming poor people, minorities, feminists, and immigrants for squeezing the economic wellbeing of the middle class.""The primary story that Republicans have been telling about  the economy is not supported by the facts. It's just not,"" Obama said to a largely supportive crowd at a local high school. (Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

SACRAMENTO, Calif. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said on Wednesday he had formed a political action committee and started raising money to help fight Donald Trump's Republican presidential campaign in key states with large Latino immigrant populations.""I'm focusing all my efforts from now to November on stopping Trump,"" Villaraigosa said in a conference call with reporters. Calling Trump a racist and misogynist, Villaraigosa said his committee, called Building Bridges, Not Walls, would focus on organizing immigrants to oppose the presumptive Republican nominee in California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida in the campaign for the Nov. 8 election.Opened with his own $1,000 contribution, the committee would seek donations to pay for its activities, Villaraigosa said. Villaraigosa, a Democrat who was Los Angeles mayor from 2005 to 2013 and also served as speaker of the California Assembly, is perhaps the state's highest-profile Latino leader. He has said he is considering a run for governor in 2018. 
His anti-Trump campaign is among the first efforts to formally turn concern among immigrants about the billionaire's campaign into political action. Last week, Democrats in San Diego organized an anti-Trump demonstration that drew about 400 people.Trump has made concern over illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign. He has accused the Mexican government of sending rapists and criminals across the border, pledged to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and called for a temporary halt to Muslim immigration amid fears that radicalized immigrants will commit terrorist acts.
Last week in the border city of San Diego, Trump called a judge hearing a case against one of his businesses ""hostile"" and ""a hater"" and said he believed the judge was Mexican.""Both Democrats and Republicans are horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency,"" Villaraigosa said.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

ELKHART, Ind President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he expected the winner of the Democratic presidential nominating race would be clear next week after Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders compete in races in California and New Jersey.""I think that there has been a healthy debate in the Democratic Party, and it's almost over,"" Obama said during a town hall-style event broadcast by PBS.People will ""probably have a pretty good sense next week,"" of who the nominee will be, Obama said.
Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, is the front-runner in the Democratic race. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, lags her in the number of delegates needed to wrap up the nomination.California and New Jersey, which both have large numbers of delegates up for grabs, hold their votes next Tuesday. 
Obama has not endorsed either candidate in the Democratic race, though he has made clear his affection and admiration for Clinton, who was his opponent in the 2008 Democratic nominating race. Obama appointed Clinton as his secretary of state after winning the presidential election that year.

By Jon Herskovitz
| AUSTIN, Texas

AUSTIN, Texas Former Baylor University President Kenneth Starr resigned as chancellor of the world's largest Baptist university on Wednesday after being implicated in a report for not doing enough to probe sexual assaults by athletes.Starr, who rose to prominence for his exhaustive investigation of sex scandals surrounding then-President Bill Clinton, stepped down as chancellor but will keep his post as a professor in Baylor's law school.""With sorrow, earlier this morning, I announced my resignation effective immediately as chancellor of Baylor University as a matter of conscience,"" Starr said in an exclusive interview on ESPN television's ""Outside the Lines.""Starr added he was unaware of what was happening but still accepted responsibility.""We need to put this horrible situation behind us,"" he said. One of the victims of sexual assault at Baylor, identified only as ""Sarah,"" told the show she sent a letter to Starr about being raped. She finds it hard to believe that he did not know about other sexual assaults.
Baylor's board of regents accepted the resignation, the school said.Last week, the central Texas university in Waco removed Starr as president and fired head football coach Art Briles after an independent report found administrators mishandled sexual abuse cases involving football players.The investigation found actions by Baylor administrators directly discouraged students from reporting sexual assaults. In one case, the actions included retaliating against a complainant for reporting a sexual assault.
""We were horrified by what we learned from the investigation and again express our public acknowledgment and deepest apologies,"" the board said in a statement on Wednesday.In March, a former student at Baylor brought a negligence lawsuit in federal court against the school, claiming it acted callously and indifferently after she was raped by a Baylor football player.In a separate scandal, Baylor football player Sam Ukwuachu was sentenced last year to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a fellow student in 2013.
Starr became Baylor's president in 2010, promising to promote the school's ""great tradition in the Christian world.""A former appeals court judge, Starr was appointed as a special counsel to investigate Clinton over a real estate investment and other matters. His probe widened to include Clinton's sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and led to Clinton's impeachment by the House of Representatives. Republicans could not muster the two-thirds majority in the Senate needed to remove Clinton from office. (Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

By Suzannah Gonzales

Kansas vowed on Wednesday to sue the Obama administration over a directive telling U.S. public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identities.The announcement by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt made the state the 13th to wade into an acrimonious debate about the rights of transgender Americans. It comes a day after a federal appeals court refused to reconsider its ruling that gave a Virginia transgender high-school student access to the bathroom of his gender identity.The court's decision ""means our only option is to pursue a more direct challenge to the Obama administration's unlawful efforts to unilaterally rewrite Title IX,"" Schmidt, a Republican, said in a statement.President Barack Obama's administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority.
The letter relied on an interpretation of Title IX, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education initiatives that receive federal financial assistance. The letter did not have the force of law but contained an implicit threat that schools that do not abide by the directive could lose federal aid.Schmidt called the directive an attempt to expand federal power.Also on Wednesday, the Kansas Senate passed by 30-to-8 a resolution opposing the Obama administration's guidance on transgender students' bathroom use that said state and local officials, and not federal officials, should decide school policy and that the directive threatens students' privacy and safety. 
Officials from 11 U.S. states - Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin - sued the Obama administration last week, calling its directive ""a massive social experiment."" Mississippi's Republican governor said on Thursday he planned to join the lawsuit. Schmidt said he is reviewing whether Kansas will join the lawsuit by the 11 states, led by Texas, or file a separate, similar lawsuit.
North Carolina sued the federal government last month, seeking to protect a state law passed in March that bans people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their sex assigned at birth.But while many states have protested the Obama administration directive, others have acted to protect the rights of transgender individuals. Massachusetts lawmakers on Wednesday were voting on a measure that would make the state the 18th to ban discrimination based on gender identity.

By Nick Brown
| SAN JUAN

SAN JUAN As struggling Puerto Rico enters a bitter election season, discord in the U.S. territory's ruling party is reaching new heights, which could benefit bondholders.Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has pushed to force hedge funds, mutual funds and other investors to take losses on the $70 billion Puerto Rico owes them because it cannot repay the debt in full. He says the island's staggering poverty and lack of money to ensure basic services constitutes a humanitarian crisis. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5)Garcia Padilla, deeply unpopular with exhausted political capital, has dwindling allies among campaigning lawmakers now distancing themselves from him. They may adopt more creditor-friendly policies to counter his populist ideals, experts say. Puerto Rican residents vote in local primaries this Sunday with some members of Garcia Padilla's Popular Democratic Party locked in tight battles, including Rep. Rafael ""Tatito"" Hernandez, who runs Puerto Rico's House finance committee.The island's election cycle is unique, with all posts decided on the same day every four years, making political campaigns especially heated. Election day, Nov. 8, is a holiday, and voter turnout averages more than 80 percent.The governor will not seek a second term, and financial markets have never given him much credibility. His administration has yet to publish fiscal 2014's audited financial results.That has fed a perception of irresponsible government, and spurred PDP members to try to distance themselves from his administration.The dynamic could play into the hands of creditors. Garcia Padilla set aside about $200 million in the fiscal 2017 budget toward the $800 million payment due on GO debt July 1, but Hernandez has said he will lobby to earmark enough to pay it all.""There is a lot of lobbying here by bondholders, and one of the big issues is whether to include money to pay that debt in next year's budget,"" Sergio Marxuach, a San Juan-based economist, said in an interview.A law signed in April, giving the governor authority to issue moratoriums on debt payments, could be scaled back, said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who follows Puerto Rico. ""Our base case has been that the budget will be used as leverage to amend back parts of the moratorium,"" Hanson said. While these local fights play out, the U.S. Congress has been debating a bill that would pull Puerto Rico's finances under federal oversight and allow the government to restructure its bond debt.
UNRAVELING GOVERNMENT
The governor, though never wildly popular, has had some success pushing his agenda. But lately the wheels have come off, even though his party has controlled the House and Senate since 2013. Key party leaders, like Hernandez and former Secretary of State David Bernier, the PDP's gubernatorial candidate, have openly criticized him.Garcia Padilla's own economy minister, Alberto Baco Bague, publicly questioned the legitimacy of the humanitarian crisis, telling local media in May the narrative was a political ""strategy."" Baco declined to comment for this story.
Last week, in a boon for businesses, the legislature repealed a new round of tax hikes on professional services, the same bill it had approved just last year on the strength of Garcia Padilla's message of financial desperation.Adding to the chaos, a group of Puerto Rico creditors sued Garcia Padilla's administration over the legality of the debt moratorium, despite having signed an agreement barring lawsuits while sides negotiated a restructuring. The move reflected ever-growing acrimony between the government and its creditors, Hanson said.A spokeswoman for Garcia Padilla's office had no immediate comment.A SLOW BURN
Like Baco's criticism, much of the internal discord turns on whether there is actually a humanitarian crisis. But while that argument may be losing political steam, it should not be disregarded, Marxuach said.
The message has resonated with Democrats in Washington, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Rep. Raul Grijalva, who made separate visits to Puerto Rico in May to stress the dire human circumstances on the island. ""Puerto Rico is at a moment of necessity and crisis,"" Lew said May 9 in San Juan. Marxuach said the crisis is not so much a ticking time bomb, ""it's a slow burn."" Public pensions covering 330,000 beneficiaries are the worst-funded of any state-level U.S. pension this century, set to run out of cash in three years. Hospitals face staffing shortfalls as doctors flee to better-paying jobs on the mainland. The island's poverty rate is at 45 percent; unemployment is near 12 percent, and higher in rural towns. Puerto Ricans' ability to emigrate to the mainland is an escape hatch that mitigates the economic stress and political pressure to fix it. But for those without the ability to escape the burdens just grow.""The debt stays the same,"" said Marxuach, ""but the economy grows even less.""

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A showdown between New York City and Donald Trump over one of the most potent symbols of Trump's candidacy, the glitzy atrium of Trump Tower, intensified on Wednesday as the mayor's office criticized his closing of the tower's public space for campaign events.Lined with pink marble and indoor waterfalls and a popular tourist attraction, the atrium has become a favorite event backdrop for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. presidency, who frequently boasts to voters of his wealthy lifestyle and his success as a building developer.City officials are now investigating whether Trump's using the atrium for private campaign events without permission is in breach of a long-standing agreement between Trump and the city's planners. Trump had agreed to maintain it as a public space as a zoning concession when the tower was built. A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, weighed in on Wednesday to register City Hall's displeasure, which may yet force Trump to find an alternative setting for his events for the five months remaining before the November presidential election. 
""Despite what he may think, the rules and laws of this city apply to everybody, including Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump should honor his agreement with the city to keep the space open to the public,"" Austin Finan, the spokesman, said in a statement.In order to build his flagship Fifth Avenue skyscraper taller than zoning rules would have otherwise allowed, including the penthouse where Trump lives, Trump agreed to keep the atrium open to the public from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day.
The atrium, opened in 1983, is one of scores of ""privately owned public spaces"" across the city, an effort to balance the wishes of developers to build taller while preserving pockets of space for New Yorkers in crowded neighborhoods.Since launching his campaign by descending an escalator into the atrium last June, Trump has held at least half a dozen campaign events where Reuters reporters have seen his security staff prevent anyone but a few pre-approved journalists from entering parts or all of the atrium. 
City officials, whose investigation was first reported by Reuters on Tuesday, say they have no evidence of Trump seeking or getting permission to close the space for a private event, which is allowed to happen up to four times a year. Michael Cohen, an executive vice president for the Trump Organization, said on Tuesday he could neither confirm nor deny if there had been a violation of the agreement while his staff tried to locate the paperwork. He did not respond to questions on Wednesday. (Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Additional reporting by Lucas Jackson, Carlo Allegri and Brendan McDermid; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. congressional committee has launched a probe into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's handling of the cyber theft of $81 million from one of its accounts held by the central bank of Bangladesh, according to a letter seen by Reuters.The letter, addressed to New York Fed President William Dudley and sent Tuesday from the House of Representatives' Science Committee, requests ""all documents and communications"" connected to the February heist, the bank's oversight of the global financial network SWIFT and the status of any reviews related to the Fed's information technology conducted since the attack occurred.The letter follows similar probes launched last month by Tom Carper, the Senate Homeland Security Committee's top Democrat, and Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat.The latest inquiry comes as policymakers, regulators and financial institutions around the world increase scrutiny into the heist and related attacks on banks in Vietnam and Ecuador, in which hackers sent fraudulent transaction messages across the SWIFT.
""In light of the recent cyber attacks on our global financial systems, the Committee believes it is imperative to receive information from the NY Fed about its response, its oversight of SWIFT, the status of the investigation, and any remedial steps taken to address vulnerabilities,"" states the letter, signed by House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican.A New York Fed spokeswoman said it intended to respond to the new request for information. The bank has so far denied responsibility for the Bangladesh Bank intrusion.
The letter said it was ""deeply troubling"" that cyber security experts believe more attacks will be uncovered as banks review their security systems, and that Bangladesh Bank's systems appeared to be the ""weak link"" in the February attack.SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, last week urged banks to bolster their security, saying it was aware of multiple attacks. Banks around the world rely on SWIFT to issue payment instructions to each other.
The committee requested a response from the New York Fed by June 14. (Reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington, additional reporting by Jonathan Spicer in New York, editing by G Crosse)"
