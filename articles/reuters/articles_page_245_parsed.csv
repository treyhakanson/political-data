By Lawrence Hurley and Nick Brown
| WASHINGTON/SAN JUAN

WASHINGTON/SAN JUAN As the U.S. Congress drags its feet on a bill to address Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt crisis, it could get kicked into high gear by an unlikely source: the Supreme Court. The highest U.S. court is due to rule by the end of June on the validity of a Puerto Rico law that would allow the U.S. territory to restructure the chunk of its debt issued by public agencies, more than $20 billion, in a bankruptcy-like process.The court fight is playing out as the Republican-led Congress grapples with legislation that lawmakers hope will prevent the need for a bailout of the territory of 3.5 million U.S. citizens.The legislation is expected to put Puerto Rico's finances under federal oversight through a control board and let the Caribbean island cut debt through a bankruptcy-like restructuring process. It would preempt the Recovery Act, the local restructuring law that was thrown out in U.S. courts before Puerto Rico asked the Supreme Court to reinstate it.Puerto Rico is not covered by federal bankruptcy laws that U.S. cities and public agencies can use, so some U.S. lawmakers view legislation as the only way to keep the debt crisis from worsening.But drafting the bill has been laborious. Some bondholders, including U.S. hedge funds, and Republicans are seeking to ensure that creditors get paid as much as possible of what they are owed. Congressional Democrats, the Obama administration and Puerto Rico itself are trying to prevent austerity that could threaten services on the island.An early draft of the bill by the House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee never made it to a vote, and the panel on Wednesday delayed unveiling the latest draft, citing the need for ""a number of refinements.""Some Republicans oppose inclusion of a ""cram-down"" provision that would let Puerto Rico impose debt cuts on creditors who do not agree to them.
LESS PALATABLE
A Supreme Court decision on Puerto Rico's law could come as soon as Monday. The ruling could change the political dynamics for Republicans by resurrecting a law that is viewed as even less palatable to them than the congressional bill, according to congressional sources and experts who follow the debate. Many of the creditors lobbying conservatives in Congress to oppose the legislation, known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), would prefer to keep debt-restructuring talks out of a bankruptcy court, or at least avoid cram-down.That is because in the normal course of business they are entitled to full repayment, but in a bankruptcy proceeding they could be legally made to accept discounts. If the Supreme Court reinstates the Recovery Act, the congressional legislation might not seem so bad to creditors in comparison, said Melissa Jacoby, a University of North Carolina School of Law bankruptcy expert and professor. ""It might alter the lobbying landscape,"" Jacoby said.
Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its debt, most recently the bulk of a $422 million payment owed by its primary government bank.The Recovery Act, if revived, would let the island restructure debt at public utilities like power authority PREPA and water authority PRASA, though the island's legislature could try to expand it to cover other debts, Jacoby said.The Supreme Court's March 22 oral arguments indicated the justices could uphold the law.Such a ruling could prompt creditors and Republican lawmakers to embrace the need to pass the PROMESA bill. The legislation is expected to carry more bondholder protections than the Recovery Act, requiring an attempt at consensual restructuring talks as a condition for any debt cuts.
""Those very same players who are now blocking our (congressional) legislation will, all of a sudden, encourage the (Republican) majority to pass some legislation"" if the Supreme Court revives the Recovery Act, said a Democratic House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity.The island's moment of truth could strike by June 30. That is the date by which the Supreme Court is expected to rule and a day before Puerto Rico faces a $1.9 billion debt payment that its governor has said it cannot afford.Congress is aiming to pass legislation to address Puerto Rico's crisis before that payment.  Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat, told Reuters the high court's ruling ""could have some effect"" on PROMESA's drafting process ""depending on what the Supreme Court says about Puerto Rican authority to do whatever it needs to do.""A source close to major creditors said a ruling reinstating the Recovery Act could encourage Congress to pass legislation for a different reason: creditors would keep litigating different aspects of that law, perpetuating Puerto Rico's economic uncertainty.Parish Braden, a spokesman for House National Resources Committee Republicans, said Congress ultimately must act regardless of what the Supreme Court does.""The ball is already in Congress' court,"" Braden said.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican veteran Newt Gingrich did not rule out on Wednesday the possibility that he could be persuaded to serve as presumptive nominee Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate, but said Trump has plenty of other talent to consider.""I would certainly talk about it,"" Gingrich told Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity. ""I wouldn't turn it down automatically.""Gingrich has been a persistent subject of speculation as a possible Trump running mate. He is a former speaker of the House of Representatives and, as such, meets one of Trump's main requirements for the job - that his No. 2 be someone who could help steer legislation through Congress.Gingrich ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and lost to the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney. He has been serving as an informal adviser to Trump, who has said he has narrowed his list of potential picks to five or six.Gingrich said in the Fox interview that former Texas Governor Rick Perry and Ohio Governor John Kasich would both be strong selections for the position.
Kasich, who ended his own presidential run last week, has emphatically ruled out serving with Trump, while Perry has said he would be willing to be considered and has endorsed Trump.Speculation has also centered around some of Trump's former rivals like U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who said this week he was not interested, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who is a strong backer of Trump.
""I'm not the only person around,"" Gingrich said.He suggested that there could be better choices for the position, noting that it would be an advantage for Trump to have a running mate who could help win over voters in a particular region of the country. A former congressman from Georgia, Gingrich has lived in the Washington, D.C., suburbs for years.
Still, he said, he would be willing to consider it.""I am in the 'not no' column,"" Gingrich said. (Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Paul Tait)"	['Perry', 'Trump', 'Romney', 'Rubio', 'Kasich', 'Paul']	[]

LONDON London's status as a global financial center would probably be affected to some extent if Britain votes to leave the European Union in next month's referendum, French finance minister Michel Sapin said on Thursday.""The City (of London) is a considerable financial force and I don't think that (Brexit) would transform all the elements that constitute its strength,"" Sapin said through a translator during a visit to London.""But I don't think that it would be without effects which would have to be seen.""
Some French banks had told him Brexit would have consequences for them and that some of their activities based in London might not carry on as they were, he said.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives' information technology team has blocked lawmakers from accessing software applications hosted on a Google cloud service to prevent possible hacking campaigns, two congressional sources said on Wednesday. The move came after Yahoo Mail was also blacklisted by House authorities due to fears of ransomware infiltration.The two restrictions, which have hampered some internal communications in the lower chamber, have both been implemented within the past two weeks and are still in place. The episodes are not believed to be related, the sources said.   Devices connected to the House's internet via wifi or ethernet cables have been barred from accessing appspot.com, the domain where Google hosts custom-built apps, after the FBI notified Congress of a potential security vulnerability, the sources said.""We began blocking appspot.com on May 3 in response to indicators that appspot.com was potentially still hosting a remote access trojan named BLT that has been there since June 2015,"" one of the sources, a House staffer with direct knowledge of the situation, told Reuters.
A Google (GOOGL.O) spokesman said the company was investigating reports of the restriction and would work with the House to resolve any issues. The FBI has so far not responded to a request for a comment.The FBI sent an advisory to private industry in June 2015 about a number of remote access tools capable of stealing personally identifiable information, including a trojan file named BLT found on the Google appspot.com domain.         Ted Henderson, a former House employee, said two Google-hosted apps he created specifically for use by congressional staffers to discuss politics and share alerts on votes are now effectively banned on their work network.
The disabling of appspot.com occurred after the House Information Security Office sent an advisory email to lawmakers and staffers on April 30 warning of increased phishing attacks on the House network from third party, web-based mail applications including Yahoo Mail and Gmail.""The attacks are focused on putting 'ransomware' on users' computers,"" the email, seen by Reuters, states. It added that the primary focus of the attackers appeared to be Yahoo Mail, which was being blocked on the network ""until further notice.""
Two individuals fell victim to ransomware by clicking on infected Word document email attachments, sources familiar with the hacking said. The infected files were able to be recovered without paying any ransom, the sources said.Ransomware attacks, which involve accessing a computer or network's files and encrypting them until a ransom is paid by the victim, have grown more severe and common in recent years. Yahoo (YHOO.O) is working closely with the House to resolve the matter, a company spokesperson said. (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Andrew Hay)"	[]	[]

By Joseph Menn
| SANTA CLARA

SANTA CLARA Cyber attack techniques used by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State could also be used by other countries, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said on Wednesday.Speaking in California, Carter told reporters that the U.S.-led coalition used electronic techniques to disrupt and degrade the jihadist force's ability to organize and said an unspecified number of other countries could do the same in other conflicts.""These are not capabilities that only we have,"" Carter said at a news conference at the Santa Clara headquarters of Intel Corp's security wing. ""That is why good, strong cyber defenses are essential for us.""The remarks add more detail to a campaign that has only recently been acknowledged. The conference was also attended by the U.S. Secretaries of Homeland Security and Commerce.The cabinet secretaries had gathered for a day-long presidential security advisory board meeting that was the first to be held in Silicon Valley since the group's inception more than 35 years ago.
The officials used their remarks at the event to call for greater cooperation between the government and private sector, especially to confront rising cyber security threats.Carter said he was expanding the Pentagon's technology innovation unit by adding an office in Boston and hiring a recruiter to attract tech company leaders to temporary military jobs. The so-called Defense Innovation Unit Experimental was formed to help get ideas and products from Silicon Valley into the Defense Department quickly.National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers told the group that the government's largest intelligence workforce had moved from almost exclusively defending Pentagon networks to protecting the civilian government five years ago and was increasingly assisting the Department of Homeland Security in efforts to help safeguard private companies.
""The part that frustrates me is, why are we coming in after the fact,"" as with the destructive hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp, instead of acting earlier on information gathered about attacks in the works, Rogers said. Tensions between U.S. technology companies and the government continue to flare over President Barack Obama's call for encryption that can be pierced at the government's request. The three cabinet secretaries stood behind the call for flexible encryption during the press conference. The National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee did not address the subject during its public sessions at Intel on Wednesday.
Tech and security company officials and prominent venture capitalists said at the meeting they hoped the government would continue to hasten the adoption of private-sector innovation in such areas as robotics and machine learning and the officials said that they would.White House cyber security policy coordinator Michael Daniel said cooperation was critical to avoid the massive economic, social and intelligence benefit of the Internet for the West becoming a liability.

By Ginger Gibson and Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump pulled even with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday, in a dramatic early sign that the Nov. 8 presidential election might be more hotly contested than first thought.While much can change in the six months until the election,the results of the online survey are a red flag for the Clinton campaign that the billionaire's unorthodox bid for the White House cannot be brushed aside.Trump's numbers surged after he effectively won the Republican nomination last week by knocking out his two remaining rivals, according to the poll.The national survey found 41 percent of likely voters supporting Clinton and 40 percent backing Trump, with 19 percent undecided. The survey of 1,289 people was conducted over five days and has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.""Very happy to see these numbers,"" Trump said in a written comment to Reuters. ""Good direction."" A spokesman for Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the poll.A Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted in the five days to May 4 had the former secretary of state at 48 percent and the New York magnate at 35 percent.    Republican strategist Dave Carney said the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed the vulnerability of Clinton, who is still battling U.S. Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination. ""She has been in the public eye for decades, served in high office, and now she's in a dead heat with Trump, in a race that everyone thought she would win easily,"" said Carney, who has been critical of Trump. ""Everyone thought it would be a romp.""
REPUBLICAN RELUCTANCE 
Trump has his own problems, though. He is struggling to bring some senior Republicans behind his campaign after primary election battles in which his fiery rhetoric rankled party elites.    Several Republican leaders -- including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan -- are withholding their support. ""After a tough primary, that's going to take some effort,"" Ryan said about unifying the party. ""We are committed to putting that effort in."" The former reality TV star will face pressure to tone down his rhetoric and clarify his policy positions when he visits Republican lawmakers, including Ryan, on Thursday.Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney criticized Trump on Wednesday for not releasing his tax returns, saying the only explanation was that the documents contained a
""bombshell.""Trump has said that he will make public his tax returns onthe completion of an audit.             Clinton and Trump both poll well with voters of their respective parties, but independent voters continue to express uncertainty about who they will support, with 38 percent in the Reuters/Ipsos poll saying they are unsure or would vote for someone else.With the party's primary season winding down, the two likely nominees have turned their attention to attacking each other, both on policy and personality.
Clinton took aim at Trump's tax reform plan at a rally in New Jersey on Wednesday. With a typical American family earning $54,000 per year, Clinton said, ""It would take that family 24 years of work to earn what Donald Trump's tax plan will hand out to people like him in just one year. That is no way to create good job with rising incomes for the vast majority of Americans, is it?""Trump has taunted Clinton in recent days for failing to ""close the deal"" against Sanders.    University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said Trump - who has promised to force Mexico to pay for a border wall to halt illegal immigration and called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country - could also face a wall of opposition among minority voters.""This is an election that will be determined as much by the demographic composition of the American electorate as anything else - and that didn't change in a week,"" he said.     Clinton's loss in the Democratic primary election in West Virginia on Tuesday also signaled possible trouble for her in industrial states in November, underscoring how she still needs to court working-class voters in the Rust Belt.Roughly six in 10 voters in West Virginia, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in country, said they were very worried about the direction of the U.S. economy in the next few years, according to a preliminary ABC News exit poll. The same proportion cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue in the election.

By Duff Wilson and John Shiffman
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The House of Representatives on Wednesday unanimously passed legislation to improve safety planning for children who are born dependent on opioid drugs. A similar bill is pending in the Senate. It is one of more than a dozen new measures that are aimed at addressing a U.S. epidemic of addiction to pain pills and cheap heroin.    The legislation came in response to a Reuters investigation last year, titled ""Helpless and Hooked,"" which revealed that at least 110 babies had died since 2010 after being born dependent or exposed to opioids and sent home with parents ill-prepared to care for them.""It's hard to imagine that stories like these could be any more tragic,"" Rep. Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican who is the prime sponsor of the bill, said on the House floor. ""Unfortunately, they are. Because they should have and in many cases could have been prevented.""
Only nine of the 50 U.S. states followed a federal law requiring them to track and help those newborns, Reuters reported. The news agency found that more than 130,000 newborns were diagnosed with drug withdrawal over the last decade, but most of them weren't reported to state child-protection authorities.In April, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asked all states to report by June 30 whether and how they are following the existing law, known as the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. States receive federal funding after giving assurance they are complying.Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the leading Democratic co-sponsor, emphasized that the new legislation would require help for not only the newborn but also for the mother and family. That provision is aimed at overcoming resistance to reporting cases of newborn addiction among doctors and other health-care workers, who sometimes fear that mothers may be punished if the cases come to official attention. 
    ""This important step with this bill is to ensure that the whole family is healthy and successful and supported,"" Clark said. The measure, formally known the Improving Safe Care for the Prevention of Infant Abuse and Neglect Act, passed 421-0.Children's advocates are seeking more federal funding to go with the commitment. ""We would view this as a good first step, but they need to make it real and put some money in it,"" said John Sciamanna, vice president of public policy for the Child Welfare League of America.
Among the other opioid-related bills adopted by the House on Wednesday was one designed to help states emulate a pilot program for drug-affected newborns in Huntington, West Virginia. Rep. Evan Jenkins, a Republican who helped create the Huntington facility, known as Lily's Place, before he became a congressman, said his bill would help improve access to care for poor babies and women on Medicare.The Reuters series can be read here: here  (Edited by Michael Williams)"	['Clark']	[]

By Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump would consider changes to Social Security and Medicare if he is elected U.S. president, a top adviser to the New York businessman said on Wednesday, signaling a shift from Trump's earlier stance that he would not touch so-called entitlement programs.Policy adviser Sam Clovis said at a Washington conference that Trump would be open to a bipartisan look at entitlement spending once he implemented his other policies, such as his tax plan.""I think after the administration's been in place, then we will start to take a look at all of the programs, including entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare,"" Clovis said at an event hosted by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.The foundation is known for its attacks on deficit spending, and it supports revamping Social Security and Medicare.""We'll take a hard look at those to start seeing what we can do in a bipartisan way,"" Clovis said, adding Trump was not  proposing any entitlement changes now.
Trump, who became the likely Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 general election last week when his two remaining rivals dropped out, had said he wanted to leave those programs alone. On the campaign trail in Wisconsin last month, he attacked Republicans who he said would cut Social Security benefits.
""It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is,"" Trump said during a Republican debate in March. ""I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.""Clovis said Trump's economic policies would spur growth, and he estimated a $4.5 trillion to $7 trillion surplus over 10 years. The conservative Tax Foundation has estimated Trump's tax plan, which calls for simplifying the tax code and slashing corporate rates, would cut U.S. tax revenues by about $10 trillion.Trump may retool that tax proposal to bring down the price tag, said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist with the Heritage Foundation. He said he and Larry Kudlow, who hosts a program on CNBC, have proposed changes to the tax plan.
""What we were working with the campaign a little bit on is how can we get that cost down, cut it by half or more, without disrupting the main growth elements of the plan,"" Moore told Reuters.Hope Hicks, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said the tax plan was not being re-written. Moore said Trump had not yet signed off on any proposed tweaks. (Reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by Tom Brown)"	['Peterson', 'Trump', 'Moore']	[]

By Megan Cassella
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against Ohio officials on Wednesday over a plan by the state to restrict the U.S. healthcare agency's access to state and federal funds, saying it was being singled out for providing abortion services.The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of Planned Parenthood branches of greater Ohio and of the southwest region, said attempts to defund the healthcare agency and several affiliated programs were an ""extreme punishment"" exacted solely because abortion services are part of its range of care, court filings showed.Agency officials also said such actions violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution for singling out Planned Parenthood and treating it differently from other healthcare providers.Ohio Right to Life director Katie Franklin called the lawsuit ""frivolous.""The Ohio bill was signed by Governor John Kasich in February and bars the state from contracts with organizations that perform or promote abortions. It is set to take effect on May 23.
Kasich's press secretary, Joe Andrews, said in an email he would not discuss pending litigation, but added the governor, a former Republican presidential candidate, was pleased to sign legislation ""that continued our progress in moving funding to other eligible providers.""The lawsuit is the 15th filed by Planned Parenthood over access to care at its centers since mid-2015, when anti-abortion activists began releasing videos purporting to show group officials negotiating prices for aborted fetal tissue.
Planned Parenthood denied wrongdoing and said the videos were distorted and politically motivated. Officials in 12 states have since blocked efforts to cut funding from the clinics, and the federal director of Medicaid, a government healthcare program for the poor, warned states in April against cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood simply because its services include abortions.Planned Parenthood officials said they were asking the court to hand down an order before the law takes effect. If allowed to continue, the action would ""constitute an undue, constitutionally intolerable burden on the abortion rights of Ohio women,"" the filing said.Also on Wednesday, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed into law a bill that directs the state's spending of federal funds for family planning services to health centers and hospitals that provide a full range of healthcare. 
The governor's office said in a statement the bill would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood clinics out of federal grants for family planning programs.  (Additional reporting by Kim Palmer in Cleveland and Fiona Ortiz in Chicago)"	['Palmer', 'Brownback', 'Kasich']	['abortion', 'healthcare']

By Richard Valdmanis and Grant Smith
| BOSTON/NEW YORK

BOSTON/NEW YORK Supporters of U.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders may inhabit opposite ends of the political spectrum, but they have one thing in common: an unprecedented hunger for campaign swag.Fans of the Republican billionaire Trump and of Democrat Sanders have bought nearly $20 million worth of campaign hats, T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other merchandise so far, according to campaign officials, a level that political brand experts reckon is a record for a presidential election.The sales reveal deep passion for the White House contenders among some voters, and could also signify an expansion of merchandise as a fundraising tool in future races, said Laura Ries, president of branding consultancy Ries & Ries.""I'm sure we'll see more of this. Merchandise is a great way of getting your message out there, of engaging people, and of raising money,"" she said.Among offerings from Trump, now the only candidate left in the Republican race, are T-shirts featuring slogans like ""Team Trump"" and ""New York Values"", trucker hats emblazed with ""Make America Great Again"" and a ""presidential dog raglan"" sweater designed to be worn by dogs.The campaign shop for Sanders, who describes himself as a Democratic socialist and who has promised to go after Wall Street and redress social inequalities, features ""Feel the Bern"" mugs, T-shirts with slogans like ""Join the political revolution NOW"", and a ""Babies for Bernie"" baby bib.Hillary Clinton, who is expected to fend off the challenge from Sanders to become the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has run a much smaller campaign merchandise business.""Hillary is a huge front-runner in the polls, but in terms of passion, she's lagging,"" Ries said. ""Not as many people want to wear a Clinton T-shirt.""
T-SHIRTS AND COFFEE MUGS
The Sanders campaign has raised about $12.8 million in gross revenue from campaign merchandise sales, accounting for some 7 percent of total individual contributions so far, according to Kenneth Pennington, the campaign's digital director.He said the campaign had sold more than 800,000 individual items since launching last year, including 207,000 t-shirts and 44,000 coffee mugs. That gear cost the campaign $8.5 million to manufacture, representing about 5 percent of the campaign's total expenditures to date, according to federal disclosures, meaning the campaign's net revenue on merchandise is about $4.3 million. The primary manufacturer of the goods was Tigereye Promotions of Ohio.
Campaign reports do not require candidates to break out revenue from merchandise sales.Trump's merchandise business is smaller than Sanders', but still historically huge. The real estate developer has mainly used his own funds to finance his White House bid so far, but his campaign has raised more than $6 million in gross revenue by selling Trump trademark gifts and apparel, representing ""a majority"" of the campaign's individual contributions, according to spokeswoman Hope Hicks. ""The sale of official campaign products has been extremely successful,"" she said.That gear cost the campaign more than $4.7 million to produce. Among the most used manufacturers were Cali-Fame of California and Ace Specialties of Louisiana, according to federal campaign finance disclosures. The owner of Ace Specialties, Christl Mahfouz, is on the board of Trump's son's foundation, the Eric Trump Foundation, which raises money for terminally ill children.
Clinton's campaign, meanwhile, has spent just $1.4 million on swag manufacturing so far, according to campaign records. A campaign official was not immediately available to comment on how much the campaign had raised through the sale of that merchandise.""For Hillary, I suspect we will see more swag, as she tries to pick up Bernie supporters in the general election,"" said Karen Post, a brand consultant and author of ""Brand Turnaround"". ""What young person do you know who doesn't love T shirts?""The Trump and Sanders swag spending this year is unmatched by recent elections. Democratic President Barack Obama, seen as one of the best-branded presidential candidates in recent U.S. history, spent just $1.3 million on T-shirts, posters and bumper stickers during his first election bid in 2008, when he galvanized supporters behind his core messages of hope and change slogan and his rising sun campaign logo. Obama spent less than $70,000 on merchandise during his 2012 re-election bid against Republican Mitt Romney, whose campaign dished out $3.4 million on campaign promotional items, according to campaign finance reports.
