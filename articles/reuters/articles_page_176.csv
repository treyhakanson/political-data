| SACRAMENTO, Calif.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday signed a sweeping package of gun control bills, banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and expanding the definition of prohibited assault weapons in the wake of mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando.Democrats in the legislature rushed the measures through in hopes of passing them before their summer break, in part to try to forestall a competing gun control proposal headed for the November ballot. California already has some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation, but after the shooting spree in the Southern California city of San Bernardino last December, lawmakers began work on measures they said would close unintended loopholes.""My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,"" Brown said in a signing measure.It was a rare success for advocates of greater gun control.     U.S. lawmakers have fallen short in attempts to tighten gun laws after the killing of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last month. 
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a measure on Friday that would give authorities three days to prove that someone on a terrorism watch list should not be allowed to obtain a firearm. But Democrats rejected it as ""toothless.""The bills signed by Brown ban so-called bullet buttons, which allow quick changes in the magazine of a military-style weapon, and require background checks for purchasers of ammunition.Ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 bullets at a time will also be banned, and background checks will be needed for people borrowing guns from non-family members.Brown also vetoed several bills, including one that would have allowed co-workers, educators and mental health professionals to request restraining orders forbidding people deemed dangerous from owning guns. 
Gun rights advocates called bills a ""Gunpocalypse."" ""The California Legislature showed their true faces today,"" said Craig DeLuz, spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition. ""They abused the legislative process to enact their depraved anti-civil rights agenda.""Their efforts spilled into intra-party politics as well, after Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who is expected to run for governor in 2018, gathered enough signatures to place his own gun control referendum on the November ballot. 
The move angered the state Senate's top Democrat, Kevin de Leon, who had been working to pass many of the same measures through the legislature. Worried in part that Newsom's initiative would boost turnout in November among Republicans who oppose gun control, legislative Democrats rushed to pass their bills in time for Newsom to withdraw his measure.But the lieutenant governor refused.""Today's steps in the right direction will grow into a giant leap forward for public safety if voters pass the Safety for All initiative to keep guns and ammo out of the wrong hands,"" he said.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton's lead over Republican Donald Trump has dipped into the single digits among likely U.S. voters for the first time in nearly two weeks, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.The June 27-July 1 poll showed a 9.4 percentage point lead for the former secretary of state over the New York businessman, down slightly from an 11.2 point lead in a previous five-day poll that ended on June 28.Clinton had maintained a double-digit lead in the rolling poll since June 20, as she recovered from a brief boost in Trump's numbers in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, when he renewed a call for a ban on Muslim immigration.Among likely voters, 43.9 percent now support Clinton, compared with 34.5 percent for Trump. Another 21.7 percent of likely voters wouldn't support either candidate.
Clinton is more popular among men and women, young people and minorities, college graduates, and people who live on incomes that are both lower and higher than the national average. Trump has an edge among whites, people with lower levels of education, older Americans and retirees, and he leads among people who frequently attend church.Overall, voters have increasingly sided with Clinton since mid-May, when the two were about even in the poll. 
Trump is expected officially to become the Republican presidential nominee when the party holds its convention in another 2-1/2 weeks. Clinton is expected to become the Democratic nominee when the Democrats hold their convention a week later.The poll, which included responses from 1,080 likely voters, has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.5 percentage points.
Clinton's lead had widened to as much as 14 percentage points in the past two weeks as Republican leaders criticized Trump for his opposition to international trade agreements and a string of nativist comments about Hipsanics and Muslims.Clinton's campaign, meanwhile, has been dogged by allegations that she mishandled classified emails and failed to protect U.S. diplomats in Libya while secretary of state in Obama's first administration. She denies wrongdoing.   (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler)"

By Julia Edwards and Adam DeRose
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, seeking to tamp down a firestorm over meeting with former President Bill Clinton, said on Friday she will accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Hillary Clinton for mishandling emails.The United States' top law enforcement officer, however, stopped short of saying she would recuse herself from the investigation of the Democratic presidential candidate.""I will be informed of those findings, as opposed to never reading them or never seeing them, but I will be accepting their recommendations and their plan for going forward,"" Lynch said.She was responding to questions from a Washington Post journalist who was introducing a talk by Lynch at the Aspen Ideas Festival, a gathering of government, technology and other business leaders in Aspen, Colorado.Republicans, including presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have said a political appointee like Lynch should not be involved in the email investigation and that the Monday night meeting with Bill Clinton shows Lynch is too close to the Clintons.With a regretful tone, Lynch said on Friday she would not privately meet with Bill Clinton again and that she understood how the meeting ""casts a shadow"" over the perception of the Justice Department's probe into Hillary Clinton's email use.The attorney general said she has received many questions about her role in the investigation and ""whether someone who was a political appointee would be involved in deciding how to investigate."" Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, saying the Obama administration's Justice Department could not be free of bias. 
In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a daily news briefing that the investigation is being handled completely independently of the White House and President Barack Obama.Lynch was appointed by the Democratic president and sworn in on April 1, 2015, well after Hillary Clinton left Obama's Cabinet in 2013.Career prosecutors are not appointed by a president and may serve through different administrations. The FBI director is appointed by the president but is not part of his Cabinet and is considered apolitical.  Lynch said on Friday that she had already decided to accept whatever recommendations prosecutors presented her before her meeting with Bill Clinton. 
The private meeting with the former president took place on Lynch's plane after she landed in Phoenix on Monday night. Bill Clinton was leaving the airport after a rally for his wife earlier that day.Lynch told reporters earlier this week that she did not discuss the email probe or other matters pending before the Justice Department with Bill Clinton, calling their meeting ""primarily social."" The FBI is investigating Hillary Clinton's email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state, an issue that has overshadowed her campaign.She apologized last year for using the server, saying that while she did nothing wrong, she should have used two email accounts: one for State Department business and another for personal matters.
Representatives for her campaign could not be reached immediately for comment on Friday. Trump on Thursday called Lynch's meeting ""a sneak"" and questioned the judgment of both Bill Clinton and the attorney general.In a tweet on Friday, the wealthy businessman said the meeting showed the U.S. political system was ""totally rigged"" and that Hillary Clinton had bad judgment. ""Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!"" Trump said on Twitter.The Justice Department, along with the White House, has said the probe should be free of political interference.

By Nick Brown
| SAN JUAN

SAN JUAN Puerto Rico on Friday said it will default on $779 million worth of constitutionally backed debt, its most senior bonds, making good on threats that the island would choose paying essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors.Debt payments totaling just over $2 billion were due on Friday. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla told reporters on Friday that overall the U.S. commonwealth territory will not pay $911 million worth of its obligations.The U.S. territory's finances will soon come under a U.S. federal oversight board after U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law on Thursday a bill giving the island access to a debt restructuring process, and implementing a halt on litigation arising from any defaults on its $70 billion debt load.""Today, Puerto Rico is protected against creditors' actions,"" Garcia Padilla said.The General Obligation (GO) debt, or debt that carries a GO guarantee, is a category of debt that has not been defaulted upon by any U.S. state in decades. Puerto Rico is not covered by Chapter 9 U.S. bankruptcy code which applies to municipalities.Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank (GDB) said on Friday the island would have just $95 million in cash at the end of the year even after the defaults announced on Friday.Puerto Rico's benchmark 2035 GO bond rose 0.25 points in price to trade at 67.50 points, pushing the yield down to 12.519 percent.
On Thursday Garcia Padilla authorized Puerto Rico, under a locally written debt moratorium law, to suspend some of the $2 billion in debt payments due on Friday.The developments on Friday represent the nadir of a decade-long effort by Puerto Rico to avoid economic collapse. The island is hamstrung by emigration and a 45 percent poverty rate.    ""Even if the Commonwealth were to devote every last penny in the (accounts) to debt service on July 1, it would still owe holders of the public debt hundreds of millions of dollars,"" the GDB said in a statement on Friday.Some of the debt expected to be defaulted upon such as PBA (Public Building Authority) ex-series L bonds will be mostly covered by reserve funds held by the trustee bank. Nearly all of the payments due on the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA) Bond Anticipation Notes (BANs) will be covered by reserve funds as well.
    If some of the debt is covered by insurance policies, some creditors could receive a portion of their payments.    The GDB, Puerto Rico's primary fiscal agent, said the island has only $200 million in its operating account, and another $150 million in revenue that was redirected in recent months away from other debt payments.     Even if the island continues emergency measures like suspending vendor payments and withholding contributions to a pension fund that is already insolvent, the operating account will still run out of cash in 30 to 60 days, the GDB said.
""We knew this day would come, that they would default, and it is here. It was a good thing they passed PROMESA, even at the eleventh hour,"" Ted Hampton, senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service, said, referring to the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA).Late on Thursday the island's legislature approved an $8.9 billion fiscal 2017 budget, which now awaits Garcia Padilla's signature.In the wee hours of Friday, Puerto Rico released long-awaited audited financial statements for fiscal year 2014, more than a year late.    The statements, audited by KPMG, showed, among other things, that Puerto Rico's largest public pension has exhausted its assets and is now insolvent. Puerto Rico's pensions have among the largest funding gaps in U.S. history.""When I entered office, Puerto Rico was property of Wall Street,"" Garcia Padilla said, adding: ""Today, everybody concludes that we have been telling the truth about Puerto Rico's fiscal condition.""

WASHINGTON Donald Trump will meet this weekend with Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Pence spokesman said on Friday, after a report the governor was being vetted as a potential running mate for the Republican presidential candidate.As the Republican candidate for vice president, Pence, a social conservative from a Midwestern state, could help the real estate mogul reassure wary Republicans.The governor, who faces a tight race for re-election to a second term in Indiana, has praised Trump in the past but did not back him in the Republican Party's nominating race.""Governor Pence has accepted an invitation to spend a little time with Mr. Trump this weekend,"" said Marc Lotter, deputy campaign manager of Pence's re-election effort. ""This meeting is very consistent with meetings Mr. Trump is holding with many key party leaders.""Earlier, MSNBC, citing unnamed sources, said Trump is considering Pence, 57, as a potential running mate. The network, which first reported the upcoming meeting, said it was part of the vetting process.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich are also under consideration to be Trump's running mate, sources told Reuters. ""Trump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence,"" Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said in an email.
Republicans will hold their party convention July 18-21 in Cleveland to formally pick their nominee ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.Trump, 70, a real estate mogul and former television reality star, was scheduled to speak at rally in Colorado on Friday.He has said he has narrowed down his potential running mates to five or six contenders, according to media reports.
On Thursday, Pence told reporters he had not spoken with Trump since before Indiana's May 3 primary contest, MSNBC said. The governor had earlier pledged to back former Trump rival Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas and Tea Party favorite.

By Letitia Stein
| TAMPA, Fla.

TAMPA, Fla. A federal judge has blocked parts of a new Florida law aiming to cut off state funding for preventive health services at clinics that also provide abortions, acting shortly before the restrictions took effect on Friday.U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle issued a preliminary injunction late on Thursday after state Planned Parenthood affiliates challenged certain provisions as unconstitutional.Hinkle found the clinics were unacceptably targeted by state efforts to eliminate funding for other healthcare services they also provide, such as birth control and screening for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases.""The state's only beef is that the plaintiffs provide abortions,"" he wrote, noting that Florida already prohibits funding for abortions, as courts have held permissible.Florida is among many states adopting new abortion laws as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
Supporters argued that the wide-ranging law adopted this spring in Florida would protect women's health. It included restrictions similar to those in a Texas law that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down earlier this week.Planned Parenthood, however, did not challenge in its lawsuit a related provision requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a type of formal affiliation that can be difficult to obtain.The organization's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for Northern District of Florida, focused on the funding cuts, which it said jeopardized about $500,000 annually. Planned Parenthood also challenged a new requirement that state inspectors review 50 percent of patient medical records at abortion clinics.
Hinkle's 25-page injunction also blocked the additional inspections, noting that the volume requirements for abortion clinics far exceeded the standards for other medical facilities.""The inspection provision is a solution in search of a problem,"" Hinkle wrote.
In the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood also raised concerns about changes in how the state defines gestational stages. The terminology was clarified during a court hearing, said Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, who applauded the judge's ruling.""This means this vital programs will continue to go forward,"" she said in a phone interview. ""Because anti-women's health politicians want to end abortion, they went to the lengths of trying to stop these preventive services."" The Florida Department of Health, named in the lawsuit, did not immediately provide comment. Neither did the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican.

WASHINGTON A U.S. report on the number of civilian casualties from American counterterrorism strikes will be issued later on Friday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.President Barack Obama has long promised to increase transparency about his administration's use of drones. His administration said in March it would publicly release an assessment of combatant and noncombatant casualties from U.S. counterterrorism strikes in areas outside active war zones since 2009.The drone campaign has come under criticism by human rights groups and others who say the strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Libya have caused civilian casualties.
Human rights groups, which accuse the Obama administration of not being forthcoming about the precise guidelines that govern drone strikes, have welcomed the expected report amid their calls for greater transparency about the impact from such strikes.

By Ayesha Rascoe
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said Congress must end its deadlock on funding to combat the Zika virus before lawmakers head out to recess later this summer.""The good news is we feel fairly confident that we can develop an effective vaccine for Zika,"" Obama said after a meeting with U.S. health officials in the Oval Office. ""The problem is right now that money is stuck in Congress.""Obama met with the heads of the Health and Human Services Department, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to discuss the nation's response to the mosquito-borne virus.Earlier this week, Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal to provide $1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika. Democrats and the White House said the plan fell short of Obama's $1.9 billion funding request and included measures that would take funds from other important health initiatives.""We have not seen the House (of Representatives) and Senate come together in a sensible way to put forward the dollars that we have requested to get the job done,"" Obama said. ""I expect Congress to get this funding done before they adjourn, as part of their basic responsibility.""
U.S. lawmakers typically go on recess in August to go campaign for re-election in their home districts. Following the deadlock, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have accused each other of playing politics with the health crisis.
Zika has caused concern throughout the Americas due to an alarming rise in cases of the birth defect known as microcephaly and other severe fetal brain abnormalities linked to the virus reported in Brazil, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. Infants with microcephaly tend to have abnormally small heads and may experience potentially disabling developmental problems.While Obama said there have not been any cases reported of local transmission of the virus in the continental United States, he said the nation is home to mosquitoes that carry the virus.
""It is absolutely critical for the United States government, working in concert with other governments in the hemisphere, to be pushing hard right now to get this situation under control,"" Obama said.As of June 23, there have been seven babies born in the United States with microcephaly or other Zika-related birth defects such as serious brain abnormalities, and five lost pregnancies from either miscarriage, stillbirth or termination.
