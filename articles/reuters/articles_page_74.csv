| SYDNEY/SINGAPORE

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE Investors and traders in Asia indicated on Monday they are mostly increasing their bets on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton winning the U.S. presidential race after the second of three debates with Republican party nominee Donald Trump. Some, though remain cautious, saying there was still a chance of a surprise Trump win. They said many in the markets were wary after being burned by the shock ""Brexit"" vote in June.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up around 0.1 percent by mid-afternoon in Singapore on Monday, while Wall Street index futures were little changed after Clinton exchanged barbs with Republican party nominee Donald Trump in the televised event, which was shown live across trading rooms during Asia's morning. The 90-minute debate quickly turned into an acrimonious discussion of a 2005 video that emerged on Friday in which Trump was heard using vulgar language and talking about groping women.  The controversy has caused some senior Republicans to withdraw their support for him. ""For those that think that Trump has a very, very low chance of winning the U.S. elections it might be a good time to go long on global equities,"" said Itay Tuchman, Citi's head of markets for Australia and New Zealand.Markets could be prematurely pricing in a Clinton victory, as they did during the ""Brexit"" vote in June, when the United Kingdom voted unexpectedly to leave the European Union, said Lee Jin Yang, research analyst for Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore.""We need to remember that Brexit only became a key focus one week before the vote. The market had priced in near zero probability of it happening but it did."" According to a CNN online poll, Clinton won the debate by  57 percent to 34 percent.
But Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors in Hong Kong, said he is wary of such polls - especially after Brexit. ""The way that mainstream media, and a lot of commentators, interpret the outcome of the debate may be different to what the voting public in general takes away,"" Crabb said. ""That is a concern because often, a lot of these polls have not been quite as accurate as people are expecting.""Mathan Somasundarum, a strategist at stock brokerage Baillieu Holst in Sydney, said a Clinton victory would reduce the risk of the United States adopting a strong trade protectionist policy. Trump has been highly critical of the NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and Canada as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress. He has promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it.""I would expect the U.S. dollar to weaken and you would expect then there is some pressure coming off emerging markets, and then commodities, which (are a) proxy for emerging markets,"" Somasundarum said. ""China, commodities and the Aussie dollar should do better.""While the markets had already begun to price in a Clinton victory even before the Republican party's crisis over Trump's 2005 remarks, some are beginning to game out what would happen if the Democrats won both houses of Congress, which are now Republican controlled. 
The possibility of the Democrats controlling Congress and the White House is a concern to some in the markets as they see it leading to more regulation of businesses and higher taxes.""Over time, people will start thinking, is this going to mean a big difference in the way taxation works? Is it going to mean more government involvement?,"" said Crabb at Old Mutual Global in Hong Kong. ""But the immediate reaction will be a relief rally.""Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney, said while markets usually view one party dominating the government as a risk, it could be different this time.""Investors have been disappointed by the political stalemate over recent years, which has prevented meaningful and well-needed changes being pursued,"" Gluskie said.
Steven Friedman, senior investment strategist at BNP Paris bas Investment Partners in New York, said he saw little in the debate that represented a game-changer for either candidate. ""This obviously plays to Clinton's advantage, given her lead in the polls,"" he said.Strategists in a recent Reuters equity poll mostly viewed an election victory on Nov. 8 by Clinton as more positive for the stock market through the end of the year, largely because her positions - unlike her opponent's - are well-known. Chris Brankin, chief executive at stock brokerage TD Ameritrade Asia, said he thought Trump was much better prepared for the town hall debate in St. Louis than he was for the first debate, and that could give markets some pause. ""I have always said markets 'know what they get' with Hillary, as she as always been seen as pro-Wall Street and Trump is a bit of an unknown for investors.  ""After tonight's debate I still think there are a lot of questions as who will be elected into office next month and markets are probably going to remain range-bound till after the U.S. elections.""

| PORT-AU-PRINCE

PORT-AU-PRINCE Haiti started burying some of its dead in mass graves in the wake of Hurricane Matthew, a government official said on Sunday, as cholera spread in the devastated southwest and the death toll from the storm rose to 1,000 people.The powerful hurricane, the fiercest Caribbean storm in nearly a decade, slammed into Haiti on Tuesday with 145 mile-per-hour (233 kph) winds and torrential rains that left 1.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.A Reuters tally of numbers from local officials showed that 1,000 people were killed by the storm in Haiti, which has a population of about 10 million and is the poorest country in the Americas.The official death toll from the central civil protection agency is 336, a slower count because officials must visit each village to confirm the numbers.
Authorities had to start burying the dead in mass graves in Jeremie because the bodies were starting to decompose, said Kedner Frenel, the most senior central government official in the Grand'Anse region on Haiti's western peninsula. Frenel said 522 people were killed in Grand'Anse alone. A tally of deaths reported by mayors from 15 of 18 municipalities in Sud Department on the south side of the peninsula showed 386 people there. In the rest of the country, 92 people were killed, the same tally showed. 
Frenel said there was great concern about cholera spreading, and that authorities were focused on getting water, food and medication to the thousands of people living in shelters.Cholera causes severe diarrhea and can kill within hours if untreated. It is spread through contaminated water and has a short incubation period, which leads to rapid outbreaks.
Government teams fanned out across the hard-hit southwestern tip of the country over the weekend to repair treatment centers and reach the epicenter of one outbreak. (Reporting by Joseph Guyler Delva; Writing by Christine Murray; Editing by Diane Craft and Paul Tait)"

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump paced, frowned and physically loomed at times over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during Sunday night's town-hall debate, prompting bewilderment and mockery from some on social media.The online reaction underscored the contentious tone of the encounter in St. Louis in which Trump and Clinton hurled insults at each other less than a month before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.Twitter users seized on Trump's body language, with some remarking that he appeared to have ""stalked"" Clinton around the stage. The criticism came as the Republican faces a political storm after being caught on a leaked 2005 videotape making lewd and demeaning remarks about women.""#Trump's body language [was] bizarre,"" wrote Twitter user Sheena (@texdakota). ""Pacing, insulting, standing right behind her.""
""Trump's body language freaked me out,"" wrote Charlotte (@charlotteirene8). ""I get very uncomfortable when men stand behind me, especially like that.""A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Clinton's performance inspired online criticism as well. ""Clinton could have done better,"" tweeted ryank (@ryantkelly). ""Didn't seem as hungry, as able to get under his skin tonight.""Sentiment on Trump's performance was 66.9 percent negative, according to an analysis by social intelligence firm Brandwatch of Twitter posts during the debate, while Clinton's was 57.8 percent negative.
The debate, which featured questions from audience members, was the most tweeted-about debate ever, with more than 17 million tweets, said Twitter spokesman Nick Pacilio.Trump's statement that he and running mate Mike Pence differed on their approach to military intervention in Syria was the most-talked-about moment of the night on the microblogging site.

WASHINGTON There was a moment in Sunday's U.S. presidential debate when Democrat Hillary Clinton was trying to fend off an attack from Republican rival Donald Trump about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" Clinton said of her rival for the Nov. 8 election.""Because you'd be in jail,"" Trump shot back, drawing a mix of gasps and applause from the crowd that was defying instructions to remain silent.It was one of the most explosive moments of the debate in St. Louis, and unprecedented for one presidential candidate to suggest on a debate stage that his opponent should be in jail.The debate was crammed with moments that could at best be described as petty and at worse vicious - as the candidates traded personal attacks and sarcastic one-liners.Trump frequently interrupted Clinton and sparred with the two debate moderators, who in turn chastised the crowd for occasional outbursts.
When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Clinton if Trump had the discipline to be a good leader, Clinton responded with one word: ""No.""""I'm shocked to hear that,"" Trump responded sarcastically.He called Clinton names, including referring to her as ""the devil"" when discussing the support for her by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.

""We have a divided nation, because people like her - and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart,"" Trump said a few minutes later.
Clinton in turn jabbed at Trump for his lewd remarks about women captured on a 2005 videotape released on Friday that has thrown his candidacy into crisis.""OK, Donald, I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you,"" Clinton said.After 90 minutes of such harsh exchanges, the mood changed suddenly when the final question came from an audience member who asked each candidate to describe one admirable quality about the other.
""I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald,"" Clinton said.Trump said of Clinton: ""She doesn't quit, she doesn't give up, I respect that.""At the close of the debate, they shook hands, something they had notably avoided doing when the night started.

By Richard Cowan and Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON/ST. LOUIS

WASHINGTON/ST. LOUIS The U.S. Republican Party on Sunday confronted its biggest crisis in more than 40 years when its presidential nominee, Donald Trump, faced a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women in a newly uncovered 2005 video.Only a month before the Nov. 8 election and on a day when Trump was due to debate Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump took to social media to squelch any speculation that he would leave the race.""Tremendous support (except for some Republican leadership""). Thank you,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.Then in a last-minute surprise in St. Louis, host city for the town-hall debate, Trump called journalists into a hotel room to witness a meeting he held with four women who revived accusations of past sexual misdeeds by Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton.The party turmoil recalled past party crises, including the Watergate scandal that led to Republican President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974.A businessman-turned-politician previously best known to Americans as a reality TV show host, Trump, 70, faced his latest crisis when on Friday the 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.The controversy pitched Trump, 70, into the biggest crisis of his 16-month-old campaign and deepened fissures between him and establishment Republicans. On Sunday, he struck a defiant tone in the face of calls for him to abandon the race.A source close to the campaign of Trump's vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, dismissed talk among some political analysts the Indiana governor might bolt the ticket in the uproar over Trump's comments.""Absolutely not,"" the source told Reuters.At a Democratic campaign event in Chicago, President Barack Obama weighed in on the controversy, saying Trump had been degrading not only to women, but to minorities, immigrants, people of other faiths, and the disabled.
Obama said that ""tells you he is insecure.""""He pumps himself up by putting other people down,"" Obama said.SUPPORT WOBBLING
With Republican Party leaders in crisis mode and doubts emerging over Trump's ability to draw support from crucial undecided voters, there were nonetheless some early signs many of his core supporters would remain loyal.A public opinion poll by POLITICO/Morning Consult, taken just after news broke of the video, found 39 percent of voters thought Trump should withdraw, and 45 percent said he should stay. Of those who said Trump should leave, only 12 percent identified themselves as Republicans.
As of Sunday afternoon, at least 160 of the United States' 332 sitting Republican governors, senators and House of Representatives members had condemned Trump's remarks, according to a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage.At least 30 had called for him to withdraw from the race and three other officeholders said he should consider doing so. Eight of those said they were withdrawing their endorsement as well.Those facing a difficult re-election were more likely to speak out. All but six of the 40 Republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive had condemned Trump's comments on the video, although only three members of that group called for him to drop out.Any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles. The Trump campaign was battling back, circulating ""talking points"" to a core of high-profile Republicans who promote Trump in the news media. The points sought to undermine establishment Republicans who have abandoned Trump.
""They are more concerned with their political future than they are about the future of the country,"" said a copy of the talking points, described to Reuters by two sources close to the campaign.A real estate developer making his first run at public office, Trump has made his battle against the establishment a central campaign theme.""Phones have been blowing up for the past 24 hours,"" said a prominent Republican political operative in Washington, referring to a heavy volume of calls among party officials and Republican members of Congress.   DOWN-BALLOT RACES
The operative, who did not want to be identified, said Trump's troubles could steer campaign donations away from him and to Republican candidates for Congress and other down-ballot offices.The source said Trump could help himself most during the presidential debate - the second of three before the election - if he addressed the video and an Oct. 1 New York Times report that he took so substantial a tax deduction on a declared $916 million loss in 1995 that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years.Despite having recovered from a string of setbacks, Trump had an uphill battle to win the White House. Before the video surfaced, a Reuters/Ipsos poll had Clinton leading by 5 points on Friday. The question now is whether Trump's quest for the presidency has been dealt a lethal blow.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, facing eroding support from his party over lewd remarks about women, goes into a second presidential debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton on Sunday needing to demonstrate he remains a credible candidate.The pressure on the 70-year-old Trump at the debate will be intense. Not only must he parry attacks from Clinton and explain why he is a better alternative. He must also show an apologetic side to stop more Republican supporters from giving up on him.Trump already had an uphill battle to win the White House in the Nov. 8 election before disclosure of a 2005 video in which he could be heard talking crudely about women.A Reuters-Ipsos poll had Clinton leading by five points on Friday, before the video surfaced. Now, the question is whether Trump's quest for the presidency is all but over.The fresh controversy adds an air of unpredictability over the 9 p.m. EDT debate at Washington University in St. Louis, the second of three scheduled presidential debates as the long-running U.S. election contest enters its final weeks.It will be a town hall-style debate with undecided voters posing half the questions and the debate's two moderators posing the others.His vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said on Sunday that Trump needs to show contrition.
""We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night,"" Pence said in a statement.The crisis has put the Republican National Committee in a tight spot with less than a month to go until Election Day.Trump would have to resign the nomination to allow Republican leaders to choose a successor, but the New York businessman is showing no signs of stepping down despite increasing calls from elected leaders for him to let Pence become the nominee.""The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN!"" Trump tweeted on Sunday from Trump Tower in New York.
At the first debate, on Sept. 26, Trump was repeatedly put on the defensive by Clinton. He never let her accusations go unanswered, and as a result he missed opportunities to use his speaking time to draw attention to Clinton's perceived weaknesses.Republicans said Trump needed to perform more like Pence, who was deemed the winner in his vice presidential debate against Democratic rival Tim Kaine last week.Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said there is plenty Trump could learn from Pence, who stayed on offense at the vice-presidential debate, did not bother to respond to Kaine's accusations, and looked calm and unflappable.""It was a clear lesson in how you avoid falling into your opponent's traps,"" Bonjean said. ""Don't talk about what the other side wants you to talk about, focus on what you want to talk about.""
Clinton has been hunkered down for days getting ready for what could be, for her, a knockout blow against Trump.Before the video surfaced, Clinton campaign officials said they were expecting the Republican nominee to come to the debate more subdued than the first round.But they were also prepared in case Trump follows through with a threat to focus on Clinton's sometimes troubled marriage to former President Bill Clinton.Clinton, who has already capitalized on Trump's treatment of women, herself foreshadowed how she might respond to an attack from Trump on her marriage during a speech to a fundraiser in Washington on Wednesday.""I feel it's my responsibility not to defend myself against his attacks because, really, been there, done that,"" she said. ""I think it's my responsibility to defend everybody else against his attacks,"" she said, drawing cheers from the crowd.Clinton has her own issues to face. Wikileaks on Friday published an email from Clinton advisers appearing to contain excerpts of paid speeches to corporations, in which Clinton voices support for open trade and borders and says how sometimes it is important to have a public and private position.

MEXICO CITY Mexico's peso surged more than 1.8 percent against the dollar on Sunday ahead of the U.S. presidential debate, after comments Donald Trump made about women in a video created a storm around his campaign.The currency moved after markets in Asia began Monday trading. At 3 p.m. CDT (2000 GMT), the peso had strengthened 1.89 percent to 18.955 per dollar.Republican nominee Donald Trump has vowed he would build a wall on the border with Mexico and renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement if he is elected. 
The United States is Mexico's main trading partner and Wall Street analysts say concern over any potential trade restrictions have hurt the peso.

By Joel Schectman and Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Some prominent Republicans are urging Donald Trump to quit as the party's presidential nominee after video surfaced of him making vulgar comments about women but any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles.The real estate magnate has insisted he would never give up the White House race and wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Republicans who are attacking him are ""self-righteous hypocrites.""    With only a month to go before the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, it would be a massive stretch to substitute Trump for his running mate Mike Pence or anyone else, Republican strategists and U.S. election experts said.    It is ""virtually impossible to replace somebody in August, let alone October,"" Republican strategist Karl Rove said on ""Fox News Sunday."" After a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced Friday, Republicans such as U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois urged Trump to remove himself from the race.The 2005 video showed Trump, then a reality TV star speaking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. Making a change at the top of the ticket for one of the two major parties this close to Election Day would be without precedent in the history of modern U.S. presidential elections.In 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern's running mate, Thomas Eagleton, was replaced after it was revealed that the vice presidential hopeful had been hospitalized for depression. Eagleton withdrew from the race in August of that year and was replaced by Sargent Shriver.
In 2000, Missouri voters faced a last-minute candidate change in the state's U.S. Senate race after the Democratic challenger Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash, a month before the election. Carnahan's name remained on the ballot, however, and the dead man won the election. His widow, Jean Carnahan was appointed to fill the seat.  Republican party rules do not include a mechanism to involuntarily remove from the ticket a presidential candidate who has already been nominated. The party does have procedure, known as Rule 9, that outlines the process for filling a vacancy if a nominee were to die or quit.Republican leaders could try to pressure Trump into resigning by withdrawing financial support for his campaign and withholding logistical help. But as of Sunday, Trump showed no sign of backing down and went on the attack against party figures who have suggested he leave the race.
But if Trump were to decide to quit, the process would involve convening a 160-member committee of the Republican convention to select a new nominee, said Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian at Vanderbilt University.Experts say such a step would lead to electoral chaos with Republican attorneys fighting state-by-state legal battles to make the last-minute candidate swaps on paper ballots, long after many state deadlines have already passed.Even more daunting, would be how to deal with early or overseas votes already cast. About 411,000 Americans already have voted in person or through the mail, according to Michael P. McDonald, a Florida State University political science professor who tracks early voting. The figure is sure to grow dramatically over the coming days. Early voting has already begun in six states and this week it will start in eight more.Another problem for Republicans is the risk of legal challenges to the election result. Concern about such challenges could deter some Republicans from voting.
The Republican Party might argue that those ballots already cast for Trump should count toward electoral votes for the replacement candidate, said Matthew Dallek, an expert on presidential politics at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile said the party would likely challenge any effort by Republicans to replace Trump as their candidate on the ballot, adding that it would be ""very confusing"" for voters with early ballots already being cast.""It would be political suicide for Donald Trump to step down right now,"" she told ABC News. ""I'm sure my legal team is already looking at efforts underway, if there are any efforts underway,"" she said when asked if Democrats would oppose any effort by Republicans in the states to switch candidates on ballots.Dallek said an effort to substitute a new candidate at this point would lead to ""utter chaos.""""We would be operating in uncharted territory. You would be in this legal netherworld,"" he said. (Additional reporting by Andy Sullivan and Susan Heavey; Editing by Bill Trott and Alistair Bell)"

By Emily Stephenson and Ginger Gibson

 (Editors Note: Attention language that may be offensive to some readers in paragraphs 22, 23, 24)By Emily Stephenson and Ginger GibsonNEW YORK/WASHINGTON With his campaign in crisis, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed on Saturday to stay in the race despite calls from more than two dozen prominent Republicans for him to drop out following the release of a recording of him making lewd comments about women.Both Trump's wife and his running mate criticized his words, saying they were insulting and indefensible. ""The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly -  I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN!"" Trump wrote on Saturday afternoon on the social media website Twitter.  The video was the latest calamity for Trump, who had hoped to revive his flagging campaign in the face of a recent drop in polls with less than a month until Election Day. Trump is due to appear alongside Democrat Hillary Clinton on Sunday in their second debate in the run-up to the general election. Clinton is not expected to address Trump's video before then.     The 2005 video of Trump talking on an open microphone showed the then-reality TV star speaking about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.In a statement, Melania Trump called her husband's words ""unacceptable and offensive to me.""""This does not represent the man that I know,"" she said. ""He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.""The backlash over the video was swift and widespread. More than 60 prominent Republican current and former officeholders issued statements condemning Trump's remarks about women, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and John McCain, the party's standard bearer in 2008. More than 20 called for Trump to end his presidential bid. In an unusual move, his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence issued a critical statement of Trump's words, saying on Twitter that he ""cannot defend them.""""As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump,"" said Pence, who is governor of Indiana.
Pence indicated he would continue to support Trump, despite calls from several Republicans for Trump to step aside and let Pence be the nominee.    There is no precedent for a major party to replace its nominee this late in the campaign and it was unclear if there was an avenue to force him out. Voting has begun in several states, including swing states Virginia and North Carolina.A recorded apology by Trump early on Saturday did not stymie an avalanche of calls from members of his party to quit. Trump huddled on Saturday in Trump Tower with senior advisers, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Despite previous scheduling, Giuliani will appear on five major Sunday morning news programs, a rare round robin reserved for major news events - replacing Republican Chairman Reince Priebus on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on ""Fox News Sunday,"" a last-minute switch. No reason was given for the bump of Conway. A CBS news release said the RNC asked to replace Priebus because Trump's operation wanted ""a campaign person"" to appear on the program.Trump left the building briefly to greet a small crowd of supporters, saying ""100 percent"" he would remain in the race. Before returning to a bank of elevators, he told reporters, ""Tremendous support.""He quickly moved to do damage control in Saturday's video in which he declared himself a changed man and attempted to shift the focus to his opponent Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. On Twitter, Trump posted critical statements from Juanita Broaddrick, a woman who has accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her.
""Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,"" Trump said in his video statement, posted on his Facebook page.    COMMENTS CONDEMNED
Trump has struggled to win over women voters, and the video was expected to further feed Democratic criticism about his past behavior toward women. Trump's support has suffered among suburban women and white, college-educated women, groups that Republicans have traditionally won.In the recording that triggered the firestorm, Trump said of one woman, ""I did try and fuck her. She was married."" He went on to discuss his attraction to others.""I just start kissing them,"" he said. ""And when you're a star they let you do it.""
""Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,"" Trump said.On Saturday afternoon, CNN published a separate report detailing remarks Trump made over the course of several years while appearing on Howard Stern's radio program.The remarks included discussing the size of his daughter's breasts and that he once had sex with three women at the same time. Trump was asked if he would have sex with a black woman and responded, ""It depends on what your definition of black is."" The remarks were the last straw for some Republicans who have stuck with him through a series of controversial remarks, including calling Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and ""criminals,"" calling for a ban on Muslim immigrants, attacking a judge of Mexican descent, attacking the Gold Star family of a Muslim soldier killed at war and saying Senator John McCain was not a war hero because he had been a prisoner of war.House Speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump to a scheduled appearance on Saturday in Wisconsin. Pence declined to speak in his place.The list of Republicans announcing they would not vote for Trump or calling on him to step aside grew on Saturday: Senators Kelly Ayotte, Lisa Murkowsi, Dan Sullivan, Mark Kirk, Jeff Flake, John Thune, Mike Crapo, Shelley Moore Capito and Mike Lee; House members Jason Chaffetz, Mia Love, Joe Heck, Bradley Byrne, Martha Roby and Barbara Comstock; and Governors John Kasich, Dennis Daugaard and Gary Herbert. Additionally, former presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Carly Fiorina and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on Trump to quit.""Donald Trump's behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy,"" McCain said in a statement. While Democrats largely remained silent, opting to let Republicans attack one of their own, Vice President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter, ""The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. It's not lewd. It's sexual assault."" Some prominent Republicans indicated they would stick with Trump. Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, and Tony Perkins, head of the conservative Family Research Council, said they would continue to support him.""I think 10 years ago he was a different man,"" said Representative Jack Kingston, a Republican from Georgia. ""I am very glad that he quickly apologized.""

By Luciana Lopez and Jeff Mason
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Supporters of former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday expressed anger and vindication over leaked comments made by Hillary Clinton to banks and big business that appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to Wall Street.Clinton, who needs Sanders' coalition of young and left-leaning voters to propel her to the presidency, pushes for open trade and open borders in one of the speeches, and takes a conciliatory approach to Wall Street, both positions she later backed away from in an effort to capture the popular appeal of Sanders' attacks on trade deals and powerful banks. The excerpts of remarks by the former secretary of state, made in 2013 and 2014 in closed-door meetings where audiences paid to attend, were published online on Friday by WikiLeaks, which sourced them to the email account of John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the speech transcripts. Clinton has previously declined to release any such transcripts.""This is a very clear illustration of why there is a fundamental lack of trust from progressives for Hillary Clinton,"" said Tobita Chow, chair of the People's Lobby in Chicago, which endorsed Sanders in the primary election.""The progressive movement needs to make a call to Secretary Clinton to clarify where she stands really on these issues and that's got to involve very clear renunciations of the positions that are revealed in these transcripts,"" Chow said.The revelations were quickly overshadowed by the release of an 11-year-old recording of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, making lewd comments about women. TRUST PROBLEM

Clinton has worked hard to build trust with so-called progressives, adopting several of Sanders' positions after she bested him in the primary race. The U.S. senator from Vermont now supports his former rival in the Nov. 8 general election against Trump.Still, Clinton has struggled to win support from young ""millennials"" who were crucial to Sanders' success, and some Democrats expressed concern that the leaks would discourage those supporters from showing up to vote. ""That is a big concern and this certainly doesn't help,"" said Larry Cohen, chair of the board of Our Revolution, a progressive organization formed in the wake of Sanders' bid for the presidency, which aims to keep pushing the former candidate's ideas at a grassroots level. ""It matters in terms of turnout, energy, volunteering, all those things.""The Clinton campaign said it would not confirm the accuracy of the documents released by WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. ""We are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange, who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton,"" said Glen Caplin, a campaign spokesman. 
""Guccifer 2.0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign,"" he said, referring to the hacker or hacking group that altered some data stolen from the Democratic National Committee before making it public earlier this year. The U.S. government on Friday formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the election.FACEBOOK BACKLASH 

The origin of the leaks did not dampen social media criticism of the speeches by some.""Bernie was right about Hillary,"" wrote Facebook user Grace Tilly, ""she's a tool for Wall Street.""""Clinton is the politicians' politician - exactly the Wall Street insider Bernie described,"" wrote Facebook user Brian Leach.Spokesmen for Sanders did not respond to requests for comment. NBC News quoted a statement from Sanders saying he would work to advance the Democrats' policy platform.""Whatever Secretary Clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on Wall Street, I am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic Party platform which was agreed to by her campaign,"" the statement said.Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf said progressive voters would still choose the former first lady, even with misgivings.""I'd like to meet the Bernie Sanders supporter who is going to say, 'Well I'm a little worried about her on international trade, so I'm going to vote for Donald Trump',"" he said.
