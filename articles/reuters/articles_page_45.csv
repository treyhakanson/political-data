By Valerie Volcovici
| HUNTINGTON, WV

HUNTINGTON, WV When Carissa Sellards talks to her West Virginia University friends about post-graduation plans, one dilemma keeps coming up - whether to stay in their home state or strike out for more promising opportunities elsewhere.If recent history holds, over half of them will either not find work or leave the state, contributing to a brain drain of young talent that is pushing the state to try to reinvent its economy and break with a coal industry in long-term decline. ""Companies don't come here to invest because they only associate us with coal,"" said Sellards, a 20-year-old sophomore who addressed the state legislature when she was in high school about the lack of opportunities for young people in a post-coal economy.The often stark choices faced by Sellards and other young, educated West Virginians underline the challenges awaiting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton here and in other ""Rust Belt"" states if she wins the Nov. 8 election, as most polls suggest she will.West Virginia is expected to vote decisively for Republican Donald Trump, who has gained in recent polls and promises to revive the coal industry and put miners back to work by easing environmental restrictions and renegotiating trade deals to America's advantage. It is a message that has resonated with millions of older voters in other Rust Belt states facing declines in manufacturing jobs and feeling threatened by foreign competition.    But it largely rings hollow for college-educated millennials like Sellards, who are seeking jobs in the service economy or technology sector.By contrast, Clinton alienated swathes of West Virginia voters by saying earlier this year that ""we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"" in transitioning to cleaner energy. Coal industry backers have long accused President Barack Obama of waging a ""war on coal"" by imposing tougher environmental standards.Clinton later apologized for her comment, and has proposed a $30 billion plan to help revitalize coal communities. The plan promises to secure health benefits for former coal workers, invest in new infrastructure such as broadband access, and repurpose old mines and power plant sites.Clinton energy adviser Trevor Houser has said her challenge will be to help coal and other Rust Belt communities deal with economic realities rather than ""false promises"" of restoring dying industries.Beneath the nostalgic coal rhetoric, West Virginia officials and grassroots groups have quietly started to focus on reversing the flight of college-educated millennials to help drive an economic revival. Of the 124,358 students who graduated from public higher education in West Virginia in the last decade, 58,730 were working in the state in 2014, a work participation rate of 47.2 percent, according to a report released by West Virginia University's Bureau of Business and Economic Research on Monday. The state had the 11th biggest net outflow of college degree holders from 2007-2014, according to the most recent U.S. census. One barrier to keeping graduates in state is a business start-up rate that is the lowest in the country at 5.1 percent in 2014, the most recent year of available data.
A Reuters analysis of national data shows a strong connection between migration patterns of college graduates and local start-up rates: Among the 25 states with start-up rates below the 2014 median of 6.8 percent, 19 saw a net outflow of college grads between 2007 and 2014.The debate over West Virginia's economic future comes as its coal production this year hit its lowest level since the 1970s. West Virginia's energy sector, which includes coal, natural gas production and utilities, account for 17 percent of the state's GDP but only 4 percent of employment. Coal industry employment plunged 53 percent between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, down from nearly 26,000 to just over 12,000. The government is the state's biggest employer, accounting for 20 percent of jobs, with healthcare a fast-growing sector at 17 percent. In 2014, West Virginia's real GDP grew 0.7 percent from the previous year compared to the national average of 2.2 percent. The state is one of a few whose population shrank over the past two years, according to the latest national census. By median age it is the second-oldest U.S. state, four years above the national average.    At the West Virginia University Institute of Technology's new campus in Beckley, which opened in August, close to some of the state's coal counties, officials hope to turn the struggling city into an innovation hub.
In addition to offering courses in burgeoning fields like computer science, sustainable tourism and health care, WVU Tech hosts the Launch Lab, a small business incubator that helps budding entrepreneurs bring ideas to fruition.Joe Carlucci, a small business coach and director of the LaunchLab, said West Virginia is at the start of a long process of reinvention after decades of mourning coal.""They are prepared to plant that seed and not see the shade of that tree,"" he said. ""They are seeing that we have to change our own story."" 
FEDERAL SUPPORT
Although Clinton would struggle to regain popularity in Rust Belt states if elected, these regions would have an incentive to work with her administration to tap into federal grants.West Virginia Republican Congressman Evan Jenkins, a member of the House appropriations committee who represents the state's southern coal-producing regions, said the state cannot turn down assistance to diversify its economy.
""I want to continue fueling grant-making opportunities to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit and energy of the state's millennials,"" he told Reuters at a ceremony in August in which federal grants were awarded.But unleashing that spirit will require a significant investment in infrastructure, specifically broadband access, something that local lawmakers ignored when coal was still performing well eight years ago, said Chris Walters, a 30-year old Republican state senator.  Walters is focused on getting legislation passed to expand broadband access throughout the mountainous state, which ranks near the bottom of the list of broadband connectivity, just ahead of Guam and Puerto Rico.""If we don't give connectivity to our residents, we aren't giving them the opportunity to succeed in the global economy,"" said Walters.In state capital Charleston, NGO Generation West Virginia has helped pass legislation to attract young entrepreneurs seeking low-cost alternatives to places like Denver or San Francisco, including a bill to waive business start-up fees to people under 30 and another to allow crowd-funding to help seed new businesses.Entrepreneurship also extends to industries like agriculture, which state officials see as an opportunity in the state's rural coal counties.An entrepreneurship program called the Coalfield Development Corporation won a $2 million grant this year to help train young people from coal counties to run businesses, offering them college classes, life skills and paid apprenticeships.Ben Gilmer, the 34-year-old director of the corporation's agriculture entrepreneurship program Refresh Appalachia, said part of Clinton's challenge in coal country will be to sell the vision of a future that is unfamiliar.Small programs like his can offer concrete examples and help ease the transition, he said.""Politicians take advantage of people's fear of what comes next,"" Gilmer said. ""But five years from now, we will have examples and that will speak louder than any rhetoric that's out there.""

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's promise to restore American jobs by renegotiating international trade deals appears to be failing him in states most affected by outsourcing, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.Voters in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania - three competitive states in the Nov. 8 election that form the bulk of a region dubbed the Rust Belt for its swaths of shuttered factories - favor Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, on the issue of trade, according to the polling, with some respondents citing how international trade can bring down prices.The results underscore the uphill battle the New York businessman faces on Election Day, when he needs to sweep a broad array of battleground states to win the White House.""Trump has made a strong effort to portray Clinton as favorable to trade policies that he has labeled 'a disaster' for the United States,"" said Thomas Nelson, a political science professor at Ohio State University.        In the automaking state of Michigan, which has voted reliably for Democratic candidates in recent presidential elections but which Trump has fought hard to win, some 40 percent of likely voters believed Clinton would be better equipped to address trade, compared with 36 percent for Trump.In Ohio, known for its aerospace, steel and rubber industries, 45 percent said Clinton would be better on trade, compared with 38 percent for Trump. In Pennsylvania, long a steel and heavy manufacturing center, 45 percent favored Clinton on trade, compared with 38 percent for Trump, according to the polling, conducted in mid-October.Clinton is leading Trump in all three states among likely voters, with advantages of 4 points in Michigan, 3 points in Ohio and 6 points in Pennsylvania, according to the Reuters/Ipsos polling. But other polls show the race tightening in those states. RealClearPolitics, which averages data from most major polls, shows Clinton leading Trump by 6.6 points in Michigan and 5.1 points in Pennsylvania, and Trump leading Clinton by 2.7 points in Ohio.
Officials for Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.'WHAT JOBS ARE YOU BRINGING BACK?'
Poll respondents reached by Reuters who favored Clinton on trade mainly gave two reasons - first, that international trade deals can help people by lowering prices for goods; and second, they doubt Trump can deliver on his promise to restore the U.S. manufacturing sector.""We all like to have inexpensive items,"" Ronald Lane, 56, of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, who plans to vote for a third-party candidate next week as a protest against both Trump and Clinton.
""I think it's important to save American jobs which have already gone overseas, but I don't believe there is much that can be done to bring them back,"" he said.Christina Ledesma, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, a Clinton supporter, said she also disagreed with Trump that the economy would suffer a lasting negative effect from trade deals.""Our unemployment rate is lower than it's been since 2008. What jobs are you bringing back?"" she said.Michigan's unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in September, below the national average of 5 percent. Ohio's was at 4.8 percent and Pennsylvania's at 5.7 percent.
Trump has called the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico one of the worst deals ever struck and blames it for manufacturing jobs being moved to Mexico.He also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would open markets in East Asia. Trump argues that the deal, which must be ratified by Congress, would motivate more U.S. companies to move their production overseas. Last week while campaigning, he called outsourcing ""the greatest job theft in the history of the world"". ""The jobs theft will end ... the day I start the presidency. It's going to be America first again,"" he said.Clinton has offered a more tempered approach, saying she would seek to re-evaluate NAFTA if elected and that there were problems with some aspects of the TPP.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English from Oct. 6 to Oct. 17 in Michigan and Pennsylvania, and from Oct. 6 to Oct. 12 in Ohio. It included 1,370 likely voters in Michigan, 1,467 in Pennsylvania, and 1,200 in Ohio. All three state polls had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

By Amanda Becker and Emily Stephenson
| PENSACOLA, Fla./ LAS VEGAS

PENSACOLA, Fla./ LAS VEGAS Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump attacked one another's character as they pushed their closing arguments six days before the U.S. presidential election, while the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clinton's lead over Trump rising back to the margin she held last week.Many national polls have shown Clinton's lead over Trump narrowing since the re-emergence Friday of a controversy over her use of a private email while secretary of state.But the latest Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released on Wednesday showed Clinton's lead over Trump rising back up to 6 percentage points, the same advantage she held before the FBI announcement related to her email practices. Signs of a tightening race have rattled financial markets as investors started to factor in the possibility that the New York businessman might pull off a victory on Nov. 8.World stocks, the dollar and oil fell on Wednesday, while safe-haven assets such as gold and the Swiss franc rose. Clinton has been regarded as the candidate who would maintain the status quo, an important factor to financial markets, which generally do not like uncertainty.Campaigning in Pensacola, Florida, Trump predicted he would win, telling supporters at the outdoor rally, ""It's feeling like it already, isn't it?""We've got to be nice and cool, nice and cool. Alright, stay on point, Donald, stay on point. No sidetracks, Donald, nice and easy,"" said Trump, whose campaign has at times been damaged by controversial unscripted remarks.Trump argued that Clinton was unqualified to lead the country, calling her ""totally unhinged.""Speaking to supporters in Las Vegas, Clinton blamed Trump for pitting Americans against one another, citing his rhetoric on groups like Muslims and Mexican-Americans. Trump, she said, is ""out of his depth,"" and she called his proposals on foreign policy issues ""incredibly dangerous.""
""He doesn't have a clue,"" Clinton said. Investor anxiety has deepened in recent days over a possible Trump victory given uncertainty about his stance on issues including foreign policy, trade relations and immigrants.Trump, who has never previously run for elected office, has run an unorthodox campaign, with policy proposals including reviewing trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and imposing a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country.Currency traders have sold the dollar this week in part because they suspect Trump would prefer a weaker dollar given his protectionist stance on international trade, and in part because the uncertainty surrounding a Trump win might lead to a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve in the months ahead, instead of the interest rate hike that many expect by year-end. A rise in U.S. interest rates would make the dollar, and dollar-denominated assets, more attractive to investors.A Reuters equity market poll last month showed a majority of forecasters predicted that U.S. stocks would perform better under a Clinton presidency than a Trump administration.
An average of polls compiled by the RealClearPolitics website showed Clinton just 1.7 percent ahead of Trump nationally on Wednesday, with 47 percent support to his 45.3 percent.ELECTORAL MATH
Clinton's position is stronger than national polls imply given that the race is decided by the Electoral College system of tallying wins on a state-by-state basis. Winning the presidency requires a majority of 270 electoral votes, and Democrats have a built-in advantage with large states such as California and New York traditionally voting Democratic. Clinton looked likely to win at least 226 electoral votes, meaning she would need to pick up votes in ""toss-up"" states such as Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Iowa, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada, according to estimates by RealClearPolitics on Wednesday afternoon.
Trump, on the other hand, has a steeper path to climb, looking likely to win 180 electoral votes, meaning he needs more votes from the battleground states, the website showed.Both candidates are focusing their final campaign efforts on those crucial states.Trump and Clinton have campaigned intensively in recent weeks in Florida, which yields a rich haul of 29 electoral votes. A RealClearPolitics average of polls in the state puts Trump 0.7 point ahead of Clinton. In North Carolina on Wednesday, Clinton deployed President Barack Obama to make the case that Trump posed a unique threat to the future of the country. ""The fate of the republic rests on your shoulders,"" Obama told supporters in Chapel Hill, calling Trump temperamentally unfit to lead the nation.Trump's campaign announced plans to run three ads during Wednesday night's Game Seven of the World Series, held in Cleveland, Ohio's second biggest city. The ads focus on the renewed controversy surrounding Clinton's email server.In an ad titled ""Corruption,"" an announcer says: ""Hillary cut deals for donors. Now the FBI has launched a new investigation. After decades of lies and scandal, her corruption is closing in.""

By David Lawder
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Massive government investment in China's semiconductor industry risks distorting the global market for integrated circuits, leading to damaging overcapacity and stifling innovation, U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has warned.     The comments come at a time of growing trade tension between the Asian giant and the United States over accusations of dumping, industrial overcapacity and a souring business climate for foreign firms doing business in China. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to levy punitive tariffs of 45 percent on imports of Chinese goods if he is elected.In a speech on Wednesday, Pritzker sharply criticized a $150-billion plan by the Chinese government to expand the share of Chinese-made integrated circuits in the domestic market to 70 percent by 2025, from 9 percent now.""Let me state the obvious: this unprecedented state-driven interference would distort the market and undermine the innovation ecosystem,"" Pritzker said at the Center for Strategic Studies think-tank in Washington. That level of investment would be equivalent to half of worldwide semiconductor sales last year and result in market distortions similar to those plaguing the steel, aluminum and green technology industries, Pritzker added.      ""The world has seen the effects of this type of targeted, government-led interference before,"" she said.
""The result has been overcapacity in the global marketplace that has artificially reduced prices, cost jobs in both the United States and around the world, and caused significant damage to those industries globally,"" Pritzker said. It was ""imperative we take steps to prevent a similar situation from developing in the semiconductor industry,"" she added. Such steps include a Commerce Department study of the global semiconductor supply chain now underway, besides engaging with China, and other governments, to persuade them to avoid policies that distort markets or spur technology transfers.""The U.S. government will make clear to China's leaders at every opportunity that we will not accept a $150-billion industrial policy designed to appropriate this industry,"" Pritzker added.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that China advocates for all countries to provide a fair and transparent investment environment.""We hope everyone can rationally view relevant trade and investment cooperation and work together to create a positive atmosphere,"" she told reporters at a regular briefing when asked about Pritzker's remarks.China's Ministry of Commerce did respond immediately to a request for comment. 
Earlier on Thursday, 12 U.S. senators urged that Zhongweng International's $2.3-billion purchase of Cleveland, Ohio-based Aleris Corp. be rejected by a national security review panel.""In addition, we are seeing new attempts by China to acquire companies and technology based on their government's interests - not commercial objectives. And we have witnessed attempts to restrict access to China's domestic market,"" Pritzker said.The technology industry depends on a global supply chain, open and fair trade and innovation, she said, warning against government behavior that disrupts the system and distorts markets.""China's effort to move up the value chain should be the result of healthy competition and free and fair trade, not state-directed investments aimed at distorting global markets,"" Pritzker said.""In addition, no government should require technology transfer, joint-venture, or localization as a quid pro quo for market access.""

By David Lawder
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Twelve U.S. senators urged on Wednesday that a national security review panel reject Chinese aluminum giant Zhongwang International Group Ltd's proposed $2.3 billion purchase of U.S. aluminum products maker Aleris Corp.The senators asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a letter to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and ""ultimately reject it"" on grounds that it would damage the U.S. defense industrial base. ""Zhongwang's purchase of Aleris would directly undermine our national security, including by jeopardizing the U.S. manufacturing base for sensitive technologies in an industry already devastated by the effects of China's market distorting policies, and creating serious risk that sensitive technologies and knowhow will be transferred to China, further imperiling U.S. defense interests,"" the senators wrote.The deal, announced just over two months ago, would give one of the world's largest makers of extruded aluminum products access to U.S. technology and customers, which include Boeing Co and U.S. and European automakers that are increasingly turning to aluminum.It comes as another Zhongwang subsidiary is embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties amid broader trade tensions between the U.S. aluminum industry and China.
The U.S. Commerce Department is currently investigating China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd over allegations that it has been evading U.S. import duties on extruded products by shipping them through third countries.The letter to Lew was signed by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, where Aleris is based, and Democrats Ron Wyden, Charles Schumer, Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley, Amy Klobuchar, Tammy Baldwin and Al Franken.They said the review committee needed to be cautious about the potential for sensitive research data to be transferred to China, including data with military applications such as advanced modeling techniques, high-strength alloys and the design of light armor material.
""Despite the national security importance of our nation's aluminum sector, the industry continues to be decimated by China's market distorting policies that contribute to vast overcapacity,"" the senators wrote.""China's overcapacity in aluminum has directly contributed to severe reductions in U.S. domestic production as smelters unable to compete have been forced to close. Each such closure further imperils our nation's ability to ensure a reliable supply of strategic materials in times of crisis,"" they wrote.A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter, adding that information filed with CFIUS by law cannot be disclosed to the public and that Treasury does not comment on specific CFIUS cases.
Aleris said in a statement reacting to the letter that the company's U.S. facilities produce no defense-related products, and the technology for aluminum plate used in some defense products was widely used in the industry.""Our facilities in the U.S. produce aluminum for car and truck exteriors, gutters and roofing material,"" Aleris said. "" Less than one percent of our sales go into defense applications, and none of those goods are produced in the U.S.""A Zhongwang spokeswoman said in a statement that the CFIUS filing for the transaction is voluntary and that the company and its U.S. subsidiary have no connection with the Chinese government. She added that the transaction will bring in additional resources and capital to Aleris and there will be no changes to management, employees or business strategies.

| JACKSON, Miss.

JACKSON, Miss. A historic black church in Mississippi was burned and spray-painted with ""Vote Trump"" and authorities said on Wednesday it was arson and being probed as a hate crime committed one week before the U.S. presidential election.Greenville Fire Chief Ruben Brown Sr. told a news conference on Wednesday afternoon that investigators had determined the fire at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church was ""intentionally set.""""Samples and evidence have been collected from inside the church and are being analyzed to determine the accelerant or ignition source,"" Brown said.Earlier in the day he said no one was injured in the Tuesday evening blaze, but the church was extensively damaged. ""We're investigating this as a hate crime,"" Greenville Police Chief Delando Wilson told a news conference early on Wednesday. ""We feel that the quote on the church is intimidating.""It tries to push your beliefs on someone else, and this is a predominantly black church and no one has a right to try to influence the way someone votes in this election.""
Wilson told the Wall Street Journal that police on Wednesday evening were interviewing a ""person of interest"" in connection with the fire but the individual had not been charged.Wilson did not immediately return a call or email. Black churches in the U.S. South have long been a base of support for the Democratic Party. During the U.S. civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, southern black churches were often targets for arson and bombings by white supremacists.
""The FBI Jackson Division is aware of the situation in Greenville, and we are working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed,"" the agency said in a statement.""This act is a direct assault of people's right to freely worship,"" Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons said in a statement. The town of some 33,000 people is about 100 miles (160 kms) northwest of Jackson.
""The act that happened left our hearts broken,"" Pastor Carolyn Hudson told the news conference, noting that the church has a 111-year history.The Mississippi Republican Party declined to comment. In October, the Orange County Republican Party's office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, was set on fire and a graffiti message left nearby said ""leave town or else.""No arrests have been made in that incident, which Indiana Governor Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential candidate, called ""political terrorism.""

By Justin Mitchell and Andy Sullivan
| JACKSON, Ga.

JACKSON, Ga. Down a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training -- and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""How many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!"" asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name ""Bloodagent.""""Ooh-rah!"" shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend.As the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton.They say they won't fire the first shot, but they're not planning to leave their guns at home, either.Trump's populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul's promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be ""rigged,"" and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud.
Armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer's 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people.Their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008.In recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon.
Many fear Clinton would push the county further to the left.""This is the last chance to save America from ruin,"" Hill said. ""I'm surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same."" EXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENED
The Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud.
An hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member's high-powered rifle knocked down a tree.The group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain.Amid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins.He said he doesn't want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said.
""I will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,"" said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago.Trump's candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center.""Prior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,"" he said. ""Now these ideas are legitimized.""Over the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence.    ""If Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket,"" former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clinton's death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday.Back in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come.""We've building up for this, just like the Marines,"" he said. ""We are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come."" (Editing by Stuart Grudgings)"

Disgraced former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner has checked into a rehab facility that treats sex addiction, the DailyMail.com reported on Wednesday.The online version of the British newspaper said electronic devices are banned at the facility, which separates men from women and treats a range of addictions related to cyber sex, exhibitionism and anonymous sex and other acts. The facility was not named in the report.Reuters could not independently verify the report. Weiner could not be reached for comment.Federal prosecutors and New York police announced last month they were investigating Weiner following a separate report by the DailyMail.com that he engaged in sexually explicit cellphone and online messages with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina.Weiner, 52, did not respond at the time to Reuters' requests for comment on the texting report but told the Associated Press last month that he had ""likely been the subject of a hoax.""
An investigation into those messages also triggered a new FBI probe of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails, as some of her emails were found on a device related to the Weiner investigation, sources close to the matter said.Once a popular congressman, Weiner resigned in 2011 after saying he had accidentally sent a lewd picture over Twitter. Two years later, his campaign for New York City mayor was derailed after explicit photos he had sent under the pseudonym ""Carlos Danger"" to a young woman in Indiana surfaced.
Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, one of Clinton's top aides, said in August she was separating from her husband after yet another scandal.Abedin's announcement followed a New York Post report that Weiner had recently sent photos of his boxer-brief-clad genitals - one while he was in bed with their toddler son - via Twitter to another woman.
An attorney for Abedin could not be reached on Wednesday to comment on the DailyMail.com report. (Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Rigby)"

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Hillary Clinton led Republican Donald Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released on Wednesday, the same advantage the Democratic presidential nominee held before an FBI announcement that reignited the controversy about her email practices.The Oct. 28-Nov. 1 opinion poll was conducted almost entirely after FBI Director James Comey notified Congress last Friday his agency would examine newly discovered emails that might pertain to Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.Comey said he did not know whether the emails were significant and released no information other than that they existed. His announcement drew outrage from Democrats who voiced concern it would unfairly influence voters so close to next week's election. Trump and other Republicans seized on the news to revive questions about Clinton's credibility.
Among 1,772 people who have either voted already or were identified as likely voters in the Nov. 8 election, 45 percent said they supported Clinton, while 39 percent said they backed Trump. On Thursday, the day before Comey's announcement, Clinton led Trump by 43 percent to 37 percent.In a four-way poll that included alternative party candidates, Clinton led Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters. Forty-five percent supported Clinton, while 37 percent backed Trump. Five percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 2 percent backed Jill Stein of the Green Party.
Other national polls have shown Clinton's lead shrinking over the past week. RealClearPolitics, which averages most major opinion polls, showed Clinton's lead had narrowed to 1.7 points on Wednesday from 4.6 points last Friday.
