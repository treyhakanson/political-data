By Douglas Busvine and Patricia Zengerle
| NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON Two years ago there were questions over whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could get a visa to enter the United States. Next week he visits Washington as one of President Barack Obama's closest international partners.Obama invited Modi for one of the last big visits by a world leader before his term ends in January. Although the trip won't feature a lavish state dinner, the Indian leader will address both houses of Congress, considered a rare honor.This will be their seventh meeting since Modi became prime minister in May 2014, an impressive tally for a U.S. president and a leader who is not a formal ally, said Ashley Tellis at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.""The personal relationship between the president and the prime minister ... is really one of the unanticipated surprises of the past two years,"" said Tellis, an expert on India.The developing relationship is seen as an Obama foreign policy success. Washington views India as an important part of its rebalance to Asia and as a counterweight to China.    The two countries are finalizing agreements that would make it possible for their militaries to cooperate more closely, and for U.S. defense manufacturers to both sell and make high-tech weaponry in India.A deal on logistics would govern issues such as how the two countries account for costs of military exercises. Another involves encrypted communications and geospatial data transfer.A history of colonial rule followed by decades of non-alignment has, however, made New Delhi wary of an embrace by the more powerful United States, which has overtaken Russia as India's top arms supplier.""It is neither a strategic partnership nor an alliance,"" said Nitin Gokhale, founder of defense portal Bharat Shakti. ""It can be a long-term arrangement, but to call it a strategic partnership would be premature.""
    There are frustrations, too, on the U.S. side.The two countries reached a civil nuclear agreement in 2005, but it has yet to yield any contracts for U.S.-based companies. Only now is Westinghouse, a unit of Japan's Toshiba, approaching the finish line on a deal to build six reactors in India.GETTING TO KNOW YOU
The visit gives Modi a chance to network with U.S. lawmakers who may feature in a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton administration but, as it coincides with the California primary, he is not expected to meet either.
Modi is generally popular with U.S. lawmakers, who extended his invitation to address Congress. But they criticize what they see as lingering unfriendliness to U.S. firms and a stifling bureaucracy, and question New Delhi's record on human rights.""The economic engagement between our two countries should increase and it should be more accessible for U.S. companies,"" Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a telephone interview. Obama and Modi are expected to discuss India's desire to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a 48-member club of nuclear trading nations.India was shut out for decades because of its weapons program, and the civil nuclear agreement with the United States gave it access to foreign suppliers without giving up its arms.Obama administration officials have said they backed India's desire to join the group, but the idea faces resistance among some on Capitol Hill, as well as from China, an ally of India's arch-rival Pakistan.
""Existing NSG guidelines were established to guard against nuclear proliferation, and we should not create exceptions for particular countries,"" Corker said.There is lingering concern in Washington over Modi's handling of communal riots in 2002 that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, in Gujarat.Modi was chief minister of the state at the time and, though a court-ordered inquiry found insufficient evidence to prosecute him, the issue prevented him from getting a U.S. visa for years.Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised human rights on a visit to New Delhi this week, saying the two largest democracies had ""special obligations"" to set the highest standards.Congress' Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission has scheduled a hearing on India for June 7, the day Modi arrives in Washington and the day before his address to the combined House of Representatives and Senate. He leaves the United States on June 8.Corker promised to asked Modi about India's record on human trafficking, which he brought up recently in an emotional Senate hearing with Obama administration officials.""The country we believe has 12-14 million slaves, which is close to half the number we believe exists worldwide,"" Corker said. ""It's obviously a very significant issue and when he's here, it's one I certainly plan to raise.""

By Steve Holland and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican, ended a long period of soul-searching and endorsed Donald Trump for president on Thursday, a step toward unifying party loyalists behind the insurgent candidate despite concerns about his candidacy.Ryan had been a high-profile holdout to supporting Trump for the Nov. 8 presidential election out of concern about the presumptive Republican nominee's bellicose rhetoric and break with party orthodoxy on issues including trade and immigration.The House of Representatives speaker announced his support in a column for the Janesville Gazette newspaper in his home state of Wisconsin. It surfaced in the middle of a speech by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in which she launched a far-reaching attack on Trump's foreign policy credentials.Ryan did not specifically use the word ""endorse"" in his column, but his spokesman, Brendan Buck, made clear that Ryan's move should be seen as an endorsement.The speaker had criticized the Republican candidate several times, including Trump's proposal in December to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States because of national security concerns.The 46-year-old Ryan was the only member of the Republican congressional leadership who had not formally embraced Trump.In a tweet, Trump responded: ""So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!""Ryan's backing of Trump could give cover to more reluctant Republicans to get behind the billionaire businessman as their best chance to win the White House.""I think the endorsement is significant because it shows the falling in line of the establishment Republicans from the top,"" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean.
It should also help Trump make the case that he can bring the party together as he girds for a Republican nominating convention in July that many party leaders plan to skip.It also represents a blow to Republicans who have been trying to organize a third-party bid to give party loyalists who cannot abide Trump someone else to support. The ""never Trump"" crowd includes 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. Ryan was Romney's vice presidential running mate.While Ryan's decision could push some Republican leaders off the fence, many holdouts remained, such as two former rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Aides to both said their positions had not changed.Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid described Ryan's move as ""abject surrender,"" adding: ""The GOP is Trump's party now.""
'HEAL THE FISSURES'
Ryan met Trump in a high-profile meeting last month and they have since had a number of telephone calls.""It's no secret that he and I have our differences. I won't pretend otherwise,"" Ryan wrote. ""And when I feel the need to, I'll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.""Ryan said he and Trump had spoken many times in recent weeks about how, ""by focusing on issues that unite Republicans, we can work together to heal the fissures developed through the primary.""""Through these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people's lives. That's why I'll be voting for him this fall,"" Ryan said.
Announcing he will vote for Trump should make it a bit more comfortable for Ryan to chair the party's nominating convention in Cleveland.While Ryan's endorsement was significant for Trump, there remain many concerns about him within the party.Longtime Republican financier Fred Malek drew attention to worries about Trump in a column in the Washington Post on Thursday. He cited Trump's criticism last week of New Mexico's Republican governor, Susana Martinez, considered a rising star in the party with the ability to appeal to Hispanics.""These attacks on fellow Republicans must stop as we move closer to the general election,"" Malek wrote.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, who has said he will support Trump, told CNN that Trump's proposed Muslim ban was a bad idea and that his criticism of Martinez was ill-advised.Ryan said he too still had concerns about Trump's tone.""It is my hope the campaign improves its tone as we go forward and it's all a campaign we can be proud of,"" Ryan told the Associated Press.

WASHINGTON The United States has approved 4,700 Syrian refugees who are awaiting resettlement to the country, while an additional 7,900 are awaiting security review, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Thursday.Johnson, speaking to a homeland security advisory panel at the Department of Homeland Security, was defending against critics who say the Obama administration is falling behind meeting its goal of bringing in 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country by the end of fiscal year 2016.

Three days before Puerto Rico's Democratic presidential primary, Bernie Sanders leveled a blistering attack on a restructuring bill moving through the U.S. Congress and offered a radically different approach to fixing the territory's $70 billion debt problem.Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who is giving front-runner Hillary Clinton a tougher-than-expected challenge for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, will formally introduce his legislation next week, a spokesman said on Thursday.Unlike a bipartisan House of Representatives bill that would establish a federal oversight board to renegotiate the massive debt with investors, Sanders' bill would create a ""Reconstruction Finance Corporation of Puerto Rico"" that would protect public pensioners from cutbacks and ""concentrate losses among vulture funds,"" according to a summary.""It is morally reprehensible that Wall Street vulture funds are demanding that Puerto Rico fire even more teachers, close more schools, cut pensions and slash the minimum wage so that they can reap huge profits off the misery of the people of Puerto Rico,"" Sanders said in a statement.The term vulture funds is a derogatory reference to specialized investing in deeply discounted or distressed assets, typically bonds, by buying them up on the cheap in hopes of profiting on the expectation of a credit restructuringClinton has backed the House bill.
Last week, a House committee with oversight of Puerto Rico approved a debt restructuring measure that backers hope will be enacted into law before July 1, when the island is faced with making good on $1.9 billion in debt payments.Sanders' proposal comes as the nominating contests for the presidential election are winding down. Along with Puerto Rico, California and a handful of other states are holding their nominating contests in the coming days.
Sanders' bill sets out to strip the ability of hedge funds to profit off their investments in an attempt to protect pensions ahead of creditors.The Reconstruction Finance Corporation would consist of seven members, all full-time residents of Puerto Rico and mainly chosen by the Puerto Rican legislature and governor.The House bill, by contrast, would give Republicans in the U.S. Congress a say in recommending the majority of the proposed oversight board members.
While the House bill boasts no cost to U.S. taxpayers, Sanders wants $10.8 billion for infrastructure improvements in Puerto Rico. He proposes raising federal reimbursements for the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs for the poor, elderly and disabled.Sanders also wants elections by Jan. 31, 2018, in Puerto Rico to decide whether it should become a state, an independent country or reform its current status.

5	5	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-intelligence-idUSKCN0YO24T	Some officials worry about briefing Trump, fearing spilled secrets	"


By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Some U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that Donald Trump's ""shoot from the hip"" style could pose national security risks as they prepare to give him a routine pre-election briefing once he is formally anointed as the Republican presidential nominee.Eight senior security officials told Reuters they had concerns over briefing Trump, whose brash, unpredictable campaign style has been a feature of his rise as an insurgent candidate. Despite their worries, the officials said the ""Top Secret"" briefing to each candidate would not deviate from the usual format to avoid any appearance of bias.Most of the officials asked for anonymity to discuss a domestic political issue.Current and former officials said that the scandal over Hillary Clinton's use of emails also raises concerns about her handling of sensitive information. The likely Democratic nominee is facing an FBI probe into whether security was compromised and laws were broken by her use of a private email server for government business while she was Secretary of State.""The only candidate who has proven incapable of handling sensitive information is Hillary Clinton,"" said Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""If there is anyone they should be worried about it is Hillary Clinton."" But Trump's lack of foreign policy experience, his volatile style, and his little known team of foreign policy advisers make him a unique case, the officials said.  ""People are very nervous,"" said one senior U.S. security official. Intelligence and other security and foreign policy officials are also trying to determine ""who on (Trump's) team are trustworthy, the official added. ""We've never had a situation like this before. Ever.""A spokesperson for Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Other officials downplayed such worries, noting that the traditional briefing, while classified as Top Secret, is mostly a broad overview of national security issues and does not include the most sensitive government secrets about intelligence sources and operations. 
In the post-Second World War era, confirmed U.S. presidential nominees have traditionally received the briefing from intelligence officials -- including spy agency chiefs -- covering a broad range of national security issues.The nominees are usually briefed shortly after their party nominating conventions, and are allowed to include one or two aides who must undergo security checks. Current and former officials say the nominees are explicitly warned not to share the contents of the briefing, which includes detailed intelligence assessments. After election day, presidents-elect receive the same Presidential Daily Brief, or PDB, that the sitting president gets, complete with material on the intelligence agencies' sources, methods, and covert operations.Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told Reuters that he shared some of the concerns over how Trump, who has never held public office, might use information from the briefing.    ""I would be very concerned with Mr. Trump's ability to know what he can and can't discuss"" publicly about the contents of an intelligence briefing, said Schiff, who has endorsed Clinton for president.
Schiff said one consequence of intelligence agencies' worries about Trump's reputation as a loose cannon could be that briefers circumscribe some of the information they provide to Trump and Hillary Clinton, his prospective Democratic opponent.Trump has tended to make broad-brush statements on foreign issues rather than delve into policy nuances. He drew criticism from some former national security officials last month when, without evidence, he quickly tweeted that the downing of an EgyptAir flight appeared to be a terrorist attack.  Clinton is honing in on national security as a key potential weakness for Trump, and is set to deliver a foreign policy speech on Thursday designed to portray the billionaire businessman as unfit for the White House. SAME BRIEFING FOR BOTH?

Officials familiar with the views and policy of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's Office, which will give the in-person briefings, say it will do its utmost to avoid any suggestions of political favoritism or bias. Officials say the spy agencies' intend to follow past practice and give identical briefings to both nominees.One former intelligence official said Clinton could have an advantage in the briefing because she would likely ask more probing questions than Trump, a newcomer to foreign policy.The briefings provide an ""overview of pressing issues and hot spots around the world,"" said former CIA officer David Priess, who briefed attorneys general and FBI directors, but not presidents.One U.S. intelligence official said that Trump's style may not be such a risk because the briefings are general in nature and often track publicly available information.""If he reads the papers every day, he won't hear much that will surprise him,"" the official said.Current and former officials said that covert operations and the intelligence agencies' ""sources and methods,"" which are among the nation's most tightly guarded secrets, are never discussed in the pre-election briefings.

By Andy Sullivan and Grant Smith
| CINCINNATI

CINCINNATI When Larry Harmon tried to vote on a marijuana initiative in November in his hometown of Kent, Ohio, the 59-year-old software engineer found his name had been struck from the voter rolls.Two hours south in Zanesville, restaurant worker Chris Conrad, 37, was also told he was no longer registered.Both men later found out why: they had not voted often enough.As the Nov. 8 elections loom, officials in Ohio have removed tens of thousands of voters from registration lists because they have not cast a ballot since 2008. All U.S. states periodically cleanse their voter rolls, but only a handful remove voters simply because they don't vote on a regular basis. And nowhere could the practice have a greater potential impact in the state-by-state battle for the White House than Ohio, a swing state that has backed the winner in every presidential election since 1960.Voters of all stripes in Ohio are affected, but the policy appears to be helping Republicans in the state's largest metropolitan areas, according to a Reuters survey of voter lists. In the state's three largest counties that include Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, voters have been struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods.That's because residents of relatively affluent Republican-leaning neighborhoods are more likely to vote in both congressional elections and presidential contests, historical turnouts show. Democrats are less likely to vote in mid-term elections and thus are more at risk of falling off the rolls. In the three biggest counties, at least 144,000 voters have been removed, the Reuters analysis found. The statewide total is unclear. Each of the state's 88 counties manages its own voter rolls, which generally are not made public. Unlike other voting-rights disputes that have sparked protests and lawsuits, the practice doesn't appear to be driven by one specific party. Both Republican and Democratic officials in Ohio have purged inactive voters over the past 20 years.But neighborhoods that have a high proportion of poor, African-American residents are hit hardest, the Reuters analysis found.""It's absolutely unfair,"" said Donna Porter-Jones, an organizer at Amos Project, an interfaith group that aims to register 30,000 voters from some of Cincinnati's poorest neighborhoods ahead of November. CLEANING UP THE ROLLS

Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, says canceling registrations for voters who missed three straight federal elections helps keep voting rolls current. Since 2011, the state has cleared out more than 2 million records of people who have moved or died, he said. Those who don't vote over a six-year stretch or respond to a postcard mailed to their address have only themselves to blame, he said. ""If this is really important thing to you in your life, voting, you probably would have done so within a six-year period,"" he said in an interview.People who don't respond to the postcard can be removed from voting lists if they sit out the next two federal elections. Many other states only remove voters from the rolls if they have died or moved to a new address.""You shouldn't be struck of your right to vote because you skipped an election,"" said Kathleen Clyde, a Democratic state representative who has been fighting the practice.Four civil liberties groups sued to end the practice last month, arguing that it violates federal law and unfairly targets low-income and minority voters.  Voting-rights advocates say they are concerned that many infrequent voters who helped drive turnout to a record in the 2008 presidential election won't be able to vote in this year's likely matchup between Democrat Hillary Clinton, vying to become the first female president, and Republican Donald Trump, the celebrity billionaire.
PARTISAN BATTLES 
The Ohio lawsuit is one of a number being fought across the country. Photo ID requirements and other efforts to tighten voting laws have spurred fierce partisan battles and protests in recent months. They follow a Supreme Court decision in 2013 that struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, a signature achievement of the civil rights movement in the 1960s.The Ohio dispute, by contrast, centers on a practice that has been in place for decades but is receiving new attention from civil liberties groups and Democrats ahead of November. ""We are pleased the courts are reviewing the state's actions,"" said Pratt Wiley, national director of voter expansion at the Democratic Party in Washington.Republican party officials at the local and national level, as well as the Trump campaign, did not respond to requests for comment.But Tom Fitton, the head of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has pushed Ohio and other states to keep their voting lists up to date, described the lawsuit as a ""power play"" by civil liberties groups ""to ensure that candidates they like are able to steal elections if necessary."" Federal law prohibits states from removing voters solely because they haven't voted, but it also requires them to keep voter lists up to date. Ohio residents who are removed from voting lists must re-register at least 30 days before an election. 
Harmon, the software engineer, backed President Barack Obama in 2008 but has sat out presidential and congressional elections since then. He says he initially thought he had done something wrong to get kicked off the voting rolls.""I felt embarrassed and stupid at the time,"" said Harmon, who is involved in the Ohio lawsuit. ""The more I think about it, the madder I am,"" he said.""KICKED OFF""
In Cleveland's Cuyahoga County, 5 percent of voters in neighborhoods that backed Obama by more than 60 percent in 2012 were purged last year due to inactivity, according to the Reuters analysis of the voter lists. In neighborhoods where Obama got less than 40 percent of the vote, 2.5 percent of registered voters were removed for that reason.In Franklin County, home to the state capital Columbus, 11 percent of voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods have been purged since 2012 due to inactivity. Only 6 percent of voters in Republican-leaning neighborhoods have been purged.  The disparity is especially stark in Hamilton County, where affluent Republican suburbs ring Cincinnati, which has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the country.In the heavily African-American neighborhoods near downtown, more than 10 percent of registered voters have been removed due to inactivity since 2012. In suburban Indian Hill, only 4 percent have been purged due to inactivity. Overall, 30,000 voters have been removed due to inactivity since 2012, a larger figure than Obama's margin of victory that year.  On a recent rainy afternoon, Amos Project canvasser Marcia Mackey tried to get some of those voters back in the system. Wielding a clipboard and a smile, Mackey asked pedestrians in the Over the Rhine neighborhood north of downtown Cincinnati when they last cast a ballot. If they couldn't remember, she encouraged them to register again.""People don't know they've been purged until they go to the election site and get turned away,"" Mackey said. ""We need to make sure that people have voices."" (Grant Smith reported from New York. Editing by Jason Szep and Ross Colvin)"	['Sullivan', 'Obama', 'Trump', 'Ross']	[]

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration's top Supreme Court lawyer is leaving office at the end of June having won a string of major cases including fending off challenges to President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law and legalizing same-sex marriage.Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has served in the Justice Department post since June 2011. He also held two other positions in the Obama administration. Verrilli's deputy, Ian Gershengorn will take over, the Justice Department said in a release announcing Verrilli's departure.""For five years, Solicitor General Don Verrilli has fought in our nation's highest court for a better future, winning landmark cases that moved America forward,"" Obama said in a statement.Verrilli twice successfully defended the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, against conservative challenges. In 2012, the court ruled 5-4 to uphold the law against a broad legal attack. Three years later, the justices rejected a second challenge on a 6-3 vote.
""Thanks to his efforts, 20 million more Americans now know the security of quality, affordable health care,"" Obama said.In other major victories, Verrilli urged the justices to strike down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which barred the recognition of same-sex marriages for the purposes of federal benefits. The 5-4 ruling striking down the law in June 2015 helped pave the way for the court's 5-4 landmark 2015 decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide, which Verrilli also advocated for. 
In another case, Verrilli successfully persuaded the court in 2012 to strike down provisions of a harsh anti-immigrant law in Arizona on a 5-3 vote.""Through these and many other cases - and through his thoughtful counsel and principled advocacy - Don has built a legacy of inclusion, expanding opportunities and civil rights for all Americans and moving our country forward,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement.
Setbacks included the court's 2013 ruling on a 5-4 vote striking down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, a law enacted to protect minority voters. He also lost a case 9-0 in which a company challenged Obama's authority to appoint members of the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate was in recess.The court has yet to rule in several major cases Verrilli argued this year, including a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law and his defense of Obama's executive action that would protect more than four million immigrants from deportation.

By Mica Rosenberg
| BELCOURT, North Dakota

BELCOURT, North Dakota Elvis Norquay, a member of the Chippewa Indian tribe, has lived most of his 58 years on North Dakota's remote Turtle Mountain reservation and says he's never had a problem voting.That was before 2014, when he hitched a ride with a friend to cast a ballot in local and congressional elections and was turned away. Embarrassed, he asked why he couldn't vote. He was told he lacked proper ID under new state requirements. He has no phone, no current driver's license and his tribal ID lacks a street address.""When we left, my friend said, 'that's not right',"" said Norquay, who has lived on disability since 2002 in a rural county near the Canadian border.Norquay is among a growing number of Native Americans embroiled in court battles over changes to voting laws that could influence the outcome of some tight races in the November 2016 presidential and congressional elections.While the Native American population is small nationally, lawsuits involving tribes over voting problems have proliferated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement.North Dakota is one of 17 states that have new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.Many of these changes have sparked lawsuits and accusations that black, Hispanic and other minority voters could be disenfranchised.Five federal lawsuits involving Native Americans have been filed since the Supreme Court decision, including three this year alone.Suits in North Dakota, Utah, South Dakota and Arizona claim new voting rules passed in majority Republican states are discriminatory and could reduce voting by tribal members, who tend to back Democrats. A suit in Alaska, for example, claimed the state violated federal rules by failing to translate voting materials for tribal voters.The tribes say changes to voting rules in those states disproportionately affect Native Americans, an allegation the states and counties deny.The Native American vote is not big enough to flip a safe Republican state such as North Dakota into the Democrat column in this year's presidential election, but Native Americans are a growing proportion of the population and a majority in some counties where increased voter turnout in recent years has tipped the balance in some congressional races.In many states, the number of Native Americans is growing faster than the population as a whole. Between 2000 and 2010, the Native American population rose by 26.7 percent to 1.1 million, compared to 9.7 percent growth in America's overall population, census data showed.Recent changes to voting laws, such as North Dakota's new voter ID law, are part of ""a much broader, deliberate, and concerted effort by Republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters on election day,"" said Pratt Wiley, head of voter protection issues at the Democratic Party in Washington.
""Those voters are more vulnerable today than they were before the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013,"" he said of Native Americans.Republicans deny that voting law changes passed by Republican-dominated legislatures are discriminatory and say they are intended to reduce fraudulent votes.""These are popular common sense laws to protect elections from fraud,"" said Lindsay Walters, national spokeswoman at the Republican National Committee.TRIBAL ID CARDS
At issue in North Dakota are revisions pushed largely by Republican state legislators in 2013 and 2015 to a 2003 state elections law that eliminated a provision that had allowed people without proper identification such as Norquay to vote if they were recognized by a poll worker or if they signed an affidavit swearing to their identity.
Norquay and six other members of his tribe sued the secretary of state in January in U.S. District Court in North Dakota. They said they were refused the right to vote in November 2014 because many old tribal IDs such as Norquay's don't list a current residential address. It says some tribal members can't afford a new tribal ID or struggle to obtain proper identification because there are no state offices that provide driver's licenses on the reservations. Richard McCloud, chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, said widespread unemployment and poverty among tribal members meant that some struggle to afford the $10 needed to obtain a new tribal card. ""Ten dollars is three pounds of hamburger and some macaroni for a family,"" said McCloud at the tribe's headquarters on the reservation of about 4,274 people a few miles (km) south of the Canadian border.""Maybe it's no big deal if you work, but it's a big deal to people that don't have access to $10,"" he said.North Dakota's secretary of state, Al Jaeger, the only defendant in the suit, said in an interview that the law is not discriminatory and simplifies the voting process in the only state in the country that does not require voters to register ahead of an election. He said his office has spent heavily on ad campaigns to educate voters about what IDs are accepted.Jaeger's deputy, Jim Silrum, said the ID requirements are not a barrier for the 97 percent of state residents with driver's licenses, an accepted form of ID, so the number of people affected by the changes is miniscule. Those with no driver's license, can get a non-driver state ID allowed at the polls from the motor vehicle department for free.
Jaeger and Silrum said they could not respond directly to an assertion in the lawsuit that residents on reservations have to travel long distances to obtain a state ID.LITTLE EVIDENCE OF FRAUD
Republican state Representative Jim Kasper from Fargo repeated his party's argument that the changes were aimed at reducing the risk of voter fraud, but Silrum said there was little evidence of such irregularities. In the 2012 presidential election, there were only nine cases of people voting twice, but that was because they used the same ID rather than a lack of proper identification, he said.State Representative Kylie Oversen, a Democrat from Grand Forks, said the changes could alter tight elections in favor of Republicans. She said Republicans pushed for the bill after Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012 by less than 3,000 votes.In sparsely populated states such as North Dakota, with just 739,000 people, congressional elections have been decided by just a few thousand votes.Rolette County, surrounding Norquay's reservation, is one of two counties in the state where about 75 percent of the population is Native American. Those two counties were the only places in North Dakota that gave President Barack Obama more than 70 percent of the vote in 2012.After the changes in the ID law were implemented in North Dakota, voter turnout in Rolette County dropped by more than 12 percentage points between the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections, more than any other county in the state, election data from the secretary of state's office shows.""What has happened is the Native American vote has become something that can tip elections,"" said Jean Schroedel, a professor at Claremont Graduate University in California who studies Native American voting.The Native American Rights Fund, a non-profit law firm representing Norquay and other members of his tribe in the lawsuit against the state, plans to file a motion by June 30 requesting that the court invalidate the changes to the ID law ahead of November's election, according to court documents.

| WICHITA, Kansas

WICHITA, Kansas After moving to Kansas, Tad Stricker visited a state motor vehicle office to perform what he thought was the routine task of getting a new driver's license and registering to vote.It was a familiar procedure for Stricker, 37, who has moved from state to state frequently in his work as a hotel manager. He filled out a voter registration form and got his driver's license. He was not asked for more documents, he said.So he was stunned when he tried to cast a ballot in November 2014 and was told he was not on the voter rolls. A month later, a letter from the state said why: His registration had been placed ""in suspense"" because he had failed to meet a state requirement he did not know about - proving he was an American.Spurred by Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a national leader in pushing for anti-immigration and voting changes, more than 36,000 Kansas residents have joined Stricker in limbo since early 2013 under a state law that raises a new and higher barrier to voting in the United States: proof of citizenship.While you must be a U.S. citizen to vote in American elections, most states allow those wishing to register to simply sign a statement affirming they are citizens and provide a driver's license number, Social Security number, or other proof of residency. A Reuters analysis of the Kansas suspense list shows the law disproportionately hits young voters, who often do not have ready access to the needed documents, as well as unaffiliated and Democratic voters in the Republican-controlled state.""What a shock,"" said Stricker, who was born in Missouri and moved to Kansas with his wife from Illinois. ""I was under the impression I had registered to vote, I had done everything I needed to. I just thought, 'This can't be happening.'""While the law won't affect its status as a safe Republican state in November's presidential election, it thrusts Kansas into a national debate over voting restrictions that has accelerated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement.Kobach's involvement has raised the stakes in the fight against the Kansas law. Democrats and voting rights advocates say his influence with conservatives could help spread the concept to other states. His critics scored a victory on May 17 when a federal judge weakened the law. Kobach quickly appealed.The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, and Stricker was a plaintiff in the case.Photo identification laws and other voting measures have proliferated in recent years in Republican-held states, but ""the one that gets me most nervous"" is the proof of citizenship requirement in Kansas, said Pratt Wiley, director of voter expansion for the Democratic National Committee.""What you will see is that what is learned in one state, or doesn't work in one state, there is a small adjustment and then it's applied in a different state,"" Wiley said, calling Kansas ""patient zero"" in that process.Kobach has gained a national reputation for pushing a series of voting and anti-immigration measures across the country, leading one Democratic congressman to dub him ""the dark lord"" of the anti-immigration movement - a label he wears proudly.
'MOVING THE BALL'
""I don't know if I would call it a badge of honor but it reflects that I'm moving the ball in what I think is the right direction,"" Kobach said in an interview in his Topeka office across from the state Capitol.Three other states have adopted proof of citizenship laws championed by Kobach, although officials said two of them had not implemented them. Bills have been introduced in at least nine other states to create a similar law since 2012, although none have advanced very far, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.The law Kobach spearheaded in Kansas requires registrants to prove their citizenship by providing one of a series of documents, including birth certificates and passports. They are placed on the suspense list if they can't.Since late last year, those who did not complete the requirements for registration have been purged from the voter rolls after 90 days and had to begin the process over again.About 14 percent of Kansans who tried to register between the law's onset in 2013 and late 2015 failed to meet the requirement and went on the suspense list, according to documents filed in a lawsuit challenging the requirement.
""It's created a system that is needlessly complex and very discouraging, particularly for young people,"" said Steve Lopes, head of the Johnson County Voting Coalition, which helps register voters. ""Now people just say, 'Forget it, I'm not going to vote'.""Kobach rejects accusations the law is designed to suppress voter turnout, particularly among minority and low-income voters who tend to back Democrats. He says it is aimed at stopping what he describes as a rampant problem of non-citizens voting in U.S. elections - even though there is little evidence of the problem.""Every time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen. That's real disenfranchisement, it's happening every election and it's happening in every state,"" Kobach said, estimating thousands of non-citizens are on voting rolls in big states with large immigrant populations.Citing that threat, Kobach convinced the Kansas legislature in 2015 to give him the power to prosecute voter fraud. But he has won just four misdemeanor illegal voting convictions, mostly involving people who owned at least two properties and cast votes in both locations. None involved non-citizens voting, although Kobach said more complaints will be filed.U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson, who issued a May 17 order that Kansas begin to register more than 18,000 voters kept off the rolls by the proof of citizenship law, noted Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and the onset of the law in 2013.RISK OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT

""The court cannot find that the state's interest in preventing non-citizens from voting in Kansas outweighs the risk of disenfranchising thousands of qualified voters,"" she wrote.Of the 16,775 people on a late-April suspense list obtained by Reuters, more than half were ages 17 through 21, and more than 60 percent were age 25 or under. They were clustered in the high-population areas of Wichita, Topeka and the Kansas City suburbs, and the college towns of Lawrence and Manhattan.About 41 percent were unaffiliated, more than the approximately 30 percent of registered Kansas voters who are unaffiliated. About 35 percent of those on the list were Democrats, compared to 24 percent of registered voters. Twenty-three percent were Republicans, compared to 45 percent of registered voters, according to a Reuters analysis of the data.Younger voters, who are more likely to register as unaffiliated or Democrats, have a harder time getting the documents needed and have less patience with what has become an unwieldy process, said Michael Smith, a professor at Emporia State University who has studied the Kansas suspense list.Kobach said it was ""natural"" that young people were heavily represented on the suspense list because they are the majority of new registrants. He rejected criticism that a proof of citizenship requirement created a higher barrier for registrants.""If you define a barrier to voting as just having to do something before you vote, every state has that barrier, virtually every state requires proof of address,"" he said. In her court ruling, Robinson said the Kansas requirement conflicted with a federal law designed to make it easier to register while getting a driver's license. She ordered Kansas on June 14 to begin registering Stricker and other residents who had submitted voter applications through state motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of citizenship.They will be able to vote in federal elections for the presidency and U.S. Congress.  But Robinson's ruling did not end the proof of citizenship requirement for Kansans who register by mail or at locations other than motor vehicle offices, and it left even those registering while getting a driver's license ineligible to vote for state and local offices.For now, that has created a chaotic two-tier system where some Kansans can vote in state elections and some cannot, some need to provide proof of citizenship and others do not, and many county election officials are uncertain how to proceed.""It's a complete mess,"" said Marge Ahrens, co-president of the nonpartisan Kansas League of Women Voters.
