By Ian Simpson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on Wednesday for a renewed fight for a more-inclusive United States despite disappointment over an election loss that laid bare national divisions.In her first public remarks since conceding to Republican Donald Trump last week, Clinton said that many Americans were asking whether his victory meant the United States was still the country they thought it was.""The divisions laid bare by this election run deep, but please listen to me when I say this. America is worth it, our children are worth it,"" she said at a Children Defense Fund event honoring scholarship winners.""Believe in our country, fight for our values and never, ever give up.""Although Fund founder Marian Wright Edelman called the nonprofit advocacy group's event ""a love-in for Hillary Rodham Clinton,"" the former first lady said it had not been easy for her to attend.
""There have been times this past week when all I wanted to do was just to curl up with a good book or our dogs, and never leave the house again,"" said Clinton, whose ties to the Children Defense Fund date back to her work there as a young law student.Clinton, a former secretary of state, won the popular vote but lost the crucial electoral college tally to Trump, a New York real estate magnate who has taken a hard line on immigration and has opposed accepting Syrian refugees.""I know many of you are deeply disappointed by the results of the election. I am too, more than I can ever express,"" Clinton said.
""But as I said last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love, and building an America that is hopeful, inclusive and big hearted.""She said that help for children backed by Republicans and Democrats was a hopeful sign of both parties working together. The federal Children's Health Insurance Program, for example, now covers 8 million children and its creation had relied on bipartisan support, Clinton said.
""For the sake of our children, and our families and our country, I ask you to stay engaged, stay engaged on every level,"" Clinton said.She added, ""I am as sure of this as anything I have ever known. America is still the greatest country in the world, it is still the place where anyone can beat the odds."" (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Michael Perry)"

By David Lawder and Denny Thomas
| WASHINGTON/HONG KONG

WASHINGTON/HONG KONG U.S. lawmakers should take action to ban China's state-owned firms from acquiring U.S. companies, a congressional panel charged with monitoring security and trade links between Washington and Beijing said on Wednesday.In its annual report to Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said the Chinese Communist Party has used state-backed enterprises as the primary economic tool to advance and achieve its national security objectives.The report recommended Congress prohibit U.S. acquisitions by such entities by changing the mandate of CFIUS, the U.S. government body that conducts security reviews of proposed acquisitions by foreign firms.""The Commission recommends Congress amend the statute authorizing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to bar Chinese state-owned enterprises from acquiring or otherwise gaining effective control of U.S. companies,"" the report said.CFIUS, led by the U.S. Treasury and with representatives from eight other agencies, including the departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security, now has veto power over acquisitions from foreign private and state-controlled firms if it finds that a deal would threaten U.S. national security or critical infrastructure.If enacted, the panel's recommendation would essentially create a blanket ban on U.S. purchases by Chinese state-owned enterprises.The report ""has again revealed the commission's stereotypes and prejudices,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in Beijing. ""We ask that Chinese companies investing abroad abide by local laws and regulations, and we hope that relevant countries will create a level playing field,"" he told a daily news briefing.
EXTRA WEIGHT
The panel's report is purely advisory, but could carry extra weight this year because they come as President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is formulating its trade and foreign policy agenda and vetting candidates for key economic and security positions.Congress also could be more receptive, after U.S. voter sentiment against job losses to China and Mexico helped Republicans retain control of both the House and the Senate in last week's election.
Trump strongly criticized China throughout the U.S. election campaign, grabbing headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office.""Chinese state owned enterprises are arms of the Chinese state,"" Dennis Shea, chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, told a news conference.""We don't want the U.S. government purchasing companies in the United States, why would we want the Chinese Communist government purchasing companies in the United States?""The recommendation to change laws governing CFIUS was one of 20 proposals the panel made to Congress. On the military side, it called for a government investigation into how far outsourcing to China has weakened the U.S. defense industry.
The 16-year-old panel also said Congress should pass legislation that would require its pre-approval of any move by the U.S. Commerce Department to declare China a ""market economy"" and limit anti-dumping tariffs against the country.The United States and U.S. businesses attracted a record $64.5 billion worth of deals involving buyers from mainland China this year, more than any other country targeted by Chinese buyers, according to Thomson Reuters data. The push into the United States is part of a global overseas buying spree by Chinese companies that this year has seen a record $200 billion worth of deals, nearly double last year's tally. CFIUS has shown a higher degree of activism against Chinese buyers this year, catching some by surprise. Prominent deals that fell victim to CFIUS include Tsinghua Holdings' $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital (WDC.O).    Overall, data do not demonstrate CFIUS has been a significant obstacle for Chinese investment in the United States. In 2014, the latest year for which data is available, China topped the list of foreign countries in CFIUS review with 24 deals reviewed out of more than 100 scrutinized by CFIUS.Although the number of Chinese transactions reviewed rose in absolute terms, it fell as a share of overall Chinese acquisitions, the report noted, and the vast majority of deals reviewed by CFIUS were cleared.

By Greg Torode
| HONG KONG

HONG KONG A U.S. congressional panel has warned of an ""alarming"" rise in China's interference in Hong Kong, noting fears over the former British colony's continued role as a global financial hub.In its annual report to Congress on Wednesday, the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission highlights the ""chilling"" abduction and detention of five booksellers based in Hong Kong as well as pressure on media and academic freedoms.Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that ensures its freedoms, independent legal system and wide-ranging autonomy remain intact.The commission, in a detailed 33-page section, urges a fresh probe from the State Department into Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, as well as continued congressional oversight.""Hong Kong's traditional standing as a global financial hub has significant economic implications for the United States, as U.S. trade and investment ties with Hong Kong are substantial,"" the report notes.It says the booksellers' detentions - including two foreign nationals and one who was abducted inside Hong Kong - broadened domestic fears of mainland encroachment and sparked a record turnout in September's legislative election.""This incident has threatened the maintenance of the 'one country, two systems' framework and led some observers to question Hong Kong's status as a leading global financial hub,"" the report warns.
""The election took place against the backdrop of an alarming rise in mainland interference in Hong Kong.""U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton also introduced a bill that would freeze U.S.-based assets and ban U.S. entry of those responsible for the ""surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of certain booksellers and journalists in Hong Kong"", according to a statement on Rubio's senate website.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Hong Kong was an internal matter for China and no foreign country had the right to interfere.
""In order to try to split the country, some forces have openly sought foreign support,"" Geng told a daily news briefing.""Those who attempt to use foreign forces to achieve their own political goals will not succeed.""The report comes amid deepening concerns in Beijing over a fledgling independence movement in the city. The High Court this week backed a government demand to bar two recently elected lawmakers, who insulted China when taking their oath of office, from the legislature.In a statement after the report's release, the Hong Kong government said the ""one country, two systems"" principle was being implemented successfully, as was the city's role as a global commercial hub. It also urged foreign parties not to interfere.
The booksellers were involved in the production and sale of gossipy political titles banned in mainland China but freely available in Hong Kong. Their plight fueled Western governments' concerns and sparked formal diplomatic protests.One of the five men, Swedish passport holder Gui Minhai, who disappeared from the Thai resort of Pattaya last October, is the only one still in detention in China.Another, Lam Wing-kee, returned to Hong Kong in June, saying he had been held captive by Chinese agents for eight months. The report places the worsening climate in the city in the context of China's broader disregard for international legal agreements and norms on issues such as the South China Sea and Taiwan.

BEIJING A powerful U.S. senator said he is concerned that state-owned ChemChina, which is buying Swiss crop protection and seed group Syngenta (SYNN.S) for $43 billion, could use U.S. sovereign immunity laws to shield itself from claims in U.S. courts.Some Chinese state-owned entities have argued that they have sovereign immunity and thus can't be sued in U.S. courts under the U.S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976.The acquisition by China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) [CNNCC.UL] of Syngenta, the largest global investment by a Chinese company, won U.S. regulatory clearance in August despite concerns from some lawmakers over U.S. food security.This week, a U.S. congressional panel urged lawmakers to take action to ban Chinese state-owned firms from acquiring U.S. companies.In a Nov. 9 letter to U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley that was posted on his website, ChemChina said its U.S.-incorporated businesses are subject to U.S. civil law, and that FSIA does not apply to commercial activity. 
Grassley, who represents the U.S. agricultural powerhouse state of Iowa, said in a Nov. 16 response that he remained concerned that ChemChina could seek to shield itself from U.S. court jurisdiction. ""While ChemChina indicated that immunity would not extend to Syngenta's U.S. business, the company failed to note that immunity would otherwise apply to a wholly state-owned entity,"" he said on his website. Some legal experts say the sovereign immunity defense, intended under international law to shield governments from legal rulings made by a foreign power, typically does not apply to commercial cases.
ChemChina's acquisition is now in the process of gaining approval from the European Commission, and the deal is expected to be closed around the end of March.In its letter to Grassley, ChemChina said the Chinese government does not interfere with ChemChina's operations and has not directed ChemChina or any of its affiliates to engage in price-fixing with competitors. 
""Syngenta will continue to have its same strategy, management, people and culture and its headquarters in Basel. No jobs will be lost and no jobs will go overseas as a result of this transaction,"" it said.ChemChina also said the Chinese government does not interfere with its operations and has not directed ChemChina or any of its affiliates to engage in price fixing with competitors.

By Benjamin Kang Lim and Kevin Yao
| BEIJING

BEIJING Whether President-elect Donald Trump goes through with a deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea will be a key indicator to how political ties unfold with China, sources with ties to the leadership in Beijing said.Beijing will also be keeping a close eye on Trump's meeting on Thursday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, its key regional rival, for clues on how the President-elect, who has never held public office, is likely to conduct foreign policy, they said.South Korea and the United States have agreed to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system  to counter missile threats from North Korea. It is expected to be in place within eight to 10 months, the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea said earlier this month.China has argued the planned deployment undermines strategic stability in Northeast Asia, and worries that THAAD's powerful radar provides coverage of China's missile installations.""Whether deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense is delayed is a political weather vane,"" one source said.A security adviser to Trump said last week his meeting in New York with Abe on Thursday may mark the start of talks to garner Tokyo's support for a push-back against China's growing influence in Asia.""We have heard what he said. We will now watch what he does,"" said the source, requesting anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to media.""We will play it by ear,"" the source said, invoking an idiom that translates to blocking a punch or a kick as it comes.DOUBT OVER ALLIANCES

Trump has created doubts over his commitment to security alliances with Japan and South Korea, suggesting they need to pay more for a U.S. military presence and even hinting they should develop their own nuclear weapons capability.Japan going nuclear would be China's worst nightmare and is likely to provoke strong reaction, diplomats and analysts have said.China's relations with Japan have long been poisoned by what Beijing sees as Tokyo's failure to fully atone for its invasion and occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two as well as competing claims over a group of East China Sea islets.""Northeast Asia would be a powder keg,"" a second source said, referring to a nuclearized sub-region including China, Japan, North and South Korea.The State Council Information Office, or cabinet spokesman's office, had no immediate comment.
China is generally opposed to military alliances, seeing them as Cold War relics. FLUID TIES
China's stability-obsessed leaders do not know what to make of the 70-year-old Trump, whose win over Hillary Clinton was unexpected, and has backpedaled on some of his more controversial campaign statements.For example, Trump pledged his commitment to defending South Korea under an existing security alliance during a phone call last week with South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Trump had said during the election campaign he would be willing to withdraw the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea unless Seoul paid a greater share of the cost of the U.S. deployment.
Trump told Reuters in an interview in May he was willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program - a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation - but has also called for China to do more to rein in Pyongyang.Sino-U.S. relations after Trump takes office on Jan. 20 are expected to be fluid, although Chinese President Xi Jinping told Trump during a telephone call on Monday cooperation was the ""only correct choice"" for the two giants.A statement from Trump's presidential transition office said the two men ""established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another"" and he believes the two countries will have one of the strongest relationships moving forward.Trump's election does offer some good news for China: it signals the demise of the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which excludes China; it raises the possibility of belated U.S. backing for the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and possibly marks an end to President Obama's strategic ""pivot"" to Asia.The bad news is that Trump has often made provocative remarks about China during his campaign, including threats to slap 45 percent tariffs on imports from China and label the world's second-biggest economy a currency manipulator.Wei Jianguo, a retired vice commerce minister, was optimistic a trade war could be avoided.""Protectionism is on the rise, but a trade war between China and the United States is unlikely,"" Wei, vice chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a government-backed think-tank, told Reuters.""That was just election rhetoric,"" he said.

By Colin Packham
| SYDNEY

SYDNEY Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull became one of the first world leaders to speak to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump this week, but only after one of Trump's old golfing buddies was asked to chip in.Turnbull confirmed that Australian golfing great and former world number one Greg Norman had been tapped to help facilitate the introduction to Trump, who includes building golf courses among his many business interests.The connection enabled Turnbull to jump the line of world leaders waiting to get the new U.S. leader on the phone, well ahead of larger allies like Britain and Japan, after Trump's surprise win in last week's presidential election.""In diplomacy and policies, you use lots of networks. All I can say is we have great networks, great connections and Greg Norman is a great Australian,"" Turnbull said on Thursday.""(Norman) is a great advocate for strengthening the Australian-American alliance. One of our greatest assets is the more than million Australians who live overseas,"" he told reporters in Sydney.
Australia's unconventional diplomatic approach reflects the apparent confusion that surrounds the incoming Trump administration as it  works on the transition before he is sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Norman, a U.S. resident, described Republican Trump as a friend and said he was happy to help.
""Donald, for all his bluster, rhetoric and aggressive style of messaging, caught the attention of those that needed a rudder for their forgotten ship and beliefs,"" Norman said in a statement.""Like it or not, he made a poignant and powerful impact on a base that sat sadly alienated,"" he said.Damon Hunt, a spokesman for Turnbull, said Australia had already been using its network of expatriates in the United States to canvass both candidates well before Trump unexpectedly defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
Trump's contact information was handed on to Australia's ambassador in the United States, Joe Hockey, who then relayed it to Turnbull, Hunt said.""The only thing that was unusual about it was that we built relationships with both sides. A lot of countries and certain politicians just picked the Democrats, we were never going to back just one horse,"" Hunt said. (Reporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Paul Tait)"

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON China and the United States must avoid being overly suspicious of each other's strategic intentions, China's ambassador to the United States said on Wednesday while looking ahead to the Presidency of Donald Trump.Trump lambasted China throughout the U.S. election campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office.He has also vowed to build up the U.S. Navy in what advisers say will be a strategy to reassure countries in the Asia-Pacific worried about China's assertive pursuit of territorial claims.China's Washington envoy, Cui Tiankai, told a film screening to commemorate the 1979 normalization of U.S.-China ties that after ""a most unusual political season,"" it was important to build consensus and identify common ground.He said both countries were already cooperating on many issues, but added:""We have to make greater efforts to promote better mutual understanding and we should be careful not to be overly suspicious about each other's strategic intentions.""There are people here in the United States who believe that everything that China does is aimed at challenging the United States' s global dominance, and there are people who believe that everything the U.S. is doing is aimed at containing China.
""I think both views are wrong.""There would inevitably be problems and challenges in the next four years, Cui said, ""but ... I am quite confident that, on the whole, the relationship will move forward on a stable and right track.""Cui said the countries had a shared responsibility to cooperate on issues such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
""We both want stability in the world. We both strive for a stronger global economy, and we both need a better natural environment. Common goals call for a close partnership."" Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Monday and Xi told the U.S. President-elect cooperation was the only choice for the world's two largest economies, while Trump said they had established a ""clear sense of mutual respect.""Nevertheless, Trump's election has created uncertainty when Beijing hopes for stability as it faces daunting reform challenges at home, slowing growth and a leadership reshuffle that will assemble a new party elite around Xi in late 2017. Zbigniew Brzezinski, who as U.S. National Security Adviser drove normalization with China in the late 1970s told the same Washington event the world was watching U.S. political developments ""with some stupefaction.""
""We are now living in a political system, a worldwide system, that is experiencing a very serious crisis... . (I)t is potentially threatening to both sides, to the well-being of global stability,"" he said.""You can have serious political problems in China ... there are serious problems in the United States. We don't know how we will be managing responsibilities in the foreseeable future, given some of the initial warning signals,"" Brzezinski said.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic U.S. senators elected Chuck Schumer of New York as minority leader on Wednesday, and he tapped former presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders to help Democrats woo blue-collar workers, many of whom voted for President-elect Donald Trump.Senate Republicans also met and voted to keep Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the majority leader.Schumer, 65, replaces the retiring Harry Reid of Nevada as the top Democrat in the Senate as the party prepares to deal with Republican Trump and Republican majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives.Schumer said Democrats had learned from the Nov. 8 election that they needed ""a sharper, bolder economic message about returning the economic system which so many feel is rigged against them to one that works for the people.""""We're ready to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Republicans, working with soon-to-be-President Trump on issues where we agree, but we will go toe-to-toe against the president-elect whenever our values or the progress we've made is under assault,"" Schumer, who has been in the Senate since 1999, told reporters after the Democrats' closed-door election.
In a move recognizing the influence of Sanders with many working-class voters, Schumer asked the independent senator from Vermont to be caucus head of outreach. Sanders, who lost the presidential primary to former senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, said his job was to reach out to ""grassroots America.""Another liberal, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was given the role of vice chair of the conference while yet another progressive voice, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, was made conference secretary.Senator Joe Manchin, a more conservative Democrat from West Virginia, was named vice chairman of the Democratic policy and communications committee. 
Schumer said he knew there would be differences of opinion on the new team, but that together the group could ""speak to the blue-collar worker in West Virginia, and Michigan, as well as the people who live along the coast."" Trump's economic populism helped him flip some once-reliably Democratic areas in blue-collar states while Democrats did better in large urban centers and coastal states.
Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois remained minority whip, the No. 2 spot, while Senator Patty Murray of Washington was chosen as assistant Democratic leader.In the House, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi announced she was running for minority leader again and said she already has the support of more than two-thirds of her caucus.Pelosi, who may face a challenger, agreed this week to delay leadership elections until Nov. 30 after her fellow Democrats called for more time to reassess why they fell short of their goals in the Nov. 8 election.

By Dustin Volz and Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has not announced a point person dedicated to cyber security policy or staffing in his administration, an omission that could make the United States more vulnerable to threats and worsen a government cyber talent shortfall, current and former national security officials said.They and multiple sources involved with the Trump transition organization said they were unaware of any person in the Trump orbit who is dealing specifically with cyber security, and that there has been minimal contact with federal agencies.The apparent lack of expertise or prioritization coincides with U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, having   pivoted to digital warfare to address the growing national security and economic threats that nation-states and extremist groups pose in cyberspace.In response to a request for comment, a Trump spokeswoman referred to a cyber-security ""vision"" on Republican Trump's campaign website, which calls for an immediate review of U.S. cyber defenses and vulnerabilities and lists high-profile hacks as ""key issues"" without further explanation.It did not mention cyber attacks on Democratic Party political organizations during the election campaign that the U.S. government said were carried out by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 vote. Trump praised WikiLeaks for publishing leaked emails from his opponent Hillary Clinton's campaign and also questioned whether Russia was responsible for the hacks.A former National Security Agency (NSA) official who reviewed the ""vision"" statement said it was short on detail.Kellyanne Conway, a senior advisor to Trump who managed his campaign, told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower Wednesday that reports of a rocky transition process were false.""You don't form a federal government overnight,"" she said.The ousting of former Republican lawmaker Mike Rogers from Trump's transition team on Tuesday left a void of expertise on cyber and intelligence matters for the president-elect, officials said.  Rogers, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee while in Congress was talked about in Washington as a potential CIA Director or Director of National Intelligence.
Former Defense Intelligence Agency Director Michael Flynn and retired lieutenant general Ronald Burgess are part of Trump's transition team. They were focused on intelligence and security matters, according to a Trump team document that has circulated among Washington trade and lobbying organizations in the week since the New York businessman's stunning election victory.Flynn is a contender to be the next Director of National Intelligence or White House National Security Adviser, according to people close to him and multiple media reports. A less likely possibility, according to the people, is Flynn would be named head of the National Security Agency.But neither Flynn nor Burgess are experts on cyber security, nor have they indicated an interest in the subject to Obama administration officials, sources close to the Trump and Obama teams said.TALENT GAP

The federal government has struggled for years to keep pace with the rising need for cyber talent. A July memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget found a critical shortage of talent across the country was worsened in government, caused in part by an inability to compete with lucrative salaries in the private sector. James Norton, a former George W. Bush administration official who helped set up the Department of Homeland Security's first cyber security team, said that Trump's transition team may be waiting to move forward on the issue until after cabinet-level security posts are filled. ""Cyber will be a priority,"" said Norton, now president of Washington-based consulting firm Play-Action Strategies LLC. ""There's a little bit of fog, but I think that will clear once the names of the nominees are out."" But finding and retaining qualified technical people to serve in government may become even more difficult under a Trump presidency because of disagreements with his policies and politics, three former national security officials said. 
The president-elect's bombastic statements on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and at times elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the Internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda or urged his supporters to boycott Apple when it refused to help the FBI unlock an iPhone tied to one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters.Susan Hennessey, a former attorney in the office of the general counsel at the NSA, said she has been urging people in the intelligence community to keep working in Trump's administration because their expertise will be necessary to protect the country and resist potential abuses of executive power on issues such as surveillance.""In candor, I'm sad to be asking former colleagues whom I respect to consider setting aside their conscience in order to serve their country,"" said Hennessey, who now serves as managing editor of the national security blog Lawfare. ""I can't and don't blame anyone who feels they can't stay.""A current national security official who has been approached by the Trump transition team said all or most political appointees in the Obama administration are expected to be sent packing after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. He predicted that as much as five to 10 percent of the federal workforce also might leave. Richard Clarke, a former senior White House advisor on counterterrorism and cyber security in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, said Trump's election presents an opportunity to civil servants to help shape or resist the president-elect's opinion on policy matters. He said many of the same concerns about Trump existed within the federal bureaucracy when former President Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980.""These people like Reagan and Trump are not well-grounded in policy,"" Clarke said. ""They don't have a lot of firm beliefs that stem from years of analysis and experience,"" Clarke told Reuters. ""You can change their mind if you do it subtly, if they trust you. And you may not even know you've changed their mind, because they don't know what their mind is.""Some parts of government are more effective than others at ""slow-rolling"" the president's impulses, Clarke said. But ""you can't slow-roll work that needs to be done,"" such as improving cyber security and addressing cyber threats, he said.
