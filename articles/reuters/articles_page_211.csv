WASHINGTON The Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would revamp federal chemical safety protections for the first time in decades, sending it to President Barack Obama for his expected signing into law.The Senate approved the measure that was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives on May 25.The bill would update the Toxic Substances Control Act amid complaints that its 40-year-old provisions hobble the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from effectively regulating chemicals, including those ranging from asbestos and flame retardants to everyday household products.
""No one disputes that this bill transfers power from the states to the federal government,"" Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky complained during debate of the bill.He said it would add hundreds of new regulations that will burden the U.S. chemical industry and hurt jobs.
The EPA, under the bill, would have to consider the impact of a chemical on human health and the environment, as well as the chemical's benefits and the economic impact of regulation.

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The White House threatened on Tuesday to veto a Senate defense policy bill, saying it would prevent President Barack Obama from closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and limit the size of his National Security Council.""The bill would undermine expert judgments of the (Defense) Department's civilian and military leadership and constrain the ability of the president and the secretary of defense to appropriately manage and direct the nation's defense,"" the White House said in a statement.The $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, sets spending policy for the Pentagon each year. The Republican-led Congress generally uses the must-pass bill as a vehicle for a range of policy measures.The Senate Armed Services Committee passed the bill last month. It is now being debated in the full Senate, where lawmakers have introduced hundreds of amendments. Obama had already threatened to veto the House of Representatives' version of the annual bill, which passed that chamber last month. The White House opposed it for a number of reasons, including its use of $18 billion in special war funds for day-to-day military programs to avoid automatic budget cuts.The Senate version did not adopt that strategy. But Senator John McCain, the Armed Services Committee's Republican chairman, filed an amendment with a similar plan to use $18 billion of so-called Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to pay for additional troops, more equipment and an increase in a planned military pay increase.
KEEP AMERICA SAFE
McCain and other Republicans argued that the increased spending was necessary to keep Americans safe.
In a statement, he criticized Obama's veto threat as ""a sorry defense of the status quo,"" and said he hoped Obama would change his mind.""I hope when the NDAA reaches the president's desk, he understands the critical importance of this legislation to our national security better than his administration seems to now,"" McCain said.Democrats said they would support more military spending if Republicans also approved spending on civilian programs.
Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate, said Democrats would offer their own amendment, adding funding for airport security, to combat Zika, for local police, to fight opioid addiction and improve infrastructure.""If the Republicans pass the defense amendment but then block a similar increase to middle-class programs, they will have broken the budget agreement and the appropriations process will come to a grinding halt,"" Reid told a news conference.After the House and Senate pass their versions of the NDAA, the two chambers agree on a final version of the bill. If that passes, it is sent for Obama to veto or sign into law.Obama vetoed the 2016 NDAA because it sought to increase defense spending by using the war funds, and over the restrictions involving the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for terrorism suspects. He eventually signed a version with the Guantanamo measures after the spending plan was removed.

By Chris Kahn

Republican Donald Trump trails Democrat Hillary Clinton by 10 points in the 2016 presidential campaign, according to a poll released on Tuesday, showing little change from a week ago and suggesting his comments about a Mexican-American judge had yet to affect his standing in the race.The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll came after several days in which Trump faced sharp criticism over his insistence that a federal judge who was born in Indiana to Mexican parents was biased in a case involving the celebrity billionaire.But the fallout from Trump's comments appeared to have done little to help Clinton build her lead over the presumptive Republican nominee.  The online survey showed that 44.3 percent of likely voters said they would vote for Clinton, compared with 34.7 percent who would support Trump. A further 20.9 percent said they would not vote for either candidate. The results were little changed from last week's survey.The poll was conducted from Friday to Tuesday, starting shortly after Trump's first comments about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against Trump University, the New York businessman's defunct real estate school.Trump has suggested that Curiel's heritage is influencing the judge's opinion about the case because of Trump's campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called Trump's comments textbook racism on Tuesday, while Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Trump should stop attacking minority groups.Bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, Trump said on Tuesday he would no longer talk about the judge, adding that his previous remarks about Curiel had been misconstrued.Other events, including news that Clinton had secured enough  delegates and superdelegates to become the first female presidential candidate of a major U.S. political party, occurred toward the end of the poll.The poll included 1,261 respondents and had a credibility interval of 3.2 percentage points.

For most of the year, Clinton has maintained an edge over Trump in the Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters. That edge briefly disappeared in May after Trump's remaining rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out and party leaders started to line up behind his campaign. Trump's level of support has since eroded as he sparred with his party's leadership and continued to be dogged with questions about Trump University.The Reuters/Ipsos poll differs from others that are often days removed from when their data was collected. As a result, the Reuters/Ipsos poll often detects shifts in opinion well ahead of other surveys.

TAMPA, Fla. Florida Democrats demanded investigations on Tuesday into a donation made by a Donald Trump foundation to the state's attorney general, citing an Associated Press report that the Republican attorney general solicited the money around the time her office was considering a lawsuit against Trump University.At question is a 2013 donation of $25,000 from a Trump charity to a political committee supporting the attorney general, Pam Bondi, that has received media scrutiny this year. ""Florida's top law enforcement official solicited a donation from someone she was supposed to be investigating for fraud,"" Florida Democratic Party Chair Allison Tant said in a statement.""She even went as far as to campaign for Trump, who has made a habit of bragging about buying politicians. Floridians deserve answers and Pam Bondi must be held accountable,"" Tant added.Bondi, who has endorsed Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, on Tuesday called the AP report misleading.
""My office has made public every document on this issue, which shows no one in my office ever opened an investigation on Trump University nor was there a basis for doing so,"" she said in a statement. ""Any news story that suggests otherwise is completely false."" The Trump campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The Associated Press reported on Monday that Bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join a New York state investigation into Trump's defunct real estate training school.Trump is fighting lawsuits that accuse his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaire's real estate investment strategies.
Bondi ended the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived, the AP reported. At the time of the donation, she was seeking re-election.The Tampa Bay Times quoted a Bondi spokesman saying on Monday that documents released in the case ""consistently demonstrate that through due diligence, staff assessed matters brought to their attention and properly determined that New York litigation seeks relief for any and all aggrieved consumers, regardless of their state of residence.""

By Karen Freifeld
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A ruling by New York's highest court in a fraud case against former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) Chief Executive Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg could affect the state's case against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his defunct Trump University.The New York Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman could seek to recoup millions of dollars in bonus payments to Greenberg using the legal remedy called disgorgement.Unlike damages, which are used to compensate victims' losses, disgorgement requires a defendant to give back gains obtained from unlawful means. The ruling means that Schneiderman can go after $5 million he says Trump personally pocketed from the Trump University real-estate seminar venture.""It doesn't help him,"" Jeffrey Goldman, Trump's lawyer in the New York case, said on Monday of the Greenberg ruling. But Goldman said Trump expected to win the case and could also try to limit the amount subject to disgorgement, such as by arguing that most of it was earned outside of New York.
According to the state's 2013 lawsuit against Trump, filed in state court in Manhattan, Trump University was an unlicensed, illegal operation that bilked students of up to $35,000 each between 2005 and 2011. Two proposed class actions in California make similar allegations.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly raised the Trump University litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated. He has also accused the federal judge overseeing the California lawsuits of being biased against him because of his ethnicity. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents.
In the Greenberg case, the state accused the former CEO of orchestrating sham transactions at AIG and misleading shareholders about the company's financial health between 2000 and 2005. Schneiderman is asking that Greenberg disgorge some $25 million in bonuses during that period, plus interest. Greenberg has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, David Boies, who represented Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore in the dispute over the 2000 election recount, had argued that disgorgement was not a remedy available to the New York attorney general under either the state's securities fraud law or another fraud statute. The Court of Appeals rejected Boies' arguments.
The ability to seek disgorgement may be useful to Schneiderman because the California cases involving Trump University may be resolved before the New York case. One is scheduled for trial on Nov. 28, just a few weeks after the Nov. 8 election. A settlement or judgment in those cases could undermine Schneiderman's claim for $40 million in damages because he is suing on behalf of many of the same former Trump University students. But disgorgement claims would not be affected. (Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Anthony Lin and Peter Cooney)"

WASHINGTON Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday his comments questioning the impartiality of a Mexican-American judge had been misconstrued as a broad attack on people of Mexican heritage.Trump said, however, that it was fair to question the judge's impartiality in the civil suit against Trump University and whether he could receive a fair trial.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A senior U.S. senator said on Tuesday he would like to pass legislation to extend expiring sanctions on Iran and enable Congress to quickly enact new ones if necessary over the country's ballistic missile tests.The Iran Sanctions Act, which imposed nuclear, missile and terrorism sanctions on Iran, expires at the end of 2016, and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress support extending it.But Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged that lawmakers have not yet unified behind a proposal that would attract enough votes to pass and become law.""Members have different views,"" he said at a roundtable discussion with reporters.The Obama administration has warned Congress that it would oppose new sanctions that interfere with the international nuclear pact, laying the groundwork for a potential fight over any legislation.
Senator Bob Corker, the committee's Republican chairman, has said he is working on legislation with Cardin that he hopes will attract strong bipartisan support. That measure has not yet been unveiled and aides said they had no more information about when it might be introduced.Cardin was one of several Democrats who joined every Republican in Congress in opposing the nuclear agreement with Iran announced last July. But he has urged lawmakers to accept it since a Republican-led effort to block the pact failed in September.
After the deal went ahead, Cardin filed legislation meant to increase U.S. oversight of it. That bill never came up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.Cardin said he still felt that bill was valid and wants to amend it to extend the Iran Sanctions Act and create a ""legislative framework"" so sanctions could be imposed quickly if Iran pursues its ballistic missile program.Late last month, two Democratic senators who supported the Iran nuclear agreement, Tim Kaine and Chris Murphy, introduced a separate bill to extend the Iran Sanctions Act until Obama can guarantee Iran's nuclear program is purely peaceful. 
And Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte, with 18 other senators form her party, introduced a separate bill that would extend the Iran Sanctions Act through 2031 and require new sanctions over Iran's ballistic missile efforts.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has said he wants any Iran bill to come to the floor with at least the 67 votes needed to override a presidential veto.

By Dan Freed
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The chair of the House Financial Services Committee has proposed getting rid of much of the regulation put in place after the financial crisis, unveiling a plan on Tuesday that ignited fierce debate in the presidential election but is expected to flame out in Washington.In a sweeping speech at the Economic Club of New York, Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, from Texas, laid out his ideas on weakening the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law just as polls opened in six states holding presidential primaries.Hensarling also met on Tuesday with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee who has called for dismantling the massive reform law.Trump's campaign declined to comment on Hensarling's plan. The lawmaker told Fox Business Network on Tuesday he would not describe the ""blow-by-blow"" of his meeting with Trump but said they had common ground on Dodd-Frank. Meanwhile, the Democrats' likely nominee, Hillary Clinton, sought to tie the real-estate tycoon to Hensarling's proposal. Clinton ""strongly opposes Chairman Hensarling and Donald Trump's efforts to gut critical reforms put in place to protect the public after the financial crisis,"" said her adviser Gary Gensler, who headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when Dodd-Frank was passed.""While Republicans attempt to roll back measures that protect consumers and curb excessive risk-taking on Wall Street, Hillary Clinton will fight to defend Dodd-Frank and go beyond it, with tough new rules, stronger enforcement and more accountability."" Hensarling's plan would allow banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or meeting much tougher capital requirements.It would also throw out the Volcker Rule that restricts banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council consisting of regulatory agencies' heads to designate firms as ""systemically important,"" also known as ""too big to fail."" That label triggers requirements to hold more capital and abide by stricter regulations.
In essence, Hensarling said his plan involved ""far more loss-absorbing capital and far less federal control.""It would also maintain the law's section on derivatives and keep the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by Dodd-Frank, albeit with a changed structure.""I'm only replacing 89.7 percent of Dodd-Frank,"" Hensarling joked.Few expect the plan, previewed in a video last week, to become law soon. While it could pass the Republican-controlled Congress, it would then have to be signed by President Barack Obama, who also signed Dodd-Frank into law. 
On Tuesday White House spokesman Josh Earnest said reforms enacted after the crisis ""essentially guarantee that taxpayers will not be on the hook for bailing out big banks if their risky bets go south.""But Obama leaves office in January and those vying to replace him, including Senator Bernie Sanders running as a Democrat, have distinct views on regulation and Wall Street.""Those on the left who gave us Dodd-Frank believe in the principle that human nature is self-destructive and that people  - except themselves, of course - are fundamentally ignorant,"" Hensarling said, demonstrating the political charge of his ideas. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick, shot back that Republicans seek ""to make life easier for mega bankers and tougher for ordinary Americans."" Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is a firebrand for stronger regulation, said ""while most Republicans in Congress are debating not whether to run away from Trump - but how far and how fast - Congressman Hensarling is sprinting toward Trump Tower."" 
Trump has given few clues to how he would take apart Dodd-Frank and what he might put in its place. ""Here's something we both agree with, and that is Dodd-Frank is impeding economic growth,"" Hensarling told Fox Business. ""I think he well received the message. I think he was interested in the policy.""Clinton has proposed breaking up large banks that take excessive risk, charging institutions a ""risk fee,"" taxing high-frequency trading, and creating more oversight of ""shadow banking.""The most liberal candidate, Sanders has gone further and suggested reinstating the Glass-Steagall law that once separated commercial and investment banking.James Ballentine, head of congressional relations at  American Bankers Association, the industry's lead trade group, said both parties ""agree that parts of Dodd-Frank just aren't working.""""Any law that generates more than 24,000 pages of proposed and final rules will inevitably include problems that should be fixed,"" he said in a statement.
