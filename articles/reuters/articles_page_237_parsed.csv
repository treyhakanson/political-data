WASHINGTON The White House on Friday defended its deportation policy after complaints from Democratic presidential candidates and congressional leaders that a sweep targeting Central American illegal immigrants is inhumane.Reuters reported on Thursday that U.S. immigration officials plan a month-long series of raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally.White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged that the deportation operations were consistent with President Barack Obama's policy to focus on deporting criminals and recent immigrants who crossed the U.S. border illegally after Jan. 1, 2014.""No one is removed if they have an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief,"" Earnest told reporters at a briefing.""If this serves to discourage people from considering to make this journey, that would be a good thing,"" Earnest said.In 2014, a wave of children fleeing violence in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala surged across the U.S. border, inflaming the debate over how to deal with the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.
The planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries by Central American women traveling with their children.In January, immigration officers rounded up 121 people, mostly women and children, in three states. That sparked criticism from Democrats running to replace Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential elections.On Thursday, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton reiterated her concerns about the new plans.
""I'm against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities,"" Clinton said.Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders said he opposed ""the painful and inhumane business of locking up and deporting families"" trying to escape violence in other countries.In Congress, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called on Obama to reconsider the plans and focus on addressing the instability in Central America.
Democratic representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a critic of the Obama administration's deportation policies, complained the administration was leaking word of the deportations to scare people away from coming to the United States.""The last time they did this, people called my office about raids that were not existent because it creates panic, it creates fear, it's terrible, it's a terrible way to bring about policy on this issue,"" Gutierrez told reporters.""Stop talking about them as illegal immigrants. They are asylum seekers,"" he said. (Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu and Richard Cowan; Editing by Chris Reese and Andrew Hay)"	['Reid', 'Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia's government for damages, setting up a potential showdown with the White House, which has threatened a veto.The Saudis, who deny responsibility for the 2001 attacks, strongly object to the bill. They had said they might sell up to $750 billion in U.S. securities and other American assets in retaliation if it became law.The ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,"" or JASTA, passed the Senate by unanimous voice vote. It must next be taken up by the U.S. House of Representatives, where the Judiciary Committee intends to hold a hearing on the measure in the near future, a committee aide said.If it became law, JASTA would remove the sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. It would allow survivors of the attacks, and relatives of those killed in the attacks, to seek damages from other countries.In this case, it would allow lawsuits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir has said his country's objection to the bill is based on principles of international relations. ""What (Congress is) doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday.James Kreindler, a prominent trial lawyer who represents 9/11 families and won large payouts for the victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan American Airways Flight 103 over Scotland, said he expected the bill to pass the House and become law.""It would be crazy for (President Barack) Obama to veto bipartisan legislation (which would) open (U.S.) courts to victims of the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history,"" Kreindler said.
Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat and a JASTA co-sponsor, said the bill is overdue.""Today the Senate has spoken loudly and unanimously that the families of victims of terrorist attacks should be able to hold the perpetrators, even if it's a country, a nation, accountable,"" Schumer told a news conference.CLASSIFIED PAGES OF 9/11 REPORT
Republican Senator John Cornyn, also a sponsor of the bill, said JASTA does not target the Saudis, although he alluded to a still-classified section of a report on the Sept. 11 attacks that Saudi critics say might implicate Riyadh.
""We have yet to see the 28 pages that have not been yet released about the 9/11 report, and that may well be instructive,"" Cornyn said at the news conference.Other lawmakers who have seen the 28 pages have said releasing them would quiet such rumors.Cornyn said it was up to the court to decide whether the Saudis were liable. ""I don't believe that this will be destructive of the relationship that we have with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" he said.The White House said Obama still plans to veto JASTA.
""This legislation would change long-standing, international law regarding sovereign immunity,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a daily press briefing.""And the president of the United States continues to harbor serious concerns that this legislation would make the United States vulnerable in other court systems around the world.""Asked if Senate Democrats would back a veto, Schumer said he would vote against Obama.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who had opposed the bill, said the version passed on Tuesday eased his worries that it might leave U.S. allies more vulnerable to lawsuits, for example if groups based within their borders but not supported by their governments were behind a terrorist attack.""We don't want to alienate allies, but we do want to create redress if a nation-state was involved in helping a terrorist organization attack American interests, and I think they should be held liable,"" Graham said in a brief interview.

WASHINGTON The White House on Tuesday said it strongly opposes a House bill to fight the Zika virus, saying its funding is ""woefully inadequate"" to support the public health response that is needed. The Obama administration has urged Congress to pass legislation that would direct $1.9 billion to fighting the Zika virus that is linked to birth defects including microcephaly.

WASHINGTON A proposal by a U.S. Senate committee to cancel the Defense Department position of acquisition chief could lead to an increase in costs, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Tuesday.The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the National Defense Authorization Act aims to cancel the position of under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics because it slows innovation. The committee is proposing to divide the responsibilities between a new office in the Pentagon that deals with research and another which would address business management.If the acquisition chief position, currently held by Frank Kendall, was cut, it would separate research and engineering from manufacturing and could derail progress made on lowering growth in contract costs over the last three decades, Carter said at the Sea-Air-Space conference.
""Separating these functions makes no sense, as procurement and sustainment costs are controlled by decisions made during development,"" Carter said.
The proposal still has to take a number of steps before it becomes law. The Senate version of the defense bill must be reconciled with the House's version before being voted on in both chambers. If passed, that version would be sent to the White House for President Barack Obama's signature, or veto.    On Monday, the White House said it would veto the House's version of the bill because it would shift $18 billion of wartime Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs.

By Joseph Ax
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday postponed a deadline for prosecutors in New Jersey to reveal a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the so-called ""Bridgegate"" criminal case involving allies of Governor Chris Christie.The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a last-minute emergency request from one of the people on the list, less than two hours before U.S. prosecutors were set to file the names in federal court in New Jersey.The document could make clear how many Christie associates were aware of an alleged scheme to close down lanes at the George Washington Bridge in what prosecutors claim was an act of political retribution against a local mayor.Christie, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for his party's presidential nomination this year, has denied knowledge of the plot.
U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton had ordered the list made public at the request of several media companies.But one of the alleged co-conspirators anonymously filed an emergency appeal, arguing his reputation will be irreparably besmirched.In a brief order, the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia scheduled a hearing for June 6. The court is also considering whether that hearing should be closed to the public, presumably to preserve the individual's anonymity.    
The unindicted co-conspirators are those who prosecutors believe joined in the plot but have not been criminally charged.Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for the media companies, said in an email, ""We're looking forward to making our case before the full 3rd Circuit panel that the public has a First Amendment right to see the list of unindicted co-conspirators.""
Thus far, three people have been charged. William Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, are scheduled to face trial in September.David Wildstein, also a former official at the Port Authority, the agency that oversees major transportation facilities in the New York City area, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating.Prosecutors say they orchestrated the September 2013 lane closure in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as payback against the Democratic mayor for refusing to endorse Christie's re-election bid. The ensuing traffic wreaked havoc in town, causing massive delays and impeding emergency responders.The case has proven embarrassing for Christie, who is heading presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's transition team. The trial will unfold in the heat of the presidential campaign ahead of Election Day, Nov. 8."	['Christie']	[]

By Barbara Goldberg
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The race to succeed Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie got under way this week when a former Goldman Sachs executive entered the ring as the first Democratic contender to succeed Christie, whose popularity has slumped.Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and U.S. ambassador to Germany who has never held elected office, is seeking the Democratic nomination for the gubernatorial  election in November 2017. Christie, who is not eligible to run for a third term, won the governorship in 2009, when he beat one-term Democrat Jon Corzine, also formerly of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Murphy, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany until 2013, said he would focus on issues such as equal pay for women and a higher minimum wage - legislative initiatives that Christie has either already vetoed and is expected to veto. 
""It's time for a governor who has your back. I will,"" promised Murphy, 58, in a campaign ad released on Monday. He is a married father of four who lives in Middletown and retired in 2006 after 23 years at the Wall Street investment bank.Political observers say other possible candidates include Democrats such as state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and Republicans such as Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick, state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr and Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno.Christie has seen his approval ratings fall to fresh lows in recent weeks. He has been tarnished by the ""Bridgegate"" scandal and criticized as a no-show leader preoccupied first with his own presidential campaign and when that failed, with role as a top adviser to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.
""His approval ratings are terrible. They have been low and keep going down. He will leave unpopular,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University.A poll of New Jersey voters last month showed 31 percent approve and 63 percent disapprove of Christie's performance as governor, said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics.
Voters will likely seek a candidate very different from Christie, Zelizer said, particularly on transparency and righting the state's finances. ""They are looking for someone who is antithetical to him. Someone they can trust, someone who is devoted to the state, and someone who seems clean and immune from scandal,"" Zelizer said. ""They want a governor who will bring in new kinds of industry and new pockets of growth."" (Reporting by Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Scott Malone and Cynthia Osterman)"	['Trump', 'Christie']	[]

SYDNEY Australia's center-left opposition Labor Party leader Bill Shorten on Tuesday endorsed U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton over her chief Republican rival, Donald Trump, who he said would be ""very difficult"" to work with.Shorten, who is campaigning against Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ahead of national elections on July 2, pledged to continue Australia's close relationship with the United States regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election.But he made no secret of which candidate he preferred.""In terms of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, I have to say that if I was in America, I would be voting for Hillary Clinton,"" Shorten told reporters.
""Whoever America elects we'll deal with but there's no doubt in my mind that Trump would be very difficult, I think, to deal with.""
Trump's often controversial comments on everything from Muslims and women to the future of NATO and relations with Russia have drawn criticism from Berlin, Paris and other European capitals.British Prime Minister David Cameron this week stood by his description of Trump's plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States as ""divisive, stupid and wrong"" after Trump said that he was unlikely to have a good relationship with Cameron.

By Sharon Bernstein
| SACRAMENTO

SACRAMENTO Two of the most powerful politicians in California are advancing the same basic gun control agenda - yet they are at loggerheads in a political duel that could preview an ugly race to replace the state's popular Democratic governor, Jerry Brown.The spat among ambitious Democrats took a serious turn this week, as Senate leader Kevin de Leon aggressively moved to push a package of gun control bills through the legislature that, if passed, would largely render irrelevant a firearms referendum by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom aimed at the November ballot.""They both want tougher gun laws in California and they both want credit for it,"" said Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist who now heads the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California.Both efforts would prohibit possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require greater scrutiny of ammunition purchasers and seek to better keep guns out of the hands of violent felons. The legislative package, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday and will go before the full body on Thursday, also seeks to eliminate a loophole in an existing law prohibiting weapons with detachable ammunition magazines.Newsom, who is running to replace Brown in the 2018 gubernatorial election, is expected to make the gun control measure a centerpiece of his campaign, along with a proposed ballot initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.  But de Leon has not endorsed him. Last year, shortly after Newsom announced his gun control referendum, de Leon reduced the number of legislative staff working in the lieutenant governor's office. De Leon, who represents Los Angeles, is close to possible Newsom rivals in the governor's race, including former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. 
He has asked Newsom to agree to withdraw his ballot measure if the Senate package passes, but Newsom has refused.""The initiative process is a blunt instrument and should always be the last resort - not the first,"" de Leon said in an email on Monday. ""It would be preferable to achieve policymaking on such a complex issue as gun control through the legislative process.""De Leon is also concerned that the ballot campaign would be expensive, drawing political contributions from pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association and potentially causing Democrats in moderate and conservative districts to lose elections, a source close to him said.
But Newsom said in a letter to de Leon shared with Reuters that his initiative was more comprehensive than the Senate package, tackling topics that had stalled repeatedly in the legislature.Dan Newman, Newsom's campaign strategist, said concerns about gun violence, not politics, motivated the lieutenant governor.""He will get plenty of exposure this fall via his support for the marijuana initiative and Hillary for President,"" Newman said. ""Being relentlessly attacked by the NRA isn't something he needs for his personal ambition.""
Backing a ballot initiative on a controversial topic like gun control will likely raise Newsom's profile with voters, Schnur said. But it could also backfire and alienate de Leon.""It doesn't do his campaign for governor a lot of good to be going up against the most powerful Democrat in the legislature,"" Schnur said.Gun rights supporters say both men are being opportunistic.""Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom is no stranger to trying to hijack high-profile issues in order to get his name out there,"" said Craig Deluz, a lobbyist for the Calgun Foundation. ""And Senate Pro Tem de Leon doesn't want the Lieutenant Governor to steal his thunder."" (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	[]	['guns']
