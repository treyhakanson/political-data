WASHINGTON Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said repealing the Obamacare health insurance system is a ""pretty high item on our agenda"" for the new Congress that was elected on Tuesday, calling it the ""single worst piece of legislation"" from the first two years of the Obama administration.McConnell told reporters he would like to see bipartisan comprehensive tax reform, and that border security should also be high on the to-do list. He expects president-elect Donald Trump to send the Senate a Supreme Court nominee soon, and to review environmental regulations put in place by Obama, including on coal.

By James Oliphant and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK One immediate consequence of Donald Trump's stunning victory in the U.S. presidential race is that the identity crisis that convulsed the Republican Party during his tumultuous candidacy has been resolved.It's Trump's party now, for better or worse.Although having never before held public office, the businessman and former reality TV star vanquished 16 other Republican candidates to win the nomination and go on to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, but established Republicans challenged his commitment to party tenets and organized against him.Trump's political ascent encountered fierce opposition from some in the party's establishment wing that includes former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich and from others in its social-conservative faction, such as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. All of them criticized Trump at times for straying from orthodox Republican positions on such issues as trade, his temperament or his lack of governing experience.But on Wednesday, all of that seemed forgotten and forgiven, at least for the moment, as Trump, the surprise winner in a 17-month-long election campaign, prepared to take power with the backing of Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress and the promise of an aggressive conservative agenda. ""The American people have spoken and it's time to come together,"" Kasich tweeted on Wednesday after he scrapped plans for a speech in Washington later this week that was intended to pave a new direction for the party after an expected Trump loss. Bush said he would ""pray"" for Trump. Cruz termed Trump's win ""an amazing victory for the American worker.""Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives who had drawn the ire of Trump supporters by refusing to campaign for him, praised Trump on Wednesday and said that voters had delivered Trump a ""mandate"" to pursue his agenda, having won the electoral vote that counts while Clinton likely won the popular vote. Had Trump lost, both Ryan and Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, were expected to face challenges to their jobs. Now, having protected his House majority, Ryan will be Trump's top legislative ally. If, as many expect, Priebus is tapped by Trump to join his administration, Trump will be able to replace him with a hand-picked successor, thus cementing his grip on the party's apparatus. 
Republican donors who did not support Trump, too, were coming around. ""Nothing unifies like these decisive wins, and nothing unifies like the power of having the House, the Senate and the White House,"" said an adviser to a leading donor.'COMPLETE CONTROL' 
Representative Chris Collins, who was an early Trump supporter, said without the opposition of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, many divisions within the Republican Party would dissipate. 
""The big difference is we now have complete Republican control,"" Collins told Reuters. ""We're all on the same page give or take 10 percent, which is nuances more than anything.""Trump adopted much of the ""Better Way"" domestic policy agenda Ryan has painstakingly put together in over the last few years, notably revising his tax plan to bring it roughly in line with House Republicans' proposal after initially floating much more drastic reform.Trump this year proposed cutting the top individual income tax rate to 33 percent from its current 39.6 percent. He had initially said he would drop that rate down to 25 percent but revised his proposal after tax experts said it would balloon government deficits.While Trump has offered a bare-bones outline of his replacement plan for Obama's signature national healthcare law known as Obamacare, advisers told Reuters he would draw heavily on the House version.At a news conference on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that Congress under Trump would move quickly to repeal Obamacare.
TRADE, BENEFITS
It remains to be seen whether House Republicans view Trump's mandate as extending to other, prominent campaign promises. Trump staked much of his candidacy on opposing major trade deals, while Republicans have generally favored free trade.Trump promised repeatedly not to touch Medicare and Social Security federal retirement benefits, asserting that Clinton would slash those programs even though she had not proposed to do so. Most mainstream Republicans believe revamping Medicare and Social Security is critical to curbing federal spending.Trump vowed to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. During the campaign he met with House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling but never endorsed Hensarling's proposed bank regulation legislation and instead called for a return to the 1930s Glass-Steagall law separating commercial and investment banking. Representative Warren Davidson, a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said he thought Congress could get some early wins on areas of agreement with Trump that included replacing Obamacare and finding a way to repatriate corporate profits held overseas and using the money to pay for infrastructure repairs. Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, which lobbies for some of the biggest U.S. banks, said Republicans must act swiftly to show that as change agents they can actually govern.""They have to show the American people that Republicans are able and capable of governing. Obviously there was a clear mandate last night that says Washington is not working and people want Washington to work,"" he said. ""Part of me says you need to have a clean slate, okay, that was the campaign, now this is governing.""

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to shake up Washington and as president the brash real estate mogul will be in a position to dramatically change how the United States handles immigration, trade and a range of other policies.Yet many of his more ambitious proposals will require cooperation from Congress. While he will likely enjoy a post-election honeymoon with congressional Republicans, a long-lasting romance is far from guaranteed, given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with Republican orthodoxy.Following is an overview of Trump's top domestic policy plans, based on the sometimes vague details of his agenda, and their likelihood of success:TRADE
In his campaign, Trump argued that international trade agreements had hurt U.S. workers and the country's competitiveness. He has promised to ""get tough"" on China, withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which is still not finalized, and renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada. As president, Trump does have some power to raise tariffs on countries such as China. He could delay the TPP, as well, even if Congress approves it.Economists have warned that such moves would damage the economy by forcing consumers to pay dramatically higher prices on everything from refrigerators to T-shirts. U.S. exports, such as airplanes and soybeans, would likely suffer as well.     IMMIGRATION
On the campaign trail, Trump has promised to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been ""compromised by terrorism."" Those policies would not come cheap. Trump has estimated the wall would cost $8 billion to $12 billion. Other estimates have run much higher.Politico estimated it would cost at least $166 billion to deport all of those in the country illegally and complete a border wall. While many congressional Republicans support those policies, they might blanch at the cost.Trump has said he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but he has no power to force another country to spend money on something it does not want. More broadly, Trump could shift the broader debate over immigration, empowering skeptics like Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who want to reduce overall immigration levels and reduce the number of skilled guest workers. That would be a blow to business groups and Hispanic advocates who have sought to relax immigration laws.HEALTHCARE

Trump has promised to repeal President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the Medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally.He would need Congress to act, and Republicans could have difficulty getting the 60 votes needed to advance a repeal effort through the 100-seat Senate.Republicans could face a public backlash if they repeal a law that has provided healthcare to millions of Americans.A Trump administration would have plenty of other opportunities to undermine Obamacare, however, by appointing officials who are not committed to its success.TAXES AND SPENDING
Trump has vowed to make deep tax cuts, while also promising to protect popular health and retirement programs that account for more than a third of U.S. government spending.That combination of policies would massively increase the national debt, according to the nonpartisan Center for a Responsible Budget.
He has also proposed increasing spending on the military and infrastructure, but has said he would reduce spending on categories other than health and retirement by 1 percent each year.On taxes, he would get plenty of help from Republicans in Congress, who have been laying the groundwork for a tax-code overhaul that would lower rates and close loopholes. But they will encounter fierce resistance from homeowners, businesses and other interest groups that benefit from current tax breaks.Trump's promise to protect entitlement programs will rile fiscal conservatives, who worry they will swamp the federal budget in the decades to come. But those programs are popular with the American public.WALL STREET REGULATION
Trump has promised a ""dismantling"" of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details.The Republican Party's platform calls for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said in July that his campaign backed that change.Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall.
ISLAMIC STATE
Trump has offered few details about his plans to fight Islamic State but has said he would ""knock the hell out of"" the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of his strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump has said if he wins, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after he takes office on Jan. 20 to propose their own plans.Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create ""safe zones"" there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states.Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.RUSSIA
Trump has said he would have a ""very, very good"" relationship with Russia. Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab.Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense.NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that country's behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism.SUPREME COURT
With one vacancy on the Supreme Court and several more likely in the coming four years, Trump will have a chance to put a conservative stamp on the nation's courts for decades to come.His list of potential nominees has won praise from conservative activists and Republicans in the Senate, who will be eager to help him in that area.

By Chris Kahn
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump fared better with parts of U.S. society than expected, and Democrat Hillary Clinton did worse, to produce a U.S. presidential election outcome that defied opinion polls forecasting a Clinton victory.Early readings from a Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day opinion poll help explain how the New York real estate magnate eked out his advantage in Tuesday's vote.

The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included more than 45,000 people who voted in the presidential election. The poll reading was taken after most - but not all - voters were counted in the presidential election. It will be updated as more poll responses are tallied and more votes are counted across the country.

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's successful campaign for the presidency may have rewritten the political playbook. Here are key moments from his ascent.2015
* June 16 - Trump descends an escalator in the marble-lined atrium of Trump Tower in Manhattan to announce his campaign and perhaps his best-known campaign pledge: to build a ""great, great wall"" on the southern border with Mexico.* July - Although his bid is initially dismissed as a sideshow by many commentators and journalists, opinion polls start showing Trump taking a lead in a crowded field of 17 Republican contenders.* Dec. 7 - Trump calls for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representative can figure out what is going on."" The call followed deadly attacks in Paris, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility.2016
* Feb. 1 - Despite being ahead in the polls, Trump comes in second in the Iowa caucuses, the first state nominating contest, losing to Ted Cruz, a senator from Texas popular among evangelical Christians.* March 1 - Trump wins seven of the 11 states that vote on so-called Super Tuesday.
* March 3 - Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in 2012, delivers a scathing speech calling Trump a ""con man,"" becoming an early mover in a wave of party leaders, including its living former presidents, who publicly reject Trump.* March 11 - Trump continues to draw huge crowds to sometimes volatile rallies, where protesters and Trump supporters would sometimes come to blows, but a rally in Chicago had to be canceled at the last minute amid sometimes violent protests outside the venue. * May 3 - Trump wins Indiana, becoming the party's presumptive nominee after Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich withdraw from the race.
* May 26 - Trump wins a majority of delegates, securing his nomination and foreclosing the possibility of a contested convention.* June 20 - Trump fires his original campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort takes over the running of the campaign.* July 15 - Trump announces Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate. A far more traditional Republican figure, Pence often describes himself as ""a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order."" * July 21 - Trump accepts the Republican Party's nomination on the final day of the party's convention in Cleveland.
* Aug. 17 - Trump taps Stephen Bannon, the chairman of the right-wing news website Breitbart News, as his campaign's chief executive and promotes senior adviser Kellyanne Conway to the post of campaign manager. Days later, Manafort, who was facing controversy over his previous consulting work in Ukraine, quits the campaign.* Sept. 1 - Trump flies to Mexico to meet with the country's president, Enrique Pena Nieto, culminating in a joint news conference. A brief diplomatic scuffle follows Trump's return, where he and the Mexican president dispute whether or not they discussed Trump's plan to have Mexico pay for the border wall.* September/October - Trump clashes with Clinton before an audience of tens of millions in three presidential debates that are marked by their unusually ugly tone - Trump at one point said Clinton should be in jail. Public polls show that most Americans thought Clinton prevailed in all three debates.* Oct. 7 - A recording surfaces of Trump boasting in 2005 of how his celebrity allows him to grope women and ""grab them by the pussy,"" prompting a dozen or so women to come forward to accuse Trump of making unwanted sexual advances. Trump dismisses the remarks as ""locker room talk"" and denies the accusations of unwanted advances. * Nov. 8 - Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in one of the biggest upsets in decades.

By Scott Malone and David Ingram
| BOSTON/NEW YORK

BOSTON/NEW YORK Americans in liberal enclaves from New York to San Francisco reacted with shock and despair on Wednesday to Republican businessman Donald Trump's defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, with many struggling to explain the result to their children.Trump, who had never before run for public office, won on a broad wave of support both from the Republican U.S. heartland and by flipping previously Democratic states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, helping his party protect majorities in both chambers of Congress.The victory stunned residents of major cities up and down the East and West coasts, many of whom had trusted opinion polls that had long predicted a Clinton victory but were proven profoundly wrong by Tuesday's results.""I'm feeling physical pain. I'm shocked. I'm sad,"" said Sofia Huizar, 30, as she waited outside the Manhattan hotel where Clinton conceded her loss on Wednesday morning, some eight hours after Trump declared victory.Huizar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, said she spent much of Tuesday night commiserating with family across the border. ""It's a way to help process the fear,"" Huizar said.Trump's campaign promises have included building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal crossings and to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.Others, like Kim Priban, a 38-year-old nurse who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Boston Heights, Ohio, said they had a difficult time breaking the news to their children. Priban said she had proudly taken her 5-year-old daughter along to vote for Clinton, who would have been the first woman U.S. president, and on Wednesday morning had to discuss the result with her.""I still haven't quite figured out what to tell my daughter. I've been crying all day,"" Priban said. ""I feel like I have to go out and make my voice heard for women and children.""
Priban and Huizar are likely far from alone in the depth of their pain over Clinton's loss, academic research suggests.A 2015 paper by researchers at Harvard University found that voters who supported Republican Mitt Romney's unsuccessful White House bid reported sharper spikes in their unhappiness than parents following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren or Boston residents after the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.'DISRUPTER, FOR BETTER OR WORSE'
While many Democrats along the coasts mourned Clinton's defeat, Trump supporters celebrated the outcome, saying they hoped he would shake up a dysfunctional political system.
""The overwhelming majority of Americans want change, and this is a direct result. ... Trump is the disrupter, for better or for worse,"" said Kelley Smith, 33, who lives in Chicago and works in software sales. ""He's a little bombastic. I don't think he's polished. But I don't think he's going to purposefully take our country down.""The divide between the coasts and the heartland, evident not only in the results but also in the social media battles ahead of the election, made the Trump victory more shocking for liberals.Deena Pioli, an attorney from San Francisco, said she had rarely run into people who were not supporting Clinton, and that she now regrets that.""Those of us here in San Francisco and California should not be so safe in our bubble,"" she said.  
Trump dropped his angry speaking style to take a conciliatory tone when he declared victory early Wednesday morning, saying, ""I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.""Clinton and Democratic President Barack Obama sounded similarly restrained. But the breadth of Trump's win left his opponents urging self-examination.""Folks should have deep humility in this moment,"" said civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson on Twitter. ""We all have things to learn from how Trump happened.""Karen Parnett, a 48-year-old mother of three in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she had been heartbroken to tell her children about Trump's win, and said the result illustrated the growing anger of lower-income voters who believe their concerns are being ignored by Washington.""I have too much at stake with three kids to just throw up my hands and weep and say that all is lost,"" Parnett said. ""There are new realities and we need as a country to reckon with what in the world we are going to do about the disenfranchisement of the white working poor.""(This story has been refiled to fix typo in ninth paragraph) (Additional reporting by Colleen Jenkins in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Dan Levine, Deborah M.

By Matt Spetalnick and Arshad Mohammed
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Some Republican foreign policy veterans who came out against Donald Trump during the presidential campaign said on Wednesday they were sticking to their guns following his election victory, but a few others signaled that objections to serving in his new administration were softening.Trump's stunning upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton has created a new dilemma for the Republican national security establishment, much of which had publicly distanced itself from their own party's candidate, declaring him unfit to lead. They must now decide whether to return to the fold.Some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are also facing a choice of whether to quit their posts because of concern that a Trump presidency would violate their principles, or else stay and try to influence policy from the inside. However, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, ""I wouldn't expect a mass exodus.""About 150 of the Republican party's most prominent national security specialists signed open letters in March and August in outright opposition to Trump's candidacy. One said he was ""utterly"" unqualified for the White House. The other warned that he would be ""the most reckless president in American history.""While neither letter said the former officials would never work for Trump, their scathing critique was clearly intended to discourage fellow Republicans from supporting him. Trump responded at the time by deriding them as members of ""the failed Washington elite"" who ""deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.""A number of the signatories contacted by Reuters on Wednesday made clear that they were unswayed from their negative view of Trump and would not work for him.However, they stopped short of urging others to also shun the next administration, which is widely seen as having limited foreign policy expertise at a time when the next president will face the challenges of Syria's civil war, the fight against Islamic State, a newly assertive Russia and the rise of China.""I don't expect to be asked. I wouldn't serve. But there are others who will. It will be a matter of individual conscience,"" said Eliot Cohen, who served as counselor to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and helped spearhead the March letter, which was posted on a blog called War on the Rocks and created a stir among Republicans.""I'm concerned about his ignorance, the belligerence, the misunderstanding of how the world works,"" Cohen said of Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV host who rode to victory on a wave of voter anger toward Washington insiders.
Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and a supporter of the U.S.-led Iraq invasion in 2003, said: ""I won't have anything to do with Trump, but I don't know about others. I hope good people go into the government.""WAITING AND WATCHING
But others appeared to waver, with some saying decisions on whether to join the Trump administration could depend on how the president-elect behaves during the transition and who he appoints to senior posts.
Among the Trump allies said to be in consideration are former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and one-time United Nations ambassador John Bolton for secretary of state, and General Michael Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for national security adviser.Dov Zakheim, a former Pentagon undersecretary who signed one of the dissent letters, said Trump would have to reach out beyond his circle of supporters to find enough qualified people to fill many important jobs.""He will want to show that he is not dividing the Republican party, so he will extend an olive branch to those in the party who opposed him,"" Zakheim said. Asked whether he expected to be offered a post, he said: ""I have no idea, as it's not up to me.""Bryan McGrath, a retired US Navy officer and co-organizer of the War on the Rocks letter, said he did not expect that those who signed it ""were signing away employment rights, that they weren't going to work in a Trump administration.""If the president asks for your service, he said, ""you have to take that request seriously.""
Patrick Cronin, an Asia expert and former third-ranking official at USAID under President George W. Bush, said that despite his earlier opposition to Trump, he eventually briefed his transition team and would continue to provide advice. But he said he was not interested in joining the administration.Michael McFaul, President Barack Obama's former ambassador to Moscow and a Clinton supporter in the election,  said the Republicans had a ""deep bench of experience"" for enlisting foreign policy experts.Even as Trump prepares to form his foreign policy team, some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are facing a post-election quandary.Some said privately before Tuesday's vote they would consider retiring or quitting rather than working under Trump, who alarmed them during the campaign by questioning U.S.-led alliances, praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting that Japan and South Korea should be allowed to have nuclear weapons and threatening to order the resumption of interrogation methods condemned as torture.Other officials suggested they would wait to see how he acts once in office and who he names to senior posts, saying the responsibility for government service transcended any one president.""If he keeps some of his campaign promises, about the use of torture, for example, many of us have discussed whether we are honor-bound to resign or to stay and try to have some influence from the inside. It's too early to say,"" one CIA officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

By Julia Harte
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said on Wednesday that human rights were respected during Tuesday's U.S. presidential election and there were few cases of intimidation, despite recent changes to election rules in several states that created unnecessary burdens for voters. ""Some legal and administrative decisions appear to have had a partisan flavor,"" Ambassador Audrey Glover, head of the OSCE election observation mission to the United States, said at a news conference on Wednesday. ""These recent changes ... led to a lack of clarity regarding the rules.""Tuesday's astonishing contest, in which Republican candidate Donald Trump beat his long-favored opponent, Hillary Clinton, to become the 45th president of the United States, was the first election to occur in the United States in more than 50 years without the full protections of the landmark Voting Rights Act.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a provision of the law that had allowed federal oversight of states with a history of racial discrimination, prompting the U.S. federal government to reduce its own election monitoring program. The OSCE deployed nearly 300 observers to polling stations in 33 states, although they were not allowed to freely observe early voting and Election Day in 19 of those states, according to the international rights group.
At almost half of the polling sites observed by the OSCE delegation, some citizens who wanted to vote were not found on the voter list, causing ""systemic concern regarding the effectiveness of voter registration methods,"" according to the group.Despite concerns that voters would be intimidated at the polls, the OSCE said, its observers did not see any serious incidents. However, U.S. civil rights groups logged unusual levels of voter intimidation complaints, receiving about 35,000 calls through a national voter complaint hotline as of Tuesday evening.   
Revised voting laws and lengthy court battles in many states also left voters uncertain about when and where they could cast their ballot and whether they would need to present photo identification.  (Reporting by Julia Harte; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"
