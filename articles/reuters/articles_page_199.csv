| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to pass a $602 billion defense authorization bill, despite President Barack Obama's threat to veto the annual policy measure over issues including a ban on closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison.The vote was 85-13, far more than the majority needed to pass the 100-member Senate. Six Republicans and seven members of the Democratic caucus voted against the bill, which authorizes military spending for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.Obama gave a long list of objections to the versions of the bill passed by the Senate and House of Representatives, including provisions making it more difficult to close the detention center at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba and the use of funds specially designated for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to allow the military to avoid mandatory spending limits.The Senate's version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, now must be reconciled with the one passed by the House last month before it can be sent to Obama. The House bill also faces a veto threat.If the bill is finished before November, when every member of the House and one-third of the Senate is up for re-election, a veto could prove challenging for Democrats.Obama's party is trying to keep the White House, and hopes to regain the Senate majority it lost in 2014, if not control of the House. But Democrats perpetually battle accusations from Republicans that they are soft on defense, a fight that could be more difficult if they block the major Pentagon policy bill.
'DEATH SENTENCE'
Republican Senator John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said he was disappointed the bill did not include a program that would help Afghans who are in danger because they worked for American troops to move to the United States.
""They are the number one target for the Taliban and for ISIS (Islamic State),"" McCain said in the Senate after the bill passed without an amendment extending the program to provide Special Immigrant Visas for interpreters and others who worked for U.S. forces.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who had introduced the amendment, called its omission ""unconscionable."" In a statement, she said, ""For many of them, this could be a death sentence.""The bill would also require young women to register for the military draft, as the Department of Defense opens all of the military, including combat roles, to females. A few conservative senators voted against the measure because of that provision.
The bill passed with a compromise on the use of Russian RD-180 rocket engines. Lawmakers eased a ban on their use late last year, worried that it could drive United Launch alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, out of business and leave only privately held SpaceX to transport satellites into space.An amendment from Republican Senator Cory Gardner and Democrat Bill Nelson gives the Pentagon time to develop and test a replacement for the Russian-made engines and limits their use for launches.McCain, a harsh critic of Moscow, had tried to stop the use of the RD-180 to send a message to Russia's President Vladimir Putin. The bill also bars military base closures, despite military leaders saying they have more capacity than they need. Closing bases is a thorny issue for many lawmakers, especially in an election year.

By Dustin Volz and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hackers believed to be working for the Russian government broke into the Democratic National Committee's computer network, spied on internal communications and accessed research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the committee and security experts said on Tuesday.Two separate groups entered the DNC's system, and one read email and chat communications for nearly a year before being detected, according to the committee and CrowdStrike, the cyber firm that helped clean up the breach.Russian spies also targeted the networks of Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as the computers of some Republican political action committees, the Washington Post quoted U.S. officials as saying, although details were not available.A Clinton campaign official said there was no evidence the campaign's information systems had been hacked.A Russian government spokesman denied involvement in the breach.""I completely rule out a possibility that the (Russian) government or the government bodies have been involved in this,"" Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, told Reuters in Moscow.The intrusion is emblematic of the sophistication of Russian hackers, who intelligence officials have long viewed as the most talented of U.S. adversaries in cyberspace.The Democratic Party had been aware of efforts to hack Trump material for two months, and U.S. intelligence agencies were involved in efforts to find out who was behind the hacking, a source familiar with Trump opposition research said.The source said Democratic Party operatives believed the hacking was conducted by the Russian government. The research includes material on Trump's business efforts in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Serbia and Russia, according to information made available to Reuters.        
Cyber attacks against political candidates and organizations are common worldwide. U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said last month he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the Nov. 8 presidential election nears.U.S. Representative Jim Langevin, a Democrat and co-founder of the congressional cybersecurity caucus, said it was ""disconcerting"" that independent groups penetrated the DNC and that one was able ""to stay embedded for nearly a year.""But the groups are extremely sophisticated, Langevin said, and have previously been implicated on attacks at the White House, the State Department and the German Bundestag, as well as a number of private companies.RUSSIAN BEARS ON THE LOOSE    

The DNC contacted CrowdStrike in May and within 24 hours it began investigating unusual activity on the group's network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer. It identified two hacking groups and both were kicked out this weekend, he said.The first, which CrowdStrike named Cozy Bear, entered the DNC's systems last summer, according to the firm. It primarily monitored email and chat conversations and may be working for Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, Alperovitch said. Russian President Vladimir Putin once ran the FSB.The second group, nicknamed Fancy Bear, is probably working on behalf of Russia's military, Alperovitch said. It gained entry in late April and ""went straight to the oppo research ... on Donald Trump and exfiltrated some of it,"" he said.
Alperovitch said both groups were among ""the best threat actors that we've ever encountered"" but they did not appear to be working together. He was not sure how the intrusions occurred but suspected the hackers may have leveraged ""spearphishing"" emails to trick DNC employees into downloading malicious code onto their network.""When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is,"" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the DNC, said in a statement. ""Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.""Trump's interest in Russia goes back to the 1980s, with a 1990 Vanity Fair article citing news program appearances in which Trump offered his own services as a negotiator with Russia. Information made available to Reuters indicates Trump tried on at least three occasions - in 2004, 2008 and 2013 - to get involved in business deals in Russia.In 2013, he and an Azerbaijani-Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, jointly put on a Miss Universe competition in Moscow, and Trump was photographed with Agalarov's wife, son and daughter.The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama's campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes.U.S. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to Chinese hackers.

By Jonathan Stempel

A federal judge refused to dismiss a criminal indictment against two former allies of New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie over their alleged roles in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal, known as Bridgegate.In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton, in Newark, New Jersey, rejected arguments by William Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly that the laws under which they were charged were too vague and that they had no reason to know some of their activities might have been illegal.Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, and Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were charged with wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy for allegedly arranging the September 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey.The closure led to several days of gridlock affecting the bridge, the world's busiest, which spans the Hudson River to connect New Jersey to Manhattan. Prosecutors said it was intended to punish Fort Lee's Democratic mayor for not endorsing Christie's successful reelection bid.In her 23-page decision, Wigenton said reasonable public officials would understand that wrongdoing attributed to the defendants would violate drivers' right to travel.
""Political payback is not a significant government interest,"" she wrote.Wigenton also said it was for jurors to decide whether to hold the defendants criminally responsible for their alleged dealings with former Port Authority executive David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and is cooperating with prosecutors.Michael Baldassare and Michael Critchley, lawyers who represent Baroni and Kelly respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A trial is scheduled for Sept. 12, court records show.Christie has not been charged and has denied involvement in wrongdoing, but the scandal hurt his popularity within New Jersey and weighed on his unsuccessful 2016 presidential run. 
Both defendants are also seeking records from Christie's cellphone through subpoenas to a law firm that previously generated a taxpayer-funded report absolving the governor of wrongdoing. Critics of Christie have called that report biased.Separately, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia is weighing requests by media to publicly release a list of unindicted co-conspirators. Oral arguments were heard on June 6.The case is U.S. v. Baroni et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 15-cr-00193.

By Lesley Wroughton
| SANTO DOMINGO

SANTO DOMINGO U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced high-level talks to ease tensions with Venezuela's socialist government on Tuesday, just hours after he backed calls for a referendum that could force President Nicolas Maduro from office.  Kerry said the talks would start immediately in Caracas and be led by Thomas Shannon, a veteran of U.S. diplomacy in the region. Attempts last year at dialogue between the ideological foes were stalled by Venezuela's deepening crisis.The two countries have been embroiled in diplomatic hostilities since the administrations of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and U.S. President George W. Bush. Kerry said the goal was to go beyond ""the old rhetoric.""""I've committed to see if this can work so let's see if we can improve the relationship,"" he told reporters, after huddling with his Venezuelan counterpart on the sidelines of an Organization of American States (OAS) meeting in the Dominican Republic.The talks would also be aimed at fostering dialogue between Venezuela's government and opposition, Kerry said.Maduro welcomed the proposed talks and repeated his suggestion that the two sides restore ambassadors in each other's capitals after an eight-year hiatus that began when Chavez expelled the U.S. envoy to Venezuela.""I propose to John Kerry 'let's designate ambassadors', I am ready. They have ambassadors in Beijing, Vietnam and Havana, and they don't have one in Caracas,"" he said in a speech to teachers.Maduro proposed an ambassador in 2014 but U.S. President Barack Obama has not yet accepted his credentials.
FIREWORKS AT ASSEMBLY
Once one of Latin America's most prosperous nations, Venezuela has plunged into unrest and a harsh economic slowdown. Long lines for food and medicines have led to protests and opposition calls for a recall referendum to remove Maduro.    That measure is allowed under the constitution, a point made by Kerry to reporters after he met Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez. Earlier in the day, in a speech to OAS delegates, Kerry gave his backing to the referendum push and called on Chavez's political heirs to release political prisoners and respect fundamental rights.     His comments to the 34 members of the main diplomatic body of the Americas marked the strongest show of support yet from the United States for the disputed referendum process.
Venezuela's opposition accuses the election council of stalling the recall at the behest of Maduro by arbitrarily changing criteria for requesting a recall vote. Maduro has said any recall against him would be in 2017 at the earliest, pushing back against opposition pressure.Several opposition politicians are in jail, notably hardline leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has a 14-year sentence for inciting 2014 anti-government protests that spiraled into violence killing more than 40 people. The government denies it holds political prisoners.Kerry's comments drew a furious response from Rodriguez, who accused Washington and OAS chief Luis Almagro of ""international bullying.""  ""Every day we have evidence of the secretary general's bias in favor of sectors of the opposition who are seeking a coup in Venezuela,"" she said. 
""I see now this is ordered by Washington. I know they are on Washington's payroll to meddle in the domestic affairs of Venezuela,"" she said, speaking through a translator. Kerry was more conciliatory after his first ever bilateral meeting with Rodriguez, saying the United States did not support a push by Almagro to suspend Venezuela from the OAS for alleged violations of the regional group's ""democratic charter.""""The United States is not taking that position, we are not pushing for a suspension. I don't think that would be constructive,"" he said.At Almagro's behest, the OAS will hold a meeting later this month to initiate the process that could end in Venezuela's suspension. But the former Uruguayan foreign minister appears isolated in the group, with even right-wing governments opposed to Maduro in the region balking at throwing Venezuela out.Venezuela and the United States have repeatedly gone through periods of diplomatic fighting followed by generally short-lived eras of reconciliation. Following Washington's 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, Shannon met with a top Venezuelan Socialist Party official to improve ties with Caracas. The good mood soured within months when the United States criticized the sentence handed to opposition leader Lopez.

By Diane Bartz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Four U.S. senators - two Democrats and two Republicans - introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at preventing big pharmaceutical companies from using safety rules to prevent generic drugs from coming to market.Senators Charles Grassley, chair of the Judiciary Committee, and Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat, are sponsors of the bill along with Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chair of the antitrust subcommittee and top Democrat, respectively.The Food and Drug Administration, which ensures the safety of the country's food and drug supply, has a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, called REMS, which is designed to ensure that the riskiest drugs are dispensed safely.But there have been complaints that the program has been misused by brand-name drug companies to prevent generic manufacturers from getting the drug samples needed to market cheaper versions. Generic companies also complain their drugs are not allowed to share a safety protocol, making it difficult to come to market.The bill would allow a generic manufacturer who faces either of these situations to file a lawsuit to force access to a sample or force negotiations for a safety protocol.
""Balancing the cost of developing lifesaving medications with the need to make available affordable prescription drugs to consumers has always been a difficult task. It's a consistent topic at my town meetings,"" Grassley said in a statement.""Unfortunately, we're seeing some brand-name drug companies engage in anti-competitive tactics that delay entry of lower cost generic drugs into the market. This bill takes important steps to ensure that our laws are not frustrated.""There is a similar bill in the House of Representatives which addresses the same issue but uses a different strategy. For example, it requires the generic company seeking a REMS drug to get FDA authorization to obtain the sample.
In one of the REMS disputes which is public, Mylan Pharmaceuticals filed a lawsuit in 2014 against Celgene Corp, accusing it of using REMS to prevent generic copies of Thalomid and Revlimid to market.The Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel will hold a hearing on its bill on June 21.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, which counts major drugmakers among its members, said it had no immediate comment.The Generic Pharmaceutical Association was pleased to see the bill introduced.""It is worth noting and recognizing recent efforts by representatives in the branded industry to highlight the valuable role generic medicines play in driving healthcare system savings,"" said Chip Davis, GPhA's president. ""Continued use of these anticompetitive practices by certain manufacturers drives the exact opposite outcome."" (Reporting by Diane Bartz, editing by G Crosse)"

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Hillary Clinton's lead over Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race has narrowed since late last week, according to the results of the first Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted since the Orlando shooting rampage on Sunday.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has blamed Democratic policies for the worst mass shooting in U.S. history and doubled-down on his pledge to ban Muslim immigration, while Clinton has warned against demonizing Muslim-Americans.The poll, conducted from Friday to Tuesday, showed Clinton with an 11.6-point lead - 44.6 percent to 33.0 percent - over Trump, down from the 13-point lead she had in the five days that ended Saturday.The Florida attack, in which a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and wounded 53 could have a lingering impact on the presidential race, mixing concerns about immigration, gun violence and religious tolerance into what has already been a volatile and sharply negative campaign. The shooter, Omar Mateen, 29, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrant parents, called authorities during the massacre to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State militant group.Federal investigators have said Mateen, who was killed by police, was likely self-radicalized and there was no evidence he received any instruction or aid from outside groups such as Islamic State. 
Trump seized on the attack to accuse Democratic President Barack Obama of failing to address ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" to warn that Clinton's policies on immigration would allow more potential attackers into the country, and to fine-tune his call for a suspension of Muslim immigration.In a speech on Monday, Trump said he would suspend immigration from countries with a ""proven history of terrorism"" against the United States, Europe and allied countries ""until we fully understand how to end these threats.""Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee,  said Trump's response to the attack was disturbing.""Prejudice, paranoia and partisanship are not a plan, and will not protect anyone,"" Clinton said in a statement.    
She re-emphasized her support for coordinated military action in Syria and Iraq and called for tougher controls on firearms sales.Clinton's slip in the polling was not all Trump's gain. The proportion of voters who said they would not vote for either candidate has risen steadily over the past week. About 22.4 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate, according to the five-day average of results on Tuesday. That was up from 20.6 percent a week ago.
Trump's strident tone on Muslims and national security appears to have helped him in the past, at least with Republicans. He surged in opinion polls among Republicans late last year after attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.According to Reuters/Ipsos polls over the past several months, a majority of Republican voters said he was their party's best choice to deal with terrorism and trusted him more than his Republican rivals to be commander in chief.Most Republicans also support Trump's proposed ban on Muslim immigration, while a majority of Americans oppose it.The online poll included 1,063 likely voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 3.5 percentage points.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to protect the identities of wealthy individuals and others who make anonymous, or ""dark money,"" donations to politically active nonprofit groups.The measure, which drew lobbying support from billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, was approved in a 240-180 vote along party lines. It would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from collecting the names and addresses of donors who contribute $5,000 or more to 501(c) organizations, a name that refers to the tax code section that covers them. The action sent the bill on to the Senate.Although the measure would apply to all 501(c) tax-exempt groups, such as universities, hospitals and charities, politically active nonprofits are the intended beneficiaries.Republicans said the legislation would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from targeting conservative groups following 2013 revelations that Tea Party organizations were subjected to extra scrutiny.Political spending by nonprofit groups including the Koch- aligned Americans for Prosperity has grown dramatically since 2010, when the Supreme Court opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups in its landmark Citizens United ruling. 
The White House on Monday said it opposed the bill, the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, claiming it would constrain the IRS from enforcing tax laws and reduce transparency among private foundations.Democrats argued that the legislation could make it easier for foreign entities to finance political campaigns inside the United States. Charity regulators have also warned that the loss of donor information would make it harder to protect the public against charity fraud. The change would reduce available information on a range of organizations, IRS data shows.
Republicans said the bill is necessary to protect donors from potential leaks that could subject them to harassment. Donor identities are not supposed to be released to the public, hence the term ""dark money."" But leaks have occurred, including the 2012 release of donors to the conservative National Organization for Marriage that resulted in a settlement requiring the IRS to pay the organization $50,000.
Supporters of the legislation also pointed to signs that the IRS may seek to end the disclosure requirement on its own.    Nonprofit groups could spend more than $500 million on this year's presidential and congressional elections, up from $10 million in 2008, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.House Republicans are also pushing to censure and impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for allegedly failing to cooperate with a probe of the IRS scandal.

By Tom Polansek
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO The chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday urged federal antitrust officials to conduct a ""careful analysis"" of Dow Chemical Co's proposed $130 billion merger with DuPont, adding pressure on officials to scrutinize how rapid consolidation in agriculture will affect farmers and consumers.U.S. Senator Charles Grassley called for the review in a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division. The Iowa Republican said he was concerned the planned tie-up will decrease competition in the farming sector following a flood of mergers and acquisitions in recent years.He also said he was worried the deal could raise barriers to entry for smaller companies, hurt innovation and raise prices for products.Grassley's request for a federal review increases attention on risks of consolidation as more large agribusiness deals are in the offing. Bayer AG is pursuing a $62 billion acquisition of Monsanto Co, the world's top seed maker, while Chinese state-owned China National Chemical Corp [CNNCC.UL], or ChemChina, plans to buy Swiss crop chemicals company Syngenta AG for $43 billion.A global downturn in grain prices and a strong dollar have reduced U.S. farm income and prompted farmers to cut spending. That has eaten into sales of the big six agrochemical and seed companies that are now looking to bolster profits through mergers and partnerships.
Dow expects the regulatory review of its proposed merger with DuPont ""will be a thorough process,"" a company spokeswoman said. The deal is ""pro-competitive and good for farmers and consumers,"" she said.Dow has previously said it expects the deal to close in the second half of 2016.
DuPont had no immediate comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.In March, Grassley, who also serves on the agriculture committee, joined other senators asking for the U.S. government panel that reviews foreign acquisitions to assess the impact of ChemChina's planned acquisition of Syngenta on domestic food security .The U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to join the review panel, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, a move that subjects the deal to additional government scrutiny.
Last month, Monsanto turned down Bayer's acquisition attempt as ""incomplete and financially inadequate"" but said it was open to further negotiations.Monsanto said the initial offer did not adequately address potential ""regulatory execution risks related to the acquisition.""

Detroit would sell its first general obligation bonds since exiting bankruptcy in December 2014 under a proposal by Mayor Mike Duggan's administration to refund up to $660 million of outstanding bonds.The city council on Tuesday sent the plan to refund up to $275 million of unlimited tax GO bonds sold in 2014 and up to $385 million of limited tax GO bonds sold in 2010 and 2012 to its Budget, Finance and Audit Committee for consideration. The outstanding bonds were issued through the Michigan Finance Authority and backed by the city's share of distributable state aid payments.John Naglick, Detroit's finance director, said Detroit expects to capture lower interest rates in the bond refundings to save money for the budget and to lower property tax rates supporting the bonds. 
""If it wasn't for this move to record low rates, we wouldn't do this,"" he said.Ten and 30-year yields on Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A scale are at or near all-time lows, driven by big investor demand for debt sold by states, cities, schools and other municipal issuers.
Detroit was able to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations in the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy. In its first post-bankruptcy public debt offering last August, the city restructured $245 million of variable-rate revenue bonds backed by city income taxes into a fixed-rate mode at a hefty spread over MMD's scale.
If the GO bond refundings are approved by the city council committee on Wednesday, the measures would head for a full-council vote on June 21. Naglick said the issuance also needs approval from the Detroit Financial Review Commission, the city's post-bankruptcy oversight board, which meets on June 27.
