By Andrew Osborn
| MOSCOW

MOSCOW The Kremlin said on Thursday U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policy approach was ""phenomenally close"" to that of President Vladimir Putin, giving Russia hope that tattered U.S.-Russia relations could gradually be improved.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking in New York, said he saw incredible similarities between the two men's foreign policy ideas, and this meant there was a solid basis to start a meaningful dialogue between Moscow and Washington.         Peskov, in the United States for a chess tournament, said he was struck by how similar parts of Trump's victory speech were to a speech Putin gave in southern Russia last month. Both men said they would put their own country's national interests first, but that they would be ready to develop ties with other nations, depending on how ready other countries were to deepen relations themselves.
""They (Putin and Trump) set out the same main foreign policy principles and that is incredible,"" Peskov said in comments broadcast by Russian state TV's Channel One on Thursday evening.""It is phenomenal how close they are to one another when it comes to their conceptual approach to foreign policy. And that is probably a good basis for our moderate optimism that they will at least be able to start a dialogue to start to clear out the Augean stables in our bilateral relations."" 
With Moscow and Washington now at odds over Syria, Ukraine and NATO, Peskov cautioned that it would take a long time before relations could return to a high level, however, because of how far they had been allowed to deteriorate.""An atmosphere of mutual trust takes years to achieve,"" he said. ""It's not possible to just declare that there is an atmosphere of mutual trust, especially after such serious damage was done in the last few years to our relations.""
Peskov told the TASS news agency separately that Putin was ready to be flexible when it came to mending ties which he wanted to improve, but that there was a limit to his flexibility and that he would need to see some U.S. reciprocity.Peskov spoke after one of Russia's most senior diplomats told the Interfax news agency earlier on Thursday that the Russian government had been in touch with members of Trump's political team during the U.S. election campaign and knew most of his entourage.

By Joseph Ax
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump campaigned for president as a savvy billionaire who would apply his business acumen to improving the U.S. economy, cutting taxes for Americans and negotiating better trade deals.But his vast, complicated network of businesses under the Trump Organization, including numerous foreign investments and debts, could create unprecedented conflicts of interest when he takes the oath of office as U.S. president in January, government ethics experts said. Federal law does not prohibit the president from being involved in private business while in office, even though members of Congress and lower-ranking executive branch officials are subject to strict conflict-of-interest rules. Lyndon Johnson, for instance, quietly managed his broadcasting businesses despite insisting publicly that he had ceased all involvement, according to his biographer, Robert Caro.""There are no legal restrictions, no legal requirements,"" said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of the nonpartisan watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.But most presidents in recent decades have voluntarily placed their personal assets, including property and financial holdings, in blind trusts overseen by independent advisers to avoid any appearance of impropriety, experts said. Under a blind trust, the owner has no say or knowledge in how the assets are managed.President Barack Obama was one exception, but his investments are mostly in broad-based index funds and U.S. Treasury notes with little chance of conflicts.Trump's businesses include licensing deals, hotels and golf courses around the world. During the campaign, he filed a 104-page financial disclosure statement, as required by law, that showed he had financial interests in more than 500 entities with names like China Trademark LLC and DT Marks Qatar LLC but had few details.BLIND TRUST 
While plenty of wealthy men have been president, no one has ascended to the White House with such a complex array of assets.Trump's spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on how he planned to manage his businesses while he was in the White House.
During the campaign, Trump did say he would likely transfer day-to-day operations to his children. But experts in government ethics said that would do little to insulate Trump.""That presumably frees some time up for him to be the president, but it doesn't do anything to clear the conflicts of interest,"" said Kenneth Gross, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who has counseled high-ranking political appointees on ethics laws. ""His family's interests, his children's interests, are co-existent with his own.""The nature of Trump's businesses, Gross said, makes a blind trust all but meaningless - even if he were inclined to shift control of his empire from his family, an idea he has rejected.Gross advised Michael Bloomberg, a New York billionaire businessman, when he became mayor of New York City. Bloomberg stepped away from day-to-day operations at his data and media company, Bloomberg LP, and donated all terminals that were used by city agencies to avoid any impression of profiting from public funds.Some of the potential problems for the Republican president-elect are obvious. One of his latest ventures, a luxury hotel in Washington just blocks from the White House, leases its property from the U.S. government, putting Trump on both sides of any landlord-tenant disputes.Others are more opaque. Trump has licensing deals and diverse real estate holdings in numerous countries that could benefit from foreign government subsidies or tax breaks. Companies in which he holds an interest owe hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to foreign banks that are subject to U.S. regulations, such as Deutsche Bank and Bank of China, according to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
His properties include hotels in countries like Turkey, Uruguay, the Philippines and South Korea, and golf courses in the United Arab Emirates, Ireland and Britain.  Conflicts of interest could stem, for example, from countries trying to influence policies by doing business with any of his companies or even his children. His daughter Ivanka has a line of fashion products, which along with other Trump-branded items are made in countries like China.Trump has accused China of currency manipulation and threatened to put tariffs on its imports.GOVERNMENT REVIEW OF TRUMP INC. DEALS?
Trump's opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, faced criticism during the campaign over the Clinton Foundation, the charity founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
That was despite an ethics agreement that Hillary Clinton signed in 2009 in order to become Obama's secretary state that was designed to ensure donors could not sway U.S. foreign policy. Under the deal, the State Department was allowed to review any new contributions from foreign governments.Unlike Clinton, however, Trump is not answerable to anyone else as president. And he has already shown himself willing to blur the lines between campaigning and marketing, holding events at his own properties and touting his companies during speeches. Given the high-profile properties that bear his name, a blind trust would do little to help his case, experts said.""You can't put a golf course in a blind trust; it would be pointless,"" said Robert Kelner, a Washington lawyer and an expert on government ethics. ""The idea behind a blind trust is that it's blind - you don't know what assets are held.""The only unassailable solution, experts said, would be for Trump to sell off his businesses and place the proceeds in a blind trust.With no legal requirements, Trump's actions as president are only subject to the will of the voters or to built-in checks and balances like Congressional oversight. The potential for conflicts is exacerbated by the lack of publicly known details about Trump's holdings. Even his net worth is unclear. Trump has boasted of more than $10 billion in wealth, but financial magazines have estimated his fortune at less than half that.He has refused to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of presidential campaign tradition, and legal experts said he is under no obligation to do so as president.His dealings with foreign governments are thus largely unknown. He will likely face scrutiny of policy decisions that affect countries where he is known to have business interests, said Bookbinder.

By Jonathan Spicer
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Move over, Janet Yellen. The Federal Reserve chief has a challenger for the title of speaker most scrutinized by Wall Street, and it's Donald Trump. All new U.S. President-elects are closely monitored by the financial community for clues about what their policies mean for markets. But Trump's speaking style, often using enthymemes or incomplete sentences that leave room for interpretation, along with vague or contradictory campaign promises make him all the more challenging to decipher. ""His statements are crazy. He says peculiar things, like building the wall and getting Mexico to pay for it, that you know are just not going to happen,"" said Allan Meltzer, a Fed historian and professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburg. ""But his actions as opposed to his statements have been very moderate,"" he said.Exhibit A for how Trump has policy makers and investors hanging on his every word came shortly after the Republican's conciliatory acceptance speech early Wednesday. Bonds fell and stocks gained as investors placed tentative bets that Trump's somewhat vague platform of economic stimulus would translate into corporate profits and higher inflation.The stakes are high. With a Republican controlled House and Senate, Trump has the opportunity to use his time in office to radically reshape the American economy. He has pledged dramatic tax cuts, infrastructure spending and economic deregulation, and wants to repeal Obamacare. These measures he says will turbo-charge growth and help boost the wages of those who have lost out in a globalized world where ""middle-class"" jobs have been squeezed.With the U.S. budget deficit at just 3.2 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 9.8 percent in 2009, and near record low interest rates, Trump has room to undertake a large-scale fiscal boost, at least in the short term. His restrained acceptance speech hinted that infrastructure was a priority. Trump said he would ""rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals (and) our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none.""
On the campaign trail, Trump's speeches were full of superlatives and unfinished thoughts that only complicated matters for traders and economic policy watchers. These enthymemes are a rhetorical device at the heart of a persuasive speaking style that has helped catapult the billionaire to the White House.Trying to parse his words is one thing. Actually putting money to work quickly base on them brings far more risk than usual, according to Brian Shapiro, CEO of SPAG Funds, a small global macro hedge fund manager based in New York. ""I won't react to it, but the world will,"" he said. ""I think people will have a heart attack if they react to every word.""""TRUMP LITE""

Economic advisory firm Fathom Consulting dubbed the election outcome ""Trump Lite"": a world in which as President-elect he would be unwilling or unable to enact some of his more extreme policies such as building a wall at the Mexico border, mass deportations of immigrants and wide-ranging protectionist measures.""Markets are waiting to see if we are going to have the campaign Trump who spoke in rhetoric, or Trump the president who is going to be more pragmatic in his approach,"" said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies.Economists and fund managers, as well as the Fed's policymakers, are looking to see which issues Trump will prioritize. So far, indications are he would pursue tax cuts, additional military spending, and revamping President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare.Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, speaking to reporters as Americans voted on Tuesday, said he would try to figure out whether or not the new president's fiscal policies ""would be more simulative, about the same, or worse,"" adding the level of market volatility would provide a clue. 
Trump has no defined economic team. It is unclear whether he will follow the lead of say Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California at Irvine, whose studies suggest a tougher trade stance against China; or whether he could cleave to Wall Street allies such as former Goldman Sachs alumnus Steven Mnuchin, who has been mooted by Trump as a potential Treasury Secretary.""Trump's fiscal plan as it stands is pretty vague and it doesn't add up,"" said Paul Ashworth, Toronto-based chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""We expect some fiscal plan that will pursue the Republican agenda, but it's likely to be much smaller in scale than the one originally envisaged by Trump."" While these policy questions are expected to persist even after Trump succeeds Obama in January, ""the nature of the Trump cabinet appointments and the tone of their confirmation hearings will either ease or amplify the uncertainty premium in the markets,"" wrote Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho.  Beyond Navarro and Mnuchin, all eyes will be on whether many of the conservative economists, like Columbia University business school dean Glenn Hubbard, who abandoned Trump during a divisive campaign could ultimately return as advisors. Yet the reality-TV-host-turned-president-elect has struggled in the past to maintain the measured tone shown in his victory speech. During his campaign, for example, Trump appeared to suggest the United States could renegotiate its debts to obtain a better deal, a comment he quickly rowed back upon. His past criticisms of Yellen as someone who should be ""ashamed"" of her policy actions, and comments that she was keeping interest rates low for political reasons, could roil markets if repeated during his wait to take office in January. ""He has managed to keep it under control some of the time,"" Meltzer said. ""Whether he will be able to do that as president will very much determine whether he is successful.""

Former Los Angeles Mayor and former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa on Thursday publicly launched his campaign to become the next governor of the country's most populous state.With a new campaign website, the Democrat said his main focuses if elected would be investing in schools, repairing infrastructure around the state and shoring up an ailing middle class.He said his campaign would stand in direct contrast to that of President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican who campaigned heavily on building a wall between the United States and Mexico and deporting undocumented immigrants. Trump won the presidency in a surprise upset against Democrat Hillary Clinton earlier this week.""We are a state that builds bridges, not walls. We are inclusive. We celebrate our diversity. And we welcome newcomers,"" Villaraigosa said in a statement on his campaign website. ""We know the answer to fear is hope. The answer to division is unity.""
Villaraigosa, who was Los Angeles mayor from 2005 to 2013 and served as speaker of the California Assembly from 1998 to 2000, is perhaps the state's highest-profile Latino leader. 
Villaraigosa in June said he had formed a political action committee and started raising money to help fight Trump's presidential campaign in key states with large Latino immigrant populations.California's Democratic Lieutenant Governor and former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said in early 2015 that he would also run for the state's top political position. The two are currently the leading entrants in the race to fill the seat of the popular Governor Jerry Brown, who will be 81 when his term ends.

By Caroline Humer
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican President-elect Donald Trump vowed on the campaign trail to repeal Obamacare, but making good on that promise may be easier said than done.President Barack Obama's 2010 national healthcare reform law extended medical insurance to 25 million more people by expanding the Medicaid plan for the poor and creating subsidized coverage for individuals.Republican lawmakers, who have voted more than 50 times to repeal all or part of the law, have begun pressing Trump to deliver. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday repealing Obamacare is a ""pretty high item on our agenda"" for the new Congress.But a complete repeal of Obama's Affordable Care Act may not be immediately in the cards, as Republican lawmakers now hold 51 seats in the Senate at latest count, well short of the 60 seats required to overturn it.Instead, health policy experts said, Trump could try to dismantle key elements through a process called budget reconciliation. That would allow him to eliminate funding for the income-based subsidies that make the new insurance plans affordable, or cut the money providing expanded Medicaid benefits in 31 states.""Some of the policy experts on the Republican side would say tearing it up and starting over would be very disruptive,"" said Paul Howard, director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute.Parts of the law have been weakened through legal challenges. Several of the largest U.S. health insurers have pulled out of the exchanges for individual coverage after losing money on a sicker-than-expected group of patients. Consumers not eligible for government subsidies have seen premiums rise sharply, including a projected average increase of 25 percent for 2017.Scrapping the law altogether without a clear plan for providing replacement coverage for so many people would be politically risky, experts said. Trump also would face a tight deadline were he to try to dismantle the insurance exchanges by 2018; many state-based health insurance regulators require insurers to submit plans for the upcoming year by April or May - only a few months into a new administration.Trump also could seek changes to other provisions of the law, such as a tax on medical device makers, or the so-called ""Cadillac tax"" that is due to hit rich employer-based healthcare plans in 2020.
However, some elements could not be eliminated by depriving the law of funds. For instance, the law prevents insurers from denying coverage to people based on their health or pricing insurance based on gender. Mandatory coverage of preventive benefits also would be unaffected - short of a complete repeal.It also is not clear if Trump would try to reverse the individual mandate, which requires people to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. The goal of the requirement was to broaden the pool of policyholders to include more healthy Americans.Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on Thursday at a New York Times Dealbook conference that some elements of the law are so popular that they are likely to continue, even if there is something Trump calls ""repeal."" They include allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plans and people with health problems to buy insurance without paying more. Medicaid could continue to expand, he said, though with a different type of federal financing.SOWING CONFUSION OVER HEALTHCARE

Trump's surprise victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton rattled healthcare investors on Wednesday, depressing shares in hospital operators and some insurers.Medicaid focused health insurer Molina Healthcare Inc. fell nearly 16 percent, and hospital chain Tenet Healthcare Corp dropped 25 percent. Large insurers, who have been losing money on the exchanges, gained, with Anthem Inc. up 1.5 percent.Enrollment opened on Nov. 1 for 2017 coverage and once those plans are purchased, it would be legally difficult for Trump to cancel them before the one-year contracts run out, said Molina Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Dr. Mario Molina.""Any changes they make will have to be on a prospective basis to begin in 2018,"" Molina said.It's not clear what Trump's plan to replace Obamacare would look like. Options he raised on the campaign trail include replacing the Obamacare individual coverage with high-deductible healthcare plans, and lumping the sickest people together into high-risk pools that are insured separately.
""I think there is going to be a lot of confusion and a lot of anxious people,"" Molina said.Among the worries for some people covered under Obamacare is how long it will last.Before the law took effect, Marc Dobin, a 57-year old mediator and lawyer in Jupiter, Florida, said his insurer put a surcharge on his premium because he has heart stents. Under Obamacare, insurers are barred from charging more for pre-existing conditions.""Imagine the disaster if, part way through the year, they cancel it,"" Dobin said.For others, the cost of premiums bolstered their support for Trump.Crista Simmons, 63, a piano teacher in Kalamazoo, Michigan, spends about a third of her gross income on premiums and medical care.""There are people who pay more in premiums than their mortgage,"" she said.

He also sees some sort of subsidies for individual insurance remaining.
Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which passed in 2010 and was Obama's signature domestic policy.

By Alister Doyle
| MARRAKESH, Morocco

MARRAKESH, Morocco U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could use legal short-cuts to pull out of a global agreement for fighting climate change within a year, keeping a campaign promise and by-passing a theoretical four-year wait, lawyers say.Trump, who has called global warming a hoax and said it was invented by the Chinese to undermine U.S. manufacturing, has said he wants to cancel the 2015 Paris Agreement among almost 200 nations that entered into force on Nov. 4.The accord, which seeks to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century with a shift from fossil fuels, says in its Article 28 that any country wanting to pull out after joining up has to wait four years.In theory, the earliest date for withdrawal is Nov. 4, 2020, around the time of the next U.S. presidential election.But Trump could pull out of the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement, the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change with just a year's notice, also voiding U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement, U.N. legal experts say.That would be controversial, partly because the Convention was signed by former Republican president George Bush in 1992 and approved by the U.S. Senate. It would also severely strain relations with many foreign nations.Meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, for two weeks of talks to work out ways to implement pledges for action in the Paris Agreement, many countries have reaffirmed support for the 195-nation accord since Trump's election victory on Tuesday.
POLITICAL COSTS
""If Trump withdraws from the Paris Agreement there would be a political cost. If he pulls out of the Convention the cost would be greater,"" said Daniel Bodansky, a professor of the Arizona State University Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law.""It would be going nuclear. It would signal that the United States has no interest in cooperating with other nations on climate change,"" said Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
The Convention sets a goal of avoiding ""dangerous"" man-made damage to the climate to avert more heat waves, downpours, floods, extinctions of animals and plants and rising sea levels. The Paris Agreement is much more explicit, seeking to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.Trump wants to safeguard jobs in the U.S. coal and oil industries, saying the Paris Agreement would undermine the U.S. economy. He said in May: ""We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement.""But the accord has since entered into force in international law. As of Thursday it had been ratified by 103 nations representing 73 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.
Trump could also pull out from Paris immediately if the Republican-controlled House and Senate passed a law asking him to do so, Bodansky said. The Supreme Court had a tradition of upholding U.S. laws when they conflict with international law. ""If Trump acts with the approval of Congress there is no problem under U.S. law,"" he said. There would be little recourse to challenge such a decision under international law - the Paris Agreement has no sanctions for non-compliance.Many delegates reckon Trump is likely to have other priorities, from the economy to immigration. Trump may find it easier simply to oppose President Barack Obama's domestic plans to reduce U.S. emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.The idea of the Paris Agreement's four-year wait is that ""it sets a legal trap,"" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, head of the 48-nation group of least developed nations. ""By the time Trump gets round to thinking about it we could have another president."" (Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington; Editing by Gareth Jones)"
