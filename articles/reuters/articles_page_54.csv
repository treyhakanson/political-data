| NEW YORK

NEW YORK More Republicans now think Democrat Hillary Clinton, rather than Donald Trump, will win the presidency, as their party's candidate struggles with difficulties including allegations of sexual misconduct and his suggestion he may not honor the outcome of the election.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday and conducted from Oct. 20 to Oct. 24 found that 41 percent of Republicans expected Clinton to win the Nov. 8 election, versus 40 percent who picked Trump.That reflected a sharp decline in confidence from last month, when 58 percent of Republicans said they thought their party's nominee would win, versus 23 percent who expected Clinton to prevail. Among Trump's supporters, 49 percent in the latest poll said they believed Trump would win, down from 67 percent who felt that way at the beginning of the month.""There's still hope, I guess. I just don't have a great deal of faith in a good portion of the American public,"" said Bert Horsley, 38, of Belgrade, Montana, who said he planned to vote for Trump even though he believed Clinton would win. Horsley said he felt the country was leaning increasingly socialist and that voters were more inclined to focus on Trump's problems than on issues facing Clinton, including allegations she mishandled classified emails while secretary of state.""The nation's willing to overlook certain things in some people and not in others,"" he said.
Despite the growing pessimism, Trump, who trails Clinton in national opinion polls, still enjoys overwhelming support from members of his party. Some 79 percent of likely Republican voters said they would vote for him. Many said their support was rooted in an expectation he would promote a conservative agenda in Congress and appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court.    Democrats appear to be strongly anticipating a Clinton presidency. Some 83 percent of Democrats said in the poll they thought she would win, while only 8 percent predicted Trump would become president. Among Clinton's supporters, 92 percent expected her to win, up from 83 percent a month earlier.Clinton held a commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the presidency, according to results from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.
CONFIDENCE DROP THIS MONTH
Trump, a businessman and former reality television star, has alarmed mainstream Republicans throughout his campaign by routinely bashing the political establishment and making a series of provocative statements. He aroused criticism for belittling the parents of a U.S. soldier killed in the Iraq war, calling for a ban on admitting Muslims to the country and accusing a judge of bias because of his Hispanic heritage. He has also asserted, without showing evidence, that the U.S. electoral system is rigged.
But Republicans remained mostly confident in their candidate's chances until this month, when a videotape from 2005 was released in which Trump could be heard bragging in vulgar terms about kissing and groping women. At least 10 women have since accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, from the early 1980s to 2007, according to reports in various news outlets. Trump has denied the women's allegations, calling them ""totally and absolutely false"" and has promised to sue the women after the election.Trump has also deepened divisions within his party by refusing to promise to accept the outcome of the election. ""I will keep you in suspense,"" he said when asked about the issue  during an Oct. 19 debate with Clinton.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with American adults in all 50 states. The latest poll included 648 people who identified as Republicans and 771 people who identified as Democrats. It had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 4 percentage points.

By Steve Holland
| CHARLOTTE, N.C.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in an appeal on Wednesday to African-Americans and working-class voters, promised ""21st century"" banking industry reforms and tax changes to spur job creation and investment in blighted communities.Delivering an urban policy speech two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Trump highlighted his plan to ease access to bank credit for young blacks trying to start businesses and create jobs in their communities.The New York businessman, who trails Democrat Hillary Clinton in national opinion polls and is struggling to appeal to African-Americans and Latinos, also called for broader tax incentives to spur inner-city investment.The steps, coupled with efforts to reduce U.S. trade deficits and the outsourcing of jobs abroad, Trump said, would ""raise wages at home, meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable"" for the poor.Trump flew to Charlotte, a major commercial hub in the U.S. South, after attending the formal opening in Washington of a Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House.Trump's detour from the campaign trail to plug his business drew criticism from some fellow Republicans, but the former reality TV star said the project, completed ""under budget and ahead of schedule,"" showed what he could accomplish if elected president.His Democratic rival, Clinton, said: ""Donald Trump is actually paying more attention to his business than to the campaign. That's his choice, but we're going to keep working really hard to reach as many voters as possible.""Speaking to reporters during a flight to New York after campaigning in Florida, Clinton also said the proposed merger of AT&T Inc and Time Warner Inc ""raises questions and concerns and they should be looked into.""In Charlotte, Trump provided few details of ""21st century Glass-Steagall,"" which would build on the 1933 Depression-era law requiring the separation of commercial and investment banking.Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999 under then-President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton's husband. The 2008 financial crisis prompted an overhaul of banking rules with the passage in 2010 of ""Dodd-Frank"" Wall Street reforms that many Republicans have criticized.
""Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need,"" Trump said.Trump, speaking to a mostly white audience after meeting with black religious leaders, said he would step up the police presence in U.S. cities so that ""every poor African-American child"" can walk on the streets in safety.""Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police,"" he said.Last month, hundreds of demonstrators protested in Charlotte after the release of videos showing the fatal shooting of a black man by police officers.TRUMP 'WALLS ARE COLLAPSING'

While Trump's speech stuck mainly to policy initiatives, he also got in a jab at Clinton.""Honestly, she has less energy than Jeb Bush,"" Trump said, criticizing Clinton's stamina and harking back to his charges that Bush, a former rival for the Republican nomination, was ""low energy.""Clinton told reporters that ""there was not an ounce of complacency"" in her campaign and said that if elected, she would reach out to Republicans and independents, including congressional leaders, ""both before the inauguration and to continue afterwards.""Before Trump's Charlotte speech, much of Wednesday's media attention focused on Trump's appearance at his new, 263-room luxury hotel.Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who led 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain's unsuccessful campaign, said the hotel stop was the latest inexplicable act from Trump and atypical behavior for someone trying to win the White House.
    ""The walls are collapsing,"" Schmidt told MSNBC in an interview. ""He is not doing any of the normal activities that you'd be doing 13 days out in a presidential race for somebody who's competitive. You don't take a time-out to tend to your business interests.""Trump, making his first run for elected office, often highlights his business accomplishments and has held numerous events at his properties since launching his White House bid last year, including a trip to Scotland to open a refurbished golf resort in June.Asked after the event why he was in Washington instead of campaigning in a battleground state, Trump told CNN it was ""a very rude question"" and said he worked hard on the trail every day.""I can't take one hour off to cut a ribbon at one of the great hotels of the world? I mean, I think I'm entitled to it,"" Trump told ABC News. He said there was a double standard, noting that Clinton was not criticized for taking time to see the singer Adele in concert on Tuesday night.Clinton campaigned on Wednesday in Florida, where many opinion polls show a tight race.An average of Florida polls compiled by RealClearPolitics showed Clinton at 46.4 percent compared with 44.8 percent for Trump in a race including third-party candidates.Clinton has a strong lead in the race to secure the 270 Electoral College votes - or tally of wins from the states - needed to capture the White House, according to results from Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.

By Dave McKinney
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Failure to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal would be a major setback for U.S. interests in Asia as Washington seeks to deepen alliances in the region, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday, urging Congress to ratify the pact.The 12-nation Pan-Pacific trade deal championed by President Barack Obama has been pilloried by both major-party nominees in the U.S. presidential race, Democrat Hilary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.While Republicans have traditionally backed free trade deals, Trump has blamed them for U.S. job losses and threatened to rip them up or renegotiate them if he wins the Nov. 8 election. ""If we see the TPP rejected, it would be a gigantic self-inflicted wound - a setback to our own interests in the region,"" Kerry told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, in remarks that drew a smattering of applause and boos.
""It would amount to a conscious turning of our backs on the Asia Pacific at the very moment that we ought to be linking arms - it would be an act that will hurt American workers, slow our economy, hinder our ability to advance the full range of U.S. objectives"" in the fast-growing region, he added.Republican leaders have said there is no point in bringing the trade deal for a vote in the ""lame-duck"" session of Congress after the election. 
But Kerry urged Congress to approve the deal after the election, saying: ""It's the right thing to do for America - and no matter what the loudest voices may be shouting - it is also the popular choice."" There are concerns in Washington that failure to pass the TPP would prompt Southeast Asian nations to turn to China and Russia.
Kerry said the trade deal was a ""litmus"" test of Washington's capacity to lead and was necessary if the United States wanted a steady and reliable presence in the region.His comments came amid tensions with China over the disputed South China Sea, increased concerns over North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs, and questions over the future of the U.S.-Philippines alliance.

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Following is a weekly roundup of financial market analysts' views on the likely outcome of the U.S. elections and the possible implications of a Trump or Clinton win on financial markets.  MORE COVERAGE: bit.ly/2dOgcoESEE RELATED FACTBOX: reut.rs/2ewdRdgLARRY BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, HEALTHCARE TEAM, WELLS FARGO
""The probability of either a Republican or a Democratic sweep of both the Executive and Legislative branches is low, but certainly not negligible. We think these scenarios would be more volatile for stocks.""REPUBLICAN SWEEP: Positive for devices, pharma, biotech, tools and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Negative for managed care, facilities and digital health stocks DEMOCRATIC SWEEP: Positive for managed care, facilities and digital health stocks. Negative for devices, pharma, biotech, tools and PBMsMICHAEL ZEZAS, STRATEGIST, MORGAN STANLEY
""With Trump's chances fading, and Clinton's lead growing, the 'Democratic Sweep' now carries greater -- albeit still small -- odds, raising the prospects for increased infrastructure spending (a positive bias for risk assets) and for heavier regulation of the financial and pharma sectors (a negative bias for both).""                
LORI CALVASINA, U.S. EQUITY STRATEGY, CREDIT SUISSE
""We think short-term risk for the broader U.S. equity market has been reduced, but not eliminated. In many investors' minds, the perceived risks associated with a Trump victory in the Presidential race have been replaced with concerns about the implications of a Democratic sweep of leadership in Congress (for both the Senate and House to flip).""CLINTON WIN: ""Near-term, the increased chance of a Clinton victory seems good for stocks with high international exposure and industrials. In the case of industrials, we see a fundamental underpinning of support from a Clinton victory in the form of plans to increase infrastructure spending. The fundamental picture for consumer discretionary is a bit trickier, given Clinton's support for an increase in the minimum wage and the likely increase in operating expenses that would result for many companies.""TRUMP WIN: ""The financials and health care sectors have been trading more in line with Trump's prospects for victory this year, which we think is due to fears over increased regulatory pressures for both sectors under a Clinton-led White House. That being said, we think any future election-driven weakness in these sectors could be short-lived and note that the relationships between these sectors and Trump's polling numbers may already be starting to break down a bit.""    
TOBIAS LEVKOVICH, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, CITIGROUP 
""A Democratic sweep, though still unlikely, might be met with concern on Wall Street as the prospect of higher taxes enters the fray."" ""Republican control of the House would stymie legislation that raised taxes across a wide swath and thus Democratic control of Congress alongside the resident of the Oval Office could lead to laws that might not be well received and could be seen as divisive (similar to the Affordable Care Act). Notably, moves to broaden entitlements including free college education could be passed with single party control but most likely would be blocked by a Republican Speaker of the House.""""One would expect Secretary Clinton to want to be a successful president and thus a more forceful economic agenda will be necessary to achieve that aim. While attempts at bipartisanship are likely specifically where there is some meeting of the minds, including areas like infrastructure spending and some tax reforms, there are several areas that may be controversial such as some of the planned tax increases. Nonetheless, most political observers think Clinton would be far more willing to reach out for compromise than Obama did.""ALEC PHILLIPS, U.S. POLITICAL ECONOMIST, GOLDMAN SACHS

""A Brexit-style surprise in the U.S. presidential election is very unlikely... comparisons between the surprise outcome in the UK referendum vote earlier this year and the upcoming U.S. presidential election are hard to avoid, but we think the differences outweigh the similarities. Most importantly, polling in the UK was much closer, and much less consistent, than it has been in the us presidential campaign this year.""   JARET SEIBERG, COWEN WASHINGTON RESEARCH GROUP, COWEN AND COMPANY
BANKS, HOUSING POLICY: ""Sec. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have now faced off in three presidential debates without a material discussion of banks or housing. This tells us that Congress will likely shape banking policy with either Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Rep. Jeb Hensarling taking (the) lead, depending on the winner. For housing, we see both candidates as a positive, though Trump may be better for Fannie and Freddie.""JUSTIN WOLFERS, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND NBER, AND ERIC ZITZEWITZ, DARTMOUTH COLLEGE AND NBER
MARKET OUTLOOK: ""The S&P 500 futures rose by 0.71 percent during the debate window in response to a 6 percent increase in Clinton's victory probability. This implies that market participants believe that the S&P 500 will be worth 12 percent more under a President Clinton. Movements in other U.S. stock indices tell a similar story. A 12 percent difference is large both in absolute terms, and relative to how previous political shocks have moved the market."" MARKET VOLATILITY: ""During the debate, futures tracking expected future U.S. stock market volatility fell sharply, suggesting that markets are more uncertain about outcomes under a Trump presidency. Oil prices rose, gold prices fell and Treasury prices declined slightly. Roughly speaking, these movements suggest that a Clinton presidency is expected to lead to stock market volatility that is 15-30 percent lower, Treasury yields that are 25 basis points higher, and oil that is $4 per barrel more expensive."" GLOBAL MARKETS: ""Movements in overseas markets suggest that the U.S. election is expected to have significant global implications. The debate led the British FTSE 100 to rise by as much as U.S. stocks did. The same is true of many Asian markets, too... The currencies of Mexico and Canada -- both of which are partners in NAFTA, which Trump has threatened to end or renegotiate -- rose sharply, as did those of other nations with which the U.S. has free trade agreements... All told, these movements suggest that financial markets expect a generally healthier domestic and international economy under a President Clinton than under a President Trump.""

By Dan Levine

The Democratic National Committee on Wednesday asked a U.S. judge to hold the Republican National Committee in contempt of court over allegations that Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to intimidate minority voters.The DNC accused Republicans in a court filing of violating a longstanding consent decree, which restricts Republicans' ability to question voters at the polls and prevent those people from casting a ballot. During the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Trump has asked followers to ""watch"" for fraud in the Nov.8 presidential election in certain areas where minority voters reside, even though no evidence of fraud exists, the filing said. Some of Trump's followers have pledged to do just that, the filing said.The RNC has supported Trump's ""ballot security endeavors,"" Democrats said in the court filing.
The RNC said the filing was completely meritless. ""The RNC strictly abides by the consent decree and does not take part directly or indirectly in any efforts to prevent or remedy vote fraud.  Nor do we coordinate with the Trump campaign or any other campaign or party organization in any efforts they may make in this area,"" a RNC spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""The RNC remains focused on getting out the vote.""Representatives for the Trump campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.
The DNC asked a New Jersey federal judge to issue an injunction preventing the RNC from spending money on voter integrity efforts, and to instruct its field offices that no employee shall participate in any ballot security measures.

By Michelle Nichols
| UNITED NATIONS

UNITED NATIONS The United States on Wednesday abstained for the first time from a United Nations General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for an end to a U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, after opposing such measures every year for 24 years.For the 25th time, the 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution with 191 votes in favor. Israel, which opposed the resolution last year, also abstained on Wednesday. Such resolutions are non-binding, but can carry political weight.Communist-run Cuba and the United States, former Cold War foes, began normalizing relations in 2014. U.S. President Barack Obama has taken steps to ease trade and travel restrictions on Cuba, but only the U.S. Congress can lift the full embargo.The Republican-controlled Congress has resisted Obama's call to lift Washington's economic embargo after more than 50 years. Republican critics say Obama is making too many concessions to Cuba for too little in return, especially on human rights.The U.N. General Assembly applauded when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power announced prior to the vote that the United States would abstain.
""Abstaining on this resolution does not mean that the United States agrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government. We do not,"" Power told the General Assembly. ""We are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the Cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people,"" she said.
Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez described the abstention as a ""positive step for the future of improving relations between the United States and Cuba.""Rodriguez said in September that damage from U.S. sanctions between April 2015 and March 2016 amounted to $4.6 billion and to $125.9 billion since the embargo's inception more than 50 years ago.In March, Obama made the first visit to Havana by a U.S. president in 88 years. His trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cuba's 1959 revolution.
Since the opening, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing Cuba to accelerate market-style reforms and boost political and economic freedoms.The U.N. resolution adopted on Wednesday takes note of the steps taken by Obama as positive but ""still limited in scope."" It urges the United States to repeal or invalidate the embargo on Cuba as soon as possible. (Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Republican Party's two-year run in the majority of the U.S. Senate is at serious risk and may well end on Nov. 8, senior congressional aides said on Wednesday, blaming Donald Trump as a drag on down-ballot Republican candidates.With 13 days to go before elections, several Senate aides from both parties privately warned of trouble for Republicans.""Things are not good ... the Senate is gone,"" said one Republican aide who asked not to be identified in order to candidly discuss the turbulent outlook for the 2016 campaign.Citing opinion polling, the aide said Republicans could lose Senate seats in six battleground states: Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Missouri.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday and conducted from Oct. 20 to Oct. 24 found that 41 percent of Republicans now expect Clinton to win the election, versus 40 percent for Trump.That is a sharp decline in confidence from last month, when 58 percent of Republicans said they thought their party's nominee would win, versus 23 percent for Clinton.Republicans now hold 54 of the Senate's 100 seats. Democrats must snatch four seats to win a majority, provided their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, beats Trump. That would make Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, the tie-breaking Senate vote since the vice president votes in order to break a tie.
On Tuesday, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report predicted  Democrats would gain five to seven seats. Such a result would leave them short of the 60 votes needed to easily get things done in the Senate, but it would provide a majority.A less pessimistic Senate Republican aide said Senate control still ""could go either way"" but sketched out problems.In Pennsylvania, the aide said, Senator Pat Toomey has to ""fight off dead weight at the top of the ticket,"" referring to Trump. In Missouri, he said, Democrat Jason Kander, who is trying to unseat Senator Roy Blunt, is ""a great candidate."" Nationally, ""the reason we don't hold the Senate, if we don't, is because of Donald Trump,"" the aide said.
Of course, this has been a volatile and unpredictable year, and there is still time for trends to reverse. Democrats stressed they are not breaking out the champagne.According to RealClear Politics, Toomey leads by 1.8 percentage points in Pennsylvania while Blunt is up by a point in strongly Republican Missouri and Senator Richard Burr has a 2.8-point lead in North Carolina over his Democratic challenger.Still, a senior Senate Democratic aide said, ""We have a lot more paths to a majority than they do.""Republicans entered the 2016 Senate races at a disadvantage, having to defend 24 seats to only 10 for Democrats.
Democratic President Barack Obama, who is still relatively popular, won at least one of his two White House races in most of the states where Republicans currently are struggling, such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Nevada.Clinton leads Trump by about 5 points in some national polls. Studies show a pattern of voting in recent decades in which the outcome of Senate races has had a significant correlation to who wins the White House.Polling in the hardest-fought states points to extremely close races with Republican incumbents' backs against the wall.In New Hampshire, Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte is in a tough race with her Democratic challenger, Governor Maggie Hassan. University of New Hampshire political science professor Dante Scala said Republican senators in that state and Pennsylvania face the ""one-two punch"" of independent voters potentially being turned off by Trump and an electorate that leans Democratic in presidential election years like 2016.""Given the overall environment, it tilts to Hassan,"" Scala said.

Democrat Hillary Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, signed legislation in 1999 that repealed Glass-Steagall.

LOS ANGELES Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was defaced by a vandal wielding a sledgehammer and a pick-axe on Wednesday in an act captured on video, police said.Los Angeles police expect to arrest someone for the vandalism, which left Trump's name scratched out of the star, the emblem in the middle dislodged and chips missing.     A video posted at Deadline.com, a Hollywood media industry website, showed a man wearing a hard-hat and reflective vest swinging a sledgehammer and pick-axe in the pre-dawn darkness.(To see the Deadline.com video, click on this link: bit.ly/2dWGEdf )The area had been cordoned off with traffic barriers and cones, giving it the appearance of a legitimate work site.The Republican presidential nominee, real estate developer and reality TV star has faced several large protests during his campaign appearances in California, where polls show him far behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
The former host of the NBC show ""The Apprentice,"" Trump received his Walk of Fame star in 2007. A spokeswoman for Trump could not be reached for comment. Los Angeles police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado at the scene confirmed investigators have video capturing the vandalism attack and she said police expected to arrest whoever was responsible.Los Angeles-based City News Service reported a man identifying himself as James Lambert Otis said he damaged the installation ""to make a point.""
City News reported the man said he had family members who were victims of sexual assault and had intended to remove the star, which he was unable to do, and auction it off to benefit women who have alleged Trump groped them. Trump has denied the allegations.Otis could not be reached for comment on the report.Trump drew widespread condemnations from voters and a number of Republican elected officials after a 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman.
His star on the Walk of Fame was previously targeted.In the summer, a street artist erected a tiny wall around the star, complete with miniature American flags and barbed wire. The art piece, which was later removed, made light of Trump's campaign pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce administers the hundreds of star plaques on sidewalks in the Los Angeles neighborhood. They are purchased for $30,000 each.Leron Gubler, president and CEO of the chamber, said in a statement the star would be covered for several days during repairs.
