By Ayesha Rascoe and Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The dark vision of America under siege described by Donald Trump in his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination does not mesh with reality, U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday.Obama noted that the ""birds were chirping and the sun was out"" for most Americans after Trump's Thursday night speech, which expounded on the threats to America from illegal immigrants, Islamic State militants, and race-related violence.""This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn't really jibe with the experience of most people,"" Obama said at a White House news conference after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.Obama said the violent crime rate in America has been lower during his 7-1/2 years in office than any time during the last three or four decades, despite an ""uptick"" in murders in some cities this year, and the recent high-profile killings of black men and police officers.The timing of Obama's quickly arranged short meeting with Pena Nieto presented both leaders with a convenient platform from which to criticize Trump.Just three weeks ago, Obama - who has six months left in the White House - invited the Mexican president to visit one last time before the U.S. president leaves on Jan. 20.
Trump has pledged to build a wall at the Mexico border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to force Mexico to pay for it.The New York businessman has also promised to slap tariffs on some U.S. products made in Mexico, and seek radical changes or even discard the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico and Canada.Pena Nieto was first to mention Trump, but said he respected both Trump and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and would work with constructively and in good faith with whoever wins the Nov. 8 election.In March, Pena Nieto likened Trump's ""strident tone"" to the ascent of dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. But he said on Friday that he had never pointed the finger at any of the candidates, saying that anything he had said had been taken out of context.
And he stressed that the two nations' futures were closely bound.""The closeness between the United States and Mexico is more than a relationship between governments. It's a solid and unbreakable relationship between millions of people who live in both nations,"" Pena Nieto said.Obama said the rate of illegal immigration is down from past decades, and praised Mexico for helping to address a flood of migrants fleeing Central America and for work on drug trafficking.
""A Mexico that has a healthy economy, a Mexico that can help us build stability and security in Central America, that's going to do a lot more to solve any migration crisis or drug trafficking problem than a wall,"" Obama said.Obama and Pena Nieto praised the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal as addressing some of the criticisms of NAFTA. Both Trump and Clinton have said they oppose the TPP, which has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress.""There are going to be different visions about where we should go as a country,"" Obama said, running down a list of economic issues facing the nation.""But we're not going to make good decisions based on fears that don't have a basis in fact,"" he said.

By Bryn Stole
| BATON ROUGE, La.

BATON ROUGE, La. David Duke, a former leader of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, launched his candidacy on Friday for the U.S. Senate from Louisiana, saying white people are threatened in America and that he hears echoes of his views in Donald Trump's rhetoric.Duke, a Republican, is a former Louisiana state legislator and unsuccessful candidate for governor who served a 15-month federal prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2002 to felony charges of tax evasion and mail fraud.Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew criticism in February for failing to quickly disavow support from Duke.At a news conference in Baton Rouge after officially filing as a candidate to succeed outgoing Republican Senator David Vitter, Duke, 66, said he watched Trump's speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in Cleveland and heard echoes of his own past political platforms.""I don't really care what Donald Trump says about me. I respect what he's doing,"" Duke said.In an online video announcing his candidacy, Duke also said, ""I'm overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I've championed for years.""In his video, Duke said he believes in equal rights and respect for all Americans but ""what makes me different is I also demand respect for the rights and heritage of European-Americans.""Duke's announcement came as Louisiana's capital grapples with racial tensions after the fatal July 5 shooting by police of a black man named Alton Sterling and the July 17 shooting deaths of three police officers by a black U.S. Marine Corps veteran.
In his comments to reporters, Duke called the Black Lives Matter protest movement that arose after a series of killings of black men by police in various U.S. cities a ""terrorist group.""Duke said that ""European-Americans"" need a politician to fight for their interests and that white people are threatened in the United States. Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, said he was no longer affiliated with the group.'HATE-FILLED FRAUD'

Duke's announcement drew and swift and scathing condemnation from Republican leaders and others. The Republican Party of Louisiana called Duke a ""felon and hate-filled fraud"" who does not embody Republican values.Ward Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which supports Republican candidates in Senate races, said Duke will never get the organization's backing.Louisiana does not hold party primaries. Instead, candidates from all parties are placed on the same ballot. If no one wins a simple majority in the Nov. 8 election, the top two vote-getters enter a runoff.Duke used this system to his advantage when he ran for governor in 1991 and made it to a runoff against former Governor Edwin Edwards, who had left office under a cloud of controversy for misconduct in office.
Other candidates seeking to replace Vitter in the Senate include Republican U.S. congressmen Charles Boustany and John Fleming. Vitter did not seek re-election to the Senate after a prostitution scandal helped derail his bid to become Louisiana governor.""I strongly denounce the racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism of David Duke. His views are a relic of ancient history and are repugnant to Louisianians,"" Boustany said. A spokesman for Fleming said the congressman ""is wholly focused on uniting Louisiana voters of all races, creeds and religions."" In February, Trump initially blamed his failure to reject Duke's support on not having heard an interviewer clearly. ""I disavowed David Duke all weekend long, on Facebook, on Twitter, and obviously, it is never enough,"" Trump told NBC's ""Today"" show after being widely criticized.

By Steve Holland
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Donald Trump accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of a legacy of ""death, destruction, terrorism and weakness"" as U.S. secretary of state and vowed to be tough on crime and illegal immigrants in a speech on Thursday accepting the Republican presidential nomination.Trump's 75-minute speech was designed to set the tone for the general election campaign against Clinton, an answer to Republicans who say the best way he can unify the divided party is to detail why the Democrat should not be elected on Nov. 8.As the crowd chanted: ""Lock her up"" for her handling of U.S. foreign policy, Trump waved them off and said: ""Let's defeat her in November."" Thousands of supporters who were gathered in the convention hall roared their approval. When it was over, Trump was joined on stage by family members as balloons cascaded from above and confetti blew around the arena.A CNN snap poll of viewers of the speech said 57 percent had a ""very positive reaction"" to the address and 18 percent a somewhat positive reaction, while 24 percent said it had a negative effect.Social media sentiment toward Trump based on tweets that mentioned his name was slightly more negative than positive shortly after his speech. The acceptance speech by Trump, 70, closed out a four-day convention that underscored his struggle to heal fissures in the Republican Party over his anti-illegal-immigrant rhetoric and concerns about his temperament. The event was boycotted by many big-name establishment Republicans, such as 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and members of the Bush family that gave the party its last two presidents.Trump presented a bleak view of America under siege from illegal immigrants, threatened by Islamic State militants, hindered by crumbling infrastructure and weakened by unfair trade deals and race-related violence.Accusing illegal immigrants of taking jobs from American citizens and committing crimes, Trump vowed to build a ""great border wall"" against the border-crossers.""We will stop it,"" Trump said.Trump took positions in conflict with traditional Republican policies. He said he would avoid multinational trade deals but instead pursue agreements with individual countries. He would renegotiate the NAFTA trade accord linking the United States, Canada and Mexico. He would penalize companies that outsource jobs and then export their foreign-made products back into the United States.""We will never sign bad trade deals,"" Trump thundered. ""America first!""The New York businessman, who has never held elected office, filled his speech with some of the bravado he used to win the Republican nomination over 16 rivals, punctuating his rhetorical points by waving an index finger.
""I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves,"" Trump said. ""Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.""In his speech, Trump portrayed himself as a fresh alternative to traditional politicians, willing to consider new approaches to vexing problems and help working-class people who may feel abandoned.Laying out his case against Clinton, he denounced nation-building policies that were actually put in place to some extent by George W. Bush, without mentioning by name the Republican president who launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Trump said policies pursued by Clinton in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria had made a bad situation worse. He blamed her for the rise of Islamic State militants and blasted her willingness to accept thousands of Syrian refugees.""After 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,"" Trump said.Clinton senior adviser John Podesta dismissed the speech as painting ""a dark picture of an America in decline"" and called it a reminder that Trump ""is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States.""John Weaver, a senior adviser to Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich, a former presidential rival to Trump, said in a tweet that Trump had delivered the ""saddest, darkest, most depressing acceptance speech in modern history."" 
'THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE'
Trump needed a strong performance on Thursday night to improve his chances of getting a boost in opinion polls as Democrats prepare for their own, more scripted convention next week in Philadelphia.In a contest that pits two politicians viewed as unfavorable by large segments of the American people, Trump also accused Clinton, 68, of being the puppet of big business, elite media and major donors who want to preserve the current political system.""That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change - and they have to change right now,"" Trump said.Trump said he would speedily address the violence that has dominated headlines, such as the shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers earlier this month. He vowed to defeat ""the barbarians of ISIS,"" the acronym for Islamic State.""I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on Jan. 20, 2017, safety will be restored,"" Trump said. The next president takes office on Jan. 20.
CONVENTION DISCORD
The prevailing narrative at the Cleveland convention has not been about Trump's positions, but dominated instead by the failure of he party's various factions to unite behind Trump.A series of distractions at the convention largely thwarted a bid by the Trump campaign to show him as a caring father and magnanimous business leader who would bring greater prosperity and safety to the United States. But in the end, many of these points were made when Ivanka Trump, Trump's daughter, introduced her father.""I have seen him fight for his family. I have seen him fight for his employees. I have seen him fight for his company and now I am seeing him fight for our country,"" she said.Trump's text of his speech, released by his campaign,  included extensive footnotes to show where the material originated.That was perhaps in reaction to the speech given on Monday night by Trump's wife Melania, who was accused of plagiarism when she repeated lines from a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama, Obama's wife.A staff writer for the Trump Organization later took responsibility for the misstep.

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The Democratic Party has selected a handful of undocumented immigrants for official roles at next week's Democratic National Convention, in a bid to highlight the gaping policy divide on immigration between White House hopeful Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump.Clinton is hoping to drive Latino voters to the polls on Nov. 8 to shore up her chances against Trump, who has campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration by building a wall along the Mexican border and deporting millions of undocumented foreigners if elected.""Our nation is a nation of immigrants that believes in being inclusive, and that's exactly what we will continue to work toward,"" said Leah Daughtry, the chief executive officer of the committee organizing the July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia.""The voices of our nation's brave undocumented youth will be heard loud and clear,"" Daughtry added.The picks include two members of the convention credentials and platform committees, as well as several speakers. The positions are unpaid, officials said.Trump's campaign, which has argued that unchecked immigration hurts American workers and undermines national security, criticized the move.
""Apparently speaking at Hillary Clinton's convention is just one more job Hillary Clinton thinks Americans won't do,"" a Trump campaign aide said in an emailed statement. ""She should have instead invited unemployed Americans, or victims of crime, or law enforcement."" The selections are legal because of a ""deferred action program"" adopted by President Barack Obama's administration, which postpones deportations and provides work authorization for some immigrants brought to the United States as children. The Supreme Court blocked efforts to expand those protections last month.The nominations mark the first time a major U.S. political party's convention has featured so many undocumented workers among its ranks. While there was an undocumented speaker at the 2012 Democratic convention, the party has not previously tracked the immigration status of its committee members.
""It changes the whole conversation when you have someone directly affected at the table,"" said Cesar Vargas, a Mexican immigrant chosen for the party's policy platform committee. Hareth Andrade, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Bolivia who was approved under a deferred action program, was picked for the credentials committee. The convention will also feature at least two undocumented immigrant speakers, Astrid Silva and Francisca Ortiz.Clinton already has overwhelming support from minorities. Some 70 percent back her, compared with 9 percent for Trump, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, suggesting that she could have a strong chance in states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado that swing between voting Democratic and Republican in presidential elections. 
However, voter turnout among Latinos has traditionally been low, hitting only about 40 percent in 2012, meaning her challenge is to get more of them to cast ballots this year.Luis Fraga, co-director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame, said showing a commitment to progressive reform of U.S. immigration policy could help Clinton do that. He called immigration a gateway issue for minority voters that can help engage them. That's especially so because even Latinos born in the United States are often not far removed from family members who are immigrants themselves. ""Although it's not their individual experience, it is their family's experience,"" Fraga said. (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Jonathan Oatis)"

By Amy Tennery and Angela Moon
| CLEVELAND/NEW YORK

CLEVELAND/NEW YORK At times, the speech was drowned out by the cheering crowds in the arena of the Republican National Convention. Social media crowned a new political star. Some Republicans said they were seeing the U.S. president they longed for.It was Ivanka Trump's night.The eldest daughter of New York businessman-turned-presidential nominee Donald Trump almost stole the show on Thursday night with a speech about her father that roused a packed Cleveland convention hall, broadcast to millions.READ OUR TOP STORIES: Verizon emerges as front-runner in Yahoo auctionOPINION - Dumb money: How political mega-donors got it wrongSilicon Valley leads avalanche of quarterly reports
On Google, there were more searches for Ivanka Trump than for her father.The 34-year old businesswoman and former model talked about her father's yearning to improve America, childcare, equal pay for women and other issues close to her heart, with a poise some found befitting of the White House.""Okay, why isn't @IvankaTrump running for President?"" television actor Anson Mount said in a Twitter post.""One of the best speeches - if not the best speech - tonight,"" said Chris Herrod, a 50-year-old delegate from Utah who had worked for Trump's vanquished rival Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas.
One of Trump's five children, Ivanka was chosen to introduce her father, who then officially accepted the Republican Party's presidential nomination. Since Trump announced his intention to run for the White House last year, she has been steadily drawn into her father's presidential campaign along with her 35-year-old husband Jared Kushner.The couple both take part in the Trump campaign's ""family meeting"" each Monday morning, helping make decisions about spending and strategy, according to a source familiar with the meetings.Among the children, Ivanka is the one who is often the bridge to women voters and seems to have the mission of selling her father's softer side. When she is not involved in the campaign, she helps to run the family's sprawling business empire from its New York City headquarters.
This week in Cleveland she has been everywhere, lobbying for her father with delegates and donors, appearing in television interviews and leaving a trail of picture-taking fans in her wake. One man, a Republican delegate in Cleveland, carried a placard all week around the convention that read: ""Ivanka, 2024. First Female President.""Her star turn in Cleveland was one of the top trending topics on Twitter late on Thursday, with about 121 tweets mentioning her name posted every minute. Overall sentiment on her was more positive than negative by a ratio of 3 to 1, according to analytics firm Zoomph.Ivanka missed her one chance to date to vote for her father: she had not changed her party registration from Democrat to Republican in time to cast a ballot in the April 19 New York primary election.She more than compensated on Thursday night, some convention delegates said.""She gave us enormous insight into him and the kind of man he is,"" said retiree Fernando C. deBaca, a 78-year-old New Mexico delegate. ""She's (an) enormously capable young lady, as is her brother. We're going to see the beginning of a dynasty here.""

By Emily Stephenson and Steve Holland
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND People seeking a deeper understanding of Donald Trump's economic policy came up empty-handed this week at the Republican National Convention.Best known to Americans previously as a reality TV host and having never held public office, the New York businessman on Thursday accepted the party's nomination for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.The party establishment has fretted over some of his plans to curb illegal immigration, renegotiate trade deals and levy tariffs on China. Trump's skepticism about free trade puts him at odds with Republican orthodoxy. Wall Street investors are wary and confused.In speeches from the main stage and in panel discussions on the sidelines, the four-day convention was notable for a paucity of policy details, the result perhaps of a desire to play down differences among the party faithful.The lack of specifics was too much for one head of a multinational corporation, who complained at a business forum that he had no idea what to expect from Trump, a New York real estate developer. ""We feel anxious,"" said Michael Thaman, chief executive officer of Owens Corning, which operates in 25 countries. ""In business, obviously details matter.""Trump offered little insight himself in his convention-ending acceptance speech. He spoke in broad, thematic strokes without much detail, sticking closely to positions he had outlined during 13 months of campaigning.""Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,"" Trump said.HILLARY CLINTON THE TOP TOPIC
Speakers in Cleveland placed a greater emphasis on defeating the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, than on what Trump has called the failed economic policies of President Barack Obama.
On Tuesday night, when the theme was ""Make America Work Again"" and the economy was the designated topic, a rough search by Reuters of the prime-time speeches found some 80 mentions of the word ""Clinton"" compared to about 15 mentions of ""economy.""According to transcripts of the speeches delivered at the convention, only Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. mentioned Dodd-Frank, the financial oversight law many Republicans rail against. Asked on Thursday, before the older Trump's speech, about the shortage of policy specifics, his campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said:  ""The campaign is pleased with the convention program, the content of which has been diverse and dynamic and we look forward to an exciting conclusion tonight.""Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was chief economic policy adviser to Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008, was not satisfied with his experience.He described taking part in a panel discussion on Wednesday with two Trump advisers, television commentator Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore of the conservative Heritage Foundation, that he said was light on details.""'Isn't Mr. Trump bad on trade?'"" he said someone would ask. 
""'Yes, but we're going to fix it. Don't worry.'""'Isn't his tax plan a problem that's going to lose $12 trillion?' ""'Yes, but we'll fix it. Don't worry.'""Kudlow and Moore also appeared on Tuesday at an event hosted by conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks, along with donor Andy Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns fast-food restaurants Hardee's and Carl's Jr.The group discussed trade and immigration policy, with panelists at times shrugging off Trump's lack of specifics. ""All you really need to know is the alternative is Hillary Clinton,"" Puzder said at one point, reinforcing the week's theme. 
UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION
Republicans typically use their nominating conventions to emphasize their candidates' main policy points. Think tanks and lobby groups hold panel discussions. Experts circulate white papers. With Trump, the events were built more around his personality and the need for the party to unite behind him.    There were some such gatherings in Cleveland, but fewer than usual, Holtz-Eakin said.Some advisers to past Republican candidates suspected Trump was not relying on a vast team of policy advisers. Lanhee Chen, an adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, sorted through convention speeches in 2012 before speakers delivered them because, he said, he wanted to make sure they hewed closely to Romney's positions.""I imagine the Trump campaign doesn't have that process in place because they don't have a lot of policy to talk about,"" Chen said. ""It just says that policy hasn't been a priority for them. You end up with a situation where the candidate is making pronouncements that don't seem particularly well informed.""Some delegates who spoke to Reuters seemed unconcerned by the policy-light approach to the convention, arguing that it was more important for the gathering to whip up enthusiasm among the delegates and forge unity.""This is more of a party,"" said Ray Suttle, a 53-year-old lawyer and delegate from Virginia. ""You don't like people talking shop at a cocktail party, do you?"" (Additional reporting by James Oliphant; Writing by Howard Goller; Editing by Ross Colvin)"

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Members of the Democratic Party's liberal wing on Thursday nervously awaited Hillary Clinton's announcement in coming days of a vice presidential running mate, urging her to choose someone who opposes a massive Pacific free trade deal and backs tough Wall Street reform.Two U.S. senators, Tim Kaine and Cory Booker, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack were among the contenders, according to a Democratic source with knowledge of the discussions.""After promising to oppose the TPP, it's important for Clinton to pick someone who shares that position,"" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign CommitteeThe Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal, known as TPP, became a key issue during the primary season, with critics contending that it would be unfair to American workers. Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it.The Democratic source said that while Clinton's decision was being closely held, there were ""vibes"" she may be leaning toward Kaine as a partner to take on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence in the Nov. 8 election.But the source said that the consideration of Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa, ""is real,"" even if Kaine, a senator from Virginia who is also a former governor of the state, might have an edge.Clinton ""wants somebody who will be a reliable partner she can trust and make the policy decisions"" and potentially step into the presidency, the source said, adding that Clinton sees Kaine as someone who would ""fit that bill.""HITTING THE ""SURPRISE"" CHORD

Hispanic-Americans, meanwhile, continued to push for a first-ever Latino on the Democratic ticket.""For our members that kind of a message would certainly resonate,"" said Yvanna Cancela, political director for the Culinary Workers Union in Las Vegas. ""It is way past the time for when we have a Latino in one of the highest offices in the country.""Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro had both been mentioned.Others have also come under consideration.The source added that U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the party's liberal wing and a fierce critic of Wall Street, received close consideration by Clinton but would not provide the ""right balance"" for the ticket.
Others have also been under consideration in recent days, including Booker, to see if they hit a ""surprise"" chord with Clinton, the source said. Booker, an African-American, is a first-term senator and a former mayor of Newark, New Jersey.Both Kaine and Vilsack have backed free-trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiation by the Obama administration, encompassing about 40 percent of the world's economies stretching from Japan to Chile.Critics include Trump as well as Sanders. Clinton herself has distanced herself from the trade deal. Taylor said that it is ""also important she pick someone committed to strong Wall Street reform,"" saying that the ""wrong pick"" could hamper Democrats' drive to keep Trump from winning the White House.Booker traveled to Cleveland to defend the Clinton campaign, which has come under continued attack at the Republican convention there this week.
""The vile and the viciousness, it doesn't reflect who we are as a country,"" Booker said of the Republican convention, in an interviewed with MSNBC.Asked about his appearance Thursday on Clinton's official Instagram account, Booker said it should not be read as tea leaves about a potential vice presidential pick. ""You have a social media-minded person and I understand this platform,"" he said. The Democratic source knowledgeable about the process said Clinton could announce her running mate as early as Friday in Florida. She will campaign there in the run-up to next week's Democratic convention in Philadelphia, where Clinton is expected to be formally nominated.Another Democratic source said Clinton might wait until Saturday to help keep the media focused on the Republican convention in Cleveland, where opposing wings of that party were in open warfare. Television interviewer Charlie Rose, speaking with Clinton recently, noted that some view Kaine as ""boring."" Clinton responded, ""I love that about him.""Susie Tompkins Buell, a founder of the Esprit fashion label and close friend of Clinton, on Thursday would not comment on who might be the choice. But Buell, a major donor to Clinton's campaign, said the person would be a ""high contrast"" to Trump's choice of Pence.
