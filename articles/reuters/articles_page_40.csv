LONDON He turned ""You're fired"" into his reality show catch-phrase, but it was Donald Trump who went up in flames on Saturday - or at least an effigy of him did, as part of Britain's annual Bonfire Night celebrations.An 11-metre-high (36 feet) model of the Republican U.S. presidential candidate was burned at a fireworks display in the town of Edenbridge, 30 miles (50 km) south of London.The sculpture showed Trump, complete with his trademark mop of hair, holding his Democratic rival for the White House, Hilary Clinton, in a headlock, and sporting a pair of Mexico-themed boxer shorts.""I think he would be quietly amused,"" artist Frank Shepherd said of his muse. 
Britain celebrates the failed attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605 by letting off fireworks and lighting bonfires with an effigy of the ""Gunpowder Plot"" leader Guy Fawkes on top.The celebrations in Edenbridge also feature effigies of unpopular celebrities and in the past have included former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and disgraced American cyclist Lance Armstrong.
Other contenders for this year's choice included Philip Green, the billionaire former owner of failed retail chain BHS who is under pressure to resolve the firm's pension problems, and Sam Allardyce who quit as England soccer manager in September, after one game in charge, after a newspaper sting.

RENO, Nevada Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was hustled off the stage by security agents at a campaign event in Reno on Saturday after a perceived threat in the crowd.Two security agents grabbed Trump by the shoulders and rushed him back stage. The threat was unclear, but a man near the front of the crowd was pounced on by other security agents.
TV video showed the man being escorted away by a group of police officers, with his hands behind his back.Trump returned to the stage a few minutes later to continue his rally speech, three days before Tuesday's election.
""We will never be stopped,"" Trump said.

By Lizbeth Diaz
| MOLCAXAC, Mexico

MOLCAXAC, Mexico In the small southern market town of Molcaxac, 650 miles (1050 km) from the U.S. border, Alicia Villa is praying to God that Republican candidate Donald Trump does not become the next president of the United States.Over the past two decades, as Mexico's rural economy stalled, Molcaxac and hundreds of towns like it became dependent on dollars sent by relatives who made the perilous journey north, a lifeline she fears will be cut by a Trump White House.Villa, 65, said funds sent by a daughter working illegally as a house cleaner in Sacramento, California have supported her family for 12 years because the work she does as receptionist in Molcaxac does not pay enough to make ends meet.""I am Catholic and I have asked God and the Virgin of Asuncion that he lose,"" Villa said of Trump, placing her head in her hands and intoning a prayer in the square of the deeply religious hill town dominated by a striking blue church.Inside, the church was adorned with notes thanking migrant relatives for money sent to help build homes, start businesses and pay for marriages in the town surrounded by rivers, mountains and meadows in the state of Puebla.""Trump says he will kick out everyone who doesn't have papers and we really need them to be there,"" said Villa, adding that she had not seen some family members living in the United States in 20 years.Trump, a real-estate tycoon who has narrowed the gap with  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ahead of next Tuesday's vote, has vowed to make it harder for illegal immigrants to live and work in the United States, to increase deportations and to limit remittances unless Mexico pays billions for a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border.Such policies would take a heavy toll in Molcaxac, where local authorities say more than 70 percent of the population lives on remittances sent home by immigrants to the United States, many of them undocumented.""Our town has improved a lot since our people started to leave for the United States,"" said stonemason Esteban Marquez, whose workshop was partly funded by remittances from one of his children.    
'NOTHING FOR THEM' HERE 

Mexico has more than 5 million citizens living without regular papers in the United States, or about half of the entire undocumented population.Those men and women send back a large chunk of Mexico's foreign exchange earnings, contributing more than $20 billion in remittances wired this year through September.According to Mexico's Central Bank, Puebla received $1 billion in remittances in the same period, making it the fifth biggest recipient among Mexican states.So many people from Puebla live in the New York area that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Trump supporter, visited the state in 2014. Couriers have grown rich transporting salsas and fresh cheese to homesick natives up north. The money has transformed places like Molcaxac, a  picturesque town dotted with well-built homes attesting to the flow of dollars.It is not just the potential loss of income Trump could spark that worries Molcaxac locals.
The lack of employment in rural Mexico is one of the main reasons drug gangs find it easy to recruit among young people and those deported from the United States, they say.""Here in Mexico, the truth is there is nothing for them,"" said stonemason Marquez. ""The people who stay need to survive, and since there is no work, they get pulled into crime.""    
'VOTE FOR THE LADY'
Opinion polls in the run-up to the election suggest that Villa's prayers stand a good chance of being answered, with most putting Clinton consistently ahead of her Republican rival.
But the polls also show her losing ground in the final stretch. Real Clear Politics, which averages the results of most major polls, shows Clinton's advantage had declined from 4.6 percentage points to 1.7 points over the past week.Even those of more modest means in Molcaxac are on edge with America's election.""Only God knows if they are going to be able to stay there,"" said Serafina Martinez, who at 70 still works in the fields.She worries it would be hard to survive without the little her son in California sends when he can.""I would like him to keep helping us with pennies,"" said Martinez, her curved back laden with firewood and groceries. Still, the uncertainty has also helped locals in an unexpected way: the Mexican peso's value plunges every time Trump advances, making the dollar remittances stretch further.But there is no doubt in the minds of Molcaxac's townspeople that they would rather see Clinton in the White House.Clinton has proposed comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship, and says she will end detention of immigrant families. ""I think she will win, and that gives us hope that our relatives will be able to regularize (their papers),"" said Teresa Amador, selling flowers in the main market. ""I have a son who was born there, and he is going to vote for the lady."" (Writing by Natalie Schachar; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Mary Milliken)"

The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday ordered an Arizona state law that restricts the collection of ballots by third parties back in place for Tuesday's election, a victory for Republicans in an intensifying state-by-state legal battle over access to voting.The Supreme Court granted a stay of a U.S. appeals court ruling that on Friday had temporarily blocked Arizona from enforcing the law that prohibits advocacy groups from collecting completed early ballots from voters and delivering them to election offices as part of get-out-the-vote efforts.The stay will remain in effect pending a final disposition of the appeal by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court order said. The appeals court has scheduled oral arguments in the case for January.Polls have shown Republican Donald Trump with a small lead in Arizona over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race.
Democrats have accused Republicans of enacting state laws intended to make it harder for minorities and others who tend to back Democratic candidates to cast ballots. Republicans have called these laws necessary to guard against voting fraud.Arizona late Friday filed an emergency appeal asking the U.S. Supreme Court to allow it to enforce the law Arizona's legislature approved earlier this year.
Plaintiffs in the case, including the Democratic National Committee, argued the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly impacted the ability of minorities to vote.
In asking the Supreme Court to deny a stay, the plaintiffs said reinstating the law ""would expose Arizonans who are presently engaged in ballot collection and do not learn of this court's ruling to a felony conviction and criminal sanctions.""

By Amanda Becker and Emily Stephenson
| CLEVELAND/HERSHEY, Pa.

CLEVELAND/HERSHEY, Pa. Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump battled over the strength of the economy in the final stretch of their race for the White House on Friday, with Clinton praising the latest U.S. jobs report and Trump dismissing it as a fraudulent disaster.With four days left in an often bitter contest that has tightened in the last week, each candidate attacked the other as unfit to be president in a late push for votes in battleground states that could decide the outcome in Tuesday's election.Clinton leads Trump by 5 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday, maintaining her advantage in the national survey even as the race tightens in several crucial swing states.In the Oct. 30-Nov. 3 opinion poll, 44 percent of likely voters supported Clinton while 39 percent supported Trump. Clinton wrapped up her day of campaigning with a nighttime concert in Cleveland headlined by rapper Jay Z. He was joined by rappers Big Sean, Chance the Rapper, and J. Cole, and by his wife, popular singer Beyonce, as a surprise guest.""We have unfinished work to do, more barriers to break, and with your help, a glass ceiling to crack once and for all,"" Clinton said at the concert.  At his final rally of the day in Pennsylvania, Trump mocked  Clinton for her celebrity supporters. ""I am here all by myself. Just me, no guitar, no piano, no nothing,"" he said.Earlier in the day at a rally in Pittsburgh, Clinton cited the government's latest jobs report as evidence of the economy's strength. The report showed higher wages for workers as well as the creation of 161,000 jobs in October and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent from 5 percent.""I believe our economy is poised to really take off and thrive,"" Clinton told the gathering, after being introduced by billionaire investor Mark Cuban. ""When the middle class thrives, America thrives.""Trump disputed Clinton's rosy view, telling a crowd in New Hampshire that the jobs report was ""an absolute disaster"" and was skewed by the large number of people who have stopped looking for jobs and are no longer in the labor market.""Nobody believes the numbers anyway. The numbers they put out are phony,"" he said, referring to the figures released by the U.S. Labor Department.
The economy and the candidates' competing visions for the future could be critical in swaying voters in ailing Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.Both candidates made stops in Ohio and Pennsylvania on Friday, with Trump adding a stop in New Hampshire and Clinton adding one in Michigan. Each of those states is key in the state-by-state quest for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.TIGHTENING POLLS
The race has tightened significantly in the past week, as several swing states that are considered must-wins for Trump shifted from favoring Clinton to toss-ups, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project.The two candidates are now tied in Florida and North Carolina, and Clinton's lead in Michigan has narrowed so much that the state is too close to call. Ohio remains a dead heat, and Clinton has a slight lead in Pennsylvania.
Clinton is still the favorite to win Tuesday's election, with a clearer path to winning of the Electoral College. But Trump now has a plausible route to victory, especially if there is a sharp fall in turnout among African-Americans from the levels of the 2012 election.Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV star, has made a pitch for blue-collar workers who have been angered by free-trade deals and feel abandoned by Washington. But his protectionist rhetoric - he has promised to review trade agreements - appears to be having mixed success in the Rust Belt.Reuters/Ipsos polling from mid-October found a majority in both Ohio and Pennsylvania believe that international trade benefits Americans by keeping the cost of goods low, although they also think it hurts ""average Americans"" by depressing wages and causing job losses at home.Clinton appears to be leading among labor union households in both states, the poll found. She has a double-digit lead with women in both, while Trump has a more modest lead with men. Among whites, Trump has a 7-point lead over Clinton in Ohio and a 3-point lead over Clinton in Pennsylvania.In the final stretch, the two candidates continued to paint a dire scenario of life in the United States if their opponent captures the White House. Trump said the FBI's fresh examination of emails that may be related to Clinton's use of a private email server for government work while she was secretary of state could lead to ""a constitutional crisis.""
""Aren't we tired of all this stuff?"" he asked. ""America deserves a government that can go to work on Day One.""GET-OUT-THE-VOTE PUSH
Clinton suggested the volatile Trump, who has feuded with and insulted a wide array of people and groups including Muslims, Mexican immigrants and women, was too unpredictable to trust.""Think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who insults him,"" she said.Clinton has deployed high-profile supporters to campaign for her in the final days of the long race.  President Barack Obama praised her work as his first-term top diplomat during an appearance in North Carolina.""She was outstanding in her job. She was loyal to me,"" he said. Obama is trying to energize African-Americans, with whom he is very popular, and young people to turn out for Clinton the way they did for him in 2008 and 2012.Hispanic groups in swing states cranked up their get-out-the-vote efforts for the final stretch of the race on Friday, hoping to push the contest Clinton's way.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON When President Barack Obama leaves office on Jan. 20 after eight years, several of his major initiatives will still hang in the legal balance, meaning the U.S. courts and his successor will play a major role in shaping his legacy.Ongoing legal challenges by Republican-governed states and business groups are targeting Obama's signature healthcare law, his plan to combat climate change, a key immigration initiative, his transgender rights policy, his ""net neutrality"" internet rules, overtime pay for workers and other matters.Most of the cases are awaiting rulings by trial judges or regional federal appeals courts and could be bound for the U.S. Supreme Court, but are unlikely to get there until after the winner of Tuesday's election, pitting Democrat Hillary Clinton against Republican Donald Trump, is sworn in. Unless the U.S. Senate changes course and confirms Obama's nominee, appellate court judge Merrick Garland, to fill the vacant ninth seat on the ideologically split Supreme Court, the next president would be responsible for selecting a new justice who could cast the deciding vote in these cases. The Supreme Court has already agreed to decide a major transgender rights case. Obama's administration is backing a female-born transgender high school student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the school's boys' bathroom. A ruling, which also could resolve similar litigation around the country, is not due until the end of June.In another transgender rights case, a number of states challenged the Obama administration's May guidance to public schools nationwide to let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice. A federal judge blocked the policy in August while the litigation continues.Because Obama during much of his presidency has faced a Republican-controlled Congress hostile to his legislative initiatives, he has often bypassed lawmakers and used executive power to advance policy goals.""Despite having majorities in both houses of Congress, Republicans have refused to govern. Instead, this litigious Republican Party has rushed to the courts with partisan lawsuits,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.Those challenging Obama have vowed to fight on unless his successor changes course.
""Should a new administration rescind those policies and respect the bounds placed before it, we will happily direct our energies elsewhere,"" added Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has helped spearhead various legal challenges to Obama.Clinton, backed by Obama in her White House bid, could be expected to leave in place or even expand on his initiatives and to defend them in court. Trump, if elected, could quickly reverse Obama executive orders as promised. But undoing large-scale regulations like power plant emissions rules could be more complicated. ""It's not at the stroke of a pen,"" said Sean Donahue, a lawyer representing environmental groups that backed Obama administration climate rules known as the Clean Power Plan.Trump would have to undergo a new, lengthy rule-making process, according to legal experts.
CLEAN POWER PLAN
The case with the biggest potential long-term impact is the challenge by states and industry groups to Obama's Clean Power Plan, which would curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. The rules are an important legacy issue for Obama. They also are vital to U.S. obligations under last year's international climate change treaty.A federal appeals court heard oral arguments in September. A ruling is not due for months. The case is likely to go to the Supreme Court on appeal.The Supreme Court put the regulations on hold in February while the litigation continues.
Republicans and conservative groups have launched numerous challenges to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 issued rulings preserving Obama's top legislative achievement. Now, another Republican-led legal challenge is making its way through the courts. The administration has appealed a district court judge's May decision that the federal government cannot spend billions of dollars to provide subsidies under Obamacare to help individuals buy policies from private insurers without congressional approval.Separately, the administration is seeking in federal court in Texas to revive Obama's 2014 executive action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits. The plan, challenged by Texas and other states, has been barred by the courts. The Supreme Court, split 4-4, in June left in place lower court orders blocking the plan, and in October declined to revisit that ruling. Other Obama regulations have been targeted by business groups. A federal appeals court in June upheld Obama's landmark ""net neutrality"" rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content. The case remains under appeal.In September, states and business groups filed a legal challenge to an administration rule to extend mandatory overtime pay to millions of workers. A ruling is not due until after Obama leaves office.Graphic: Courts weigh Obama legacy - here (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Amy Stevens and Will Dunham)"

By Joseph Ax
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Two former associates of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were convicted on Friday for their roles in the ""Bridgegate"" lane closure scandal, following a six-week trial that served to further tarnish the Republican's damaged reputation.Bridget Kelly, the governor's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were found guilty in Newark federal court on all counts.They were convicted of fraud, conspiracy and depriving the residents of Fort Lee, New Jersey, of their civil rights.Christie, who is in charge of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's transition team, has not been criminally charged, but the scandal has torpedoed what was once seen as a promising political career.Christie on Friday again denied having had any advance knowledge of the scheme to choke traffic heading for the busy George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey and Manhattan. ""I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them,"" Christie said in a statement following the verdict. ""Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.""The scandal has dogged Christie, once seen as a potential presidential nominee before his campaign for the White House failed this year. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta said on Friday Trump should ask Christie to resign as head of his transition team.Legal experts have said it is unlikely Christie would face any criminal consequences based on the trial testimony. Baroni and Kelly were accused of shutting down access lanes to the bridge in September 2013 in Fort Lee, New Jersey, creating a massive days-long traffic jam to punish the town's mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Christie's reelection campaign.
The Port Authority, which runs the bridge, says it is the world's busiest, carrying 102 million vehicles a year on the I-95 interstate highway, a major east coast traffic artery.Lawyers for Kelly and Baroni vowed to appeal.""This is not over,"" Kelly's lawyer Michael Critchley said outside the courthouse, with his arm around his weeping client. He said the judge had erred during jury instructions.Defense lawyers were furious when U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton told jurors in response to a question they could convict Kelly and Baroni on conspiracy even if the act itself was not ""intentionally punitive toward Mayor Sokolich.""Wigenton said prosecutors did not have to prove motive, even though their case had revolved around the political retribution.
""By answering the way you're answering, you're directing a verdict of guilty,"" an angry Critchley told Wigenton on Tuesday.Baroni's lawyer, Michael Baldassare, told reporters the case was a ""disgrace"" and said the conviction would be overturned.""I am innocent of these charges,"" a smiling Baroni said.Kelly and Baroni's co-conspirator, former Port Authority official and confessed mastermind David Wildstein, had earlier pleaded guilty and appeared as the government's star witness, detailing how the three schemed to pay back Sokolich.But Wildstein also implicated Christie, saying he and Baroni discussed the lane closures with the governor while they were ongoing. Christie, Wildstein testified, laughed at the notion that Sokolich was frustrated by the traffic.
At the time, Christie believed that securing the backing of Democratic officials would burnish his national reputation, according to trial testimony.Kelly, who took the stand in her defense, testified she had discussed the lane closures with Christie a month beforehand, though she said she thought at the time they were part of a legitimate traffic study.""I take no pleasure in this verdict,"" said U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Paul Fishman, a successor of Christie in that position. Fishman, whose office prosecuted the case, said he was saddened by the conduct of top government officials.Kelly and Baroni's lawyers argued that Wildstein had orchestrated the plot himself and told them he was conducting a traffic study. Wildstein said on the stand the three of them knew all along that the study was a bogus cover story.Prosecutors showed jurors numerous exchanges that Kelly and Baroni each had with Wildstein, who operated as liaison between Baroni at the Port Authority and Kelly in the governor's office.Those included Kelly's now-infamous email to Wildstein that prosecutors said launched the scheme, in which she wrote, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""Kelly and Baroni are scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21. Each faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the most serious charge of fraud, though it is unlikely they would receive such a lengthy term.

By Ian Simpson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Long-frustrated backers of statehood for the District of Columbia are pinning their hopes on a first-ever referendum on Tuesday in a long-shot bid to become the 51st U.S. state.Invoking the colonial-era demand of ""no taxation without representation,"" supporters say becoming a state would end Washingtonians' status as second-class citizens because they lack representation in Congress.But opponents dismiss the referendum as a ""fool's errand""  destined to fail because of partisan political hurdles and the need to amend the U.S. Constitution, a procedure accomplished only 17 times since 1789.The District of Columbia was carved out to serve as the nation's capital, but it is not a state. Its 672,000 residents have no voting representative in the Senate or House of Representatives although they pay federal taxes, though they do have a delegate in the House.  A ""yes"" vote could help pressure the new Congress and president - either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump - to admit the District of Columbia as a new state, though even advocates admit that is unlikely anytime soon.A ""yes"" vote would simply be an expression of public support for statehood, a non-binding measure without any legal force.""Statehood's the only way that we can have the same rights and responsibilities as all the other citizens of the United States,"" District of Columbia Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said.The overwhelmingly Democratic capital city was fed up with Republican lawmakers espousing the rights of states and cities to self-governance and then interfering with local issues such as abortion and marijuana legalization, Mendelson said.
""That's so antithetical to democratic principles, but that doesn't seem to bother some of these folks,"" he said.The referendum seeks to upend the Constitution's provision giving Congress legislative control over the District of Columbia.Voters will cast a single ""yes"" or ""no"" vote on the referendum's four parts: admission as a state, its boundaries, approval of a constitution, and guarantees of a representative form of government.The new state would embrace the current 68-square-mile (176-square-km) district except for a core of federal property around the White House, Capitol and monument-rich National Mall. 
The District Council approved the referendum unanimously, and a Washington Post poll in November 2015 showed 67 percent of residents backed statehood. The Democratic Party's national platform also supports the idea.""If you're not part of a state, large parts of the constitution don't apply to you,"" said statehood advocate Ann Loikow.Mayor Muriel Bowser and other statehood backers took the vote's design from the successful bid in the 1790s by Tennessee, then a federal territory, to become a state through a referendum and petition to Congress.Supporters and skeptics say that even if the referendum passes it would face a dead end in Congress, where Republicans would oppose statehood since it would add Democratic senators and a representative to Congress.
Besides the political obstacles, Roger Pilon, a constitutional scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, called the statehood quest a ""fool's errand"" because of constitutional obstacles.For the District to become a state, Congress would have to propose an amendment to the Constitution, which would then have to win a two-thirds majority vote in both the Senate and the House. Even if an amendment could win approval in both houses of Congress, it would face another big hurdle: approval by the legislatures of at least three-fourths of the 50 states.Washingtonians have tried to achieve statehood before, but never by an up-or-down referendum. Congress ignored a statehood petition that included a constitution voters ratified in the 1980s.The House of Representatives rejected a statehood bill in 1993, and it failed to reach a Senate vote. A constitutional amendment for voting rights in Congress fizzled in the 1980s. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Daniel Trotta and Leslie Adler)"
