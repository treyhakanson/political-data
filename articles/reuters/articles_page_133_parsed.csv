By Ruffin Prevost
| CODY, Wyo.

CODY, Wyo. Former Vice President Dick Cheney's eldest daughter, bouncing back from an aborted 2014 U.S. Senate bid, heads into a crowded primary race next week for Wyoming's lone seat in the House of Representatives buoyed by big-name Republicans and wealthy out-of-state donors.Liz Cheney, the apparent Republican front-runner, has commanded a level of fund-raising and A-list party support - including two former presidents and onetime Cabinet members - that is rare, if not unheard of, for a relative newcomer to Wyoming politics.Her strength is even more significant in a solidly red state where the Republican primary winner is virtually assured victory in the general election.""She can go to Chicago or New York, and in one fund-raiser pull in more money than the next two closest candidates combined,"" said Deb Oakley Simpson, a daughter-in-law of former longtime Wyoming Republican Senator Alan Simpson and a Cody-based civic activist who backs one of Cheney's primary foes, state Senator Leland Christensen.To date, Cheney, 49, has received individual donations totaling more than $1.1 million, far outpacing the collective campaign receipts of her seven Republican opponents and the two Democrats running in Wyoming's primary elections on Tuesday.According to the latest opinion poll on the race, conducted during the second week of July, more than half of Wyoming voters were undecided, but Cheney led with 21 percent, more than twice the following of her nearest competitor.Her standing marks a striking turnaround from her first bid for public office, when she returned to her home state three years ago to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was branded by some fellow Republicans as a ""carpetbagger"" backed by deep-pocketed outsiders.
Her campaign also suffered from a public feud with her sister Mary Cheney, a lesbian, over Liz Cheney's opposition to same-sex marriage. BRAND NAMES, DEEP POCKETS
She ended up withdrawing from that race several months later, citing a family health crisis. Cheney and her husband, Phil Perry, an attorney, have five children.
Now Cheney, also a lawyer who worked in the State Department while her father was vice president, is leveraging her Washington connections as she runs for the open, at-large House seat in the nation's least populous state.Campaigning as a ""strong conservative voice for Wyoming,"" she has vowed to protect the state's pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights and generally work ""to reverse President Obama's devastating policies.""Among her contributors are a prominent group of her father's former high-ranking government colleagues, including former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as former Secretary of State James Baker, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and former White House political adviser Karl Rove.Other prominent donors include New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Colorado oil and entertainment magnate Philip Anschutz, brewing executive Pete Coors, Texas financier T. Boone Pickens, and Chicago real estate and media investor Sam Zell.
Cheney's two closest Republican primary rivals are state Representative Tim Stubson and Christensen, who rank second and third, respectively, in fund-raising and in polls. They have raised $255,000 combined in individual donations. Cheney, who was on the campaign trail and unavailable for comment, has accepted no political action committee funds, and PAC funding has figured little in the race.She raised the bulk of her campaign money by the end of March, with nearly half of individual contributions meeting the $2,700 limit set by federal election laws. Most came from outside Wyoming.Still, Cheney ""has raised more money from more Wyoming donors than any of her opponents,"" and contributions from all 50 states, campaign manager Bill Novotny said. ""A national effort is what it's going to take to stand up to Hillary Clinton"" at the top of the Democratic ticket in November, he added.

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON If you haven't heard a lot about what Hillary Clinton thinks of a string of controversial comments by Donald Trump that have generated round-the-clock coverage on cable news broadcasts, there is a reason - it's by design.Since becoming the Democratic nominee last month, Clinton has been touring toy manufacturers, visiting tie makers and dropping in on public health clinics, where if she mentions Trump at all, it is usually to contrast their policies.Her swift condemnation at a Wednesday campaign rally of Trump's remark that gun rights activists could stop her from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices was a rare instance where she has directly engaged her Republican rival in the 2016 race for the White House.Aides say Clinton's strategy is simple: let Trump be Trump.Trump has suffered a series of missteps over the past two weeks that go beyond his remarks on gun rights activists, which he later accused the media of deliberately misinterpreting.He has tangled with party leaders, clashed with the parents of a fallen Muslim American Army captain and this week accused Clinton, a former secretary of state, and President Barack Obama of ""founding"" the Islamic State militant group. On Friday, he said he was just being sarcastic when he made that remark. ""There is an adage in politics:  Don't get in the way of a train wreck,"" said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, a top campaign aide to presidential candidates Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004.Clinton's advisers say they see little benefit in her going toe-to-toe with Trump over every personal accusation, generating sound bites that would dominate cable news broadcasts. Rather, they are happy for him to be embroiled in controversy while Clinton focuses on policy.
Trump's campaign declined to comment for this story, but the New York real estate developer has accused the national media of bias toward Clinton. He re-posted a supporter's Tweet on Friday that said the ""corrupt media"" was deliberately exaggerating his remarks to favor his Democratic opponent. Trump has slipped in opinion polls, and worried Republican Party leaders have urged him to stop making off-the-cuff inflammatory statements that generate blanket, often negative, media coverage and distract from efforts to highlight what they see as Clinton's many shortcomings.SUCKING OUT THE OXYGEN

""He's sucking all the oxygen out of the room to his own detriment,"" said Republican strategist and Trump supporter Ford O'Connell. It's not enough to dominate media coverage, he needs to ""win"" it, O'Connell said.Trump has boasted that the news coverage he generates means he does not have to spend as much on campaign ads, but political veterans say he is squandering the attention and missing opportunities to win over undecided voters.For example, Trump gave an economic speech on Monday that was meant to help his campaign regain momentum, but it was quickly eclipsed by the fallout over his remarks on gun rights activists.Clinton, meanwhile, has been busy courting local media in must-win states. Her national press pool, which seldom gets to question the candidate, often waits as she conducts interviews with local news outlets.
She has granted few recent interviews to national outlets and rarely holds press conferences, a strategy her critics say is calculated to avoid questions about her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state, and the relationship between her family's global charity, the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department.Clinton, who has said she is one of the most transparent presidential candidates in history, has acknowledged her use of the private email server was a mistake but said she properly handled all classified information. She has denied any improper links between the foundation and the State Department.In interviews with local outlets, Clinton is more likely to face questions about job creation, public health and raising wages - all parts of her platform that she is keen to discuss.In Florida, a crucial battleground state, Republican lobbyist Gus Corbella says the contrast between the local coverage of Clinton's campaign stops there and Trump's events has been stark.""Clinton's campaign seems to have the more disciplined approach,"" Corbella said. ""The rollout that day is on a specific event she's attending, a message she's trying to deliver. Whereas on the Trump side, it's what crazy thing did he say today and the response to that.""After Clinton's visit last week to a tie maker in Colorado, the lead story on the front page of the Denver Post was ""Clinton pledges millions of jobs."" Trump also featured on the front page, but in a smaller story about ""damage control"" in his troubled campaign.

By Rory Carroll
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO A California lawmaker next week will introduce a bill requiring 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be emissions-free by 2025, her spokeswoman said on Friday.Assemblywoman Autumn Burke says the legislation is needed to ensure that California's current zero emissions vehicle target is met with actual vehicles and not just clean car credits, which environmentalists claim have flooded the market. ""Governor (Jerry) Brown has set an ambitious goal of 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, but unless we take action, the state won't come close to meeting this goal,"" said Burke, who represents the city of Inglewood in car-centric Los Angeles county. ""That's why we need to reform the rules to require that 15 percent of all cars sold in California have zero emissions by 2025. This is about clean cars, not credits,"" she said in a statement to Reuters.
The bill will require the California Air Resources Board to adopt a regulation by the end of next year to reach the 15 percent goal. CARB has for years operated a zero emission vehicles program, which has helped the state achieve its current level of about 200,000 ZEVs on the road.
But a complex system of clean car credits, designed to give automakers flexibility in meeting the sales target, has led to a glut of credits, according to experts. Environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors told CARB at a recent meeting that auto companies may be able to reach the state's target by simply submitting credits, and said changes to the program's credit system are required.
About 4 percent of vehicles sold in California are zero emissions vehicles, which include full battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and plug-in hybrids. The NRDC estimates that under the current rules and credit system, California would  have only 6 percent of all vehicles emission-free by 2025.

By Maurice Tamman
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton led Republican Donald Trump by more than 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday, little changed in weeks as the U.S. presidential campaign wobbles into the heart of summer.Since July 28, Clinton's daily support among likely voters in the poll has hovered between a low of 41 and a high of 44 percentage points. She was at 41 percentage points on Thursday, down slightly this week.Trump's support has moved slightly more, ranging from a low of 33 percentage points to a high of 39 points. He was at 36 points on Thursday, up slightly this week.Among registered voters, Clinton was ahead by 9 points on Thursday, 42 to 33.
At this point in the 2012 election, both President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney had solidified their support, and Romney held a 45 percent to 41 percent lead, with only 14 percent of likely voters not picking one of the two candidates.Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, has been mired in controversies in recent days, and many establishment Republicans have begun to distance themselves from his campaign.He drew heavy criticism for suggesting gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was meant to rally votes against her. On Thursday he repeatedly accused Clinton and Obama of being co-founders of the Islamic State militant group. On Friday he said the remarks were meant to be sarcasm.
On Thursday, the number of likely voters who were not picking either Clinton or Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election was 22 percent. That number has remained stubbornly in the 20- to 25-point range for weeks.Despite that, neither of the alternative candidates is gaining traction. In a four-way race, Libertarian Gary Johnson saw his support dip slightly to 7 percentage points on Thursday, down from a high of nearly 9 points earlier this week.
Green Party nominee Jill Stein was at about 3 points on Thursday, largely unchanged.The results on Thursday were taken from a sample of 1,446 registered voters and 1,116 likely voters surveyed between Aug. 7 and Aug. 11. The results have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Howard Goller)"	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Mark Hosenball and John Walcott
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. intelligence officials told top congressional leaders a year ago that Russian hackers were attacking the Democratic Party, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, but the lawmakers were unable to tell the targets about the hacking because the information was so secret.The disclosure of the Top Secret information would have revealed that U.S. intelligence agencies were continuing to monitor the hacking, as well as the sensitive intelligence sources and the methods they were using to do it.The material was marked with additional restrictions and assigned a unique codeword, limiting access to a small number of officials who needed to know that U.S. spy agencies had concluded that two Russian intelligence agencies or their proxies were targeting the Democratic National Committee, the central organizing body of the Democratic Party.The National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies sometimes delay informing targets of foreign intelligence activities under similar circumstances, officials have said.The alleged hacking of the Democrats and the Russian connection did not become public until late last month when the FBI said it was investigating a cyber attack at the DNC. The DNC did not respond to a request for comment for this story.The congressional briefing was given last summer in a secure room called a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, to a group of congressional leaders informally known as the ""Gang of Eight,"" the sources said.The group at the time included four Republicans: Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, and Senator Richard Burr and Representative Devin Nunes, the House and Senate intelligence committee chairs. Their Democratic counterparts were: Senator Harry Reid and Representative Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff of the intelligence committees.
AshLee Strong, press secretary for the current House Speaker, Paul Ryan, declined to comment, and Pelosi's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Pelosi on Thursday called the hacking an ""electronic Watergate"" and said the Russians were behind it.""SPEARPHISHING""
DNC officials have said they did not learn about the hacking until months after the initial congressional briefing, when an agent from an FBI cybersecurity squad asked them last fall about the party's data security arrangements.
Even then, the Democratic sources said, the FBI agent never mentioned that U.S. intelligence officials suspected that Russian hackers were targeting the organization.The attack on the DNC later led the hackers to other party organizations, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises funds for House candidates, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and other groups.A DCCC spokeswoman declined to comment.
The hackers initially used ""spearphishing"" - attacks on the private email accounts of dozens of people working for the organizations, several sources said.One of the sources said the Clinton campaign first detected attacks on its data system in early March, and was given what the source described as a ""general briefing"" about it by the FBI later that month. The source said the FBI made no mention of a Russian connection in that briefing and did not say when the penetration first took place. According to a memo obtained by Reuters, interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile said on Thursday she was creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board ""to ensure prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNC's cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class.""(This version of the story corrects seventh paragraph to show that John Boehner was House speaker at time of briefing) (Reporting by Mark Hosenball and John Walcott; Additional reporting by Julia Harte; Editing by Ross Colvin)"	['Reid', 'Clinton', 'Schiff', 'McConnell', 'Feinstein', 'Burr', 'Paul', 'Pelosi', 'Ross']	[]

By Steve Holland
| ORLANDO, Fla.

ORLANDO, Fla. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign team is to meet officials from the Republican National Committee on Friday in what both groups described as a routine session to discuss joint operations in Florida.Trump, who is lagging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in opinion polls, was not expected to attend the Orlando gathering after staging a rally near there on Thursday. He is to hold separate events on Friday in Erie and Altoona, Pennsylvania.The New York businessman is struggling to get past a rough several days, when he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her.In recent weeks, a steady stream of moderate Republicans, such as U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine,  have vowed not to support Trump, while 50 Republican national security experts signed a letter opposing him.
Many Republicans not only worry about failing to win the White House, but also are alarmed that their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives could be at risk.Trump has blamed the U.S. news media for taking many of his comments out of context, and on Thursday night, some of his supporters heckled and cursed reporters who covered the rally in a large arena in Kissimmee.
On Friday, Trump passed off as sarcasm the assertion he made repeatedly this week that President Barack Obama and Clinton were ""co-founders"" of Islamic State and its Most Valuable Players.""Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) 'the founder' of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?"" Trump said in a tweet.
It was the second time in recent weeks that Trump has explained a controversial statement as sarcastic. In late July, he invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time as U.S. secretary of state, which raised concerns among intelligence experts that he was urging a foreign government to spy on Americans.He said later he was being sarcastic.

6	6	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN10M146	Trump calls Obama, Clinton Islamic State 'co-founders,' draws rebuke	"


By Ginger Gibson and Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON/MIAMI BEACH, Fla.

WASHINGTON/MIAMI BEACH, Fla. Republican Donald Trump called President Barack Obama and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton the ""co-founders"" of Islamic State, ratcheting up his assertion that they are responsible for the rise of the militant group and sparking renewed criticism of his leadership ability.Clinton's White House campaign on Thursday called the remarks a ""false claim,"" in Clinton's latest response to a series of attacks by Trump in which he has sought to portray America as less safe, blaming Democrats and depicting himself as the only one who can restore security.Democrats, in turn, have used Trump's often hyperbolic statements ahead of the Nov. 8 election to argue that he is unfit to be president and lacks the temperament to be trusted with matters of national security.""This is another example of Donald Trump trash-talking the United States,"" Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement.""What's remarkable about Trump's comments is that once again he's echoing the talking points of Putin and our adversaries to attack American leaders and American interests, while failing to offer any serious plans to confront terrorism or make this country more secure,"" Sullivan said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.For Republicans uncertain about whether Trump has the discipline to maintain focus for his campaign, the latest comments were concerning. Many see the New York real estate mogul as spending too much time fighting within his own party and have called on him to refocus his campaign message on Clinton. ""ISIS is a solid GOP message to show contrast with Hillary Clinton and the failures of the Obama-Clinton administration,"" said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist who remains undecided about the nominee, using acronyms for Islamic State and the Republican Party. Even so, she added, ""Trump should have simply said that the Obama administration's decision to pull all troops out of Iraq, with no stay-behind agreement, created a vacuum and allowed ISIS to metastasize. It's absurd for him to say that Obama and Clinton are founders of ISIS  - and he can't blame the media for this.""A group of about 70 Republicans, including five former members of Congress, called on the Republican National Committee to stop helping Trump in the wake of his recent remarks and instead focus on getting members of Congress re-elected.""Trump's divisive and dangerous actions are not only a threat to our other candidates, but to our party and the nation,"" the letter stated.In response, Trump said he would stop raising money for the Republican Party if it ends its help for his campaign.""If they want to do that they can save me a lot of time and a lot of energy,"" he told Fox News. ""I'm the one raising the money for them.""
Some Republicans see a small silver lining in Trump talking more about Clinton.""It is helpful - at least to the rest of the ticket - that he is focusing a little more on Clinton than on other Republicans, whether defeated primary opponents or other elected officials who are on the ballot, for a change,"" said former New Hampshire Republican Chairman Fergus Cullen, who is not supporting Trump. ""But tomorrow, or later today, he could blame (Republican Senator) Jeff Flake for A-Rod's retirement,"" Cullen said, referring to Yankees player Alex Rodriguez's decision to leave professional baseball. ""I have zero confidence in Trump's ability to stay on one message or to drive one message for any length of time longer than about 10 seconds.""    CRITICISM OF IRAQ WAR
Trump has previously criticized Clinton for supporting the Iraq War in 2003 while she was a U.S. senator. Trump frequently says, to contrast himself with Clinton, that he opposed the war - but in interviews before the invasion he did voice support.
Now, Trump is arguing that in trying to end the war and withdrawing U.S. troops in 2011, Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, and Obama created Islamic State. Republicans frequently trace the birth of Islamic State to the Obama administration's decision to withdraw the last U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011. But many analysts argue its roots lie in the decision of George W. Bush's Republican administration to invade Iraq in 2003 without a plan to fill the vacuum created by Saddam Hussein's ouster. It was Bush's administration, not Obama's, that negotiated the 2009 agreement that called for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011.Clinton posted on Twitter that Trump's comments are disqualifying.""Anyone willing to sink so low, so often should never be allowed to serve as our commander-in-chief,"" she wrote.The White House declined to comment on Trump's claim.
Appearing in Miami Beach, Florida, on Thursday morning, Trump repeated his attack for the third time, saying the U.S. government ""has unleashed ISIS."" ""In fact, I think we'll give Hillary Clinton ... most valuable player,"" Trump said. ""ISIS will hand her the most valuable player award. Her only competition is President Barack Obama.""    Trump first made the assertion in a speech on Wednesday night in Florida, saying, ""I call them co-founders"" of Islamic State. In an interview on Thursday morning, Trump defended the remarks.""Is there something wrong with saying that?"" Trump told CNBC. ""Why - are people complaining that I said he was the founder of ISIS? All I do is tell the truth, I'm a truth teller.""Trump was also asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt if he ""meant that (Obama) created the vacuum, he lost the peace.""""No,"" Trump responded. ""I meant he's the founder of ISIS. I do."" The Democratic National Committee lambasted Trump's remarks. ""Donald Trump should apologize for his outrageous, unhinged and patently false suggestions on the founding of ISIS,"" the DNC said in a statement. ""This is yet another out of control statement by a candidate who is unraveling before our very eyes."" Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Trump on CNN, saying his remarks were ""legitimate political commentary.""

By Jonathan Allen
| WARREN, Mich.

WARREN, Mich. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday said rival Donald Trump had no real plans to help middle-class families, arguing that his agenda of tax cuts and tough trade talk would throw the economy into recession.""He's offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today,"" Clinton said in Warren, Michigan, shortly after touring Futuramic, a hangar-like, high-tech factory that makes parts for the aerospace industry.Clinton said Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, would scrap regulations meant to hold corporations accountable, cut taxes on ""millionaires and Wall Street money managers,"" and eliminate the estate tax, an inheritance tax that generally hits the wealthy.Clinton offered no new proposals of her own but sought to cast doubt on the image Trump promotes of himself as the voice for working people. The New York businessman is counting on his appeal to blue-collar voters with concerns about global trade to boost his chances in key states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio.
Clinton on Thursday ran through many of the policies she has outlined over the last year to contrast herself with Trump, who has given far fewer details about his plans, as the presidential campaign heads toward the Nov. 8 election.Speaking to Fox News later on Thursday, Trump said he would cut business taxes to bring jobs back to the United States, while Clinton would have to double taxes to meet the increased spending on social programs in her plan.Trump delivered an economic speech in Detroit on Monday. He publicly named his economic advisers last week, which Clinton mocked as ""six guys named Steve."" On Thursday, he released a list of nine additions to the council, eight of whom were women. New members included roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks, investor Carla Sands and hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci.
Workers' anxiety over trade deals has become a central theme in the 2016 election, and Clinton rejected the portrait Trump has painted that she only pretends not to favor the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal she praised when she was secretary of state from 2009-2013 but has more recently opposed.Clinton also says she would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by former President Bill Clinton, her husband. Trump routinely disparages the agreement as bad for American jobs. 
""It's true that too often past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that didn't pan out,"" Clinton told the crowd of factory workers. ""The answer is not to rant and rave, or cut ourselves off from the world.""The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us,"" she said. ""So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.""

A former North Carolina staffer is suing Donald Trump's presidential campaign, saying a top employee in the state working on the Republican's White House bid once pulled a gun on him and that after he reported it, the campaign took no action.Vincent Bordini, who said he was hired in December 2015 as a software trainer, said Earl Phillip, then Trump's North Carolina state director, pointed a pistol at his kneecap while the two were in a car together in February, according to a lawsuit dated Wednesday and filed in state court.Bordini said he reported the incident to several Trump campaign officials, including then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, with no result, according to the lawsuit, which was posted online by the New York Daily News. The lawsuit names Phillip and the Trump campaign as defendants.""Vincent was a passionate Donald J. Trump supporter,"" the lawsuit said. ""He had faith that the Trump campaign would handle the situation internally. But as time went on it became apparent  that this not going to happen.""
William Harding, a Charlotte-based lawyer for Phillip, called the allegations ""preposterous"" and said if Bordini's claims were true, there would have been criminal action.""If someone brandished a weapon on me or assaults me, I'm going to go to the appropriate law enforcement officer,"" Harding said. Phillip was replaced earlier this month as state director and moved to a diversity coalition for Trump. On Thursday, he resigned from the campaign, Harding said.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Bordini also did not immediately respond.
The lawsuit said the gun incident occurred during a trip to South Carolina ahead of that state's primary. Bordini said four other people had similar interactions with Phillip, but the campaign did nothing in response, the lawsuit said.

By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A foreign policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump confirmed his attendance at a meeting last month during which the Republican Party agreed to watered-down language in its support of Ukraine.J. D. Gordon, the adviser who previously served as a Pentagon spokesman, said that while he was present during the meeting at the Republican National Convention, he sat at a side table with staff and was not among the delegates charged with shaping the Ukraine platform.But one delegate in attendance, Diana Denman, said Gordon told her he was going to speak with Trump during the debate over the platform's language on Ukraine, saying she believed Trump's campaign played a direct role in softening the party's support for Ukraine at a time of heightened tensions with Russia.The Trump campaign has denied it played any role in the weakening of the party's position regarding Ukraine. Gordon called Denman's version of events ""inaccurate."" Stephen Yates, co-chair of the national security subcommittee, confirmed that Trump campaign members were present at the meeting where Ukraine language for the RNC platform was discussed. But he said only delegates participated in the debate and denied the Trump campaign played any role in softening the Ukraine language.
The details of the meeting in Cleveland have attracted scrutiny and raised questions about the Trump campaign's stance toward Russia.Trump has said he would seek to build a closer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, praising him as a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama. In the last month, Trump has also suggested he might not defend NATO allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite Russia to hack the emails of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and suggested he might accept Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
Denman, a member of the platform committee's national security subcommittee, said she proposed language that supported ""providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine's armed forces and greater coordination with NATO on defense planning."" That phrase was eventually changed to remove the reference to ""lethal defensive weapons.""In the end, the platform, which serves as a largely symbolic statement of the party's priorities, criticizes the Obama administration for encouraging a ""resurgent Russia"" and supports continued sanctions on Moscow and ""appropriate assistance to the armed forces of the Ukraine"" without specifying what that would involve.Yates said Denman could have reintroduced the amendment in the full committee meeting if she felt strong-armed in subcommittee. ""I don't have particular sympathy for delegates who chose not to avail themselves of the opportunity in full committee, and then start spinning yarn about how this came about,"" he said.
Denman said she stands by her account.Russia on Thursday announced it would conduct war games in the Black Sea, a day after Putin accused Ukraine of trying to provoke a conflict over Crimea. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Black', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
