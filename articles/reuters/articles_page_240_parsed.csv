LONDON Presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Britain leaving the European Union would make no difference to a potential bilateral trade deal if he became president, according to an interview clip aired by broadcaster ITV on Sunday.During a visit to London last month President Barack Obama told Britons that if they elected to leave the EU in a June 23 referendum they would be at ""the back of the queue"" for a U.S. trade deal.
""I am going to treat everybody fairly but it wouldn't make any difference to me whether they were in the EU or not,"" Trump said in an interview with Piers Morgan, due to be aired in full on ITV on Monday. ""You would certainly not be back of the queue, that I can tell you.""

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will meet this week with prominent conservatives in the media, a spokesman said on Sunday, to address allegations of political bias at the popular social networking site.Some 12 ""conservative thought leaders"" will join the meeting with Zuckerberg on Wednesday, a Facebook spokesman said. Among the invitees are media personality Glenn Beck, Fox News Channel's ""The Five"" co-host Dana Perino and Zac Moffatt, co-founder of Targeted Victory, a technology company that aims to bring transparency to media buying.Facebook came under fire last week when an unnamed former employee told technology news website Gizmodo that workers often omitted conservative political stories from the company's ""trending"" list of topics.Zuckerberg said Facebook has ""found no evidence that this report is true,"" but would continue to investigate. A U.S. Senate committee has also opened an inquiry into Facebook's practices.
Beck, a former Fox News host, took to Facebook early Sunday to say he is going to the meeting in Menlo Park, California, and  ""it would be interesting to look him (Zuckerberg) in the eye as he explains.""""While they are a private business and I support their right to run it any way they desire without government interference,"" Beck said, ""it would be wonderful if a tool like face book [sic] INDEPENDENTLY CHOSE to hold up Freedom of speech and freedom of association as a corporate principle.""

Interviews with dozens of women who have worked for Donald Trump or interacted with him socially reveal a pattern of often unsettling personal behavior by the Republican presidential candidate, The New York Times reported on Saturday. The Times, which said it based the article on more than 50 interviews, quoted women who recounted episodes in which he treated women as sexual objects and made comments about their bodies. But some women said Trump had encouraged them in their careers and promoted them within his businesses, often in positions in which women tended to be excluded.When asked about the unflattering incidents described in the article, Trump either denied that they took place or disputed the details, the newspaper said.""A lot of things get made up over the years,"" Trump told the Times. ""I have always treated women with great respect.""A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment.Barbara Res, who oversaw construction of Trump's Manhattan business headquarters, said he would sometimes interrupt meetings with comments about women's figures. During a job interview for a Los Angeles project, for example, Trump made a random aside about Southern California women. ""They take care of their asses,"" Res recalled Trump saying.
Years later, when Res says she had gained weight, she said Trump told her: ""You like your candy.""Even so, Res, who worked for Trump for 12 years before quitting and then came back as a consultant for six more, said she was grateful to Trump for her professional opportunities, though she said he frequently called her ""Honey Bunch,"" the Times reported.  Trump also earned a reputation for being seen with beautiful women dating back to his days at a New York military-style boarding school where he was named ""ladies' man"" in the yearbook, the Times reported.  
Barbara Fife, a deputy New York mayor in the 1990s, recalls Trump telling her at her City Hall office that he was in a hurry because he had ""a great date tonight with a model for Victoria's Secret,"" she told the Times.""I saw it as immature, quite honestly,"" Fife was quoted as saying.As a candidate, Trump has made frequent references to his record in business as evidence of how American women would benefit if he is elected. He has often said that no one ""cherishes"" or ""respects"" women more than him.   
    Some of those interviewed praised Trump for giving women positions of power.""I think there are mischaracterizations about him,"" Jill Martin, assistant counsel at the Trump Organization, told the Times. ""For me, he's made it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time necessary for my family.""The story comes less than two weeks after the last of Trump's Republican rivals dropped out, all but assuring him the party's presidential nomination this summer. Throughout his improbable campaign, Trump has managed to deflect criticism about his attitude to women, fueled by verbal insults he lobbed at Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina.

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama toasted Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland at a star-studded state dinner on Friday, lauding the nations for their global influence on civil rights, humanitarian issues and curbing climate change.The red carpet glamor followed a White House summit where Obama and the leaders of the five nations presented a united front against Moscow's recent military aggression in Ukraine and the Baltic region.But the meeting was more about soft diplomacy than launching ambitious foreign policy endeavors, given that Obama's second and final term ends in January. Americans will vote in presidential elections on Nov. 8.""I thought this was a very useful and important conversation, although there was probably too much agreement to make for as exciting a multilateral meeting as I sometimes participate in,"" Obama said.More than 300 guests including rapper Common, comedian Will Farrell and actress Tracee Ellis Ross mingled with diplomats, tech and Fortune 500 CEOs, White House officials, and political donors in a glass-ceiling tent built around a tree on the South Lawn.Hand-rolled beeswax candles and strings of lights reflected off ten-foot pillars of ice, an homage to the northern lights.Pop star Demi Lovato, known for her support of liberal causes, was set to perform after a Nordic-inspired meal of ahi tuna, tomato tartare and red wine-braised beef short ribs.
""It's a great opportunity to drink wine and make progress on the most serious issues of our time,"" Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters on her way into the dinner.RUSSIA

The summit was aimed in part at sending a message to a nation not on the guest list: Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and has stepped up its military posture.The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is planning its biggest build-up in eastern Europe since the Cold War to try to deter further Russian aggression, and Denmark and Norway said on Friday they would contribute to the ""enhanced allied forward presence"" with NATO.""We will be maintaining ongoing dialogue and seek cooperation with Russia, but we also want to make sure that we are prepared and strong, and we want to encourage Russia to keep its military activities in full compliance with international obligations,"" Obama said after the summit.Obama has long expressed admiration for the pragmatic and liberal-leaning politics of the Nordic nations.
""There have been times where I've said, why don't we just put all these small countries in charge for a while? And they could clean things up,"" Obama said.(This version of the story corrects the title of Samantha Power in the eighth paragraph) (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Timothy Gardner; Editing by Richard Chang and Richard Borsuk)"	['Ross', 'Obama']	[]

By Megan Cassella
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. Conservatives pushed back against the administration's non-binding guidance to schools, the latest battleground in the issue of rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the guidance ""must be challenged.""""If President Obama thinks he can bully Texas schools into allowing men to have open access to girls in bathrooms, he better prepare for yet another legal fight,""  Paxton, a Tea Party champion, said in a statement.Other Republican-led states joined calls to disregard the White House's directive and accused the administration of overstepping its role. In North Carolina, Governor Pat McCrory labeled the move a ""massive executive branch overreach"" and called on federal courts and the U.S. Congress to intercede, while Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said it was ""offensive, intrusive and totally lacking in common sense.""The U.S. Education and Justice Departments, in a letter, told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity.The guidance contained an implicit threat that school districts defying the Obama administration's interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or be deprived of federal aid.
The White House defended its actions, saying the guidance should not be viewed as a threat but instead as a set of ""specific, tangible, real-world advice and suggestions"" that many schools had sought and will welcome.""That's what we're looking for: solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every single student in school,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing, adding that the idea was to prevent discrimination against a range of groups extending beyond the transgender community.   The directive came as the Justice Department and North Carolina are battling in federal court over a North Carolina state law approved in March that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their gender assigned at birth, while other states weigh similar measures.North Carolina's law was the first to ban people from restrooms in public buildings and schools not matching the sex on their birth certificate. Mississippi has enacted legislation similarly viewed as discriminatory by civil and gay rights groups, and Tennessee and Missouri considered similar measures.
The letter to the schools from Washington said that, to get federal funding under existing rules, a school has to agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. That includes not treating a transgender student differently from other students of the same gender identity, officials said.The American Civil Liberties Union said the guidance would help make students ""free to bring their whole selves to school.""In a sign of what defiant states may face, the Justice Department this week asked a U.S. District Court in North Carolina to declare the state in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban.
Americans are divided over which public restrooms should be used by transgender people, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify.A group representing U.S. school boards called the guidance ""unsettled law.""""A dispute about the intent of the federal law must ultimately be resolved by the courts and the Congress,"" the National School Boards Association said in a statement. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was less critical than many of his party in several television interviews, saying the issue should be left up to individual states. ""Everybody has to be protected ... but it's a tiny, tiny portion of the population,"" Trump told Fox News.

By Valerie Volcovici and Emily Flitter
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Donald Trump on Friday picked a prominent climate change skeptic to help him craft his energy policy and pushed back against renewed calls that he release his income tax returns - saying his tax rate is ""none of your business.""The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is seeking to build out his policy proposals as he pivots from campaigning for his party's nomination to a likely general election matchup with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Among those he has asked for help is U.S. Republican Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the country's most ardent oil and gas drilling advocates and climate change skeptics. North Dakota has been at the forefront of the U.S. shale oil and gas boom. Trump's team asked Cramer, who has endorsed Trump, to write a white paper, or detailed report, on his energy policy ideas, according to Cramer and sources familiar with the matter.Cramer said in an interview that his white paper would emphasize the dangers of foreign ownership of U.S. energy assets, as well as what he characterized as burdensome taxes and over-regulation. Trump will have an opportunity to float some of the ideas at an energy summit in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, Cramer said.    The senator was also among a group of Trump advisers who recently met with lawmakers from Western energy states, who hope Trump will open more federal land for drilling, a lawmaker who took part in the meeting said.A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign did not comment.Environmental groups, and Clinton's campaign, quickly attacked Trump for tapping Cramer.""Kevin Cramer has consistently backed reckless and dangerous schemes to put the profits of fossil fuel executives before the health of the public, so he and Trump are a match made in polluter heaven,"" Sierra Club Legislative Director Melinda Pierce said in an emailed statement.The Clinton campaign also criticized the move.    
""Donald Trump's choice of outspoken climate (change) denier Kevin Cramer to advise him on energy policy is just the latest piece of evidence that letting him get near the White House would put our children's health and futures at risk,"" said campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson.Trump has been light on the details of his energy policy, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were president. He has also claimed global warming is a concept ""created by and for the Chinese"" to hurt U.S. business.Clinton, meanwhile, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies ""out of business.""'NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS'

Trump also took heat on Friday for not releasing his tax returns, something that American presidential candidates have done for decades. Clinton and her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both released their returns.Trump has said the Internal Revenue Service was auditing his returns and he wanted to wait until the review was over before making them public. ""It should be, and I hope it's before the election,"" Trump told ABC's ""Good Morning America.""Pressed on what tax rate he pays, Trump refused to say. ""It's none of your business,"" he said. The candidate has said there is nothing voters can learn from his tax filings. Tax filings show sources of income, both from within the United States and other countries, as well as charitable giving, investments, deductions and other financial information.The IRS declined to comment on whether Trump or any other presidential candidates were being audited.
However, the Trump campaign earlier this year released a letter from his attorneys saying his personal tax returns have been under ""continuous examination"" from the IRS.This week, Clinton began calling on her probable Republican rival to release his returns. Last August, the former U.S. secretary of state posted the past eight years of tax returns for her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, on her website. Sanders released his 2014 return in April. Presidential candidates have a long history in the modern era of releasing their tax returns.""In 1976, Gerald Ford did not release his returns, but he did release some information about his taxes,"" said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that provides tax news and analysis.""That was the last time that a major party nominee hasn't done it,"" he said.

8	8	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-fundraising-rally-idUSKCN0Y42KI	First $200 admission for a Trump rally; more to come?	"


By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The email Donald Trump's campaign sent inviting fans to a rally next week looked familiar: ""Meet me in New Jersey!"" it urged. But something was different.""You will need to buy a ticket to get into the rally,"" it added. The cost: $200.During the months-long battle for the Republican presidential nomination, rallies staged by Trump, the party's likely candidate in the Nov. 8 election, were free and open to anyone with the stamina to withstand half a day's wait outside and a heady hour packed into a sports stadium or warehouse. Supporters could buy snacks or hats or T-shirts while they waited, but they never had to pay for admission.The May 19 rally advertised in the email is a fundraiser for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival now working for Trump who, according to news reports, needs to retire debt from his own failed campaign. The emailed invitation to supporters said it will be a fundraiser. It was not clear whether Trump will charge for rallies that are not specifically designated as fundraisers. 
The New York billionaire has claimed he was self-funding his campaign and did not need donations. He has financed his offensive in the nominating phase of the race for the White House with loans to himself as well as around $12 million in unsolicited donations from fans.Now that Trump is pivoting toward the general election, where conventional estimates put the cost of winning at around $1 billion, things are changing. The move to charge admission for some appearances was just one harbinger of a new relationship between Trump and his fans, many of whom cited their perception of his financial independence as a major factor behind their support. It will test the loyalty of those who have swelled his rallies to capacity, either transforming huge crowds into cash cows or creating more breathing room in the places where he appears.     
When asked whether the format of the Christie fundraiser rally would be repeated in the future, Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not comment. ""This is a fundraiser for Governor Christie,"" she said.Supporters have said Trump's about-face on fundraising does not bother them.
Susan Kihne, a Mandan, North Dakota resident who snagged a ticket to see Trump speak at a petroleum conference later this month decided the $30 it cost her was worth it.""He's self-funded up until now, so I don't mind supporting him,"" she said.
