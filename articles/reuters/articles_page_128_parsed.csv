By Mark Hosenball and Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Leading Democrats are growing increasingly worried that the hackers who made public leaked documents this week were trying  to sabotage the Democratic candidates in several central Florida congressional races, the first time such leaks have been targeted so directly.Two sources familiar with Democratic Party investigations of  recent cyber attacks said documents made public this week by the hacker known as Guccifer2 contained information that could damage Democratic candidates in competitive Florida contests for the U.S. House of Representatives.The documents, hacked from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which raises funds for the party's House candidates, are detailed dossiers describing the Florida candidates' backgrounds, including personal details, as well as political, economic and demographic profiles of the strategic congressional districts.
Since 1996, the parties winning the counties in the Interstate 4 corridor between Orlando and Tampa, where several of the targeted districts are located, have won the presidency.Many of the state's moderate swing voters live in the I-4 corridor, and if Republican voters there turn out in force, it could cut into the vote for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.The DCCC was one of several Democratic Party organizations, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, that have been hacked, but the Democratic Party sources said they did not know who might have helped the hackers select the Florida races to target, or what the hackers were trying to accomplish.
There is, though, a growing pattern of attacks on the data systems of U.S. political organizations by hackers whom U.S. intelligence officials and private cyber security firms have concluded are working for or with Russian intelligence agencies. 
Donald Trump's presidential campaign has hired consultants CrowdStrike to bolster its data security. But two people familiar with attempts to breach the campaign and other Republican organizations said that so far there was no indication of a penetration as serious as those of the Democratic organizations, and CrowdStrike is not investigating any successful hacking of Trump campaign data.

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton does not need to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit brought by a conservative watchdog group over her use of an unauthorized private email system while she was U.S. secretary of state, a judge ruled on Friday.Clinton must instead respond in writing within 30 days to questions submitted by Judicial Watch, a group that has long been critical of her conduct and which is suing the Department of State over Clinton-era records.Judge Emmet Sullivan's ruling in U.S. District Court in Washington is likely to be a relief to Democrats, who did not welcome the prospect of Clinton having to submit to hours of questioning by lawyers in the middle of her campaign for the Nov. 8 election against Republican Party candidate Donald Trump. Clinton, who served as the country's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, has apologized for her decision to use the unorthodox email set-up, which had the effect of shielding her communications from public-records laws until the arrangement came to light last year.Voters have said in opinion polls that the email server issue contributes to impressions that Clinton is untrustworthy. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded last month there were no grounds to prosecute Clinton for the arrangement following a year-long investigation.
Sullivan has allowed Judicial Watch to obtain sworn testimony in sometimes testy exchanges with several Clinton aides in recent months, saying the court needs to establish whether the server was set up to thwart the Freedom of Information Act. But the judge agreed with Clinton's lawyers that former high-ranking government officials can be ordered to give sworn testimony only in ""exceptional circumstances.""
Sullivan also allowed Judicial Watch to get sworn testimony from a former State Department official named John Bentel. According to a scathing report by the State Department's inspector general, Bentel, then a technology official in Clinton's office, told junior staffers to never speak of Clinton's email server again after they raised concerns. Bentel and his lawyer have declined to comment on the episode.A spokesman for Clinton could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.
Judicial Watch said it was happy with the ruling.""We will move quickly to get these answers,"" Tom Fitton, the group's president, said in a statement. ""The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law.""

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The largest program of the Clinton Foundation, the family philanthropy of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is still weighing whether to continue accepting foreign donations should Clinton be elected, a spokeswoman said on Friday.It was reported on Thursday that the Clinton Foundation would no longer receive donations from foreigners or corporations if Clinton wins the election in November, an effort to defuse criticism that donors to the globe-straddling charity might inappropriately seek White House favors in return.But representatives of the charities confirmed on Friday that the new guidelines would only apply to a small portion of the foundation's activities, including its work on climate change and some of its work on economic development.The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the foundation's flagship project credited with reducing the cost of life-saving HIV medicines in the developing world, is yet to decide if it will similarly introduce new limits on donors.""CHAI is a separate legal entity from the Clinton Foundation with its own Board,"" Regan Lachapelle, a CHAI spokeswoman, said in an email. ""The CHAI Board will be meeting soon to determine its next steps."" 
CHAI accounts for nearly 60 percent of the $250 million the foundation spent in 2014, according to the foundation's most recent annual report posted on its website. CHAI files separate tax returns from the Clinton Foundation, but is included in the foundation's audited expenses, annual reports and other promotional literature.Similarly, a Canadian offshoot of the foundation, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada), or CGEP, will not be bound by the foundation's donor limits, but said it will instead become an ""independent entity"" if Hillary Clinton becomes president.CGEP, which says Canadian law prevents it from disclosing its donors' names without their permission, was founded by Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president, and Canadian businessman Frank Giustra in 2007 to improve work opportunities for people in poor countries. 
""If Secretary Clinton wins the election, we plan to spin CGEP into an independent entity to continue this important work,"" Giustra said in a statement. ""President Clinton and I believe it is important that we continue the work of alleviating poverty around the world."" The statement did not specify Bill Clinton's future role.A spokesman for Clinton's campaign declined to answer questions about the foundation. The charities have received praise from public health experts for their work alleviating the spread of HIV, and Clinton's campaign has said any donor expecting political favors in return would be misguided.
The family renamed their foundation the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013, although Hillary Clinton stepped down from her board position last year after announcing her presidential bid. Her husband and daughter remain board members.In 2008, Hillary Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family's charities in order to become President Barack Obama's secretary of state. She promised that her family's charities would name all their donors on an annual basis and seek clearance from the U.S. State Department before accepting new donations from foreign government money. Last year, the charities said they did not comply with these promises, blaming ""oversights.""On Tuesday, the Boston Globe said in an editorial that the foundation should shut down. ""Even if they've done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort,"" the editorial board wrote.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday.The Aug. 14-18 survey showed 42 percent of Americans supported Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. That compares with 34 percent support for Trump. Another 23 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate. Clinton has led Trump in the poll throughout most of the 2016 campaign, and has maintained her advantage following last month's Republican and Democratic conventions. Since late July, support for the former secretary of state has ranged between 41 percent and 44 percent of likely voters, while Trump's support has varied between 33 percent and 39 percent.The race was tighter at this point in the 2012 election, with Democratic President Barack Obama ahead of Republican nominee Mitt Romney by less than 2 percentage points.    
Clinton also led a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked people to choose between Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Some 41 percent supported Clinton and 34 percent supported Trump. Among alternative-party candidates, Johnson came in third with 7 percent and about 2 percent supported Stein. Clinton and Trump have both struggled to inspire American voters this year. According to the poll, neither candidate is regarded favorably by most Americans, and two-thirds of U.S. adults believe the country is on the wrong track. 
Clinton continues to face questions about her handling of classified emails while serving as Obama's secretary of state, while Trump's off-the-cuff remarks about immigrants, women and Muslims have rankled members of his own party.Republican leaders, including former members of Congress, have called for the Republican National Committee to stop helping Trump and refocus its resources on helping candidates win down-ballot races for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Earlier this week, Trump reshuffled his campaign leadership while his campaign chief, Paul Manafort, faced increased scrutiny over his work with pro-Russian political groups in the Ukraine. Manafort resigned on Friday.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It surveyed samples of 1,119 and 1,118 likely voters, respectively, and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Romney', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Tom Polansek
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Advisers to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to U.S. agricultural groups that he will give growers and states a say on national farm policy should he be elected, two association leaders said on Friday.Eleven groups representing farmers, seed companies and other players in the sector met for the first time with Trump's top agricultural advisers in Washington on Monday to make recommendations on policy, following a similar meeting with representatives of rival Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in June.The presidential candidates' agriculture policies are crucial, agricultural groups say, because net U.S. farm income this year is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. If that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013.For Trump's team, the meeting came as he has tried to be more disciplined and on message as he seeks to reset his campaign against Clinton for the Nov. 8 election. He reshuffled top campaign leaders this week, and on Friday accepted the resignation of campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Agricultural trade, labor, crop insurance and food safety were among the topics discussed at the meeting with farm groups, which included Charles Herbster, national chairman of Trump's agricultural advisory committee, and Sam Clovis, Trump's chief policy advisor, participants told Reuters.
Former Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman, who is on Trump's advisory committee, also attended, they said.""There was an assertion that farmers will be at the tables to make decisions, and that was well received by myself and our colleagues,"" said Barb Glenn, chief executive officer of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. 
Also, there was a focus on ""the concept that the states need to be brought in to work with the federal government,"" she said.Clinton's campaign staff have previously made similar comments to farm groups, said Jay Vroom, chief executive officer of pesticide association CropLife America, who attended meetings with representatives of both candidates.""Both of them are quite interested in understanding where American ag is at,"" he said.
Trump on Tuesday named 64 people to his agricultural advisory committee, including six U.S. governors, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary, and the chairmen of the U.S. House and Senate agriculture committees.The latest RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls puts Clinton 6 percentage points ahead of Trump, at 47.2 percent to 41.7 percent.

NEW YORK An artists' collective took credit for exposing Donald Trump to unflattering scrutiny on Thursday, saying it was responsible for a life-sized nude statue of the Republican presidential candidate that turned up in a New York City park.      Copies of the orange-tinted likeness - featuring a massive belly, small fingers and missing some genital parts - were simultaneously unveiled in downtown Manhattan's Union Square Park and public places in four other U.S. cities.The collective titled the work ""The Emperor Has No Balls.""In New York, the unauthorized installation appeared to surprise passers-by - prompting stares, giggles and shrugs of bemusement from park visitors.Ina Cope, a 58-year-old retiree from the Bronx borough of New York, said she was not expecting to see the Trump statue when she got off the subway to meet a friend for lunch.
""It was crazy: I was coming off the train, minding my own business, and there it was,"" she said, laughing. By early afternoon, workers from New York's Department of Parks and Recreation had taken down the statue.
 Mae Ferguson, a Parks Department spokeswoman, said the statue was removed because the installation of any unapproved structure is illegal in any city park.The activist collective, a group called INDECLINE that includes artists, musicians and filmmakers, claimed ownership of the work, saying in an email that the statues were also placed in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and Cleveland. It said an artist called Ginger helped create the likeness.
""These fleeting installations represent this fleeting nightmare and in the fall, it is our wish to look back and laugh at Donald Trump's failed and delusional quest to obtain the presidency,"" INDECLINE said in a statement.A Trump spokeswoman did not respond immediately to an email with a request for comment.

By Pavel Polityuk
| KIEV

KIEV A Ukrainian lawmaker on Friday divulged more details of what he said were payments made to Donald Trump's campaign chief in the U.S. presidential race by the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich.MP Serhiy Leshchenko said money was allocated for Trump aide Paul Manafort to finance services such as carrying out exit polls at elections, buying computers and conducting research. The largest single payment was $3.5 million. Manafort has denied allegations - first made in the New York Times on Monday - that he received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovich's Party of Regions. Ukrainian anti-corruption investigators have corroborated the existence of what they called a ""black ledger"" of payments made by Yanukovich's party but stressed that they could not establish whether Manafort himself received money.Leshchenko, a member of President Petro Poroshenko's parliamentary faction, called on Ukrainian authorities to send a request for assistance to Washington to investigate Manafort.  
""Manafort didn't work for free in Ukraine, he served the Party of Regions for over 10 years and it is clear that his work was paid,"" Leshchenko told a news conference.""The money was transferred in cash and it is impossible to trace the transactions, but I have no doubt as to the authenticity of these documents,"" he said. 
""If Mr Manafort denies any allegations, I think he has to be interrogated into this case and prove his position that he was not involved,"" Leshchenko added. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign has previously said the allegations were evidence of ""more troubling connections between Donald Trump's team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine"".Trump, a Republican, has spoken favorably in the past of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last month, he invited Russian hackers to find ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time as secretary of state, when she used a private email server to conduct government business, although he later described that call as sarcasm.
In response to the earlier report in the New York Times, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement on Monday. ""I have never received a single 'off-the-books cash payment' as falsely 'reported' by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia,"" he said.Trump overhauled his top political team this week, demoting Manafort, who was brought on as campaign chief in June to professionalize its approach but struggled to get the wealthy businessman to rein in his freewheeling ways.

7	7	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN10T1MB	Trump says he regrets past remarks that 'caused personal pain'	"


By Ginger Gibson
| CHARLOTTE, N.C.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump apologized on Thursday for past remarks that ""may have caused personal pain"" as he sought to refocus his message in the face of falling opinion poll numbers in his first speech since shaking up his campaign team this week.""Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing,"" Trump told a crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.""Trump did not cite any examples of such remarks. The New York businessman has made his ""tough talk"" and brash style a selling point of his campaign for the Nov. 8 election, rarely apologizing in the face of criticism even from within his own party for own party for comments insulting women, Muslims and Mexican immigrants.In his presidential announcement speech last year, he described some Mexican immigrants as ""criminals and rapists."" He recently faced a barrage of criticism for belittling the family of a Muslim American soldier who died in Iraq in 2004, after the soldier's father spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention last month.The campaign for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, quickly dismissed Trump's apology, saying: ""Donald Trump literally started his campaign by insulting people.""We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize,"" the campaign said in a statement. ""But that apology tonight is simply a well-written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive, bullying and divisive comments he regrets -- and changes his tune altogether.""Trailing Clinton in national opinion polls, Trump has tried to reset his campaign, announcing on Wednesday a shake-up of his senior campaign staff for the second time in less than two months. In the past week, he has abandoned his free-wheeling style of campaigning, instead using a teleprompter at every rally.Trump also began adding non-rally events to his campaign schedule, visiting a police lodge on Thursday afternoon and hosting a roundtable on Wednesday morning. Previously, Trump had eschewed such events that historically comprise a significant portion of a candidate's time.
Trump's speech on Thursday night, echoing remarks earlier in the week in Wisconsin, reached out to minority voters and accused Clinton of being dishonest.""So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: She never tells the truth,"" Trump said. ""In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe.""'AUTHENTICITY'

Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, promised on Thursday he would stick to a more disciplined and uplifting message to voters in the final dash to Election Day without crimping his freewheeling style.Conway said the candidate's White House bid could preserve his ""authenticity"" and still move past a long string of controversies to focus on issues.""We would like to take an uplifting, optimistic, policy-centric message directly to the American people,"" Conway told CBS's ""This Morning,"" adding she was confident the former reality television star could stick to a sharper message.Wednesday's campaign reshuffle also brought on Steve Bannon, a combative conservative who headed the Breitbart News website, as chief executive officer, in a move seen as giving Trump a chance to emphasize his unconventional style.
Conway said the more disciplined approach by Trump, who has never held elective office, would not mean jettisoning his more off-the-cuff and unpredictable style.""We're going to make sure Donald Trump is comfortable about being in his own skin - that he doesn't lose that authenticity that you simply can't buy and a pollster can't give you,"" she said on CNN. ""Let him be him, in this sense.""Trump has so far been unable to extend his appeal beyond white middle-class voters who pack his rallies. Conway said her rise to campaign manager showed Trump valued a more policy-driven approach that would appeal to women and independent voters.""The way to speak to women and all Americans is through issues. We've got to get away from this content-free campaign and on to the substance,"" she said.    The campaign will put two ads on the air in five states this week, the first campaign ads Trump has aired in the general election, Conway said. He will also continue a series of policy-focused speeches after giving speeches in the past two weeks on jobs, national security and law and order.""He's going to give these policy speeches,"" she said on CNN. ""You'll see more of those. Next week is immigration week, followed by education week."" (Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Clinton', 'Gibson', 'Trump']	[]

WASHINGTON Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told federal investigators that former Secretary of State Colin Powell suggested she use a personal email account, the New York Times reported late on Thursday.Clinton has for over a year been dogged by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nation's top diplomat.The newspaper said the information came from notes the Federal Bureau of Investigation delivered to Congress on Tuesday, which contained details from a more than three hour interview the agency conducted with Clinton over her private email use.The Times also cited an upcoming book that described a dinner conversation where Powell told Clinton to use her own email except for classified information. The newspaper also reported that Clinton asked Powell in a 2009 email exchange about his use of email while serving under former president George W. Bush.Reuters could not independently verify the report. Representatives for Clinton could not be immediately reached late on Thursday.
Colin Powell's office in a statement said he could not recall the dinner conversation. He did recall describing the system he used to her, but the statement did not say he suggested Clinton do the same. ""He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department,"" the statement said. ""At the time there was no equivalent system within the department."" 
He used a secure department computer to manage classified information, the statement said. Powell has said he had no choice besides using his private account as the department did not have a fully functioning email system of its own when he joined in 2001.
Republicans have repeatedly hammered Clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness.FBI Director James Comey announced last month that no criminal charges would be filed over Clinton's use of private email servers while secretary of state, but rebuked her for ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information.

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-foundation-idUSKCN10T2JW	Clinton Foundation to bar foreign, corporate funding if Hillary Clinton elected president	"

WASHINGTON The Clinton Foundation will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton is elected president and will stop holding the annual Clinton Global Initiative meetings whatever the outcome of the November election, a foundation spokesman said on Thursday.Former President Bill Clinton told staff members on Thursday he would resign from the foundation's board and that it would only accept donations from U.S. citizens and independent charities.The former president also said he would hold the 12th and final Clinton Global Initiative in September. The annual meetings have included current and former heads of state, corporate leaders and celebrities who discussed poverty, healthcare, development and other issues.    Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian confirmed the moves, which were first reported by the Associated Press.
The foundation has come under fire during Hillary Clinton's Democratic presidential campaign, with Republicans charging that donors were rewarded with access to her and her aides as well as her husband while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Other critics have said the foundation's reliance on millions of dollars from foreign governments created conflicts of interest for a would-be U.S. president.
Clinton resigned from the foundation's board after launching her successful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. She will face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, founded in 2001, has raised more than $2 billion for causes that focus on health and environmental issues, mainly in the developing world.
