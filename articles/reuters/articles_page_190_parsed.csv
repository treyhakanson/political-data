LIMA Peru's president-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said amid laughter on Tuesday that his government would sever ties with the United States if Republican Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in November.Kuczynski, a 77-year-old former investment banker who won the Andean country's tight runoff race earlier this month, said he mentioned his worries about a Trump presidency to U.S. President Barack Obama on a congratulatory phone call.Asked by a reporter what would happen to relations with the United States if Trump wins, a laughing Kuczynski said ""we're going to grab a saw and cut them off!""The presumptive Republican nominee in the race to succeed Obama, Trump has sparked criticism across Latin America for his anti-immigrant rhetoric, especially in Mexico where President Enrique Pena Nieto has compared his campaign to the rise of Adolf Hitler.
Trump is a threat to the region ""because he wants to put up a wall between the United States and Latin America and make Mexicans pay for it!"" Kuczynski said in reference to Trump's proposal for stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs across the southern U.S. border.
Peru is a leading global supplier of copper and gold. It also shares the dubious distinction with neighboring Colombia of being one of the world's leading producers of cocaine.Peru and the United States implemented a free trade agreement in 2009 and are both signatories of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Trump has criticized.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton's lead over Republican rival Donald Trump has slipped by about five percentage points since mid-June, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, bringing the race for the White House to within nine points. The poll showed that 44.5 percent of likely voters supported former secretary of state Clinton while 35.5 percent backed businessman Trump. That compares with 46.6 percent support for Clinton and 32.3 percent for Trump on June 12, a date that marked her widest lead for the month.Trump has focused much of his energy in recent days on the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida by a U.S.-born gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State militant group. Trump vowed to ban people from entering the United States from countries with links to terrorism against America or its allies.
Hardline national security proposals have help Trump win increased support from voters in the past, including after the shootings in San Bernardino, California and Paris late last year.
Clinton responded to the Orlando attack by calling for increased intelligence gathering and air strikes on Islamic State forces, while warning against demonizing American Muslims. She has also criticized Trump's positions on foreign policy and the economy, saying a Trump presidency would be a ""disaster"". The June 17-21 poll of 1,100 likely voters has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points.

LOS ANGELES Former California Senator Ron Calderon pleaded guilty in a federal court on Tuesday to a single count of mail fraud, ending a public corruption case in which he admitted to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes, prosecutors said.Calderon, a Democrat from the Los Angeles suburb of Montebello, left office in 2014 after serving a dozen years in the state Senate and four years in the Assembly.Sentencing is set for Sept. 19. The 58-year-old former politician reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors last week, several weeks before he was scheduled to go on trial on charges contained in a 24-count indictment.His mail fraud offense carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, but prosecutors agreed under the terms of Calderon's plea deal to seek a sentence of no more than 70 months, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement.Once an influential figure in the California Legislature, Calderon was one of three Democrats in the state Senate  suspended over ethics charges in 2014, costing their party a cherished two-thirds Senate majority during an election year.
According to his indictment, Calderon accepted $100,000 in bribes from the owner of a Long Beach hospital to preserve a loophole in the law that allowed companies controlled by the owner to charge more for hardware used in spinal surgeries.Calderon also was accused of taking bribes from undercover FBI agents posing as Hollywood movie executives in exchange for steering legislation in their favor. 
His older brother, Tom Calderon, 62, a former member of the California state Assembly who became a political consultant, also was named in the indictment.He pleaded guilty last Monday to a federal money-laundering charge for allowing bribes earmarked for his brother to be funneled through his firm, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence of no more than a year in prison for the elder Calderon brother.     (Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"	['Long']	[]

By Timothy Gardner and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. senators pushed for a compromise gun control bill on Tuesday, a day after the Senate failed to advance four gun measures following last week's mass shooting in Orlando, the deadliest in modern U.S. history.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would schedule a vote on a bill by fellow Republican Senator Susan Collins that would prevent about 109,000 people on ""no-fly"" and other surveillance lists from purchasing guns. Collins said she expected a vote on the bill this week or next.On Monday, the Senate defeated a Democratic prohibition on gun sales to people on a broader range of government watch lists, while also blocking a narrower Republican measure. Some senior Republicans would not commit to supporting the Collins bill, citing worries about people being denied the ability to buy weapons without adequate safeguards.But the No. 3 Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, told reporters: ""There may be a glimmer of hope now,"" adding that Collins' proposal seemed to be ""a step in the right direction.""The measure is being debated in the Senate before the Nov. 8 election when Democrats hope to win control of the Senate and gain seats in the House of Representatives. Democrats believe Republican congressional opposition to wider control bills gives them a powerful campaign issue.It was too soon to tell if President Barack Obama would support the Collins bill. Spokesman Josh Earnest said senior officials including lawyers at the Department of Justice were taking a look at it.""If the assessment is that this would enhance the ability of our law enforcement professionals to keep us safe and prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing a gun, then that's likely something that we'll be able to support,"" Earnest told reporters in a daily briefing.  In the Senate on Monday, four measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists - two put forth by Democrats and two by Republicans - fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-member chamber.The votes were a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through Congress despite repeated mass shootings. The bills lost in largely party-line votes that showed the political power in Congress of gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.
'SHAMEFUL DISPLAY'
The White House accused U.S. senators of a ""shameful display of cowardice"" and said they failed the American people by not advancing any gun control measures after the Florida shooting.The gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to Islamic State during the June 12 rampage in which he killed 49 people and wounded 53 at an Orlando gay nightclub before being fatally shot by police.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he had concerns about the Collins measure. ""It's a slippery slope when an American citizen is denied a constitutional right, without forcing the government to come forward with some evidence on the front end"" that a person should be prohibited from buying guns, he said.  
After Monday's votes, the Senate also debated a different tactic for battling domestic attacks that could be inspired by Islamic State and other foreign militant groups.Senators were aiming to vote by Wednesday on legislation by Republican John McCain of Arizona expanding the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ability to conduct secret surveillance in counter terrorism investigations.""This week we'll have the opportunity to strengthen our ability to combat lone wolf terrorists and connect the dots so we are better able to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States"" such as the Orlando massacre, McConnell said.'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Collins, who held a news conference with eight other senators including Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida, said her bill would stop about 2,700 Americans and 106,300 foreign national on surveillance lists from buying guns.""We believe that if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane you are too dangerous to buy a gun,"" the Maine lawmaker said. She said Americans and immigrants with work permits could appeal a denial and recover lawyers' fees if they prevailed. Nelson said he owed it to the families of the victims in the Orlando shooting as well as police and other first responders to the carnage. It was not clear whether Collins' plan would draw significant bipartisan support. The NRA said her proposal was ""unconstitutional"" and would not have prevented the Orlando attack. Gun control groups promised to intensify their push for legislative action, and not just in Washington.Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said her group, besides supporting pro-gun control candidates for Congress, would work to strengthen gun-sale background check laws ""state by state until Congress acts.""""If the NRA and their lapdogs in the Senate thought moms would feel dispirited and back down, they are sorely mistaken,"" Watts told reporters in a teleconference.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday that amendments were necessary to a Puerto Rico debt bill that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said would be voted on by next week.Reid, speaking to reporters, said changes were needed to the federal board overseeing the restructuring of Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt under the bill, but he did not say whether Democrats would be successful in making any changes.The House of Representatives passed a Puerto Rico debt relief bill on June 9, following months of internal debate. Supporters hope the Senate passes that bill, without any amendment, before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment.The Caribbean island, which is a U.S. territory, is suffering a poverty rate of about 45 percent and has been hobbled by worsening debt problems. Some schools and medical facilities are closing and thousands of residents are relocating to the U.S. mainland, further shrinking Puerto Rico's tax base.
While Reid said he had ""some serious concerns"" with the current bill, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and lawmakers in the House, he did not say whether he expected any amendments to succeed in the Senate.A Senate debate over amendments could simply help put Democrats on record registering their concerns with the legislation.""At the very minimum, we need some amendments to make sure that people understand what is not in that bill,"" Reid said.
Democrats in both chambers have voiced concerns over some potential minimum-wage reductions for young workers that Republicans included in the House bill.They also have said the federal oversight board, to be appointed by Washington, might not have Puerto Rico's best interests in mind.
Supporters of the bill have argued it is the best measure that can pass the Republican-controlled Congress and that  Puerto Rico could slip into chaos without action. (Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Chris Reese and Peter Cooney)"	['Reid', 'McConnell', 'Obama']	[]

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican Donald Trump said on Tuesday his ""unlimited"" trove of personal wealth would help compensate for his poor presidential campaign fundraising, even as he took steps to court new donors to help win the White House.The New York real estate mogul raised only $3.1 million in individual contributions in May and ended the month with $1.3 million in cash, leaving him far behind his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton who brought in $26 million and closed the month's books with a $42 million war chest.The figures underscore the huge cash advantage Clinton is hoping to enjoy leading into the Nov. 8 presidential election, one that could allow her a large staff and millions of dollars of television and digital ads in battleground states.Trump, who openly shunned donations while winning the party nomination, rebuffed criticism from Republicans who say he needs to raise cash for the general election fight against Clinton. His campaign might need in excess of $1 billion by some estimates but Trump said money was not a problem.     ""If need be, there could be unlimited 'cash on hand' as I would put up my own money,"" Trump said in a statement, which asserted he had already spent over $50 million dollars on his bid for the White House. The billionaire candidate added that his campaign also costs less than a traditional one because it is ""is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.""Trump has said he is worth more than $10 billion, but much of his money is tied up in properties and businesses. Estimates from outside groups have put Trump's wealth as low as $1 billion. Forbes magazine estimates it at $4.5 billion.According to Trump's most recent personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, in May, he had between $65 mln and $175 million in liquid assets - money in funds, equities and cash.Despite Trump's professed lack of concern for standard campaign fundraising, he took steps to boost donations.
Several sources with knowledge of Trump's fundraising activities said he will attend a dinner on Tuesday evening to court hedge fund managers and other Wall Street donors. Woody Johnson, the billionaire investor and owner of the New York Jets football team, is also hosting a breakfast for Trump at a high-end restaurant in Manhattan on Wednesday morning.Targeting smaller donors, Trump on Tuesday also sent his first email asking for donations, telling supporters that he will match their contributions up to $2 million.Trump's allies, donors, and other Republican operatives have expressed concerns about his campaign operation, which has been dogged by internal battles, a threadbare campaign infrastructure, and thin fundraising apparatus.""Without money you don't have a campaign,"" said Stan Hubbard, a Republican donor from Minnesota who owns a chain of radio stations and who has contributed to Trump. 
""He's got to call on people to give money and stop all this nonsense about funding his own campaign,"" Hubbard said. Trump this week fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who had been overseeing the campaign's fundraising arm.UNUSUAL CANDIDATE
Trump has spent much of the race so far breaking the mold of a traditional campaign, defeating a crowded field of primary opponents who vastly outspent him in ads and staff.    
During the Republican primary race, he often told his supporters not to contribute money and ridiculed opponents for accepting cash from special interest groups and wealthy contributors.    He has so far showed little interest in calling donors to ask for money for his general election battle. He only began holding in-person fundraisers in late May.""Trump defeated the most talented GOP field in a generation with less staff, less experience and less money in much less time,"" said Republican strategist Keith Appell. ""That said, Trump's campaign needs to transition quickly to a national, general election effort online, on the air and on the ground - his populist, anti-Washington, new leadership message has been muddled by sideshow issues.""Trump has loaned his campaign $46 million since launching last year, federal filings show. He often uses his own plane to travel to campaign events, and also uses his hotels and other properties as venues - expenses he is required by law to reimburse from his campaign funds.The campaign has spent about $6.2 million with Trump businesses including TAG Air and his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. It has also reimbursed Trump about $390,000 for some payroll and other expenses. The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, announced it raised $11 million in May, and had $19.9 million in cash at the beginning of June. The RNC will help Trump's effort to get elected, but also helps fund congressional races.

WASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met on Tuesday with about 10 of the 51 State Department officials who last week wrote a cable disagreeing with U.S. policy toward Syria and arguing for ""a more militarily assertive U.S. role.""Multiple U.S. officials have said they do not expect the memo, conveyed through the State Department's relatively rarely used ""dissent channel,"" a conduit for voicing contrary views, to change U.S. President Barack Obama's policy.In the cable, the diplomats call for military strikes against President Bashar al-Assad's government to stop its persistent violations of a civil war ceasefireObama's policy toward Syria, where a civil war has burned for more than five years, has been predicated on the goal of avoiding deeper military entanglements in the Middle East, and has been widely criticized as hesitant and risk-averse.
Obama's limited intervention has focused on fighting the Islamic State militant group that controls a swathe of Syria and Iraq and that has inspired attacks on U.S. soil. The memo by the State Department officials demanded a more muscular stance.
While State Department spokesman John Kirby said that Kerry had met with about 10 of the officials for half an hour on Tuesday, he declined to provide details of their discussion about the cable, which the department has not made public.""We believe that achieving our objectives will continue to elude us if we do not include the use of military force as an option to enforce the Cessation of Hostilities (CoH) and compel the Syrian regime to abide by its terms as well as to negotiate a political solution in good faith,"" said a draft of the memo posted online by The New York Times.

By Julia Harte
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Federal appeals court judges on Tuesday probed the intent behind a sweeping 2013 North Carolina law that changed the state's election rules.A lawyer for the state, Thomas Farr, defended the law and denied claims by attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department and civil rights groups that the law intentionally suppressed minority voters, speaking before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia.The court already temporarily stayed the law's provisions that eliminate voters' ability to register the same day they vote and to vote outside their assigned precincts, methods that critics say are disproportionately used by minority voters.If the appeals court follows a lower court's April ruling and upholds the law, those options may not be available for North Carolina voters in the upcoming election in November, widely viewed as one of the most critical presidential and general elections in recent U.S. history.Judge Henry Floyd asked Farr about the fact that the legislature considered an expanded version of the law soon after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County v. Holder that Congress could no longer subject states with a record of race-based voter discrimination to special elections oversight.
North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature got the ""opportunity"" to change some ""pretty liberal voter registration provisions"" with that decision, Floyd said. ""And it happened the same day Shelby was decided. Looks pretty bad to me, in terms of purposeful discrimination,"" he added.
Judge James Wynn asked Farr what type of voter behavior information the state legislature considered when passing the law: ""At the time that it enacted this, did it have ... information that the use of these particular procedures was disproportionately higher in the minority community than they were in the non-minority community?"" Farr replied that the state board of elections launched a campaign to educate voters about the new requirements.""When these rules were used in 2014 election, African-American turnout increased at a higher rate than whites,"" Farr told Reuters by email after the hearing.
Attorneys for the civil rights groups opposing the law appeared jubilant afterwards, greeting supporters outside the courthouse and at a local church in Richmond, where NAACP members sang, spoke and answered questions from reporters.""The judges asked really probing questions to understand the crux of the matter,"" said Allison Riggs, a lawyer for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. ""The court below just got the law wrong."" (Reporting by Julia Harte; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	['Farr', 'Shelby']	[]
