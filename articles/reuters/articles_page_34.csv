By Bill Trott
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's successful campaign for the White House broke every tradition and upended the political establishment with the same bluster, hyperbole and media mastery that made him one of the world's best-known businessmen.Trump told supporters at a rally early on Wednesday he had received a call from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton  congratulating him on his victory.From his grand Trump Tower escalator entrance into the Republican presidential race on June 16, 2015, Trump managed to be simultaneously charismatic and combative, elitist and populist, lewd and pious as he drilled into a lode of polarity and anti-Washington anger among American voters.It was his first run for public office and Trump, a real-estate developer, reality television star and self-confessed owner of a big ego, called it a movement, not a campaign. He drew large, enthusiastic crowds to rallies where people cheered him for ""just saying what everybody's thinking."" Critics labeled him misogynistic, ill-informed, uncouth, unpresidential, a racist, a hypocrite, a demagogue and a sexual predator, all accusations he denied.It took Trump, 70, little more than 10 months to vanquish 16 other Republican candidates and win the party's nomination, becoming the first major party nominee without government experience since General Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. He drew a record number of votes in primary contests but in so doing created a rift in the Republican Party.Then Trump squared off against Clinton, 69, in a race marked by controversies that included upheaval in his staff, charges he had groped women and unheeded demands that he release his tax records. He said that as president he would investigate Clinton for her use of email while secretary of state. He vowed to send her to jail.His campaign took a scandalous turn in October with the release of a 2005 video in which Trump, unaware he was being recorded, told a television entertainment reporter that he liked to kiss women without invitation and that, because he was rich and famous, he could grab them by the genitals with impunity.Trump dismissed the remarks as ""locker room talk"" and denied the subsequent accusations from more than 10 women who said he had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances.GLOOM OVER AMERICA
Throughout his campaign - and especially in his Republican convention speech in July - Trump described a dark America that had been knocked to its knees by China, Mexico, Russia and Islamic State. The American dream was dead, he said, smothered by malevolent business interests and corrupt politicians, and he said he alone could revive it.Trump said he would make America great again through the force of his personality, negotiating skill and business acumen. He offered vague plans to win economic concessions from China, to build a wall on the southern U.S. border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make Mexico pay for it. He vowed to repeal Obamacare while being the ""greatest jobs president that God ever created"" and has proposed refusing entry to the United States of people from war-torn Middle Eastern nations, a modified version of an earlier proposed ban on Muslims.Trump promoted himself as the ultimate success story. He dated beautiful women, married three of them, had his own television show and erected skyscrapers that bore his name in big gold letters. Everything in his life was the greatest, the hugest, the classiest, the most successful, he said, even though critics assailed his experiences with bankruptcies, the failures of his Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos and what they viewed as the misplaced pride he showed when presented with evidence he avoided paying taxes.Trump had flirted with presidential runs in the past and some initially saw his campaign as a vanity project meant to indulge his ego and burnish his brand. It was expected to be short-lived but as the election season progressed, he became the Republican front-runner, winning state nominating contests despite an unconventional campaign that relied on large-scale rallies and mostly ignored grass-roots work.His hired advisers came to realize there was only so much they could do to rein in Trump. His inner circle was dominated by his three oldest children - Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, along with Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner.
TWEET ATTACKS
The rise of Trump, once a registered Democrat, threatened to blow up the Republican Party. Its establishment challenged his commitment to their tenets and organized against him. Prominent Republicans - including former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and congressional leaders - shunned him or offered lukewarm support.Trump used Twitter as a weapon, firing off insults and mockery at those who offended him, including ""Crooked Hillary"" and Republican rivals ""Little Marco"" Rubio, Jeb ""Low Energy"" Bush and ""Lyin' Ted"" Cruz.Another target was the family of a Muslim U.S. Army captain who died fighting in Iraq after the soldier's father had spoken against Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Trump sniped back for days despite his advisers urging him to move on.As of late October, The New York Times had counted 282 people and things he had insulted on Twitter since declaring his candidacy.The Trump candidacy was brimming with contradictions. The candidate who vowed to bring back jobs to the United States had his clothing line and campaign hats manufactured in foreign countries. The man who decried the corrupting power of money in politics boasted of having bought influence himself.Undocumented workers had been used on his building projects but as a candidate Trump vowed to ship illegal immigrants out of the country. He said no one respected women more than he did but even before the groping accusations emerged, he was branded a misogynist for making fun of the appearance of rival candidate Carly Fiorina and an apparent reference to the menstrual cycle of Fox News' Megyn Kelly.
""YOU'RE FIRED!""
Trump's campaign trail demeanor seemed to draw from his experiences as host of ""The Apprentice,"" a reality TV show where he barked a crowd-pleasing ""You're fired!"" at contestants who fell short in competitions.His speeches were often unscripted and featured boasts on everything from his money to his IQ. He peppered them with dubiously sourced declarations, misperceptions and false statements.He suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, a remark the Clinton campaign called dangerous.Trump boasted of a fortune he put at $10 billion, although in September Forbes magazine estimated it at $3.7 billion, making him the 156th richest American.Trump regularly made comments that would have doomed a more conventional candidate, such as when he said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue in New York and not lose a single vote.In May he would draw accusations of racism for questioning the impartiality of a judge - born in the United States to Mexican immigrants - who was hearing a lawsuit against him.No other candidate referred to the size of his genitals during a debate. He was flattered when Russian President Vladimir Putin called him a ""brilliant and talented leader.""     Trump mocked Senator John McCain, the Republicans' presidential candidate in 2008, for having been captured during the Vietnam War and said he wanted to punch a protester in the face at a Trump rally.
DIFFICULT CHILD
Trump was born to money on June 14, 1946, in the New York City borough of Queens, the fourth of five children of Fred Trump, who would become one of the city's biggest developers and landlords, and his wife. It was Fred Trump who taught Donald the value of self-promotion and a killer instinct.By his own admission, Trump was not an easy child and in the eighth grade his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy in hopes of instilling needed discipline. Through student and medical deferments during the Vietnam War, Trump would never serve in the U.S. military but said the school gave him ""more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.""After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Trump went to work for his father's company, which focused on the outer New York City boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island and owned an estimated 15,000 apartments. In 1973 the Trumps were charged with racial bias in their rental practices before reaching a settlement with the U.S. government.With a $1 million loan from his father, Trump eventually went into business himself in Manhattan, where he became a regular at some of the city's most exclusive clubs and developed a reputation as a ladies' man.TRUMP TOWER FLAGSHIP
He soon made his mark with a series of real estate and development deals, including redoing an old hotel at New York's Grand Central Terminal. In 1983 he opened his flagship, 58-story Trump Tower, which serves as both his primary residence and Trump Organization headquarters.More projects around the world would follow, including golf courses, the Mar-a-Lago private resort in Florida, New York's venerable Plaza Hotel and casinos.Trump's projects had mixed success. The flops included the real estate-oriented Trump University, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airlines and Trump Vodka but it was his experience with four casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that took the golden luster off his empire.Timothy O'Brien, author of ""TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,"" wrote that in the 1990s Trump was out of money and twice had to go to his siblings for loans. A former employee said the Trump Organization would have shut down if the family had not come through but Trump disputed that in his 1997 book ""Trump: The Art of the Comeback.""While he never filed for personal bankruptcy, the downturn in the gaming industry sent parts of Trump's corporate empire to bankruptcy court in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009. In the 2009 bankruptcy, the unsecured creditors received less than a penny on the dollar for their claim. Trump resigned as chairman four days before the filing.

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Online trading platform PredictIt and bookermaker Paddy Power showed a massive reversal of fortune for U.S. presidential candidates Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, as the New York businessman's chances of taking the White House skyrocketed on both.Trump stunned many political experts, showing a slight edge on Clinton in several swing states after voting had ended in more than two-thirds of the 50 U.S. states.Paddy Power put Trump's chance of victory at 83.3 percent Tuesday and Clinton's at 22.2 percent. The two had been in essentially opposite positions on Tuesday morning.The Irish bookmaker stands to take a $4 million hit if Trump wins, said Paddy Power spokesman Feilim Mac An Iomaire, who said the dramatic reversal in odds was reminiscent of what it saw in the ""Brexit"" vote for Britain to leave the European Union.""You could say it's deja vu again,"" said Mac An Iomaire. ""Much like Brexit, it looked to be following the odds early on before a dramatic turnaround.""
While opinion polls went back and forth leading into Britain's June 23 referendum on whether or not to remain in the EU, betting odds favored the ""remain"" campaign. Britons voted to leave by 52 percent to 48 percent. A similar trajectory played out on the online trading platform PredictIt, which was launched in 2014 and is jointly run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and Washington-based political consulting firm Aristotle International Inc.Clinton led Trump in PredictIt's market on who will win the White House throughout the campaign, but news of her Republican challenger's surprise momentum sent her chance of winning the election plummeting roughly 75 percentage points from its level Tuesday morning to 5 percent.
Trump's chance, meanwhile, shot up more than 40 percentage points to around 65 percent. It was the first time in the entire campaign that Trump had led Clinton on the platform, according to a PredictIt spokeswoman.
British gambling company Ladbrokes had Trump's chance of victory at roughly 85 percent Tuesday night, compared with 15 percent for Clinton.Ladbrokes had earlier in the day placed Clinton's chance of victory at 76 percent and Trump's at 24 percent, but company spokeswoman Jessica Bridge said the development ""isn't a surprise in the slightest,"" given the high volume of trades made on Trump since the market opened in 2012.Roughly 75 percent of all bets in Ladbroke's U.S. presidential wagering had been placed on Trump.

By Chris Kahn
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Americans who had cast their votes for the next president early on Tuesday appeared to be worried about the direction of the country, and were looking for a ""strong leader who can take the country back from the rich and powerful,"" according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll.The poll of more than 10,000 people who have already cast their ballots in the presidential election showed a majority of voters are worried about their ability to get ahead and have little confidence in political parties or the media to improve their situation. A majority also feel that the economy is rigged to mostly help the wealthy.The poll, which will be updated as additional responses are tallied and votes are counted throughout Tuesday, found:- 75 percent agree that ""America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.""
- 72 percent agree ""the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.""- 68 percent agree that ""traditional parties and politicians don't care about people like me.""- 76 percent believe ""the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth.""
- 57 percent feel that ""more and more, I don't identify with what America has become.""- 54 percent feel ""it is increasingly hard for someone like me to get ahead in America.""
The Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll was conducted on Election Day in English in all 50 states. It includes 10,604 Americans who have already cast their vote in the presidential election and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1 percentage point.  The poll also includes a variety of questions about the presidential race, which candidate people supported, and why. Those results will be published later in the evening, after most of the votes have been counted and state races have been called.

Colorado voters rejected a ballot measure on Tuesday to create the nation's first statewide universal health insurance program, according to local NBC News affiliate 9News.The proposition, called Amendment 69, would have created one of the most dramatic overhauls to a public healthcare system in U.S. history.Colorado's 9News reported that the amendment was defeated on Tuesday night, after early results showed an overwhelming defeat.Dubbed ColoradoCare, the program would have been funded largely through a new 10 percent payroll tax increase intended to raise $25 billion in 2019, the first year the program could launch, according to the Colorado Health Institute.
ColoradoCare was intended to greatly reduce the number of uninsured residents in the state, but opponents feared the tax hike and sweeping changes to public policy would ripple through the state's economy.
James Merilatt, 43, an unaffiliated voter who supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's election, said he opposed the single-payer healthcare measure.""It's way too complicated and would have opened up a Pandora's Box,"" said Merilatt, who works in the publishing industry.

WASHINGTON Republican Paul Ryan was re-elected to the U.S. House of Representatives by voters in his Wisconsin district on Tuesday, positioning him to reassert his claim to remain speaker of the House, the highest-ranking post in the U.S. Congress.The 2012 vice presidential nominee, if returned to the speaker's chair by House members, may have a smaller Republican majority to work with if voters elect fewer Republicans. Most House races were still undecided.Like all members of the House, other Republicans were also running for re-election from their home districts, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana.Along with Ryan, they were expected to seek re-election to their leadership posts. Closed-door leadership elections in both parties were expected to take place later in November. A new speaker will be elected by all members of Congress in January.
Ryan, 46, has been speaker since October 2015. His re-election to that job is not certain. Some House conservatives have criticized him, and they may have a stronger hand after Tuesday's voting.
A number of Republican lawmakers were angered in October when Ryan said he would not campaign with or defend Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who was in a closely fought race with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night.

By Julia Harte, Andy Sullivan and David Ingram
| WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA

WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA Voters and civil rights groups reported long lines, isolated cases of malfunctioning equipment and some harassment at polling places in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election but fears of widespread violence at the polls did not materialize.Nationwide, civil rights groups logged unusual levels of voter intimidation complaints, receiving about 35,000 calls through a national voter complaint hotline as of Tuesday evening. Democratic Party officials, however, said they did not see systemic voter suppression efforts.Civil rights groups, who have enlisted 7,000 volunteers, said 40 percent of the calls they had received through the telephone hotline by early afternoon were from African-American and Latino voters.Complaints of voter intimidation were especially prevalent in Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Arizona with a disproportionate share coming from minority voters.""We are hearing more complaints about voter intimidation than we have in presidential cycles from prior years,"" said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly said the election would be ""rigged"" and called on his supporters to watch for signs of fraud in urban areas, raising fears they could clash with minority voters. Numerous studies have found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States.VOTER INTIMIDATION
Absent on Tuesday were reports of the kind of hostile political displays, vandalism and violence that have cropped up regularly throughout the campaign. A polling station was locked down in Southern California after one person was killed and three wounded by gunfire but police saw no immediate indication the incident was linked to Election Day.But isolated reports of voter intimidation and harassment flooded the voter complaint hotline run by a coalition of civil rights groups throughout the day.An African-American voter called the hotline from Alabama's Shelby County to report that a white poll worker had indicated she would have to wash her hands after handling the voter's photo identification card. 
Shelby County lawyers persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 to strike down a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act requiring states with a history of voter discrimination to get federal clearance for changes to their election laws.Clarke said many voter complaints to the hotline came from states formerly covered by that provision.Some voters in Florida reported a heavy, unexplained police presence at several polling sites around the state. A group of students in the state were told their votes would not count because their college dormitory was considered a hotel. In Ohio's Franklin County, the hotline received complaints that Somali-American voters were told they would have to vote provisionally because their addresses did not match their identification cards - and then were told that the polling site had run out of provisional ballots.In Georgia's DeKalb County, a group calling itself Defenders of Democracy was pressuring voters in line to fill out sample ballots and sign pledges that they would cast the same votes on the real ballot, according to reports received by the hotline.
The federal government reduced its election monitoring program in the wake of a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision that weakened federal oversight of states with a history of racial discrimination. Revised voting laws and lengthy court battles in many states also have left voters uncertain about when and where they can cast their ballot and whether they will need to present photo identification. A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected a request from Trump for records from a Las Vegas polling place that his campaign said had improperly remained open last week to accommodate people who were lined up to vote. The judge agreed with a county attorney who argued that election officials already preserve records. MACHINE GLITCHES
Malfunctioning machines dominated voter complaints out of Pennsylvania, Arizona, New York, North Carolina and Virginia.Trump cited reports that polling machines were switching votes for Republican candidates to votes for Democrats as cause for concern that the election outcome might not be valid, once again warning of a rigged system.
Speaking to Fox News, Trump provided no evidence to support the allegations or say where polling machines were breaking down, although there were some problems in Pennsylvania.Voters in at least four Pennsylvania counties said touch-screen voting machines were mistakenly switching votes. State officials, however, said they did not believe any ballots had been wrongly counted as a result of the machine malfunctions.Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that relies on electronic voting machines without a paper backup that would allow officials to double-check the outcome if it is challenged.The machines can record votes incorrectly if they are not calibrated properly, a problem that is magnified as the screens degrade with age. But ES&S, the company that makes the machines, said voters have a chance to confirm their choices before they cast their ballot, making it impossible for the machine to flip a vote from one candidate to another. Local officials test machines to make sure they are calibrated properly before each election.The Philadelphia district attorney's office, which monitors voting in the state's largest city, said on Twitter it was not receiving any complaints out of the ordinary.Electronic voting rolls in Durham County, North Carolina, malfunctioned early on Tuesday, prompting the county to ask the state board of elections to extend voting hours in eight precincts until 9 p.m., an hour and a half later than they were supposed to be open.The state elections board on Tuesday evening agreed to extend voting hours in the precincts by between 20 and 60 minutes.

| WINSTON-SALEM, N.C./NEW YORK

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C./NEW YORK North Carolina extended voting times in several precincts during Tuesday's  presidential election but Colorado rejected a bid to keep polls open longer after both states experienced problems with electronic voting systems.In North Carolina, advocates including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had urged the state to extend voting time in eight Durham County precincts until 9 p.m. EST, an hour and a half past normal closing time. Instead, the state board extended voting time by an hour in two precincts and less than that in the other six.In Colorado, the Democratic Party filed a petition in the Denver County District Court to extend voting for two additional hours after service failures in the state's electronic voting system in some polling places. A judge denied the request and said polls would close at 7 p.m. CST as scheduled.Colorado and North Carolina are both crucial battlegrounds in the U.S. presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The Colorado Secretary of State office had opposed the extension of voting hours.""This outage didn't stop anyone from voting. We have had two weeks of voting and everyone got a ballot,"" Lynn Bartels, a spokeswoman for the office, said on Twitter. She said anyone still in line when polls closed would have an opportunity to cast their ballot.
The Reverend William Barber, president of the NAACP in North Carolina, told members of the State Board of Elections on a conference call Tuesday evening that their refusal to extend voting hours as long as requested by local elections officials was ""deeply concerning.""The problem in North Carolina involved the electronic poll books used to check in voters in some precincts. At one precinct where voting was extended for 60 minutes, election officials reported there had been up to a two-hour period earlier in the day where no voting took place.
""We've fought too much voter suppression in this state over and over again,"" Barber said.Patrick Gannon, spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said voting was extended in just a handful of the state's 2,704 precincts. The election board is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats.

WASHINGTON Americans voting in Tuesday's presidential election were far more likely to have been contacted by Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign than Republican Donald Trump's, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll.Some 25 percent of American voters said someone from the Clinton campaign either called them or talked to them in person about coming out to vote, while 17 percent said the same about the Trump campaign, according to the survey of about 38,000 people who had cast a ballot.Clinton far outspent Trump during the race for the White House, setting up a sprawling campaign team that included hundreds of paid staff.
Four years ago, the get-out-the-vote operations were much more competitive. On Election Day 2012, some 28 percent of voters said that they were contacted by the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama, while 25 percent said they were contacted by his Republican challenger Mitt Romney's camp.
Tuesday's poll reading will be updated as more poll responses are tallied and more votes are counted across the country.
