By Steve Holland and Amanda Becker
| GREENVILLE, N.C., Va./WASHINGTON

GREENVILLE, N.C., Va./WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump invoked religion, talked of unifying Americans and tried to raise doubts about whether Democratic rival Hillary Clinton can be trusted in a new campaign stump speech unveiled on Tuesday.""I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as one American people,"" Trump told a packed rally in Greenville, North Carolina, in a departure from his typical bare-knuckled approach.On the Democratic side, both Clinton and her vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, blasted Trump. Clinton focused on Trump's past bankruptcies and his refusal to release his tax records.""He clearly has something to hide. We don't know exactly what it is, but we're getting better guesses about what it probably is,"" she said in Tampa, Florida.Kaine, in a national security speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, criticized Trump's business dealings with Russia, the ties between some of his campaign advisers to the country and Trump's suggestion that he hoped Russian hackers could find missing emails from when Clinton was secretary of state.""He has openly encouraged Russia to hack his political opponents and commit espionage against his own country,"" Kaine said.Trump, in a speech on Wednesday in Cleveland, is to lay out a military preparedness plan in which he will call for rescinding mandatory defense spending cuts and embarking on a major military buildup. The Trump campaign said the candidate will call for big increases in spending for new ships, planes, submarines and training combat troops and bolstering missile defense systems. Trump will also criticize Clinton for ""military adventurism"" for her handling of Libya and the Middle East as secretary of state.Trump, buoyed by polls showing him as gaining ground against Clinton, outlined what he would do on his first day as president if elected on Nov. 8, part of a new effort to inject more discipline into his free-wheeling campaign.
He said he would suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees into the United States, start toward repealing and replacing President Barack Obama's signature healthcare plan, and begin the first steps toward building a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.Trump, who rarely mentions religion, quoted from a Bible passage he read aloud at a black church in Detroit on Saturday, part of his effort to appeal to African-American voters.""Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one flag,"" he added. ""It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new American future.""
THE DESTRUCTION OF EMAILS 
But Trump was unflinchingly critical of Clinton over the latest disclosures from the Federal Bureau of Investigation about her use of a private email server and destruction of thousands of emails that she and her staff had deemed of a personal nature.At least two of her mobile devices were reported destroyed by a staff using a hammer and BleachBit software to wipe unwanted emails.""People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law,"" Trump said.Kaine, in his first major policy speech since being tapped as Clinton's running mate, drew a contrast between how Trump would approach U.S. relations with Russia and Clinton's track record as head of the U.S. State Department from 2009 to 2013, during Obama's first term as president.
As head of the State Department, Clinton oversaw ""hard-nosed negotiations"" with Russia to reduce nuclear stockpiles and destroy Syrian chemical weapons, while still going ""toe-to-toe"" with Putin to protect America and NATO allies, Kaine said. ""Trump seems to support Russian interests at the expense of American ones,"" he added.Kaine's speech began less than an hour after Trump concluded a campaign stop in Virginia Beach, in Kaine's home state of Virginia, where he scoffed at the idea that Clinton would hold any sway over Putin's actions. ""Putin looks at Hillary Clinton and he laughs. Putin looks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles,"" Trump said.The back-and-forth occurred as the focus of the U.S. battle for the White House shifted to national security, with both Clinton and Trump set to participate in a televised forum on Wednesday hosted by a veteran's group.Trump followed up his Virginia event by meeting with the wives of U.S. military personnel stationed at nearby installations. Setting aside his usual bombast, Trump turned soft-spoken and nodded attentively as the women, some of whom held babies on their laps, described their concerns about the quality of schools and finding jobs.""So much of this we can take care of,"" Trump told them.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Supporters of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's U.S. Supreme Court selection, on Tuesday launched a new push to persuade the Republican-led Senate to act on the nomination before the Nov. 8 presidential election, but their calls fell on deaf ears.With senators returning to work after a seven-week summer recess, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid called the refusal of Republicans to consider Garland's nomination ""disgusting and repugnant.""""Republicans have deadlocked our entire system of justice because of the Republican Senate's dysfunction,"" Reid said.Obama's nomination of the moderate appeals court judge has been pending without action for 174 days, longer than any other Supreme Court nominee in U.S. history.The U.S. Constitution gives the Senate the job of confirming a president's judicial nominees. In a move with little precedent in American history, Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have refused to take any action on Obama's nominee, insisting that Obama's successor make the pick.""The Senate is returning from the longest recess in nearly half a century, and perhaps the Republican leadership was hoping that Americans had forgotten about the unprecedented obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee,"" said Senator Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
We Need Nine, a White House-allied group, will hold a news conference in front of the Supreme Court building on Wednesday with Democratic senators and lawyers who previously worked as clerks for Garland.Republicans sounded unconvinced.McConnell ""has been crystal clear for the last seven months,"" an aide to the senator said on Tuesday. ""The next president will select the nominee.""
The nine-seat court has been one justice short since the February death of long-serving conservative Antonin Scalia. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the bench, an appointment by a Democratic president could end decades of conservative domination on the court.The White House has called Garland's confirmation a top priority for the legislative work period that began on Tuesday and ends in early October. In remarks last month, Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley indicated he could be persuaded by a large number of senators to take action on Garland in a ""lame duck"" session immediately after the election. His panel would hold any confirmation hearings.
Some conservatives worry that if Democrat Hillary Clinton defeats Republican Donald Trump in the election, she would nominate someone more liberal than Garland.But in a statement on Tuesday, Grassley reiterated that ""the next president should choose Justice Scalia's replacement"" and said his meetings with home-state voters during the recess ""only bolstered the point that Iowans should have the opportunity to have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.""

By Richard Valdmanis and Grant Smith
| BOSTON/NEW YORK

BOSTON/NEW YORK U.S. companies that have expressed the most fervent public support for President Barack Obama's environmental agenda are also funding its biggest enemies - the scores of U.S. lawmakers who are climate change skeptics and oppose regulation to combat it, according to a Reuters review of public records.Ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections, the donations from companies including PepsiCo, Dupont, and Google reveal a disconnect between how these companies present themselves to the public on environmental issues, and how they manage their political contributions to support business-friendly policy.

// ]]>

Many companies active in U.S. politics spread their political donations broadly on both sides of the aisle and consider multiple issues when deciding whom to support.But inconsistency between a company's environmental positions and its political giving may point up a need for better oversight, according to Jon Lukomnik, head of the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute. ""There really needs to be a process that looks at these issues ... at C-suite and board levels on a periodic basis,"" Lukomnik said.The Reuters review covered donations made during the 2016 election cycle by the political action committees (PACs) of 30 of the biggest publicly traded U.S. companies that signed Obama's ""American Business Act on Climate Change Pledge"" in 2015, a public promise to enact climate-friendly corporate policies and support strong climate change oversight like the global climate accord signed in Paris.The review found that 25 of the 30 companies are funding the campaigns of lawmakers featured on a ""climate deniers"" list that was put together by Organizing For Action, a non-profit created by former Obama campaign aides to advocate his agenda.The list includes more than 130 members of Congress, nearly all Republicans, and is a who's who of the biggest opponents of Obama's plan to combat climate change. Some of those on the list dispute the label ""denier"" and describe themselves as climate change ""skeptics"".The list includes Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, an energy advisor to presidential candidate Donald Trump who once argued the Earth was cooling not warming, and Republican U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who last year held up a snowball on the Senate floor as evidence global warming does not exist.The review found PepsiCo and DuPont's political action committees gave about half or more of the money from their top donations in support of senators and congressmen on the list. That amounted to $56,500 from the Pepsi PAC's 29 donations of $2,500 and above, and $40,000 from the DuPont PAC's 19 donations of $2,000 and above.
Other signatories to the American Business Act on Climate Change Pledge that gave more than a third of their top political contributions to lawmakers on the list include Google, AT&T, GE, Verizon, and Mondelez, according to the review.Those levels of donations given to climate skeptics are relatively high given that the list covers about a quarter of U.S. Congress members.Officials from PepsiCo, Google, AT&T, and Verizon did not respond to requests for comment. DuPont declined to comment, and Mondelez referred Reuters to the press release announcing its participation in the climate pledge.A GE spokeswoman said the company supports ""elected officials based on a wide range of issues, but we have consistently been outspoken about the need to address climate change and have invested over $17 billion in cleaner technology R&D over the last 11 years."" PepsiCo has also been working to become more energy efficient, and now operates the country's largest fleet of electric delivery trucks. But it still has a sizeable carbon footprint: It produced some 4.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2013, down 2 percent from 2012, according to its website. A more recent figure was not available.
DuPont, also working to increase its energy efficiency, emitted 16.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2013. POLITICALLY CHARGED Congressman Cramer, a self-described climate skeptic who opposes Obama's climate agenda but has taken donations from companies that signed the climate pledge, said companies tend to consider issues like tax policy, national security, and regulatory policy when picking who to support - as opposed to a single issue like the environment.He, like other lawmakers featured on the Organizing For Action ""climate deniers"" list, said the debate over climate change was not as clear cut as Obama's allies depict it.
""It is not a black and white issue, like if you agree with Obama you're enlightened, and if you don't you're in the dark,"" he said. ""It is more of a spectrum.""A spokeswoman for Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, another lawmaker featured on the list, said he had ""done more than almost any other member of Congress to increase the use of clean energy"" sources like wind and biofuels.But she added he was opposed to Obama's climate change initiatives, like the Clean Power Plan to curb carbon output, because he felt that it could hurt the competitiveness of U.S. businesses globally.Senator Inhofe, who said he doesn't mind the label ""climate denier"", suggested that some companies had signed the American Business Act on Climate Change pledge for superficial reasons.""These are competitive companies, and the board might have said 'Look, right now it might be a popular thing to join this, and there's no downside since we're not really committing to anything.' That absolutely goes on,"" he said.The five companies reviewed by Reuters that did not fund opponents to Obama's climate change agenda either had no political action committee, like Apple, or made only a small number of contributions, like Coca Cola.Lauren Compere, managing director at sustainable investment manager Boston Common Asset Management, said consistency between policy and political giving was becoming increasingly important to environmentally-minded investors.""No company should want to be perceived as espousing progressive climate policies on the one hand, while funding climate deniers on the other,"" she said.

By Roberta Rampton and Manuel Mogato
| VIENTIANE

VIENTIANE (Note: paragraphs 1, 6 and 19 contain language that may offend some readers)New Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte sought to defuse a row with the United States on Tuesday, voicing regret for calling President Barack Obama a ""son of a bitch"", a comment that prompted Washington to call off a bilateral meeting.The tiff between the two allies overshadowed the opening of a summit of East and Southeast Asian nations in Vientiane, Laos.It also soured Obama's last swing as president through a region he has tried to make a focus of U.S. foreign policy, a strategy widely seen as a response to China's economic and military muscle-flexing.Diplomats say strains with longtime ally the Philippines could compound Washington's difficulties in forging a united front with Southeast Asian partners on the geostrategic jostle with Beijing over the South China Sea.Duterte has bristled repeatedly at criticism over his ""war on drugs"", which has killed about 2,400 people since he took office two months ago, and on Monday said it would be ""rude"" for Obama to raise the question of human rights when they met.Such a conversation, Duterte told reporters, would prompt him to curse at Obama, using a Filipino phrase ""putang ina"" which can mean ""son of a bitch"" or ""son of a whore"".He has previously used the epithet against Pope Francis, although he later apologized, and the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines.After Washington called off Tuesday's bilateral meeting between Obama and Duterte in response to his latest comment, the Philippines issued two statements expressing regret and also briefed reporters.""President Duterte explained that the press reports that President Obama would 'lecture' him on extrajudicial killings led to his strong comments, which in turn elicited concern,"" the Philippines government said in a statement.
""He regrets that his remarks to the press have caused much controversy,"" it added. ""He expressed his deep regard and affinity for President Obama and for the enduring partnership between our nations.""Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said the focus on Duterte's comments leading into the summit had not created a constructive environment for a bilateral meeting.""All of the attention frankly was on those comments, and therefore not on the very substantive agenda that we have with the Philippines,"" he told reporters.Officials from both countries said there would be no formal meeting rescheduled in Laos but a short conversation between the two presidents was possible. Instead of the Duterte meeting, Obama held talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, a day after North Korea fired three medium-range missiles into the sea. He urged a full implementation of sanctions against North Korea, adding that the missile test demonstrated the threat that Pyongyang posed.Obama is also likely to hold an unscheduled meeting in Laos with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to discuss North Korea, Rhodes said. He said Washington needed to maintain a sense of urgency within the international community on sanctions against Pyongyang. 
MOVES TO SOOTHE TENSIONS
Obama, the first sitting U.S. president to visit Laos, said on Tuesday he wanted to address the legacy of U.S. bombing during the Vietnam War. He announced that Washington would provide an additional $90 million over three years to help clear unexploded ordnance, which has killed or wounded over 20,000 people. But the unusually open tensions between the United States and the Philippines, its former colony, threaten to overshadow the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Summits in Laos, which run until Thursday.The 10-member ASEAN will also meet leaders of other regional powers: China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, Russia and the United States.
Duterte won the presidency in May after promising to suppress crime and wipe out the illegal drug trade in a country where the number of methamphetamine users is estimated to be at least 1.3 million in a population of 100 million. About 900 people linked to drugs have been killed in police operations since July 1 and a further 1,500 have been classified as ""deaths under investigation"", a term human rights activists in the Philippines say is a euphemism for extrajudicial killings.Duterte has poured scorn on critics of his uncompromising campaign, usually larding it with curses. He lambasted the United Nations after it criticized the surge in killings and he turned down a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the Laos summit.He has accused a senator heading an inquiry into the killings of getting payoffs from drug lords.Manila has been aligned with the United States in its dispute with China over the South China Sea, in which Washington blames Beijing for militarizing a vital global trade route and jeopardizing freedom of movement at sea and in the air.China rejects those accusations and accuses the United States of ratcheting up tensions unnecessarily. China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion of trade moves annually. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have rival claims.An arbitration court in The Hague in July invalidated China's territorial claims after a case was brought by the Philippines, a ruling Beijing refuses to recognize.Duterte said last month he expected all ASEAN members to support the arbitration court's ruling, but that the Philippines would not raise the issue in Laos.

By Jeff Mason
| TAMPA, Fla.

TAMPA, Fla. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Republican rival Donald Trump on Tuesday for making comments about the Federal Reserve's monetary policies, which she said should be off-limits for U.S. presidents and presidential candidates.""You should not be commenting on Fed actions when you are either running for president or you are president,"" Clinton told reporters on her campaign plane. ""Words have consequences. Words move markets. Words can be misinterpreted.""Trump, who has previously accused the U.S. central bank of keeping interest rates low to help Democratic President Barack Obama, said on Monday that interest rates should change.""They're keeping the rates down so that everything else doesn't go down,"" Trump said in response to a reporter's request to address a potential rate hike by the Federal Reserve in September. ""We have a very false economy.""Clinton criticized the New York real estate magnate in her second press conference in as many days.""He should not be trying to talk up or talk down the economy, and he should not be adding the Fed to his long list of institutions and individuals that he is maligning and otherwise attacking,"" she said.
Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York and secretary of state, also said that daughter Chelsea Clinton's involvement in the Clinton Foundation charity will be decided after the Nov. 8 election.""These issues will be decided after the election. And we will decide the appropriate way forward,"" she said.Earlier, she told ABC News that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, should not have to step down before the election from his position at the foundation.
""I don't think there are conflicts of interest,"" Clinton said in the ABC interview. ""I know that that's what has been alleged and never proven. But nevertheless, I take it seriously.""Her use of a private email server while secretary of state and questions about improper influence involving donors to the Clinton Foundation have been thorny topics for Clinton as the presidential campaign headed into its final months.Clinton dismissed the latest call for a new investigation into her email practices.
""The FBI resolved all of this. Their report answered all the questions,"" she said.Clinton also brushed off polls that show the race tightening between her and Trump.""We're sticking with our strategy. We feel very good about where we are. But we're not taking anything for granted,"" she said. (Writing by Doina Chiacu and Jeff Mason; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

President Rodrigo Duterte called Obama a ""son of a bitch"" and said he would not be lectured over extrajudicial killings in the Philippines' drug war. Duterte later voiced regret for his language.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans in Congress are planning a light legislative agenda as they return from their long summer break on Tuesday, a strategy some say is designed in part to bog down Hillary Clinton if she becomes president. It is not uncommon for the Congress to take it slow in an election year and legislative delays could work in Republicans' favor if their nominee Donald Trump takes the White House in November.But the strategy will also pay dividends if it is Clinton who takes office on Jan. 20. She will be forced to deal with old baggage rather than focus on her agenda of infrastructure investments and immigration and Wall Street reforms.""If Hillary wins, we force her to waste time, resources, momentum, early good will and political capital - all on cleanup duty,"" said a senior aide to one Republican senator.If all goes as expected this autumn, a U.S. Supreme Court seat, vacant since Feb. 13, will remain unfilled until sometime next year. A sweeping Pacific free-trade deal negotiated by President Barack Obama will be on hold, if not doomed.And if many conservative Republicans get their way, government agencies will run on stop-gap funding from Oct. 1 until sometime in February or March. That means that the next president would have to negotiate a longer-term deal or face the prospect of government shutdowns in the early days of a new administration.Senior congressional aides have told Reuters their agenda for the coming months include bills to keep the government funded, combat the spreading Zika virus and renewing laws guarding the nation's water resources.Other items would help the majority Republicans score political points with key constituencies before the November elections, even though they have no chance of becoming law.
These include scolding the Obama administration for a $400 million payment to Iran in January after Tehran released American prisoners, anti-abortion measures and, once again, proposals to repeal Obama's landmark healthcare law.Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former aide to Republican leaders in Congress, acknowledged that public opinion polling is trending in Clinton's direction.If Clinton wins, Bonjean added, ""The whole mindset (among Republican leaders in Congress) would shift to taking care of the most important business to help Republicans and unloading the more difficult, tense issues for a Clinton administration to deal with.""Clinton has maintained a lead in most polls since Republican and Democratic conventions, but some surveys showed that lead narrowing. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sept. 2 showed Trump effectively pulling even with the Democratic nominee.
Yet one veteran Republican congressional aide said more and more Republicans in Congress brace for the White House to stay in Democratic hands for the next four years, even if their party manages to maintain control of Congress.Trump's trouble in appealing to important groups of voters, such as Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians, and self-inflicted wounds ""have made it pretty clear he's highly unlikely to get there,"" he said.Leaving the Supreme Court nomination and other high-profile disagreements for 2017 ""does bog down"" a new administration, ""no question about it,"" the aide said.Some election years mean a slow autumn in Congress, but this is not always the case. In 2012 for example, lawmakers dramatically labored all the way through New Year's Eve addressing a ""fiscal cliff"" of expiring tax and spending laws. 
Not all of the delays in passing legislation are purely on Republican shoulders though.While Trump has blasted free-trade deals, leading Democrats, including Clinton, also have criticized Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership pact that would create a free-trade zone ranging from Japan to Chile.Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, downplayed the challenges Clinton might face early on. ""She knows how to deal with Congress. She's been there,"" he said referring to Clinton's years as a senator representing New York.Besides, he added, if Trump loses, Republicans will be busy dealing with their own problems. ""They'll have to think seriously about how they got themselves in the trouble that they're in.""

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Monday she will not accept an invitation from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for a visit after rival Donald Trump created what she called a ""diplomatic incident"" in his foray there.In a written excerpt from an interview with ABC News that will air Tuesday morning, Clinton simply said ""no"" when asked if she would travel to Mexico before the election on Nov. 8, without elaborating further.Her campaign later confirmed her decision.""We understand and respect her decision to propose the time to hold a meeting,"" said Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu in a tweet, adding that contact with Clinton's campaign was ongoing.Pena Nieto extended invitations to both candidates last month, and Trump flew to Mexico City last Wednesday for a meeting that appeared to be friendly but later revealed deep tensions.
Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has been highly critical of Mexico, saying the country sends rapists and drug dealers to the United States. He has called for a wall to be built on the border that would be paid for by Mexico. Trump said at a joint news conference with Pena Nieto that they did not discuss who would pay for the wall. Pena Nieto remained silent on the issue at the event, but said later on Twitter that he made it clear Mexico would not pay for the wall.
""He came out saying one thing and the Mexican president contradicted him almost immediately,"" Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, said in the ABC interview.""He didn't raise it, so he did choke. He didn't know how to even communicate effectively with a head of state. And I think that's a pretty clear outcome from that trip,"" she added.
