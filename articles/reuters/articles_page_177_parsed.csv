WASHINGTON U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Friday she understands how her meeting with former president Bill Clinton ""casts a shadow"" over the perception of independence in the investigation her department is conducting into his wife's email use. Bill Clinton met with Lynch on her plane in Phoenix on Monday night, triggering a firestorm from Republicans and a public statement from Lynch that she will accept whatever outcome independent investigators decide at the end of the probe into the Democratic presidential front-runner's use of a private email server.

By Steve Holland and Julia Edwards

WASHINGTON - Republican Donald Trump said on Thursday that if elected president Nov. 8 he would be open to drawing NATO forces into the fight against Islamic State militants in a new mission for an alliance he has called obsolete.Trump made the comments in an interview with ABC News. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has for months raised questions about the money the United States pours into NATO, which he says needs to be reconfigured to take account of today's threats.""I like the idea of using NATO and also neighbors that aren't in NATO and take them out. You gotta take them out,"" Trump said.Under President Barack Obama, the United States has relied heavily on U.S. airstrikes to attack Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. Republicans have criticized this policy as not enough to stop the militants.Trump said the idea of using the Cold War-era alliance would be to ease the load on American forces.""I don't want to get too much of ours involved. I want NATO to be involved,"" Trump said. ""We spend a tremendous amount of money on NATO. We take care of countries that frankly should be taking care of themselves in terms of economically.""Trump's comments came amid an uproar over a meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a time when Clinton's wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is under federal investigation.The private meeting took place on Lynch's plane after she landed in Phoenix on Monday night and Bill Clinton was leaving the airport after a rally he held for his wife earlier that day.
Hillary Clinton is under an FBI investigation for her use of a private email server when she was President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state.Trump told conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher that the meeting was proof of his charge that the U.S. political system is ""rigged"" in favor of political elites.""It's unheard of,"" Trump told ABC News. ""You have this massive investigation on emails and they'd have a meeting like this.""Lynch, appointed to her position by Obama more than a year ago, said she did not discuss the email investigation or other pending matters before the Justice Department with Bill Clinton. 
    ""When I was landing at the airport, I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as I was leaving and he spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,"" Lynch told reporters.     ""Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren. It was primarily social and about our travels. He mentioned the golf he played in Phoenix and he mentioned travels he had to West Virginia...But there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending before any other body,"" Lynch said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating Hillary Clinton about her email use and has already interviewed some of her aides. The investigation into whether laws were broken as a result of the server kept in her New York home has overshadowed Clinton's campaign.
SPECIAL COUNSEL 
Obama is preparing to campaign with Hillary Clinton for the first time in her 2016 White House bid. They are to appear together in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed Clinton 11 points ahead of the billionaire businessman   At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest made clear that Obama believes an impartial investigation is crucial and noted that Lynch had said the conversation was benign.    ""I think the bottom line is simply that both the president and the attorney general understand how important it is for the Department of Justice to conduct investigations that are free of political interference,"" Earnest told reporters. U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, cited the incident in renewing his call for an independent counsel to take over the Clinton probe from the FBI.

By Nick Brown
| SAN JUAN

SAN JUAN Puerto Rico authorized suspension of payments on its general obligation debt on Thursday just minutes after U.S. President Barack Obama signed a law creating a federal oversight board with authority to negotiate the restructuring of the island's $70 billion in debt.The executive order issued by Puerto Rico's governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, comes just one day before the U.S. territory was due to make $1.9 billion worth of debt payments on July 1, including some $780 million in constitutionally-backed, general obligation bonds.It remains to be seen whether Puerto Rico will pay part of the GO debt or any of the non-GO debt.""Under these circumstances, these executive orders protect the limited resources available to the agencies listed in these orders and prevents that these can be seized by creditors, leaving Puerto Ricans without basic services,"" Garcia Padilla's administration said in a statement. The flurry of activity represents the nadir of a decade-long struggle by Puerto Rico, home to 3.5 million Americans, to stave off economic collapse, reverse a 45 percent poverty rate and stem rampant emigration that exacerbates the economy's decline.     Garcia Padilla authorized the suspension of general obligation payments under a previously enacted local debt moratorium law that has already been challenged by a creditor lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In addition, Garcia Padilla also declared states of emergency at the island's biggest public pension - the Commonwealth's Employee Retirement System - which is more than 99 percent underfunded, as well as the University of Puerto Rico and other agencies.Puerto Rico's benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 0.44 points in price to trade at 67.19 points, pushing the yield down to 12.578 percent.
OBAMA SIGNS PROMESA 
    In Washington, Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, in the Oval office on Thursday, one of the few pieces of bi-partisan legislation to make it to his desk.""I want to let the people of Puerto Rico know that although there are still some tough work that we're going to have to do to dig Puerto Rico out of the hole that it's in, this indicates how committed my administration is to making sure that they get the help they need,"" Obama told reporters before signing it.
The law will allow the island access to a bankruptcy-like debt restructuring process, but put its finances under the control of a federally-appointed board -- a condition that has riled many in Puerto Rico, including Garcia Padilla.PROMESA, which passed the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, puts a stay, or halt, on litigation in the event of a default. Puerto Rico has already defaulted three times on portions of its debt in the last year.The stay is critical to keep Puerto Rico's financial restructuring from devolving into a mess of long, costly court battles. The stay is retroactive back to December 2015.The oversight board will have the authority to facilitate consensual restructuring talks, or push Puerto Rico into a court-supervised process akin to U.S. bankruptcy. It will also oversee and monitor the implementation of sustainable budgets.
    Still, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims should Puerto Rico not deliver the cash to its investors.MBIA's National Public Finance Guarantee insures about $173 million in GO debt due on Friday, while Assured Guaranty covers another $184 million, and Ambac insures $40 million in GO or GO-guaranteed debt due on Friday.     The island's debt-laden semi-public power utility, PREPA,  earlier on Thursday announced it will make its full, $415 million payment due Friday, under the terms of a restructuring agreement reached late last year with the bulk of its creditors. PREPA, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8.3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized. The payment will be made using operational funds and proceeds from new bond sales.""Today's outcome is another step towards PREPA's transformation,"" Lisa Donahue, the utility's chief restructuring officer, said in a statement.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, under mounting pressure to advance gun-control legislation, will vote next week on a measure to keep guns out of the hands of people on government terrorism watch lists.Republican and gun lobby sources said the legislation, due to be introduced as part of a terrorism package, was likely to be a National Rifle Association-backed bill brought by Representative Lee Zeldin of New York as the companion to a Senate Republican measure from Senator John Cornyn of Texas.House Democrats, who last week staged a 25-hour sit-in on the House floor to push for gun control after the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, condemned the Cornyn-Zeldin measure as the handiwork of the NRA. Senate Democrats blocked the same legislation last week.  ""House Democrats will keep up our efforts to push for the majority to allow a vote on gun violence legislation, but bringing up a bill authored by the NRA just isn't going to cut it,"" said Drew Hammill, an aide to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. The NRA denied writing the legislation. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced the plan in a conference call with lawmakers. Republican leadership aides declined to provide details. One said the package was still being negotiated.
After the Orlando, Florida, shooting that killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at a gay nightclub [nL1N19L1WH], gun-control proponents ratcheted up pressure for meaningful legislation. ""We are going to get something done this year, I predict,"" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid told reporters. ""I think we're going to take a bite out of the NRA.""Reid said he was hopeful for a bill introduced by Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and a bipartisan House companion bill backed by Republicans including Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, to prevent gun sales to anyone on the government's ""No Fly List"" for terrorism suspects or the ""Selectee List"" for extra airport screening.  
Before Thursday's announcement, Representative Bob Dold of Illinois, a Republican backer of the Collins-Curbelo bill, urged Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to opt for the bipartisan measure, according to a Dold aide.But hopes for a vote on that measure could be dashed if House Republicans move first on the Cornyn-Zeldin bill, which would allow party leaders to say they had acted on gun control.  
""It would really be a sharp blow,"" said Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican and NRA member who supports the Collins-Curbelo measure.The NRA-backed measure would give officials three days to decide whether a gun sale should be blocked. Democrats argue the timetable is insufficient and say the government would have to persuade a court that a would-be buyer ""has committed or will commit an act of terrorism"" before it could block a gun sale.Under the Collins-Curbelo bills, a court would have 14 days to decide on appeals.

SAN JUAN Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla on Thursday issued an executive order authorizing the suspension of payment on approximately $800 million worth of constitutionally-guaranteed general obligation bonds due on July 1.    The suspension follows U.S. President Barack Obama's signing into law earlier on Thursday of a plan that gives a federal oversight board authority for negotiating the restructuring of the island's $70 billion debt and bringing the struggling U.S. territory's finances under control.

By Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON Seven U.S. senators urged Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday to press Bahrain's government to do more to promote political and social reform, adding to recent concern in Washington over that country's human rights record.The letter said the United States should be prepared to consider ""tangible consequences,"" including reconsidering arms sales, if a recent crackdown on opposition continues.""Bahrain's failure to address the legitimate grievances of its citizens has strained the country's social fabric and invited outside actors to take advantage of the deteriorating situation,"" six Democratic lawmakers and one Republican said in a letter to Kerry, a former Democratic senator.""Indeed, we believe the government's harsh crackdown on the political opposition undermines the country's stability and plays into the hands of Iran,"" they wrote, calling themselves ""deeply alarmed.""State Department spokesman John Kirby said he was aware of reports about the letter, but had not seen it.
Asked about whether U.S. arms provided to Bahrain could be used against the opposition, he said, ""We always have concerns about the end use of items that are inside the foreign military sales program.""Bahrain, which hosts the United States' Fifth Fleet and is seen by Sunni-ruled Gulf kingdoms as a strategic bulwark against Iranian influence, drew U.S. and United Nations criticism this month when it moved to strip a top Shi'ite cleric's citizenship and closed the main Shi'ite opposition group. 
A State Department report, first reported by Reuters, found Bahrain's national reconciliation efforts after it crushed street protests in 2011 have stalled, and said the Western ally in the Gulf has not implemented recommendations to protect freedom of expression.""We continue to urge the government of Bahrain to reverse their recent harmful actions,"" Kirby said a news briefing on Thursday.Earlier this week, the State Department said Bahrain's plan to try an activist for tweets condemning its prison system and involvement in the war in Yemen is worrisome to the United States.
The letter was led by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and also signed by Republican Marco Rubio and Democrats Patrick Leahy, Ron Wyden, Bob Casey, Chris Coons and Tim Kaine.It asked for more information on specific actions President Barack Obama's administration is taking to press Bahrain's leadership on the issue.

By Nick Brown
| SAN JUAN

SAN JUAN Puerto Rico's semi-public power utility, known as PREPA, on Thursday said it would make all of a $415 million debt payment due on Friday, a relief for bond insurers who might have been on the hook in the event of default.    PREPA, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8.3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized. On Thursday, the utility said it would make its $415 million payment using operational funds and proceeds from the new bond sales.""Today's outcome is another step toward PREPA's transformation,"" Lisa Donahue, the utility's chief restructuring officer, said in a statement.The payment is not a shock because PREPA and its creditors have had the framework of a restructuring deal in place since December. But debt payments in the U.S. territory are being watched closely as the island is expected to default on pieces of $1.9 billion owed on Friday, and President Barack Obama prepares to sign a bill putting the island's finances under federal oversight.
Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a stalled economy, and high poverty and unemployment. The $1.9 billion due on Friday - of which PREPA's payment was a portion - includes nearly $800 million in general obligation (GO) debt, the island's highest-ranking debt protected by a constitutional pledge. It was unclear on Thursday whether Puerto Rico would make that payment.On Wednesday night, the U.S. Senate passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which Obama has said he will sign, providing for a bankruptcy-like debt restructuring process for Puerto Rico, as well as federal oversight of its finances.
While PROMESA contemplates a stay on litigation in the event of default, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims. MBIA's National Public Finance Guarantee insures about $139 million of the PREPA payment due on Friday, while Assured Guaranty covers about $35 million.National insures another $211 million in other debt due on Friday, including $173 million in GO debt, a company spokesman said on Wednesday. Assured covers another $329 million due Friday, about $184 million of which is GO debt, a spokeswoman said.
Ambac, which insures more than $2 billion of Puerto Rican bonds, is on the hook for $122 million in principal and interest due on Friday, including some $40 million in GO or GO-guaranteed debt, according to the company's public documents. (Editing by Bernard Orr)"	['Obama']	[]

| SARANDE, Albania

SARANDE, Albania Whatever the outcome of November's U.S. presidential election, the Albanian town of Sarande is backing Hillary Clinton by erecting a bronze bust to thank her for supporting Albanian causes.Albania is a staunch ally of the United States and has a history of commemorating its presidents. Woodrow Wilson has a statue there for helping foster the young Albanian state. So does George W. Bush, who visited Albania in 2007 and backed the independence of Kosovo, whose population is mainly ethnic Albanian.Bill Clinton has a statue in Kosovo in recognition of his role in the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 in support of Kosovo.
""This bust in our most central public space is an expression of our gratitude through Mrs. Clinton to the American people and state for what they have done for the Albanian people and nation,"" Sarande Mayor Florjana Koka told a small crowd.It was also a tribute to Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, as an example to women in politics, said Koka, the first female mayor of Sarande.
American tourist Jessica Rightmayer wiped away tears as the U.S. national anthem was played. ""I think it is beautiful and I really think it is a very good likeness,"" she said.Sculptor Idriz Balani said the idea for the statue came to him when Hillary Clinton told the Albanian parliament in 2012 that Albania and the United States had together marked the Balkan country's first centenary and would be friends for another 100 years. Her ""charm, elegance and vitality"" had convinced him to sculpt her.
""I used three photos to get her smile, hair, posture and attire right and kept the necklace. She exudes benevolence. I hope they like it,"" Balani told Reuters. (Editing by Giles Elgood and Janet Lawrence)"	['Clinton']	[]
