By Mark Hosenball and John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Federal investigators have secured a warrant to examine newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton's private server, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday, as a prominent Democrat accused FBI Director James Comey of breaking the law by trying to influence the election.The warrant will allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to examine the emails to see if they are relevant to its probe of the private email server used for government work by Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.Comey came under heavy pressure from Democrats on Sunday to quickly provide details of the emails, as Clinton allies worried the prolonged controversy could extend beyond the Nov. 8 election and cast a shadow over a Clinton transition if she wins the White House.Comey's disclosure of the email discovery in a letter to Congress on Friday plunged the final days of the White House race between Clinton and Republican Donald Trump into turmoil. Clinton had opened a recent lead over Trump in national polls, but it had been narrowing even before the email controversy resurfaced.The unexpected turn in the email controversy shook  financial markets' conviction of a Clinton victory in the election and the U.S. dollar slipped against major currencies in early Asian trading on Monday.U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid sent a letter to Comey on Sunday suggesting he violated the Hatch Act, which bars the use of a federal government position to influence an election.""Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,"" Reid, a senator from Nevada, said in the letter to Comey.Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook questioned Comey's decision to send a letter notifying Congress of the email review before he even knew whether they were significant or relevant.Comey's letter was ""long on innuendo, short on facts,"" Podesta said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program, and accused the FBI chief of breaking precedent by disclosing aspects of an investigation so close to the election.""We are calling on Mr. Comey to come forward and explain what's at issue here,"" Podesta said, adding the significance of the emails was unclear.
""He might have taken the first step of actually having looked at them before he did this in the middle of a presidential campaign, so close to the voting,"" Podesta said.Comey's letter was sent over the objections of Justice Department officials. But those officials did not try to stop the FBI from getting the warrant, a source familiar with the decision said, because they are interested in the FBI moving quickly on the probe.Sources close to the investigation have said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe of former Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin.Weiner is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The FBI already had a warrant to search Weiner's laptop in that probe, but needed a warrant to look at the material that might be related to Clinton.
'CHECK ON CORRUPTION'
Sources familiar with the matter said FBI agents working on the Weiner investigation saw material on a laptop belonging to Weiner that led them to believe it might be relevant to the investigation of Clinton's email practices.Trump has highlighted the issue as proof for his argument that Clinton is corrupt and untrustworthy.""We have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption and that is the power of the vote,"" Trump told a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. ""The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions.""Comey, who announced in July that the FBI's long investigation of Clinton's emails was ending without any charges, said in his letter the agency would review the newly surfaced emails to determine their relevance to the investigation of her handling of classified information.
Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, said he filed a complaint over Comey's actions with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations.""We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power,"" he said in a column in the New York Times.But Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at Columbia Law School, called the allegations that Comey improperly tried to influence the election ""inane.""""Comey's critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was Comey's stated aim,"" said Richman, who said he had advised Comey on law enforcement policy but not this issue.An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday showed Clinton with a statistically insignificant 1-point national lead on Trump. About a third of likely voters in the poll said they were less likely to back Clinton given Comey's disclosure.Clinton, who told a Florida rally on Saturday that Comey's letter was ""deeply troubling,"" did not address the issue directly on Sunday but referred vaguely to voters overcoming a ""distraction.""""There's a lot of noise and distraction but it really comes down to the kind of future we want and who can get us there,"" she told a packed gay nightclub in Wilton Manors, Florida, where hundreds of supporters who could not get in lined the streets outside.""We don't want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality,"" she said.

| HAVANA

HAVANA A woman in a floaty dress wrestles a minotaur who reflects her inner demons in ""Errand into the Maze"", one of the Martha Graham Dance Company works that made its Cuban premiere this weekend to thunderous applause at the Havana ballet festival.The troupe was performing in the Communist-run island for the first time since 1941 and is one of seven American companies participating in the 10-day event, underscoring greater U.S.-Cuban cultural exchange in the wake of the countries' detente.""The standing ovation said it all,"" said a beaming Cuban spectator, 64-year-old Maria Antonia Armas. ""It was fabulous. I just hope this exchange will continue to flow."" The Cuban and American ballet worlds have a deeply entwined history and the founding father of Cuban dance, Ramiro Guerra, studied under Graham in New York in the 1940s.Yet ties suffered during the five decades of ideological hostility following Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution.""We keep hearing there is a Martha Graham world in Cuba that we have been apart from for decades,"" the company's artistic director, Janet Eilber, said in an interview.""We know it has evolved in its own way and in New York we have evolved in our own way, so to come together and meet our long lost relatives has been very interesting.""While there have been some exchanges between Cuban and American dance in the last two decades, the detente announced nearly two years ago is enabling a broader opening, Eilber said.
For one, it has made traveling and securing financing much easier, she said. Regular commercial flights were re-established in August and American companies such as Jetblue are keen to provide sponsorship in order to gain market recognition in Cuba.'SOPHISTICATED PALATES'
Cuban spectators said the modern and contemporary U.S. choreographies performed during the opening weekend of the 25th Havana ballet festival were like a breath of fresh air. 
While Cuban ballet has fused the best from the Russians, French, Italians, English and Americans with Latin flair and Afro-Cuban sensuality, its style has also been criticized as outdated.It is based on the approach of the Ballet Nacional de Cuba's 94-year-old founder, Alicia Alonso, a principal dancer in the 1940s with the company now known as American Ballet Theater.Alonso's choreographies to classics like Swan Lake, Giselle and Sleeping Beauty feature heavily throughout the biannual festival, which from this year onwards will be named after her.New York City Ballet choreographer Justin Peck, who brought four works to the festival, said he aimed above all to keep ""pushing the envelope"".
""Classical ballet is an evolution so it should take certain careful steps forward,"" the 29-year old told a news conference.Peck and others said it was a treat to perform in a society where the public is so enthusiastic about their art.Ballet may not be avant-garde in Cuba but it is mainstream entertainment, with tickets costing less than half a dollar and performances shown on public television.""They have one of most sophisticated palates for ballet, for dance and for art in the world,"" said Peck.Dancers and companies representing sixteen countries in total will participate in the festival, including for the first time South Korea's Universal Ballet Company and the lead dancer from the National Ballet of Mongolia.

By Steve Holland
| PHOENIX

PHOENIX Sensing a potential turning point, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump mounted a furious effort on Saturday to portray Democrat Hillary Clinton as unfit to lead the country after the latest chapter in her email controversy unfolded as he tries to mount a comeback.With the Nov. 8 election only 10 days away, Trump devoted much of his stump speech to try to take the maximum advantage of the FBI's disclosure that it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton's use of a private email server.Little is known about the extent and focus of the new FBI review. But Trump was quick to declare his rival ""guilty"" at rallies in Phoenix and in Golden, Colorado, declaring that she is symbolic of a type of public corruption that is a ""grave threat to our democracy.""Trump charged that the Justice Department, populated by appointees of Democratic President Barack Obama, is trying to help Clinton, given news reports that top department officials did not want FBI Director James Comey to reveal his new review.
""When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope. They stop dreaming. They stop trying,"" Trump said in Phoenix. ""Hillary Clinton's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped.""Clinton herself has repeatedly attacked Trump as not fit to be president.The new uproar could not have come at a more opportune time for Trump, who has been reeling for weeks from the release of a 2005 audio tape in which he boasted about groping women and the emergence of a host of women who said he did just that to them.
Trump has narrowed the gap in public opinion polls between him and Clinton nationally and in some battleground states where the election is likely to be decided. But most analyses of the polls show him facing a defeat, perhaps a landslide, if the election were to be held today. That made it essential for Trump to try to change the subject from his own setbacks and focus on those of Clinton, and give establishment Republicans who have been reluctant to support him a reason to get behind him, and perhaps sway some undecided voters as well.
Still, the Phoenix rally provided a reminder why some Republicans cannot bring themselves to support Trump, as a man there taunted reporters with a chant of ""Jew S. A."" when the rest of the crowd was chanting ""USA.""Trump's next couple of days on the campaign trail reflect a change in strategy with uncertain rewards. He is to campaign in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Sunday and in Michigan on Monday,  two states that have voted Democratic in recent presidential elections and appeared poised to do so again.

By Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland
| DAYTONA BEACH, Fla./GOLDEN, Colo.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla./GOLDEN, Colo. Hillary Clinton on Saturday challenged FBI Director James Comey to provide a fuller explanation of investigative steps he is taking related to her use of a private email server, as the Democratic presidential candidate accused him of ""deeply troubling"" behavior 10 days before the U.S. elections.Speaking to volunteers in Daytona Beach, Florida, Clinton said: ""Some of you may have heard about a letter the FBI director sent"" on Friday to the U.S. Congress informing it that the agency is again reviewing emails.Comey had decided in July that the FBI was not going to seek prosecution of Clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state.""It is pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election,"" Clinton said, adding, ""It's not just strange, it's unprecedented and it's deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts."" She urged Comey to ""put it all out on the table.""In tandem with Clinton, fellow Democrats on Saturday also worked to pressure Comey to provide details on a controversy that dominated the presidential campaigns on Saturday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 elections.Four U.S. senators - Patrick Leahy, the longest-serving Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, Thomas Carper and Benjamin Cardin - wrote Comey and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking that they provide by Monday more detailed information about investigative steps underway.At a press conference in Columbus, Ohio, the Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the House of Representatives, nearly all Democrats, also urged Comey to be more forthcoming.Sources close to the investigation on Friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.Weiner, a former Democratic U.S. congressman from New York, is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pounded away at the new FBI development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in Golden, Colorado, to attacking Clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency.
""Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful,"" Trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. ""Hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure.""Comey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the FBI or the nature of their contents.Clinton's campaign team tried to downplay the new review.""There's no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing,"" said John Podesta, who heads the Clinton campaign, referring to the FBI's latest announcement that it was taking ""appropriate investigative steps"" after learning of emails ""that appear to be pertinent"" to the earlier Clinton email probe.In some of his toughest language on Saturday, Podesta portrayed Comey's letter to Congress as ""light on facts, heavy on innuendo.""
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said Americans had already ""factored"" what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots.""We don't see it changing the landscape"" for undecided voters, Mook said.Clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters.Clinton did a campaign swing through Florida as she and Trump were thought to be in a tight race in a state famous for its role in close presidential elections.Many analysts believe this battleground state is essential for Trump to win in order to have any chance of being elected.
In recent weeks, Trump has been running behind Clinton in most public opinion polls.Singer and actor Jennifer Lopez was scheduled to headline a free concert in Miami on Saturday for Clinton supporters. The Clinton campaign hopes that ""J.Lo,"" as she is known by fans, will provide celebrity star power and help Clinton connect with young voters who earlier this year flocked to Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders.Justice Department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the FBI director's letter being sent to Congress and believe his actions conflict with a Justice Department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections.While Lynch did not discuss the matter directly with Comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other.Comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow-up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the FBI's probe of Clinton's emails, the source said.During his speech in Golden, before flying to Arizona to campaign, Trump accused the Obama administration's Justice Department of trying to protect Clinton from prosecution.""The attorney general didn't want anything to happen to Hillary. I wonder why. It's very sad. Folks, we're living in a third world country,"" Trump said.

AHERLOW, Ireland U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday he had not been contacted by the FBI about new investigative steps being taken related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she led the State Department. The FBI on Friday said it was investigating more emails in what the Democratic presidential candidate described as ""deeply troubling"" behavior 10 days before the U.S. elections.""I haven't been notified of anything, no, I haven't been requested of anything, no, I'm not aware of the department being requested, and I have no further comment to make,"" Kerry told a news conference in Ireland.""As an American citizen and former nominee of the party, there is a lot I'd like to say about what is going on, but I can't and I am just going to remain out of this,"" he added.
Clinton on Saturday challenged FBI Director James Comey to provide a fuller explanation of investigative steps he is taking related to her use of a private email server. Comey had decided in July that the FBI was not going to seek prosecution of Clinton. But on Friday he said the agency was trying to determine whether additional emails contained classified information.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has been reeling for weeks from the release of a 2005 audio tape in which he boasted about groping women, has seized on the FBI move as evidence Clinton is unfit to lead the country.Kerry was in Ireland to accept the Tipperary International Peace Award, joining recipients like former South African President Nelson Mandela, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and former U.S. President Bill Clinton.
Kerry is due to travel to London on Monday for talks on Libya that will seek to break a political stalemate over the country's U.N-backed unity government. (Writing by Lesley Wroughton and Conor Humphries, editing by Larry King)"	['Clinton', 'Nelson']	[]

By Maurice Tamman
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK With 11 days to go before the U.S. presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project.Though data is not available for all early voting states, Clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as Ohio and Arizona and in Republican Party strongholds such as Georgia and Texas.An estimated 19 million Americans have voted so far in the election, according to the University of Florida's United States Election Project, accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate.Overall, Clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the Electoral College, the Reuters/Ipsos survey showed.Having so many ballots locked down before the Nov. 8 election is good news for the Clinton campaign. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to Clinton's close aide, Huma Abedin. Those emails were found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, Abedin's estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. The Reuters/Ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged Friday afternoon.It remains unclear whether the FBI inquiry will upset the balance in the race. The bureau disclosed nothing about the Abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to Clinton. Over the summer, the FBI said it was closing its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email system while secretary of state. Until Friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial FBI email probe.
Clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the Trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. Trump has said none of the accusations are true. He also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes.As of Thursday, Clinton's odds of receiving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to State of the Nation polling results released Saturday. The project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the Democrat.Clinton's lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken at the time. Obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to Romney's 206.But even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for Clinton. News coverage of Trump's accusers had diminished, while Clinton confronted the almost daily release by WikiLeaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign manager's account. This week's leaked messages raised questions about former President Bill Clinton's finances.
And her lead in the States of the Nation project fell slightly from last week. Though the projected Electoral College votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for Clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. Trump didn't see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains: The swing states of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada all moved from leaning to Clinton to being too close to call.Still, Trump's path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. As of Thursday, Ohio remained a toss-up. Florida and North Carolina were still tilting toward Clinton, according to the States of the Nation results.Early voting data for Florida and North Carolina was not yet available this week. In Ohio, Clinton led Trump by double digits among early voters. The project's broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates.
In Arizona, Clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters. In the past month, Arizona has gradually moved from a solid Trump state to a marginal Clinton state, although it is still too close to call, according to the project results.In Georgia, she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters. Overall, Georgia leans to Trump, but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week, down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago.Even in Texas, where Trump enjoys a sizable lead, Clinton has a double-digit edge among early voters, according to project results.The States of the Nation project is a survey of about 15,000 people every week in all 50 states plus Washington D.C. State by state results are available by visiting here (Editing by James Dalgleish)"	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

| MIAMI

MIAMI Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose buoyant position in opinion polls has been threatened by a surprising new twist in the saga over her emails, on Saturday harnessed some celebrity star power she hopes will help win the battleground state of Florida on Nov. 8.Musician and actor Jennifer Lopez headlined a free concert in Miami as part of a star-studded effort to get out the vote and energize volunteers.""We're at a crossroads and we have to take the right road to the future,"" Lopez shouted to screaming fans in rain gear who danced through rain and a shower of red, white and blue confetti.The concert provided some visual counter-programming to the latest email snafu to roil Clinton's race to win the White House.The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton's use of a private email system - a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up Election Day.Clinton's campaign has said she is taking the news in stride, and on Saturday she lashed out at FBI Director James Comey over the review.
The JLo event was the first of three high-profile concerts in states Clinton wants to keep from Republican rival Donald Trump, and it gave the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach.""If we turn out, we win,"" Clinton told the crowd.Celebrity-driven events like the concert ""can serve as a bit of a distraction"" from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.""It is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive,"" Kasper said.
Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5.A Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show ""The Apprentice.""But turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this year's race for the White House has turned off young Americans, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.
Presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book ""What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House.""""Campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture,"" said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House.The events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a ""groundswell"" of support behind a candidate - and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians,  Kasper said.""It can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance,"" Kasper said.

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former U.S. congressman, has emerged as an unexpected figure in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's inquiry into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified government information on a private email server she used while secretary of state.The FBI said on Friday it is examining newly discovered emails related to the server investigation, giving new life to a scandal less than two weeks before Clinton stands as the Democratic candidate in the U.S. presidential election.The FBI called Clinton's handling of government secrets ""extremely careless"" in July after a year-long investigation, but recommended against criminal charges. FBI agents have now found emails on devices belonging to Huma Abedin, one of Clinton's closest aides, and Weiner, Abedin's estranged husband, according to unnamed law enforcement officials.WHO IS ANTHONY WEINER?
A Brooklyn native, Weiner, 52, represented parts of New York City in the U.S. House of Representatives for more than a decade, and his marriage to Abedin was officiated by Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president and Hillary Clinton's husband. Weiner was best known for his fiery speeches and acerbic, combative wit until 2011, when he was forced to step down after he posted a photograph of his crotch on Twitter. He admitted the picture was a private communication made public by mistake, and that he had been exchanging sexually charged pictures and messages with multiple women.WHO IS CARLOS DANGER?

After atoning in press interviews for the strain he placed on his marriage with Abedin, Weiner re-entered public life in 2013 as a candidate for mayor of New York City. The city's voters for a while embraced his comeback, and he was atop the public polls when revelations broke he had never shaken his sexting habit. He admitted he had continued to swap messages and pictures with women using the alias Carlos Danger.WHAT DID ABEDIN DO?
Abedin, who has worked for Clinton since she was 19, decided against joining her husband at the polling booth on the day of Weiner's loss in the mayoral race, but remained married to him as they raised their young son together.While a diminished Weiner worked as a television commentator, Abedin, who had left the State Department with Clinton in 2013, focused on Clinton's forthcoming presidential campaign, for which she was appointed vice chairwoman. Clinton rarely appears in public without Abedin somewhere nearby. Multilingual, intensely private and with a glamour validated by Vogue magazine photo shoots, Abedin became a star in her own right as Clinton campaigned across the country, obliging countless requests by Clinton supporters to pose for their smartphone cameras. 
DID WEINER QUIT SEXTING?
No, and this year it reached a breaking point. In August, Abedin announced she was separating from Weiner after a newspaper published a picture Weiner sent to a woman of him lounging on his bed in his underwear; Weiner's and Abedin's four-year-old son could be seen at his side.The FBI began investigating after it emerged that one of his sexting partners was 15 years old, a legal minor. The agency seized devices used by both Weiner and Abedin, finding the new email cache soon after. Investigators are looking to see if yet more classified information appears in the new cache.
IS DONALD TRUMP CELEBRATING?
Yes. Clinton's Republican rival for the presidency has devoted his last few rallies to reveling in the news, a diversion from accusations by multiple women that Trump groped them. Clinton, who remains ahead in public polls, argued on Friday that most voters may have already decided whether or not Clinton's mishandling of classified information in her emails is disqualifying.WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ABEDIN?
Clinton has called Abedin, 40, a surrogate daughter, and the aide was at Clinton's side even after the news broke on Friday. Her loyalty to Clinton is unmistakable in the hundreds of emails of hers that have already been made public. Abedin has spent more than two decades accruing knowledge of Clinton's habits, preferences, scheduling and alliances, and may be viewed as irreplaceable.

By Mark Hosenball and Jonathan Allen
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The FBI is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email system, it said on Friday, in a new twist that could damage the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential race.Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said in a letter to senior lawmakers that the agency would determine whether the additional emails contained classified information, adding that he did not know ""how long it will take us to complete this additional work.""The announcement came as Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump enter the final stretch of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 8 election. In a news conference late on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton urged Comey to release more details about what the FBI was looking for in the newly discovered emails.She leads Trump in opinion polls after a bruising campaign in which she has struggled to convince voters that she is trustworthy and honest. Fresh revelations about her use of email are unlikely to assuage those concerns, and questions around the FBI investigation will now likely dog her in the coming days as she campaigns across battleground states.U.S. stocks immediately fell sharply on the news, but went on to partially recover.The FBI spent about a year investigating Clinton's use of the unauthorized server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, while she was U.S. secretary of state after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails. Comey said in July that while ""there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.""Although Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, Trump has repeatedly said her email practices are criminal and should disqualify her for office. He seized on Friday's development at rallies in Maine and New Hampshire.""This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and I'm sure it will be properly handled from this point forward,"" Trump told a crowd in Lisbon, Maine.""We hope that all, all justice will be fully served,"" he said. Supporters cheered his words and chanted, ""Lock her up.""Clinton said she had learned of the newly discovered emails from news reports. 
""I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,"" she said. ""That's why it's incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what's going on.""WEINER
Two sources close to the investigation said the latest emails were discovered not during an investigation into Clinton, but rather as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.The FBI has been investigating illicit text messages allegedly sent from Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and found the Clinton emails on a device related to that investigation, the sources said.Abedin told federal investigators in April that she used several email accounts for her work, including a Yahoo email, according to a summary of the interview released by the FBI in September. She said it was difficult to print from the State Department's email system so she routinely forwarded documents to her private accounts when she needed to print them out, according to the summary. 
Abedin announced her separation from Weiner in August after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the U.S. Congress.Lawyers representing Abedin did not respond to questions sent by email on Friday. Weiner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and he did not respond to phone calls.Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who had previously advised former President Bill Clinton but has no role with Hillary Clinton's campaign, said the linking of Clinton's email woes with Weiner's sex scandals made it harder for her campaign to distinguish itself from Trump's sex scandals.""The whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption and scandal,"" he said. ""Nobody remembers the beginning of something, they only remember the end. What are they going to remember? They're all the same: sex, scandal, corruption, emails. People are going to have trouble sorting out all this information.""""EXTRAORDINARY""

Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, said it was ""extraordinary"" for the FBI to release the letter so close to the end of a hotly contested election.""The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining,"" Podesta said in a statement. ""We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July."" Clinton has repeatedly apologized for using the private email server in her home instead of a government email account for her work as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information.While the FBI probe of new emails will likely prove a distraction to Clinton in the coming days, it was unclear what impact it would have when Americans go to the polls. Election experts say about 20 percent of ballots have already been cast, as more Americans vote by mail or go to the polls early.""A lot of concern about the emails has already been baked into this electoral cake I think,"" said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. ""They know she did it, they know it was inappropriate and, failing some sensational revelation on Nov. 6, it's hard to see that it's going to make that big a difference.""Still, Republican lawmakers, who are facing a difficult fight to keep their majorities in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, leaped to condemn Clinton.House Speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his call that the Democratic nominee be barred from briefings involving classified information until the investigation is over. Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the FBI's decision to look into the emails shows ""how serious this discovery must be.""   Clinton did not respond to reporters' shouted questions about the news when she left her plane for a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.U.S. stocks declined in a volatile session on Friday but partially recovered from the sharp drop spurred by the FBI announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day down about 9 points, or .05 percent, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged on the day. The dollar also fell against major currencies.

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton's lead over Republican rival Donald Trump widened to 6 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos U.S. presidential tracking poll, released on Friday, showing Trump losing support among women.The Oct. 21-27 opinion poll shows 42 percent of people who either voted already or expect to vote in the Nov. 8 election support Clinton, versus 36 percent for Trump. Clinton's lead a week ago was 4 points.The polling was conducted before Clinton's campaign was hit on Friday by the FBI announcement that it was investigating more emails as part of a probe into her use of a private email server while secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey said in a letter to several congressional Republicans that the agency had learned of the existence of emails that appeared to be pertinent to its investigation. However, he said the FBI did not know if the emails were significant and did not provide a time frame for the probe.(GRAPHIC: Race to the White House tmsnrt.rs/298mTyD)   Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, has consistently trailed Clinton in the poll. His level of support has remained below 40 percent among all likely voters since the beginning of September.
Clinton leads Trump by 10 points among likely women voters, up from a 4-point lead the previous week. Clinton has led Trump among women over the last two months, though the size of her advantage has varied widely from 1 point to 11 points.In a 2005 video that emerged this month, Trump could be heard bragging in vulgar terms about groping and kissing women.  At least a dozen women have since publicly accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Trump denies the allegations. Trump still has an edge among white women, a key source of strength for Republicans. Trump leads Clinton by 2 points with this group, down from a 12-point lead the previous week.
Women tend to lean Democratic, but Reuters/Ipsos polling this month shows a majority of women have an unfavorable view of the former U.S. secretary of state and believe she is not honest and truthful.    Clinton also led Trump by 6 points in a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that included alternative party candidates. Both polls, conducted online in English in all 50 states, included 1,627 American adults who were considered to be likely voters from their voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote.
That sample included 965 likely women voters and 776 likely white women voters. Individual responses were adjusted to reflect the overall U.S. population. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the total sample and 4 percentage points for the women voters.The RealClearPolitics website, which tracks most major polls, shows Clinton leading Trump by an average of 5 percentage points.
