By Lawrence Hurley and Andy Sullivan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrats fell short in three U.S. states on Monday in their legal battle to impose tighter restrictions on supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump who plan to monitor Election Day voting for signs of fraud.The U.S. Supreme Court refused to reimpose new rules on partisan poll watchers in Ohio after an appeals court struck them down, while U.S. judges in Pennsylvania and North Carolina declined Democrats' request to impose new rules that Democrats had sought. Voter intimidation is prohibited under U.S. law, but Democrats worry that Trump's warnings of a ""rigged"" election in his battle against Democrat Hillary Clinton might inspire supporters to harass minority voters and create Election Day chaos in big cities as they search for signs of vote manipulation. Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare. Democrats have asked U.S. courts in six battleground states to impose greater restrictions on partisan poll watchers, arguing that the Trump campaign, state Republican parties and Republican operative Roger Stone are encouraging supporters to  intimidate minority voters.
Trump's campaign and Republican parties in the various states say their poll watchers are trained to bring evidence of any problems to the party and not confront voters directly.""This was an attempt to intimidate Republican people engaging in lawful activity,"" North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse told Reuters.Stone says those working for his planned ""exit poll"" will be trained to use neutral, non-threatening language.  
One day before the election, Democrats so far have failed to win any of their legal efforts.A U.S. judge denied the Democrats' case in Arizona on Friday. Monday's rulings in North Carolina and Pennsylvania give Democrats little time for appeals, while the Supreme Court's Monday ruling put to rest the case filed in Ohio.
The Supreme Court order, which only covers the Ohio case, included no noted dissents from the eight justices. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a brief statement noting that ""Ohio law proscribes voter intimidation"" and citing the relevant law. U.S. judges in Michigan and Nevada have yet to issue opinions.Democrats have waged a separate legal battle against the Republican National Committee, arguing in court that the RNC should be prevented from supporting the Trump campaign's poll-watching effort. A U.S. judge in New Jersey denied that motion on Saturday.  (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Andy Sullivan; Editing by Will Dunham and Leslie Adler)"	['Sullivan', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Lawrence']	[]

By Gina Cherelus
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Both U.S. presidential candidates plan to watch Tuesday night's election returns in New York, prompting the city to stage the largest Election Day police deployment in its history, officials said on Monday.More than 5,000 police officers will be stationed around the United States' largest city, and there will be extensive street closures in the neighborhoods where Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump plan to watch returns come in - and where one will likely declare victory before hundreds of cheering supporters.""We know that the eyes of the world will be on New York City,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio told a news conference on Monday. ""We have an obligation, not only to the people in the city but to this country, to make sure that tomorrow, all through the day and particularly tomorrow night, go smoothly and goes well.""Clinton plans to hold her election night event at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center near the Hudson River, while Trump's will be at a large Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.    
The city's heightened security efforts come after federal authorities received unspecific threats of attacks by the al Qaeda militant group on New York City, Texas and Virginia around Election Day. Tuesday will be the first time that both major party candidates have spent Election Day in New York City since 1944, when New York state's Republican governor, Thomas Dewey, tried to unseat Democrat and New Yorker Franklin Roosevelt, who went on to win an unprecedented fourth term in office.The New York City Police Department plans to station uniformed officers, including some with automatic weapons and explosives-detection equipment, across Manhattan and the city's 1,205 polling stations. All of the city's bomb-sniffing police dogs will be deployed, as well as special roving teams of officers, police said.
The candidates will also be protected by the U.S. Secret Service, which has provided security for both candidates during the presidential campaign and will work with the city police department on Tuesday.""This is by far the largest election detail that the NYPD has ever had,"" said Carlos Gomez, the chief of department. ""It's comparable to the detail size we have here on New Year's Eve and last year when Pope Francis visited.""
Trump has longstanding ties to New York City, where he was born and followed in his father's footsteps as a real estate developer. Clinton moved to the suburb of Chappaqua, New York, following President Bill Clinton's eight years in the White House, and served as a U.S. senator from the state from 2001 through 2008.

Three members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, ahead of a planned hearing late this month, said Mylan NV appears to have greatly overcharged the military for its lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen and asked the pharmaceutical company when it plans to reimburse the Department of Defense.The reimbursement demand came in a letter on Monday to Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, from Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and committee members Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, both Democrats.""We are alarmed that Mylan may have overcharged our military for this life-saving drug,"" the Senators wrote. They said Mylan for years may have knowingly misclassified EpiPen as a generic product in order to avoid higher rebates the company would have had to pay state and federal Medicaid programs had it been classified as a branded product.The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum of 23.1 percent for a branded medicine.
Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment on the letter, or its demands.The drug company has come under fire from consumers and politicians in recent months for raising the U.S. list price on a pack of two EpiPen injectors nearly six-fold to $600 since 2008. Lawmakers, including Grassley, have called for investigations into Mylan's pricing, helping put the product in the spotlight amid a larger debate over big drug price increases in the United States. 
Pentagon spending on EpiPen jumped to $57 million over the past year from $9 million in 2008, an increase driven by volume and by hefty price hikes that had a bigger bite on prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies, Reuters reported on Oct. 28, citing previously unreported data.  The Pentagon gets a government discount on EpiPens dispensed at military treatment facilities and by mail order. But nearly half of its spending was at retail pharmacies where it most recently paid an average of $509 for EpiPen and $528 for EpiPen Jr two-packs - three times higher than its discounted rate, according to the data.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold a hearing  Nov. 30 on EpiPen pricing and related matters.    (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Bill Rigby)"	['Blumenthal', 'Klobuchar']	[]

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Supreme Court justices, hearing a dispute over presidential powers a day before the U.S. election, indicated on Monday they might curb a president's authority to staff top administration posts in a case involving the National Labor Relations Board.The eight justices heard an hour-long argument in a 2014 legal challenge brought by Arizona-based private ambulance company SW General Inc to President Barack Obama's temporary appointment of Lafe Solomon in 2011 as NLRB general counsel. Obama also nominated Solomon to fill the position permanently, a move that required U.S. Senate approval.The company, a subsidiary of Envision Healthcare Holdings Inc, challenged Solomon's appointment after the labor board found SW General had committed an unfair labor practice by discontinuing bonus payments for long-term employees.If SW General wins, the NLRB order would be thrown out because of Solomon's participation.Solomon filled in for former general counsel Ronald Meisburg, who resigned in 2010. Obama withdrew Solomon's nomination after it stalled for more than two years. The Senate ultimately confirmed Richard Griffin to the post in 2013.SW General argued that Solomon should not have continued to fill the position on a temporary or ""acting"" basis pending Senate confirmation.
In a 2015 ruling against the administration, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said a 1998 federal law bars officials from serving in an acting role while awaiting Senate confirmation unless they were previously the ""first assistant"" to that post.The administration contends others who fill posts temporarily can also be nominated, including those previously confirmed by the Senate to another position.The Supreme Court in 2014 limited presidential powers in another case involving the NLRB, ruling that three 2013 appointments Obama made to the board while Congress was in recess were invalid.
Justice Anthony Kennedy questioned whether new constraints on presidential appointment power would make as much of a practical difference as Obama's administration claims, calling the system  ""quite capable of accommodating"" a ruling in favoring SW General.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said concerns about past government actions taken by acting officials being challenged retroactively were overblown.The administration said 100 appointments over the past 18 years would have been invalid under the approach sought by the company, including several in sensitive national security jobs.
Justice Elena Kagan said with the recent history of ""partisan bickering"" over appointments, ""we would have heard about it"" if members of Congress had objected in the manner the company does.The outcome of the case could assume added importance if the next president faces protracted nomination battles and opts to appoint officials on a temporary basis.A ruling is due by the end of June.

By Will Dunham

Blunt-spoken Janet Reno, who served eight years as the first woman U.S. attorney general and authorized the deadly 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian cult compound in Texas just weeks into the job, died on Monday at age 78.Reno died in Miami of Parkinson's disease complications, according to her goddaughter, Gabrielle D'Alemberte. Reno was diagnosed with the progressive central nervous system disorder in 1995.Reno served as the United States' top law enforcement official during Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency from 1993 to 2001, becoming the longest-tenured attorney general of the 20th century.She authorized the seizure by federal agents in 2000 of 6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez from relatives in Miami, as well as the government's huge antitrust case against Microsoft Corp in 1998.""Janet Reno was an American original, a public servant whose intellect, integrity and fierce commitment to justice helped shape our nation's legal landscape,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement.Clinton said on Monday, ""As attorney general for all eight years of my presidency, Janet worked tirelessly to make our communities safer, protect the vulnerable, and to strike the right balance between seeking justice and avoiding abuse of power.""The former Miami prosecutor, picked by Clinton only after his first two choices for the job ran into trouble, exhibited an independent streak and a brusque manner that often upset the White House.Reno weathered White House complaints that she was not a team player and that she sought too many special prosecutors to investigate cases, including the Whitewater affair involving the finances of the president and first lady Hillary Clinton. WACO RAID
Reno was only 38 days into the attorney general's job when she approved the April 19, 1993, FBI raid that led to the deaths of about 80 people, including many children, at the Branch Davidian cult compound in Waco, Texas.
Federal agents had earlier tried to serve a warrant on the cult's leader, David Koresh, who said he was the Messiah, for stockpiling weapons. Four agents and six cult members were killed in an ensuing shootout, leading to a 51-day standoff.With negotiations at an impasse, Reno gave the go-ahead for the raid after hearing reports of child abuse in the compound. The raid on the heavily armed cultists ended in an inferno that engulfed the site.""I made the decision. I'm accountable. The buck stops with me,"" a grim-looking Reno told a news conference later.Reno took a personal interest in the political tussle over Elian Gonzalez, the young shipwreck survivor whose mother drowned fleeing Cuba. Reno met the boy and his Miami relatives, who battled to keep him from returning to communist Cuba, and his father and grandmothers, who wanted to raise Gonzalez in his homeland.Reno argued that Elian belonged with his father and acted after the Miami relatives defied a U.S. government order to hand him over. She authorized armed agents to take the boy from his relatives' home in a predawn raid in April 2000 and reunite him with his father, who took him back to Cuba.
The raid infuriated members of Miami's Cuban exile community, who called her a ""witch"" and a lackey of Cuban President Fidel Castro.MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE
In 1998, Reno's Justice Department brought a huge antitrust case against Microsoft. Two years later, a federal judge ordered the breakup of the software giant because it had ignored his ruling that it had used unlawful monopolistic practices.The case was settled in 2001 by the administration of President George W. Bush, Clinton's Republican successor, in terms seen as favorable to Microsoft.
Reno appeared with Clinton after the 1995 truck bombing of  the Oklahoma City federal building that killed 168 people, and vowed to seek the death penalty for the perpetrators.Convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in 2001 become the first federal prisoner executed since 1963. McVeigh said he carried out the attack to punish the U.S. government for the Waco cult raid and another raid in Idaho.Some comedians made fun of Reno during her time in office, lampooning her appearance and 6-foot-2 height (1.88-meter), among them Will Ferrell who impersonated her on ""Saturday Night Live."" Shortly after leaving office, she appeared on the show next to Ferrell, both wearing identical outfits, in a sketch called ""Janet Reno's Dance Party.""Reno was in the job longer than anyone except William Wirt, who held it from November 1817 until March 1829.Reno ran for governor in Florida in 2002, but lost in the Democratic primary.Parkinson's disease caused trembling in her arms. ""All it does is shake, and you get used to it shaking after a while,"" she told a TV interviewer.Reno was born on July 21, 1938, in Miami to parents who were newspaper reporters. She attended public schools in Miami and earned a chemistry degree at Cornell University in 1960.She received her law degree from Harvard three years later, and worked as a lawyer in Miami.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE President Barack Obama remains confident in FBI Director James Comey's ability to the lead the agency in the aftermath of the probe of Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, the White House said on Monday.""The president views Director Comey as a man of integrity, a man of principle,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing. ""The president's views of him have not changed. ... He continues to have confidence in his ability to run the FBI."" Comey has faced intense criticism for his decision to inform Congress days before Tuesday's presidential election about newly discovered emails that might pertain to the investigation of Clinton's use of a private server while secretary of state.
He roiled the race again on Sunday when he told lawmakers that investigators had completed their review of the additional emails and there was no change to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's July finding that there was no criminal wrongdoing in Clinton's use of the server.The White House, which has attempted to remain neutral on Comey's handling of the probe, said on Monday it had not been given any advance notice of the announcement on Sunday.
""The president is entirely confident that Director Comey is not using his authority to advantage a particular political candidate or particular party,"" Earnest said.

By Julia Harte
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Personnel from the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division will be deployed to polling sites in 28 states to monitor Tuesday's election, five more than it monitored in the 2012 election, the department said on Monday.Most of those states will receive Justice Department staff who have no statutory authority to access polling sites as a result of a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, curtailing the department's ability to deploy election observers with unfettered access to the polls.More than 500 Justice Department personnel will be deployed on Tuesday, compared to more than 780 personnel the department dispatched during the 2012 general election. A Justice Department spokesman declined to say how many of Tuesday's personnel will be full-access observers.      Tuesday's hotly contested election, including the presidential race pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton, will be the first in decades in which the Justice Department can only send full-access observers to states where a federal court ruling has authorized it.
On the campaign trail, Trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities. Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare. ""As always, our personnel will perform these duties impartially, with one goal in mind: to see to it that every eligible voter can participate in our elections to the full extent that federal law provides,"" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a statement.    
Courts have granted the Justice Department permission to deploy full-access observers in five states: Alaska, California, Louisiana, New York, and Alabama. But the court order for Alabama only pertains to municipal elections and it is not on the list of states where the Justice Department is deploying poll watchers this year. The Justice Department staff who are deployed to the other 24 states on Tuesday will be election ""monitors"", who must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations.
""In most cases, voters on the ground will see very little practical difference between monitors and observers,"" said Vanita Gupta, the head of the department's civil rights division, in a statement. (Reporting by Julia Harte; Editing by Will Dunham and Alistair Bell)"	['Trump', 'Lynch']	[]

By Amy Tennery
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Facebook said on Monday it would partner with 50 broadcast stations, print and online publications for an Election Day live video blitz, as the social media company aims to build on the momentum of its popular Facebook Live video streaming service. The move comes as Facebook and rival sites like Twitter increasingly embrace live video to draw in users and boost traffic.Facebook warned last week that revenue growth would slow this quarter because of ""ad load,"" or the number of ads that Facebook can put in front of customers without alienating them, offsetting strong earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates.Each outlet partnering with Facebook will publish a 15-minute live video centered on the presidential election in one of the 50 states. The content will be featured on Facebook's ""Election 2016"" site on Tuesday and include the hashtag #50states.While Facebook is not selling ads on the Election Day livestreams, it could generate more visits to the site, bolstering its reputation as a destination for live news and pushing back against Twitter, where users often ""live-tweet"" major events.
Asked whether the Facebook Live initiative was a response to the popularity of ""live-tweeting"" events among social media users, Jason White, manager of U.S. news media partnerships at Facebook, said Facebook Live was something that ""works really well on our platform.""""I think for us we really wanted to give the news media and especially local (outlets) something to raly around on Election day,"" said White, regarding the 50 States project. He said the company is exploring the possibility of including advertising breaks in live video in the future but said that no specific plans had been made yet.
Frank Mungeam, vice president of digital content for broadcast and digital media firm TEGNA, told Reuters that six of his company's local broadcast stations, one each from Colorado, Washington state, Minnesota, Idaho, Maine and South Carolina, were participating. Mungeam, who said Facebook was not paying his company for the content, added: ""Facebook's platform offers an extended reach.""Twitter said last week its government-focused handle, @gov, would provide election information to users via direct message, while Snapchat on Sunday featured a photo filter encouraging people to vote.Facebook launched Facebook Live for selected public figures in 2015 and made it available to all users in April 2016, allowing members to broadcast video live from their smartphones.
Social media sites have been seizing on live video content to attract users. In September, Twitter broadcast its first National Football League game, attracting generally positive feedback. It launched its livestreaming app, Periscope, in March 2015.Asked about live-streaming video and social media in general, Stefan Sideris, director of global social media operations at Amobee, a digital marketing technology company, said he saw a clear trend toward bigger companies adopting the technology.""Brands and media companies are interested in connecting and engaging with consumers to bring the conversation together over live video,"" Sideris said. ""Live will ultimately drive a lot of social activity."" (Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	[]	[]

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton led Republican Donald Trump by 6 percentage points among likely U.S. voters in a Monmouth University poll released on Monday, a day before the U.S. presidential election.The survey of 802 registered voters found 50 percent backed Clinton while 44 percent supported Trump, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, the university said in a statement. Its last poll released on Oct. 17 found Clinton up by 12 points, it said.
Several other national opinion polls released earlier on Monday showed Clinton with a 3-point or 4-point advantage.

""I thought rather than sit and stew and be despondent I would try to find something really empowering and positive to do and clearly, as was shown here, there's a real energy and desire by a lot of people to just be proud and loud and supportive,"" Poslosky said.Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady who is hoping to become the first woman elected to the White House, has faced frequent scrutiny of her appearance during her years in the public eye including criticism of her hair style.
