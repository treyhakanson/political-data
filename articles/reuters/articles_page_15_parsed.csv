By Valerie Volcovici and Alister Doyle
| WASHINGTON/MARRAKESH, Morocco

WASHINGTON/MARRAKESH, Morocco President-elect Donald Trump is seeking quick ways to withdraw the United States from a global accord to combat climate change, a source on his transition team said, defying broad global backing for the plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Since Trump's election victory on Tuesday, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed support for the 2015 Paris agreement during climate talks involving 200 nations set to run until Friday in Marrakesh, Morocco.Trump has called global warming a hoax and has promised to quit the Paris Agreement, which was strongly supported by outgoing Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama.Trump's advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord, according to the source, who works on Trump's transition team for international energy and climate policy.""It was reckless for the Paris agreement to enter into force before the election"" on Tuesday, the source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Paris accord won enough backing for entry into force on Nov. 4, four days before the election.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday in New Zealand the Obama administration would do everything it could to implement the Paris accord before Trump takes office.The accord says in its Article 28 that any country wanting to pull out after signing on has to wait four years. In theory, the earliest date for withdrawal would be Nov. 4, 2020, around the time of the next U.S. presidential election.The source said the future Trump administration is weighing alternatives to accelerate the pull-out: sending a letter withdrawing from the 1992 international framework accord that is the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement; voiding U.S. involvement in both in a year's time; or issuing a presidential order simply deleting the U.S. signature from the Paris accord.
Withdrawing from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) would be controversial, partly because it was signed by former Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and approved by the U.S. Senate. The action also could antagonize many other countries. [L8N1DB41L]The UNFCCC sets a goal of avoiding ""dangerous"" man-made damage to the climate to avert more heat waves, downpours, floods, extinctions of animals and plants and rising sea levels.The 2015 Paris Agreement is much more explicit, seeking to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.Many nations have expressed hope that the United States will stay. But the host of the current round of climate negotiations, Morocco, said the pact that seeks to phase out greenhouse gases in the second half of the century was strong enough to survive a pullout.
One party deciding to withdraw would not call the agreement into question, Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar told a news conference.In Beijing on Monday, the foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a regular news briefing that China would like to continue working with all countries, including the United States, in the global fight against climate change. The agreement was reached by almost 200 nations in December and, as of Saturday, has been formally ratified by 109 representing 76 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, including the United States with 18 percent.The accord seeks to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to increasing economic damage from desertification, extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa declined to comment on the Trump source's remarks to Reuters.
""The Paris Agreement carries an enormous amount of weight and credibility,"" Espinosa told a news conference.She said the United Nations hoped for a strong and constructive relationship with Trump.The Trump source said the president-elect's transition team is aware of the likely international backlash but said Republicans in the U.S. Congress have given ample warning that a Republican administration would take action to reverse course.""The Republican Party on multiple occasions has sent signals to the international community signaling that it doesn't agree with the pact. We've gone out of our way to give notice,"" the source said.The source blamed Obama for joining up by an executive order, without getting approval from the U.S. Senate.""There wouldn't be this diplomatic fallout on the broader international agenda if Obama hadn't rushed the adoption,"" the source said.

By John Whitesides and Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday picked Reince Priebus, a Washington insider who heads the Republican National Committee, as White House chief of staff, signaling a willingness to work with Congress to advance his agenda when he takes office in January.But while giving the influential post to the low-key  Priebus, Trump handed another senior White House job to rabble-rousing conservative media figure Stephen Bannon, his campaign chairman who helped engineer his surprise victory on Tuesday over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Priebus is a friend of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who distanced himself from Trump during the campaign but embodies the Republican establishment in Washington and will play a critical role in shepherding Trump's agenda in Congress. Both Priebus and Ryan are from Wisconsin.But Bannon, former head of the right-wing Breitbart News website, has been fiercely critical of Ryan.Trump's statement announcing the appointments said Bannon and Priebus would be ""working as equal partners to transform the federal government,"" with Bannon serving as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president.The White House chief of staff serves as a gatekeeper and agenda-setter for the president, but Trump's statement mentioned Bannon's job first.""I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House.""Before joining Trump's team, Bannon spearheaded Breitbart's shift into a forum for the ""alt-right,"" a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semitics. Bannon's hiring by Trump's campaign this year signaled the businessman's dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington.Under Bannon's leadership, the Breitbart site presented a number of conspiracy theories about Clinton as well as Republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides. Critics have accused Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments. In a 2007 court filing during divorce proceedings, Bannon's former wife accused him of making anti-Semitic comments on at least three occasions. 
As head of Breitbart, he repeatedly attacked the Republican Party establishment including Ryan, alienating many veteran Republicans. Bannon showed his willingness to engage in brutal political tactics when he instigated the appearance before a presidential debate of three women who said they had been sexually abused by his Democratic rival's husband, former President Bill Clinton.Trump, who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, has been contemplating the candidates for top jobs in the White House and in various Cabinet positions since Tuesday's victory.Priebus' appointment could anger some hardline Trump supporters who were counting on Trump to keep his campaign promise to ""drain the swamp"" of business-as-usual Washington insiders.Priebus is a longtime Wisconsin political operative who was credited with marshaling party resources for Trump's White House bid. The Republican National Committee stepped in and ran most of the party's get-out-the-vote effort this year in the absence of such an operation by the Trump campaign.While some Republicans fled from Trump during the campaign, Priebus was unwavering in his backing for the New York real estate developer.
Priebus frequently traveled with Trump on the campaign trail and was seen as a positive force who helped rein in the unpredictable Trump in the closing weeks. Trump made his high regard for Priebus known on election night when he pulled him to the microphone to take a bow for his campaign efforts.BORDER WALL
Trump and his advisers already have hedged on some of his major campaign promises, including on immigration, healthcare and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton.Trump, in an interview that aired on Sunday, backed away from his promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, saying some areas could instead be ""fencing.""
Trump, whose pledge to force Mexico to pay for a border wall was a centerpiece of his White House, said in ""certain areas"" he would accept fencing instead of a brick-and-mortar wall, according to his interview with the CBS program ""60 Minutes.""""But certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction, there could be some fencing,"" he said.In the ""60 Minutes"" interview, Trump said Americans alarmed by his election had nothing to fear. ""Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid,"" he said.Demonstrators in major U.S. cities took to the streets on Sunday for a fifth straight day to protest against Trump.Trump said in the interview that once he takes office, he would remove immigrants with criminal records who are in the country illegally.During the campaign, Trump said he would deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, most of whom are Hispanic.Ryan on Sunday backed away from Trump's promise during the campaign of a ""deportation force"" to round up and deport immigrants in the country illegally.""We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that,"" Ryan told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""I think we should put people's minds at ease. That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border.""

By Alexander Besant
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Demonstrators in major U.S. cities took to the streets on Sunday for a fifth straight day to protest President-elect Donald Trump, whose campaign manager said President Barack Obama and Democrat Hillary Clinton should do more to support a peaceful transition.Following several nights of unrest, crowds of people marched in parks in New York City, San Francisco and Oakland, California, according to social media.A few thousand joined a march at the south end of Manhattan's Central Park, beginning at a Trump property on Columbus Circle and walking toward the real estate mogul's skyscraper headquarters less than a mile (1.6 km) away.They chanted: ""Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcomed here,"" and held signs such as ""White silence = violence"" and ""Don't mourn, organize."" One protester said demonstrators were reclaiming what the American flag he was holding stood for.""The flag means freedom of speech, freedom of religion, equal protection under the law and other values like diversity, respecting differences, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press,"" said Daniel Hayman, 31, of Seattle, who was in New York for work. ""We're trying to reclaim the flag and push forward those values.""Thousands in several cities have demonstrated since the results from Tuesday's election showed Trump, a Republican, lost the popular tally but secured enough votes in the 538-member Electoral College to win the presidency, surprising the world.Largely peaceful demonstrators in urban areas have said Trump threatens their civil and human rights. They have decried Trump's often inflammatory campaign rhetoric about illegal immigrants, Muslims and women, as well as allegations, which he denies, that the former reality TV star sexually abused women.Dozens have been arrested, including 71 in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday night, according to police, and a handful of police injured.
'LET'S MAKE WAVES'
In San Francisco on Sunday, about 1,000 people marched through Golden Gate Park toward a beach where they chanted: ""Let's make waves."" They held signs such as ""I resist racism"" and ""Down with the Trumps."" Across the bay in Oakland, thousands of protesters joined a festival-like atmosphere, holding peace signs and blowing soap bubbles in the sunshine. Many had brought their children, aiming to hold hands around the 3.4-mile (5.5-km) circumference of Lake Merritt in a popular urban park.Civil rights groups have monitored violence against U.S. minorities since Trump's win, citing reports of attacks on women in Islamic head scarves, of racist graffiti and of bullying of immigrant children. They have called on Trump to denounce the attacks.Trump said he was 'so saddened' to hear of instances of violence by some of his supporters against minorities, according to a transcript released on Sunday of an interview with the CBS program '60 Minutes.'
'THIS MAN IS OUR PRESIDENT'
Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said on Fox News on Sunday that she was sure many of the protesters were paid professionals, although she offered no proof.Suggesting a double standard, Conway said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that if Clinton had won the election and Trump supporters had protested, ""people would be freaking out that his supporters were not accepting election results.""""It's time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters: 'This man is our president,'"" she said.
Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN on Sunday that protests were protected by the First Amendment as long as they were peaceful. Neither Obama nor Clinton has called for an end to the protests. Obama told Trump at the White House on Thursday that he was going to help Trump succeed, ""because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.""Clinton told supporters at a New York hotel on Wednesday: ""Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.""Trump on Sunday attacked the New York Times for coverage he said was ""very poor and highly inaccurate."" ""The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?"" Trump wrote on Twitter.The newspaper published a letter in Sunday's editions from publisher Arthur Sulzberger and executive editor Dean Baquet, not apologizing, but thanking readers for their loyalty and asking how news outlets underestimated Trump's support.The Times plans to ""hold power to account, impartially and unflinchingly"" during the Trump presidency, they wrote.

For-profit education stocks have surged on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican Congress may ease regulations imposed on the industry by the Obama administration, Barron's said in a report.Stocks such as Grand Canyon Education, DeVry Education Group and Capella Education rose about 14 percent last week. Trump won an upset victory in Tuesday's presidential election. Jeff Silber at BMO Capital Markets said Trump's election could be good news for for-profit education companies, according to Barron's.A federal court trial in San Diego is set to begin on Nov. 28 over claims by former students of now-defunct Trump University that they were defrauded by a series of real estate seminars.

By Chris Prentice
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Facebook Inc chief executive Mark Zuckerberg again rejected the idea that the social network affected the U.S. presidential election, saying late Saturday it is ""extremely unlikely"" news hoaxes changed the outcome.Ensnared in a string of content controversies in recent months, Facebook has insisted that it is a technology company, not a media firm. But scrutiny of the site has heightened since the surprise election of Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday, with critics alleging the site helped spread lies via fake news stories and hoaxes. Zuckerberg has vehemently defended the network against such criticism, calling the idea that Facebook affected the election  ""crazy"" at a conference on Thursday. He echoed that stance in his late Saturday post, though he said the company would do more to prevent fake news. Such hoaxes represent a sliver of content shared on Facebook and because they are not limited to partisan views or politics, it is unlikely they could have changed the election's outcome, Zuckerberg said.""Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,"" he said, noting the network's goal is to ""give every person a voice.""Still, Facebook has launched work to enable people to flag hoaxes and fake news, the statement said.
Facebook has faced a number of content controversies this year, including international outcry after it removed an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, a decision that was later reversed. The thorniest content issues are decided by a group of top executives at Facebook.Questions over content policing have returned to the fore in the tense days since the election, which has led to protests against Trump and his proposed policies in major U.S. cities.
Ahead of the Nov. 8 election, Facebook users saw fake news reports erroneously alleging that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead.Senior management have launched a conversation to examine Facebook's involvement in affecting opinions and votes, The New York Times reported on Saturday, saying a group of vice presidents and executives began discussing late Tuesday the company's role in the election's outcome. Facebook's policy team was called together and the firm plans to address staff concerns at a broader meeting, the paper reported, citing anonymous sources. 
Facebook representatives were not immediately available to comment on the report.""After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading,"" Zuckerberg said on Saturday. ""These are very important questions and I care deeply about getting them right."" (Reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Mary Milliken)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Tracy Rucinski
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has requested that a trial over a lawsuit by former students of his now-defunct Trump University be put on hold until after the presidential inauguration, according to a motion filed by his lawyer late Saturday.A trial in federal court in San Diego over former Trump University students' claims that they were defrauded by a series of real-estate seminars is scheduled to begin on Nov. 28, but Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said the president-elect needs to ""devote all of his time and attention to the transition process.""Trump is due to assume office on Jan. 20, 2017. ""The 69 days until inauguration are critical and all-consuming,"" Petrocelli said in the filing, arguing that the president-elect should not be required to stand trial during that time.Petrocelli had said at a hearing in San Diego on Thursday that he would request the delay, though U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing the lawsuit, told lawyers he was not inclined to put off the six-year-old case further and encouraged the parties to settle.
The lawsuit involves students who claim they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing ""secrets"" from his ""hand-picked"" instructors.Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students' court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business. 
Curiel also tentatively rejected last week a bid by the president-elect to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign, which included attacks against Curiel himself, out of the fraud trial. Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trump's election campaign pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Trump's lawyers have argued that Curiel should bar from the trial accusations about Trump's personal conduct including alleged sexual misconduct, his taxes and corporate bankruptcies, along with speeches and tweets.
Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit by New York's attorney general is pending.While presidents enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that this shield does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office.

By Luciana Lopez and Ginger Gibson
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton blamed FBI director James Comey for her stunning defeat in Tuesday's presidential election in a conference call with her top campaign funders on Saturday, according to two participants who were on the call. Clinton was projected by nearly every national public opinion poll as the heavy favorite going into Tuesday's race. Instead, Republican Donald Trump won the election, shocking many throughout the nation and prompting widespread protests.Clinton has kept a low profile since her defeat after delivering her concession speech on Wednesday morning. Clinton told her supporters on Saturday that her team had drafted a memo that looked at the changing opinion polls leading up to the election and that the letter from Comey proved to be a turning point. She said Comey's decision to go public with the renewed examination of her email server had caused an erosion of support in the upper Midwest, according to three people familiar with the call.Clinton lost in Wisconsin, the first time since 1984 that the state favored the Republican candidate in a presidential election. Although the final result in Michigan has still not been tallied, it is leaning Republican, in a state that last favored the Republican nominee in 1988.Comey sent a letter to Congress only days before the election announcing that he was reinstating an investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information when she used a private email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2012. Comey announced a week later that he had reviewed emails and continued to believe she should not be prosecuted, but the political damage was already done.
Clinton told donors that Trump was able to seize on both of Comey's announcements and use them to attack her, according to two participants on the call.While the second letter cleared her of wrongdoing, Clinton said that it reinforced to Trump's supporters that the system was rigged in her favor and motivated them to mobilize on Election Day.The memo prepared by Clinton's campaign, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said voters who decided which candidate to support in the last week were more likely to support Trump than Clinton.""In the end, late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome,"" the memo concludes.
A spokesperson for the FBI could not immediately be reached for comment.On the phone call, Dennis Chang, who served as Clinton's finance chair, said her campaign and the national party had raised more than $900 million from more than 3 million individual donors, according to the two participants who spoke to Reuters.TRUMP: 'RESTRAINED' TWITTER PRESENCE

As Clinton gave her account to donors, Trump hunkered down at Trump Tower with members of the transition team announced on Friday and tasked with selecting the 15 Cabinet posts and thousands of political appointment jobs.Kellyanne Conway, who served as his campaign manager, said on Saturday that the an announcement of a new chief of staff is ""imminent."" Two candidates whose names have surfaced as contenders for the top White House job are campaign CEO Steve Bannon and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.Trump will deliver a speech about his plans moving forward in the coming days and may undertake a national victory tour, Conway said, without providing further details. He will be sworn in on January 20.The president-elect plans to keep his communication channels open. In an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air on Sunday, Trump said he isn't ready to give up his Twitter account, where he routinely posted controversial statements during the campaign that unleashed harsh criticism. ""I'm going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to be very restrained,"" Trump said.

By Daniel Wallis and Kylie MacLellan
| NEW YORK/LONDON

NEW YORK/LONDON Leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage visited Donald Trump at his home on Saturday, after suggesting he could act as a go-between to help smooth British relations with the U.S. president-elect.British Prime Minister Theresa May is not expected to meet the incoming leader until early next year and Farage has suggested her criticisms of Trump in the early days of the campaign could damage ties with Washington.    ""We're just tourists!"" Farage, head of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), told reporters as he waited for an elevator to take him up to the meeting at Trump Tower in New York City.He later tweeted a photograph of himself with Trump standing in front of a pair of golden doors and smiling broadly, the president-elect giving the camera a thumbs-up.""It was a great honor to spend time with @realDonaldTrump,"" Farage tweeted. ""He was relaxed and full of good ideas. I'm confident he will be a good President.""    Trump's election campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said: ""I think they enjoy each other's company, and they actually had a chance to talk about freedom and winning and what this all means for the world."" In a separate photograph posted on Twitter, UKIP donor Arron Banks, Breitbart London Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam, and Gerry Gunster, an American whose advocacy firm worked on the Brexit campaign, were also pictured with Trump and Farage. May - who spoke to Trump by phone on Thursday - and her predecessor David Cameron last year described Trump as ""divisive"" and ""wrong"" over his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. At that time he was not considered likely to win the presidency.
In a leaked diplomatic telegram, sent on Nov. 9 and printed in the Sunday Times newspaper, Britain's ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, said he believed Britain had built better relationships with Trump's team than other foreign diplomats.""(Trump) is above all an outsider and an unknown quantity, whose campaign pronouncements may reveal his instincts, but will surely evolve and, particularly, be open to outside influence if pitched right,"" he said. ""We should be well placed to do this.""""GROW UP""

While the British government has congratulated Trump on his election, the head of the opposition, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said he should ""grow up"" on the immigration issue and recognize that the U.S. economy depends on migrant workers. ""The treatment of Mexico by the United States, just as much as its absurd and abusive language towards Muslims, is something that has to be challenged and should be challenged,"" Corbyn, whose wife is Mexican, told the BBC on Sunday.UKIP, which has only one member of parliament in London, said Farage and Trump spent more than an hour discussing Trump's victory, global politics and Brexit.A UKIP official has suggested Farage could even be the next ambassador to the United States, but British media reported that May's office rejected the idea of any role for Farage, citing unnamed sources who described him as an ""irrelevance"".
A day after Trump's election victory, Farage called on the real estate mogul to reverse ""loathsome"" Barack Obama's policy by making Britain his top priority. Farage said he had been pleased at Trump's ""very positive reaction"" to the idea that a bust of former British prime minister Winston Churchill be put back in the Oval Office.He has also joked about sexual assault allegations against Trump, urging him to ""schmooze"" May but not touch her. He proposed that in any meetings between the British and American leaders, he could attend to be the ""responsible adult to make sure everything is OK.""    Farage, who spoke at a Trump rally during the election campaign, had predicted the former reality TV host would tap into the same dissatisfaction among voters that led to Britain deciding on June 23 to leave the European Union.Trump made repeated references to Brexit during his campaign, saying it had highlighted the desire for change among voters frustrated with traditional politics.(Story refiles to add dropped word ""the"" in first paragraph.)

By Patrick Rucker and Lisa Lambert
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. officials are striving to put finishing touches on a slew of banking rules before President Barack Obama leaves office and hands regulatory power to Donald Trump who has vowed to rewrite the existing financial rule book.President-elect Trump will take over on Jan. 20 and his fellow Republicans will have control of Congress and government agencies, allowing the new administration to block or roll back many of the last-minute changes.But by completing far-advanced work on some banking standards in the next 10 weeks, Obama officials would raising the chances that some elements of the regulatory framework will survive.Some rules are meant to flesh out the Dodd Frank Act of 2010 designed to prevent the next global financial crisis. Trump campaigned on a pledge to scrap the law but now he says only some provisions must go to lighten the regulatory burden.The Federal Reserve is working on rules to govern matters such as executive pay, market stability and what investments Wall Street may hold.Last month, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White said her agency would ""in the near term"" finish a rule on one thorny issue: how mutual funds manage derivatives.The SEC and bank regulators have also for years struggled to finalize a rule that would tie more banker pay to the long-term health of their firms rather than short-term performance of Wall Street firms.With only about 40 working days until the handover, it is not clear which, if any, of those standards will get across the finishing line.
""Just look at the calendar,"" said Tom Quaadman of the Chamber of Commerce. ""These are intricate rules and there's not much time.""The executive pay rule exemplifies the challenge.Six federal agencies have a say on the compensation standard meant as part of Dodd Frank and a final draft has not yet been offered, industry officials told Reuters.It would be nearly impossible to circulate a final rule and get the agencies to endorse it while still satisfying standards for clearing such paperwork, several lobbyists who have opposed the rule said.Banking regulators declined to comment on when the compensation rule might be completed.
NO TIME TO CHAT
Simple logistics also pose a challenge.New federal rules come into force once they have been published in the Federal Register and employees there typically need several days to typeset a rule.
That means Obama officials need to lodge paperwork with the Federal Register at the beginning of the inauguration week at the latest.Some sixteen copy editors are due to forego leave and be on hand in the coming weeks to process final rules expected from dozens of agencies, said an official familiar with the operation, but not authorized to speak to the media.""These days, people do not spend a lot of time hanging around the coffee maker,"" he said.Some freshly-minted rules also face the prospect of getting erased under a 1996 law known as the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to block a regulation within 60 working days of being drafted.One such rule allows students who were defrauded by for-profit colleges to seek loan forgiveness. The Department of Education finalized it days before the Nov. 8 election, meaning Republicans who have raised objections to it will have a chance to block it.President George W. Bush was the first to trigger the Review Act when he block labor regulations that his predecessor Bill Clinton had enacted at the end of his term.
