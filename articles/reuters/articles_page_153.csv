By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican foreign policy veterans and outside experts warned that the suggestion by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that he might abandon NATO's pledge to automatically defend all alliance members could destroy an organization that has helped keep the peace for 66 years and could invite Russian aggression.""Statements like these make the world more dangerous and the United States less safe,"" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump critic who is one of the Republican Party's leading foreign policy voices and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on Thursday.""I can only imagine how our allies in NATO, particularly the Baltic states, must feel after reading these comments from Mr. Trump. I'm 100 percent certain how Russian President Putin feels - he's a very happy man,"" he said.Trump's comments in a New York Times interview ""would seem to put him on the same page with Mr. Putin,"" Richard Armitage, who was deputy secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview with Reuters.In the New York Times interview, Trump, in response to a question about potential Russian aggression toward the Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - said that if Moscow attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing whether those nations ""have fulfilled their obligations to us."" He added, ""If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.""""It's the end of NATO,"" Robert Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to the alliance under President Bill Clinton, told Reuters. ""The essence of NATO, more than any other single factor, is the commitment of the United States of America to the security of the other 27 members.""Asked about Trump's comments, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the EU knows it needs to ""work more on our defense capabilities,"" but said the United States needs to keep solidarity with its allies.""It's very simple to realize that in the world of today, which is quite a complicated one and quite a dangerous one, you need friends,"" said Mogherini, who spoke in Washington at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
""INFLAMMATORY REMARKS""
A letter signed by a bipartisan group of 39 national security experts said Trump's ""inflammatory remarks"" do not represent the interests of the United States.""The strength of our alliances is at the core of those interests,"" said the group, which includes prominent Republicans such as former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former State Department official Eliot Cohen.The United States must uphold the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's commitments ""to all of our allies, including Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,"" the letter said.U.S. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the mutual defense commitment was the essence of the Atlantic alliance.
But he added that both Republicans and Democrats ""are becoming exasperated that most members of the alliance are not honoring their obligations"" for military spending, Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said in a statement.Responding to Trump's suggestion that his decisions would depend in part on whether states that were attacked were meeting their financial commitments to the alliance, former diplomat Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said it is important not to see NATO or any alliance solely in budget terms.""More important is the net benefit the U.S. derives from the stability and security of the country and region affected and the price the U.S. would pay if stability were to be lost or its interests undermined,"" Haass told Reuters.Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO in 1949 and calls an attack on one member an attack on all, has been invoked once - to help defend the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Following the attacks, NATO sent AWACS planes to patrol over U.S. skies, with more than 800 crew members from 13 NATO countries flying over 360 sorties. As part of the eight measures approved to support the United States, NATO, about three weeks later, sent elements of its Standing Naval Forces to patrol the Eastern Mediterranean and monitor shipping, expanding that to include the entire Mediterranean several months later.A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also noted that the alliance ""deployed a third of the troops in Afghanistan for over a decade, where over one thousand soldiers from non-U.S. NATO allies and partners gave their lives.""Still, some experts downplayed Trump's comments, even as they criticized them.Kurt Volker, who was U.S. ambassador to NATO under both Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama, said it was inadvisable to create doubts in adversaries' minds about the consequences they would face if they invaded a country.""Putin loves it,"" Volker said.But he said the general European attitude was to take Trump's pronouncements with a grain of salt. ""Everyone knows it's an election campaign,"" he said.

WASHINGTON The Obama administration, like every U.S. administration since 1949, remained committed to the NATO military alliance and  security commitments under the treaty, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday. ""I want our NATO partner to be clear where we stand. This administration, like every single administration Republican or Democratic alike since 1949, remains fully committed to the NATO alliance and to our security commitments on the Article 5,"" Kerry told a news conference.
He was responding to comments by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who told the New York Times that if elected he might abandon NATO's guarantee that any member, including the United States, would defend the others if they were attacked.

By James Oliphant and Emily Stephenson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND On the floor and corridors of the basketball arena hosting the Republican National Convention, in restaurants and bars, hotel lobbies and conference rooms across Cleveland, the talk was of the rise of Donald Trump, whose unlikely presidential candidacy has caused seismic fractures in the Republican Party.While the venues changed, the question didn't: Where do we go from here?This was the week that Trump was officially nominated as the Republicans' 2016 presidential candidate and was effectively given control of a party whose leaders have criticized him for his incendiary rhetoric, personal attacks on fellow Republicans, and tendency to stray from decades-old party orthodoxy. He packed the convention hall with his grassroots army of supporters, who seemed almost completely disinterested in his policy positions, even though they could reshape the party for years to come on core issues like trade, immigration and foreign policy.Those who were interested - party veterans, lawmakers, donors and lobbyists - found little clarity in any of the speeches delivered from the convention stage or in conversations with members of the Trump campaign.Are we still a party that embraces free trade and free markets, they asked. Are we still committed to ending abortion rights? Do we want to create a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants or ship all of them out of the country?Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and the most powerful elected Republican, acknowledged that Trump has transformed his party. But he hedged on whether he believes Trump's impact will be lasting or simply a temporary phenomenon that will dissipate if he loses on Nov. 8. ""I don't know the answer to that question. I really have no idea,"" Ryan said at an event in Cleveland. Trump had changed the party, he said, but ""how specifically and in what direction, I don't know."" Even after two days of speeches, Utah delegate Matt Throckmorton was still trying to figure out what a Trump presidency would mean for the Republican Party.""What happens next?"" asked Throckmorton.BIG STAGE, FEW DETAILS
In many way the uncertainty about Trump reflects the conflict within the Republican electorate. The party has struggled to find consensus on a number of key issues, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling during the 2016 campaign season.For example, when asked in March about international trade, the same number of Republicans said it ""creates jobs"" as said it ""causes job losses.""When asked about abortion in June, the number of Republicans who wanted it to be illegal ""in all cases"" was matched by those who wanted it to be legal ""in most cases."" Trump had his biggest stage on Thursday night, when he officially accepted the party's nomination, to spell out his vision of where he would take the Republican Party if he won the presidency.
But his speech, rich in rhetoric, offered scant detail beyond sweeping promises to put ""America first.""""If this Trump speech - and this GOP platform -  defines what a Republican is today, then it's hard to say I'm one. Hard for a lot of us,"" tweeted Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman under President George W Bush. ""LITTLE BIT FRIGHTENING""
A week earlier, Republican activists were celebrating the adoption of a deeply conservative political platform that condemned gay marriage and opposed abortion with no exceptions, among other things.Trump's lineup of speakers at the convention this week barely referenced it. ""It's a little bit frightening,"" said Chris Herrod, another Utah delegate, explaining that the platform was one of the main ways delegates could help shape party policy. ""And he seems to have an attitude of just completely disregarding it."" Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump was ""the future of the Republican Party.""
Away from the floor, some anti-Trump Republicans were quietly debating whether it would be better in the long-term interests of the party to lose the White House in November.""This week we're having some real anguished discussions,"" said Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota. ""People are falling in line"" with Trump, Weber said, ""but what does this party believe?""Take trade, for example. Republicans have long been the party of free trade, but Trump has said current trade deals have impoverished American workers and wants to renegotiate them or in some cases block them altogether, like President Barack Obama's signature Trans-Pacific Partnership.Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a close Trump ally, worked to ease fears that a Trump administration would derail the U.S. economy by scrapping trade alliances.""He has no interest in breaking up the world market,"" Gingrich told a group of diplomats, adding that Trump was, in fact, committed to free trade with some added protections for American companies. ""Now how Trump will work this out, I have no idea,"" Gingrich added.A DAILY SURPRISE

Some attendees at the convention expressed the hope that Trump would align himself with many of their cherished conservative values but admitted they just didn't know what he would do once he was in office.They would have found little solace in Gingrich's remarks to the diplomats.""You will not know what he's doing every morning, because he will not know what he's doing every morning,"" Gingrich told them, suggesting a Trump presidency would be similar to his candidacy - reactive, spontaneous and centered almost entirely around Trump's instincts.But Trump's instincts are sometimes at odds with key elements of the party.For example, he has been more accepting of gay rights and has see-sawed on abortion rights, first defending them and then saying he opposes abortion. ""Conservatives are prepared to believe Trump might be wrong 20, 25, maybe 30 percent of the time,"" Richard Viguerie, a veteran Republican activist, told Reuters at an anti-abortion event. But, Trump's opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, ""will be wrong 100 percent of the time.""Asked if Trump supported the conservative social values espoused in the platform, he laughed. ""Well, I don't know,"" he said. ""We'll have to wait and see.""Some lawmakers at the convention dismissed some of Trump's most provocative proposals, like his vow to deport an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, as unlikely to be implemented. ""Full-blown deportation is not going to sell politically and I don't think a Republican Congress, or any Congress, would stand by and watch it happen,"" Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma told a group of convention attendees.  Some Republicans believe should Trump lose, the party will simply return to its more traditional conservative principles. ""The Republican Party is bigger than any one candidate, even a presidential candidate,"" said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster.But Trump supporters said those Republicans were in denial and that Trump had permanently wrested control of the party away from the establishment elites. ""Where's Mitt Romney, where are the Bushes?"" said Mary Lou McCoy, who had traveled to Cleveland from Buffalo, New York, referring to the 2012 Republican nominee and the Bush political dynasty. ""The people have spoken.""

By Emily Flitter
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Bourbon flowed, a jazz band played, and pink and violet lights bathed the vaulted stone ceilings at a party thrown by a liquor producers' lobby group on Monday for attendees of the Republican National Convention.Seven blocks away in Cleveland, in the arena where Donald Trump was to officially accept his party's nod for the White House, a fight boiled over between Trump supporters and foes about the rules concerning his nomination. Delegates shouted at each other. The chairman tasked with keeping order briefly abandoned the podium. Microphones went dead.Typically, the Republican convention that takes place every four years is a tale of two conventions. At the official one, activists from all 50 states come to hear testimonials about their party's presidential nominee and watch the candidate's official coronation.At the other, Republicans in the professional class - strategists, lobbyists, pollsters, lawmakers - rub elbows at cocktail hours and concerts, woo donors at power breakfasts and toss back booze at night, all the while conducting informal business, swapping pledges of support and plans for the future.This year, the disconnect between the two conventions seemed more pronounced, several lobbyists and activists said, and some parties were more subdued. The Distilled Spirits Council's soiree, normally a jam-packed affair, drew a more modest crowd this year, according to some Republicans who have attended it at past conventions.The council's senior vice president, Frank Coleman, pooh-poohed the idea that attendance was down. ""It was a very large venue,"" he said, saying that the party still attracted about 700 people over the course of the evening.Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said there was a muted tone at some Cleveland gatherings, which he attributed to the unique relationship between Trump and his party's establishment.Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate and a former Massachusetts governor, and Senator John McCain, the party's 2008 nominee, hailed from the establishment and had extensive ties with businesspeople and strategists who are convention regulars.
By contrast, Trump, a real estate developer and former reality TV star who has never held elective office, clinched the Republican nomination by touting his outsider status. ""You have a non-politician, a Hollywood entertainer trying to show Americans he's fit for office, and you have Republicans who are used to coming to these things for years,"" Bonjean said. The two groups, he said, weren't mixing so smoothly.    
SEEKING CORPORATE DONORS
Inside the convention arena on Thursday evening, Trump fans cheered, danced to a band and roared support for a succession of speakers as they awaited the event's finale - Trump's speech formally accepting the nomination. But in bars and parties nearby, there was hardly any clapping and cheering as those same scenes flashed across televisions.
Some Republicans flew in to Cleveland for only for a day or two, to host events for lawmakers and clients, then left before Trump's Thursday night speech.One lobbyist for a large industrial conglomerate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had a mission in Cleveland that had little to do with Trump: mingling with congressional Republicans and showing support for their re-election efforts.The informal convention did still take place, although more subdued. One strategist skipped a night of speeches and pageantry to gamble at a nearby casino. He won $8,000. A group of three made quick glances at a TV screen as Trump's wife, Melania, spoke on Monday night, checking on her progress between turns at a bar with bowling lanes that had been converted to a private lounge.But there were constant reminders that Cleveland was different.
As an outsider, Trump lacks the kind of donor network that is typical of major party candidates and only recently has begun to ramp up his fundraising.Before the convention started, companies that habitually donate to the RNC withheld pledges or withdrew them, leading organizers to ask casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, a generous party benefactor, for an urgent donation.A strategist who asked for help to raise a last-minute $15,000 to sponsor food and drinks at a country music concert for delegates could not find any corporate donors willing to pony up. Eight of the 12 people he contacted said they were skipping the convention entirely.On Tuesday, Trump passed up a chance to forge closer ties with more big donors when he failed to appear at a breakfast  held on the field of the new football stadium in town, according to a report in Time magazine.Later that day, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie met with donors to brief them on plans for a team that would ease Trump into office if he wins the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Such gatherings often attract billionaires and other moneyed luminaries.A man in charge of fundraising surveyed attendees in the modestly sized conference room and declared, ""I think I see about $600,000 in here.""

By Scott Malone and Daniel Trotta
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Kirtland Park, on the shores of Lake Erie near downtown Cleveland, was designated as a place where hundreds of protesters could camp during the Republican National Convention. It is less than a quarter full.One measure of the shortfall: With about 10 transportable toilets on hand Tuesday night and about 15 tents, the city was providing one plastic commode for every two campers. U.S. political conventions typically are protest magnets, and the Republican National Convention that nominated Donald Trump as its presidential candidate after a bitter primary campaign had been seen as a major draw.But three days in, the crowds were far smaller than expected. Activists said deadly attacks on police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Dallas had scared off some would-be protesters. Others saw the presence of ""open carry"" gun-rights advocates as a threat to their safety. Cleveland's heavy police presence discouraged others, protest leaders said.""I'm extremely disappointed with turnout,"" said Lee Garnett, a 39-year-old tech worker who came from San Francisco to protest Trump's nomination. As he stood in Kirtland Park on Tuesday night, about two dozen activists listened to a man strum a guitar and sing.Garnett said friends had backed out. ""It was fear of violence. Fear of violence from the police and fear of violence from the Trump supporters,"" he said, citing Trump's prediction in March of riots if he were denied the nomination. City records show three of five officially permitted protests planned for the first three days of the convention did not occur. Either organizers canceled events or supporters failed to take part, city officials said. The American Civil Liberties Union had won a court battle to reduce the size of the security area around the convention hall, arguing that people needed more space to exercise their free speech rights. But the designated 1.7-square-mile (440-hectare) ""event zone"" easily accommodated the few hundred protesters on hand at any given time. At rallies, police officers appeared swiftly and often outnumbered the protesters.On Wednesday, police arrested 18 people - the biggest number of the convention so far - after they scuffled with police while trying to set fire to an American flag near the convention entrance.
'CHILLING EFFECT'
Cleveland has put 500 police officers on the streets, backed by about 3,000 reinforcements from as far away as California and Texas. Hundreds of cops on bicycles, with others on foot and horseback, have directed and controlled crowds. ""It has a chilling effect on the exercise of free speech, which is so critical in a democratic society,"" said Terry Gilbert, a veteran Cleveland civil rights lawyer. ""That's dangerous. I think that could change the whole dynamic of protest.""Cleveland police say the events have gone smoothly so far, with little violence and only 23 convention-related arrests through Wednesday.
Cleveland activist Art McCoy, founder of civil rights group Black Man's Army, which often protests against police use of force, said his group is not marching.""We've decided to be still and observe,"" McCoy said, adding that he doubted convention protests would change relations between minorities and local police. ""The convention is just a distraction.""Local activist Rachelle Smith said the Dallas shooting, in which five people were killed, influenced her choice to act as a legal observer and adviser rather than leading protests. ""I expected numbers to be bigger - whether from people coming in from out of town or people from Cleveland getting involved,"" she said.But Christine Link, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said Clevelanders have little experience assembling large-scale protests. ""Cleveland is not Chicago or New York,"" she said. ""We don't have the activist networks, we don't have the populations of those cities.""
SENSE OF OBLIGATION
Ann Wright, 70, a member of the antiwar group Code Pink who  traveled from Honolulu, said the same fear that caused some to stay home prompted her to travel to Cleveland. ""People who have privilege - I'm a white woman, I'm a retired lieutenant colonel - have to do this because we can,"" said Wright, a former U.S. Army officer and former U.S. diplomat.Protest organizers were not giving up. On Wednesday, a group of immigrant-rights activists donned ponchos with a brick pattern and stood shoulder to shoulder in what they called a human wall. Trump has promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.""It's a beautiful sight,"" Ivan Vargas, a 28-year-old business consultant from Atlanta, said as the march kicked off. ""These are people who are ready to put their bodies on the line."" At the end of the event, piles of unworn ponchos remained on the ground.

By Yeganeh Torbati
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Pentagon on Friday updated its law of war manual after a previous version came under fire for appearing to allow commanders to treat journalists as belligerents or spies.The U.S. Department of Defense manual, the first and most comprehensive of its kind, was first released last June. It compared some of the tasks of journalism to spying or other hostile actions by an enemy.The manual said some journalists may be considered ""unprivileged belligerents"" -- a legal category with fewer protections than combatants, such as prisoner-of-war status.""Reporting on military operations can be very similar to collecting intelligence or even spying,"" one passage of the manual said.Press freedom advocates said the manual's wording blurred the line between journalists and combatants and gave commanders the authority to detain reporters without charge.They also warned that it would erode U.S. credibility abroad at a time when journalists are being targeted by governments and militant groups.Sixty-nine journalists were killed for their work in 2015, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, up from 61 in 2014. In 2015, 199 journalists were being detained worldwide, compared to 221 in 2014.
After the manual's release last year, news organizations including Reuters met with Pentagon officials to protest the language and ask for changes. The revised manual provides greater detail on the legitimate purposes that journalists serve and makes clear that journalists have all the rights of civilians.Press freedom groups, including CPJ and Reporters Without Borders, praised the revisions. Advocates said the new manual acknowledged journalists' right to interview enemy combatants and placed the onus on commanders to discern between the actions of reporters and combatants.""These are major changes,"" said Frank Smyth of the CPJ. ""This affirms the rights and the practice of open and independent reporting on the battlefield.""
The Pentagon eliminated the passages comparing reporting to spying or hostile acts, but gives specific examples of how an act of reporting could result in the loss of civilian status.Journalists could still be considered unprivileged belligerents, the manual states, if they were a member of a non-state armed group and were carrying out propaganda ""or other media activities.""Journalists could also lose their civilian status in certain cases, such as relaying target coordinates for an artillery strike against opposing forces, the manual said. 
The new manual also eliminates language that called for journalists to seek permission from ""relevant authorities"" for their work ""to avoid being mistaken for spies.""That passage drew criticism for setting an unrealistic standard for war reporting, in which frontlines can shift quickly. To cover conflicts in Libya or Syria, for instance, reporters often have to cross borders illegally.Pentagon officials also said they would be willing to revise the manual again if needed.""The department's mission is to defend the very freedoms that journalists exercise,"" the Pentagon's top lawyer, Jennifer O'Connor, said in a statement. ""We have learned a lot during this process, and the department and the manual are better off for the experience."" (Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati. Editing by David Rohde and Clive McKeef)"

By Heather Somerville
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, the only big-name supporter of Donald Trump from the country's technology hub, spoke on Thursday at the Republican National Convention to urge the country to discard petty cultural battles and turn its attention to solving the United States' economic decline.Thiel offered a full-throated endorsement of Trump, echoing the Republican candidate's themes of economic decline while  lambasting economic and foreign policies that have allowed the country to get embroiled in ""stupid wars.""""Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. Our newest fighter jets can't even fly in the rain,"" Thiel said on the final evening of the four-day convention in Cleveland.""Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East.""A co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook Inc  who sits on that company's board of directors, Thiel is well-known for contrarian and even eccentric views: a Libertarian who supports gay rights and legalizing marijuana, and who has proposed floating cities beyond the government's reach while encouraging students to drop out of college and start companies.
His support of Trump has been both a source of curiosity and the butt of jokes in Silicon Valley, where Trump's anti-immigrant, anti-trade positions are regarded with horror. Many tech executives lean Democratic, and prominent Republican tech executives such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman have also rejected Trump.Thiel, who is gay, was expected to address gay rights in front of a political party whose platform rejects gay marriage and gay rights in general. He stopped short of such an appeal, however, addressing his sexuality only when saying: ""I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American.""He is only the second openly gay man to address the Republican National Convention, CNN reported.
""When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union, and we won,"" Thiel said. ""Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?""Thiel said his support for Trump was based on the belief that the candidate could address the country's economic decline. He cited the space program and other government technology achievements as examples of what has been lost.Thiel drew parallels between himself and Trump each as a ""builder.""
His family emigrated from Germany when Thiel was one year old, and arrived in Cleveland - the city hosting this week's convention. When Thiel pointed that out, he got loud applause.Back then, Thiel said, ""Opportunity was everywhere.""""In 1968, the world's high-tech capital wasn't just one city. All of America was high-tech.""

WASHINGTON/KUALA LUMPUR The White House urged Malaysia on Thursday to demonstrate good governance and a transparent business climate, a day after U.S. prosecutors sued to try and seize $1 billion in assets they said were bought with money stolen from a state development fund.The civil lawsuits present a potentially thorny issue for the two countries that have grown closer during the administration of President Barack Obama, who has visited the southeast Asian nation twice in the last two years.The lawsuits will likely affect relations, but they did not come as a surprise, said a U.S. congressional aide. ""It has been a concern of a lot of people for a long time. Corruption in Malaysia is a huge problem,"" the aide said.No criminal charges have been filed in the scandal surrounding Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, which was overseen by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.Obama spoke generally with Najib on a visit to Malaysia last year about the need for transparency and good governance, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing.""For business interests who are considering doing business in Malaysia, they're going to be looking for signs that there is good business climate,"" Earnest told reporters.
The Malaysian government ""should be conspicuous about making clear that they're committed to transparency and good governance, and the kind of rules that will encourage people who are considering investing in Malaysia's fast-growing economy to have confidence that they can do so fairly,"" Earnest said.Najib said in response to the lawsuits that his government would give its full cooperation to international investigations of the 1MDB case.Malaysia's foreign minister Anifah Aman met the U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia Joseph Yun on Thursday to discuss the lawsuits.
""Malaysia highly values its bilateral relations with the United States and calls on the U.S. to recognize the various steps taken by the Government of Malaysia to address the 1MDB issue,"" the ministry said in a statement on Thursday night.Malaysia's Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali, however, expressed ""strong concerns at the insinuations and allegations"" of wrongdoing against Najib in the lawsuits. He said in a statement that none of the probes conducted by law enforcement agencies across the globe over the past year show that any funds were misappropriated from 1MDB.
The U.S. investigation is the largest set of cases brought by the Justice Department's Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, which seeks the forfeiture of the proceeds of foreign corruption.Targeting assets ranging from valuable paintings and a private jet to the 2013 hit movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and rights to popular songs, the civil lawsuits said $3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB.1MDB said in a statement that it was not a party to the lawsuit, did not have any assets in the United States, ""nor has it benefited from the various transactions described.""

By Ginger Gibson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he might abandon NATO's guarantee of mutual defense and would renegotiate or scrap the NAFTA trade deal if he is elected, drawing fire from some senior Republicans and his Democratic rival.In response to a question about potential Russian aggression against the Baltic states, Trump told the New York Times that  Washington would help defend other NATO members only if they had ""fulfilled their obligations to us."" All three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are former Soviet republics and now NATO members.Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort did not dispute the quotes, saying they were consistent with the candidate's desire to modernize the United States' international treaties. But national security officials and some Republicans said abandoning NATO's mutual defense guarantee, enshrined in  Article 5 of the treaty, would abandon 66 years of U.S. foreign policy and threaten the world's most powerful military alliance.Also weighing in was the campaign for Democrat Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Trump's likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election.""Trump has apparently decided that America lacks the moral authority to advance our interests and values around the world,""Clinton's senior foreign policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a statement.     
Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN he disagreed ""totally"" with Trump's comments on NATO.""It's the most important military alliance in world history. It remains relevant today. Many Americans don't know that the operation in Afghanistan is a NATO operation,"" McConnell said, adding: ""I want to reassure our NATO allies that we will come to the defense of any member that is threatened.""U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a former presidential rival of Trump, said Trump's remarks made the world more dangerous and the United States less safe.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday he would not interfere in the U.S. election campaign but that allied solidarity was a key value for the group.
""This is good for European security and good for U.S. security,"" the NATO head said in a statement. ""The United States has always stood by its European allies.""Trump previously said he would force allies to shoulder more of the defense costs that the United States has borne for decades, cancel long-standing treaties he considers unfavorable, and redefine what it means to be a partner of the United States.Stoltenberg said defense spending among European allies and Canada rose last year for the first time in many years. In 2016, he said, he expected a further 3 percent increase, or $8 billion.TRADE DISPUTESTrump has railed against the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico as a U.S. job killer and was quoted as saying in the New York Times interview that he would be prepared to scrap it if he could not negotiate much better terms for the United States.
The North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994 during the administration of President Bill Clinton, the husbandof Hillary Clinton.Unlike the NATO treaty, U.S. laws appear to give presidents  significant authority to renegotiate foreign trade deals without consulting Congress, trade experts said.    ""Trump as president would have an enormous amount of discretion,"" said Barry Bosworth, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former White House staffer.    If elected, Trump could unilaterally terminate NAFTA or any other free trade deal, although a court would likely have to decide if the president had that authority, said Gary Hufbauer, a former deputy assistant secretary for trade at the Treasury Department.    NAFTA was enacted by a law passed by Congress, but Article 2205 of the agreement allows any party to withdraw from the deal with six months' notice, and Hufbauer said U.S. courts would likely allow Trump to make that decision.    ""The president has a lot more power than is generally recognized,"" said Hufbauer, currently at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.

NEW YORK The U.S. government may become a movie and music industry player, at least temporarily, after moving to seize $1 billion in assets that prosecutors said were bought with money looted from the Malaysian state development fund. The 2013 movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and an interest in the rights of EMI Music Publishing are among the targets of civil lawsuits that are filled with allegations that Malaysian officials, their relatives and associates laundered the fund's money and hid it in property, artwork and luxury goods in the United States.Seizures of assets by government authorities are fairly common, but they more typically involve sports cars, yachts and jewelry bought with drug trafficking proceeds or with profits from white-collar crime.The case of the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB announced on Wednesday is unusually large and involves some out-of-the-ordinary assets, such as rights associated with the dark comedy film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a corrupt New York stockbroker.The film could make another $100 million in the near future, a box office analyst said.According to the lawsuits, a Malaysian national involved in creating 1MDB, Low Taek Jho, used about $10 million from 1MDB to invest in the film and separately used about $107 million to buy ""a substantial interest"" in EMI, the world's third-largest music publishing company by revenue. 
Low did not respond to requests for comment sent to his Hong Kong-based company, Jynwel Capital.U.S. government-seized assets are usually sold off at auction to raise money for victims. Until that can happen, U.S. authorities must maintain the assets, officials said.The U.S. Marshals Service manages and auctions seized assets. If a judge approves the seizure of 1MDB-linked assets, the usual process would be followed, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said.
The assets would be initially restrained so their owners could not sell or transfer them. Any profits generated would be held in escrow until the case was resolved, Carr said.""We would sell those interests and, if possible and appropriate, use the proceeds of those sales for the benefit of the victim citizens in Malaysia,"" Carr said in an email. In the 1990s, the government owned shares in a California casino and through a trustee helped to manage it, putting Washington for a short time in the gambling business.
A Marshals Service spokeswoman said she did not immediately know if the agency had previously auctioned film and music royalty rights. The agency had 17,564 assets on hand as of September 2015, valued at $3.1 billion, its website said.Court papers filed by the Justice Department would, if approved by a judge, grant sweeping powers to the Marshals Service to manage the 1MDB-linked assets.Under a proposed restraining order, Red Granite Pictures, which produced ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" would have to maintain present contracts related to the film and ""allow the United States to join in and direct key business decisions about day to day operations.""In a statement, Red Granite said that to its knowledge, none of the money it received was illegitimate and that co-founder Riza Aziz and the company did nothing wrong. Aziz is the stepson of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who oversaw the 1MDB fund. The Justice Department lawsuits said that high-level officials of 1MDB corruptly diverted more than $3.5 billion from the fund over six years.
