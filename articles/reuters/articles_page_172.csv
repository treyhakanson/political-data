| TBILISI

TBILISI Secretary of State John Kerry told ex-Soviet Georgia that the United States would help it bolster its army as he reassured a close U.S. ally days before a NATO summit expected to focus on the threat a resurgent Russia poses.Kerry, on his first visit to Georgia as Secretary of State, made the commitment ahead of a NATO summit in Warsaw on Friday at which members of the Western military alliance plan to announce action to deter possible Russian military aggression.Georgia and former Soviet states such as Moldova and Ukraine have become increasingly concerned by Russia's intentions after the Kremlin annexed Ukraine's Crimea in 2014 and launched air strikes in Syria last year.Moscow says such fears are unfounded and based on what it calls anti-Russian hysteria.  In a memorandum of understanding signed on Wednesday by Kerry and Georgian Prime Minister Georgy Kvirikashvili, the United States promised to bolster Georgia's ability to defend itself against potential threats.
That meant greater military and security cooperation, enhanced information sharing, and help building up defense capacity, such as improving combat readiness and supporting defense procurement, the document said.Until now, U.S. security support has focused on training Georgian troops for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.""The United States stands firm in its commitment to Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders,"" Kerry told reporters.
Georgia, which is crisscrossed by strategically important oil and gas pipelines, fought and lost a short war with Russia in 2008. Moscow then recognized two breakaway pro-Kremlin Georgian regions - South Ossetia and Abkhazia - as independent countries, though most other countries have not.""Russia's occupation and militarization of parts of Georgia's territory are unacceptable,"" said Kerry. ""We continue to call on Russia to fulfill its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement, including a withdrawal of its forces to pre-conflict positions.""
Moscow for its part has accused the West, notably Washington, of stirring anti-Russian feelings in former Soviet states it deems part of its own sphere of influence.Kerry visits Ukraine next, on Thursday, before heading to Warsaw to join U.S. President Barack Obama for the NATO summit.In Ukraine, Kerry's third visit there since Russia annexed Crimea, he will focus on the implementation of the Minsk peace accords and the country's reform agenda. It will be Kerry's first chance to meet new Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. (Writing by Lesley Wroughton and Andrew Osborn; Editing by Larry King)"

By Susan Cornwell and David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A divided Republican Party on Wednesday fought over gun control legislation that was cobbled together following last month's mass shooting in Orlando, raising questions over U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan's ability to get the measure passed.While Democrats have said the gun control proposal put forward by Republican leaders was too weak, an influential group of approximately 40 conservative House Republicans announced their opposition as well, saying the plan did not do enough to protect gun buyers.The legislation fails ""to do enough to address the threat of radical Islamic terrorism,"" according to a statement by the conservative Freedom Caucus. The group also complained of ""the inclusion of gun control provisions that fail to adequately protect due process.""With the Republican leadership's legislation under attack from both liberals and conservatives, it was unclear whether Ryan could muster the 218 votes he would need for passage in the House of Representatives.Last month, the Senate failed to approve any of several competing Republican and Democratic gun control proposals offered in the wake of the June 12 shooting at a gay night club in Orlando that killed 49 and injured 53 others.
During the Senate debate, Democratic lawmakers staged a sit-in on the House floor to pressure Republican leaders to pass legislation expanding background checks on gun sales and blocking gun purchases by people on terrorism watch lists.The Republican leadership bill, announced last Friday, would give the government three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked. Ryan said Wednesday that he intended to bring it to the floor for a vote this week or next, but also noted changes were being sought by numerous lawmakers.""The last thing we're going to do is rush something to the floor that we don't have right,"" Ryan said.
Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, a Freedom Caucus member, said he objected to Ryan pushing the bill without allowing it to be processed by relevant committees first.Salmon said that Ryan told House Republicans in a closed meeting that he was rushing the legislation to the House floor because ""there are members that need to have this vote"" for political reasons in swing districts that could go either Republican or Democratic in the Nov. 8 elections.Democrats, meanwhile, continued to pressure Ryan for votes on their more sweeping gun control measures.
Representative John Larson of Connecticut, a ringleader of the Democrats' sit-in, said his fellow Democrats plan to support Republican mental health legislation that could help avert some mass shootings. Larson added he hoped it would be seen as an olive branch to Republicans toward progress on gun control.Scores of gun control advocates demonstrated outside the House chamber in sweltering heat on Wednesday morning, as 91 people wearing orange t-shirts stood on the steps leading to the House demanding action.They represented the 91 people who, according to government statistics, die each day in the United States from gun violence. Many of them die as a result of suicide. (Reporting by David Morgan, Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Wednesday proposed a temporary freeze on some student debt and the cutting of college tuition entirely for some families, focusing on an issue important to supporters of her rival Bernie Sanders.Clinton's latest proposal includes a three-month moratorium for federal student loan payments and a new measure to eliminate in-state college tuition for families whose income does not exceed $125,000, according to a release from her campaign. The proposal builds on her earlier plan for easing student debt loads for higher education.Clinton, the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Party nominee, is looking to win over supporters of Sanders, the Vermont senator who was her main opponent for the nomination as he consistently sought to push the party left.The presumptive Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, also has courted Sanders' voters, trying to use his outsider appeal to bring them over to his campaign.
On Wednesday, Clinton proposed using executive action to offer a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers to offer help for borrowers to consolidate loans and find other methods to reduce their payments. 
She previously has released proposals to increase access to tuition grants, push for income-based repayments, and - like Sanders - to allow graduates to refinance student loans at lower interest rates.Sanders praised the new Clinton measures on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he wanted ""to take this opportunity to applaud Secretary Clinton.""

WASHINGTON Representative Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said on Wednesday that the White House must submit a supplemental funding request immediately to support President Barack Obama's plans to keep 8,400 troops in Afghanistan.Senator John McCain, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he welcomed Obama's decision but added in a statement: ""That said, when the President himself describes the security situation in Afghanistan as 'precarious,' it is difficult to discern any strategic rationale for withdrawing 1,400 U.S. troops by the end of the year.""

By Jeff Mason and Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama, calling Afghanistan's security situation precarious, said on Wednesday he will keep U.S. troop levels there at 8,400 through the end of his administration rather than reducing them to 5,500 by year's end as previously planned.Obama, in a statement at the White House, said the role of U.S. forces in Afghanistan will remain unchanged: training and advising Afghan police and troops, and supporting counterterrorism missions against the Taliban and other groups. Obama's presidency ends in January.Obama's plan still calls for a reduction in U.S. troop levels from the current roughly 9,800, but not as much as previously planned.Obama, who took office in 2009 pledging to wind down the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he had ended America's combat mission in Afghanistan. But he acknowledged that security concerns persist.""The security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious,"" Obama said. ""The Taliban remains a threat. They've gained ground in some places.""Taliban forces now hold more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, according to recent United Nations estimates. The Islamic State group has also established a small presence in Afghanistan.
Obama's decision, which came after a review submitted last month by the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army General John Nicholson, drew some criticism inside and outside his administration.Some Pentagon officials said that it does nothing to address the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan.""It's disappointing that the administration thinks that troop numbers are a substitute for a more comprehensive strategy,"" said a U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""This is neither the reduction that the White House seems to have wanted nor the current numbers that don't seem to be sufficient to deal with the security problem.""
Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, criticized what he said was a new cap on U.S. troop levels.""It is time that the president level with the American people about what it will really take to achieve our goals in Afghanistan, and how much it will cost,"" Thornberry said in a statement. Obama spoke in advance of a NATO summit on Friday and Saturday in Warsaw, Poland, where alliance members are expected to confirm their support for the Kabul government.
In addition to the U.S. forces, there are about 3,000 other international troops in Afghanistan.U.S. troops have been in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion launched by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, that toppled the Taliban leaders who harbored the al Qaeda organization responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States that killed about 3,000 people. It is America's longest war.During his announcement at the White House, Obama was flanked by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and the top U.S. military officer, General Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The FBI report scolding Democrat Hillary Clinton over her email practices as secretary of state plays into a chief vulnerability that her rival, Republican Donald Trump, hopes to exploit - wariness among U.S. voters about her trustworthiness.Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said the Federal Bureau of Investigation's recommendation against criminal charges for Clinton means the email matter ""is now resolved.""Yet even as he removed the threat of charges against the Democratic candidate, FBI Director James Comey described Clinton's handling of classified information as ""extremely careless.""Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, seized on that comment.""We're talking about serious stuff,"" he told a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""The laws are very explicit.""The New York businessman has been struggling to unify the party around his candidacy, and Republicans say Trump could use the issue to heal some of the rifts within his party while motivating conservatives to go to the polls in the Nov. 8 election.Indeed, a main element of Trump's strategy for winning over Republicans who are lukewarm on his candidacy is to emphasize the importance of keeping Clinton out of the White House.""Clinton won the 'Comey primary' but Trump has the opportunity to drive home the lack of trust theme,"" said Republican strategist Scott Reed.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 1-11 found that a majority of American adults do not think Clinton is an honest person. This included 89 percent of Republicans, 72 percent of independents and 36 percent of Democrats.More than a quarter, 27 percent, of Clinton's own supporters did not think she is an honest person, according to the poll.Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf said Clinton needs to move quickly to get past the email episode and talk about issues central to her campaign. He predicted the issue will be short-lived as voters focus on the candidates' vice presidential running mates, the nominating conventions and fall debates.""She made a mistake here, there's no question about it,"" said Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist who was chief strategist for 2004 nominee John Kerry, the current secretary of state. 
""But there's also justice in what she says, that for 24 years the Republicans have relentlessly gone after Bill and Hillary Clinton. That has its impact and that impact you can see in her trust numbers. But this decision, despite how anybody spins, it not only helps her but in my view was indispensable to her,"" Shrum said.Hours after Comey's announcement, Trump's campaign sent an email soliciting money based on the Clinton email controversy. The big question for Republicans is whether their presumptive presidential nominee will be able to prosecute the case effectively against Clinton since he is still at war with fellow Republicans and has little in the way of campaign funds to pay for TV ads against her.""I don't think there's a way that Clinton can use this to raise anger at Republicans,"" said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. ""But the Republicans can certainly use this to raise anger at Clinton and the Democrats. Anger is a great motivator to get people out to vote.""
Trump's initial response showed why Republicans continue to have concerns about him. Interviewed by Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, Trump spent as much time criticizing Comey as he did Clinton. Comey is respected by Republicans and Democrats alike.""I have such respect for the FBI that I just don't understand what happened here,"" Trump said. ""Everybody knows she's extremely guilty. And they really said she was guilty today and then they said we're not going to prosecute.""Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, called the FBI report a ""disqualifying event"" for Clinton.""Trump's singular focus should be that she acted inappropriately. But Trump has a knack for distracting from Hillary Clinton's scandals with his gaffes and missteps,"" he said.Trump has been fighting allegations of anti-Semitism in recent days over his campaign's use of a Jewish star in a tweet attacking Clinton as corrupt.

By John Whitesides and Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The FBI recommended on Tuesday that no criminal charges be filed over Hillary Clinton's use of private email servers while she was secretary of state, but rebuked the Democratic U.S. presidential candidate for ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information.While FBI Director James Comey's announcement lifted a cloud of uncertainty that had loomed over Clinton's White House campaign, his strong criticism of her judgment ignited a new attack on her over the email issue by Donald Trump, her likely Republican opponent in the Nov. 8 election.Comey's comments are likely to reinforce what polls show are widespread public concerns about Clinton's honesty and trustworthiness. Republicans have pointed to the controversy as evidence that she considered herself above the law.House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the highest- ranking elected U.S. Republican, said in a statement that Comey's announcement ""defies explanation.""Ryan called on the FBI to release all of its findings in the case and said Comey would be called to testify before the House Oversight Committee. ""We need to know more,"" Ryan told Fox News. In a lengthy statement on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's conclusions from its yearlong investigation, Comey directly contradicted statements Clinton has made while defending her use of the private email setup.He said, for example, that the FBI found at least 110 emails that contained classified information when they were sent,  although Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private servers.""Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of the classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" Comey said.But he said the FBI concluded ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges. ""Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,"" Comey told reporters in Washington.His recommendation will likely stand. The country's top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, said on Friday she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Clinton for mishandling emails.'SHE LIED!'
Clinton's campaign was anxious to move on after Comey's announcement, saying in a statement it was pleased with the FBI decision.
""As the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email, and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved,"" spokesman Brian Fallon said.He did not respond to questions about Comey's rebuttal of the main arguments Clinton has offered in defense of her use of private email.At a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday night, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said the controversy should disqualify Clinton from being president and that her email system may well have been hacked by U.S. enemies.""Our enemies may have a blackmail file on crooked Hillary and this alone means that she should not be allowed to serve as president of the United States,"" Trump said. ""We now know that she lied to the country when she said that she did not send classified information on her server. She lied!""Following Comey's late-morning remarks, Clinton became one of the top trending topics on Twitter, with about 671,000 tweets posted by 4 p.m. (2000 GMT). The overall sentiment was more negative than positive, with about two negative tweets for every positive one, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.The FBI director's announcement came hours before Clinton's first campaign appearance with President Barack Obama, in Charlotte, North Carolina, where neither Obama nor Clinton mentioned the email probe. It also came less than three weeks before the Democratic National Convention at which Clinton is to be nominated as the party's candidate for the November election.
NO 'INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT'
The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of personal email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One question is whether she mishandled classified information on the servers.As the investigation wound up, Clinton underwent a voluntary 3-1/2-hour interview with the FBI on Saturday in Washington.Comey said the FBI did not find that Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law, and that there was no ""intentional misconduct"" by her lawyers who sorted her emails.He said her staff should have known Clinton's private email was an improper place for classified information, but added there was no evidence anyone had hacked Clinton's communications.Comey said, however, that ""hostile actors"" gained access to email accounts of people with whom Clinton corresponded  regularly. He also said she used email extensively while traveling ""in territory of sophisticated adversaries.""
Experts routinely advise U.S. government officials not to bring important digital information to countries with a track record of aggressive cyber activity. Clinton traveled to more than 100 countries during her four years as top U.S. diplomat, including trips to China and Russia, considered among the most sophisticated U.S. cyber adversaries.The FBI found 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained information that was classified at the time the messages were sent, Comey said. Eight of those chains contained ""top-secret"" information, the highest level of government classification for material that could harm national security.A further 36 email chains contained ""secret"" information, and eight ""confidential"" information, he said. Agents also found three classified emails among the thousands Clinton never returned to the State Department.Comey said there were no previous cases that supported filing criminal charges against Clinton. Other cases had involved intentional mishandling of information, he said.Last year, the FBI recommended that former CIA Director David Petraeus be charged with a felony for his mishandling of classified information with his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. In that case, however, the FBI had evidence that Petraeus knew the information was highly classified. Petraeus eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information.Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation of Clinton, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality.Republican criticism of the process heated up after Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, met privately with Lynch in Phoenix last week. Lynch, who was appointed by Obama, said later she regretted the meeting and that she and the former president did not discuss the investigation.

By Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON In declining to seek prosecution of Hillary Clinton, FBI Director James Comey said the former Secretary of State's handling of classified emails was ""extremely careless"" - conduct, legal experts said, that falls short of ""gross negligence,"" a standard for criminal charges under the Espionage Act.""Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,"" Comey said in a news conference Tuesday detailing the FBI investigation and his decision.Several legal experts agreed with Comey's conclusion that there was no recent precedent for bringing such a case without evidence of willful intent or gross negligence, and they said it would have been difficult to convince a jury to convict Clinton based on the evidence.""Extreme carelessness doesn't necessarily translate into gross negligence,"" said Laurie Levenson, a professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and former federal prosecutor. ""The only times I have seen these statutes used has been situations in which people knew they were disclosing classified, confidential information, or they could show they didn't really care,"" Levenson said. Comey said investigators determined that Clinton exchanged 110 emails that contained government secrets and that she and her staff should have known the information was classified.But unlike other cases prosecuted under the Espionage Act, the FBI has not suggested that Clinton intentionally shared government secrets with people not authorized to see them.The statute for charging gross negligence under the Espionage Act, written in 1917, requires the information be ""removed from its proper place,"" a tough legal requirement in the digital age, said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at University of Texas.Vladeck said the law is not ""well suited for careless discussion of information in unsecured media that doesn't dispossess the government of that information or direct it right into the hands of a foreign power."" 
Previous cases charged under the Espionage Act have shown intent, experts said.Defense attorney Abbe Lowell said Comey's decision was ""completely consistent"" with every case brought for leaking classified government information. Defendants in other cases include Stephen Kim, Lowell's client who pleaded guilty to leaking State Department documents to the press, as well as former C.I.A. Director General David Petraeus. He admitted to keeping classified information, which he would also share with his biographer, in his home, while telling the government he had returned all such information.""The one common denominator of all such cases is that the individual involved intentionally sent material to those not authorized to receive it, like the press, like a foreign government,"" Lowell said.Comey said the FBI ""did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information."" But he said it did find ""evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling a very sensitive, highly classified information.""
His recommendation, which Attorney General Loretta Lynch previously said she would accept, angered Republicans who said her actions should be punished. Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump reacted to the news from his Twitter account, saying, ""The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less.""In that case, the FBI recommended a felony charge. But Attorney General Eric Holder pursued a misdemeanor under another part of the law, and Petraeus pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years probation in 2015. The FBI had recordings of Petraeus acknowledging the information in notebooks in his home was highly classified. Petraeus also admitted to lying to the FBI about sharing the information with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and lover.
Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, said Clinton's cooperation with FBI investigators also may have helped her avoid charges.""There was no obstruction of justice, no failure to cooperate truthfully with investigators, no concealment of her activity,"" Aftergood said.Legal precedent suggests that Clinton is unlikely to face a misdemeanor charge for recklessness because recent cases that ended with misdemeanors began as much larger felony charges against individuals who intended to leak information.In 2010, Thomas Drake, a whistleblower from the NationalSecurity Agency who helped expose the government's warrantless surveillance of Americans, was charged with espionage after the government accused him of bringing five classified documents home. He denied the accusation, and those charges were dropped. Drake pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer.""Somebody needs to ask Comey about my case,"" Drake, who now works at an Apple store in Maryland, wrote in an email late Tuesday.Former president Bill Clinton's national security adviser pleaded guilty in 2005 to smuggling classified documents out of the National Archives by stuffing them under his clothes. He was fined $50,000 and sentenced to two years of probation.
