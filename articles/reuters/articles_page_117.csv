MEXICO CITY U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Wednesday he and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto discussed Trump's proposal for a border wall between the countries but not the New York businessman's demand that Mexico pay for it.Trump and Pena Nieto emerged from about an hour of talks at the presidential palace in Mexico City to deliver statements to the news media and take questions.""We did discuss the wall, we didn't discuss payment of the wall, that will be at a later date, this was a very preliminary meeting, it was an excellent meeting,"" Trump said.
Pena Nieto, in his statement, said the border must be seen as an asset for the region. He said undocumented immigration from Mexico to the United States had dropped considerably since reaching a peak a decade ago.

PARIS France's far-right National Front party leader, Marine Le Pen, voiced support for U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday, saying his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton would bring war and hardship to the world.Le Pen is a candidate in France's April 2017 presidential election. While her increasingly popular party thrives on anti-immigration sentiment, she has been more careful in her speeches than Trump has been so as to make her party more mainstream.""As far as France's best interest is concerned it's, 'Everything but Hillary Clinton',"" Le Pen told CNN in an interview hen asked which U.S. candidate she would support. ""It's everything but Hillary Clinton because I believe Hillary Clinton means war, Hillary Clinton means devastation, destabilizing the world, economic choices that would be devastating for my people, geostrategic choices that would lead to global conflicts.""
Opinion polls see Le Pen making it to an early May run-off in France's presidential election but losing that second round to a mainstream candidate as a majority of voters do not want her as president, despite her growing popularity.She shares with Trump a strategy that banks on presenting herself as ""anti-system."" 
""What we have in common is that we're not insiders, we are not taking part in the 'system', we depend on no one and do not take our orders from any financial institutions,"" she told CNN in the interview taped and released on Wednesday.
Trump has been rebuked by opponents for his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. He has faced criticism even from within his own party for comments seen as insulting women, Muslims and Mexican immigrants. (Reporting by Ingrid Melander; editing by Mark Heinrich)"

By Susan Cornwell and Nick Brown
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK President Barack Obama on Wednesday appointed a seven-member board to oversee a financial restructuring for Puerto Rico, a majority Republican panel that some market analysts saw as favorable for bondholders of the U.S. territory, which has been crippled by a $70 billion debt crisis.Among the board members, who Obama appointed on the recommendation of legislative leaders, are Arthur Gonzalez, a Democrat and a retired bankruptcy judge who oversaw the Chapter 11 cases of Chrysler and Enron, and Carlos Garcia, a Republican and the former head of Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank who now runs private equity firm BayBoston.The other appointees are Republicans Andrew Biggs, David Skeel and Jose Carrion III, and Democrats Jose Ramon Gonzalez and Ana Matosantos.The idea of a fiscal control board, known colloquially as La Junta in Puerto Rico, is largely reviled on the island, which has a 45 percent poverty rate and whose chronic economic slump has helped spur rampant outmigration. Among the messages by protesters and graffiti artists plastered around San Juan are: ""Wake up! They're selling our homeland!"" and ""Say no to oppression."" But from a market perspective the board figures to be a positive for creditors of the island, said David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital. He particularly cited Garcia, calling him ""an investor guy, very intertwined with everything that has happened up until now.""And the Democrats on the panel are more moderate than expected, Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson said in note.
Jose Gonzalez, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, may be the ""key swing vote"" for creditor-friendly policies, Hanson said.Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson, in a note last week, listed Jose Gonzalez, a former Santander executive, as a potential creditor ally because of his ""significant experience in Puerto Rico's banking sector.""The board was created under the federal law known as PROMESA, passed earlier this year, which will bring Puerto Rico's finances under federal oversight and give it the authority to restructure some of its debt.
The board will be tasked with assessing and certifying annual budgets and a fiscal recovery plan presented by the island's government, as well as facilitating debt restructuring talks on the island, possibly through a bankruptcy-like process.One interesting pick is Skeel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Though Republicans are generally seen as creditor-friendly, Skeel, a restructuring industry veteran, has repeatedly called for a broad-based restructuring in Puerto Rico. But he has also stressed that creditor rights should be protected in such a scenario, possibly a good sign for the fate of Puerto Rico's general obligation debt. That debt is viewed as sacrosanct in municipal debt markets, but it has no legal security under bankruptcy law, which has given some GO holders reason to fret.
Importantly, much of the negotiation tactics may be driven by the team of lawyers and financial advisers the board will ultimately select to represent it.     Restructuring consultant Martha Kopacz, of Phoenix Management Services, and veteran bankruptcy lawyer Richard Levin, of Jenner & Block, are among the professionals said to be lobbying to represent the board, according to people familiar with the situation. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, each chose two members of the board, while House and Senate Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, Democrats, made one pick apiece. Obama chose the seventh member. (Reporting by Susan Cornwell and Nick Brown; Additional reporting by Robin Respaut; Writing by Nick Brown; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler)"

By Bernie Woodall

An initial check showed that Takata Corp (7312.T) air bag parts and material involved in a deadly explosion in a truck in Texas last week were being shipped properly, a U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said the agency's hazardous material team made the determination along with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which conducted an initial survey of shipping documents. The NTSB said it will decide in the next few weeks whether a deeper investigation is needed into the incident, which occurred on Aug. 22 near Quemado, Texas, and left one woman dead and four other people injured..Such a probe was called for earlier on Wednesday by two U.S. senators, Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey, both Democrats who are members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.The NTSB said in a statement that it has asked to review all documents related to the incident.
""Initial indicators are that the materials were packaged properly. If the review of documents and other information shows cause to investigate, the NTSB will do so,"" it said in a statement.Takata's air bag inflators, which contain ammonium nitrate, have been linked to at least 14 deaths and more than 150 injuries and resulted in the largest vehicle recall in history.Prolonged exposure of the defective Takata inflators to hot and humid conditions has been found to cause air bags to explode with excessive force, spraying shrapnel into passenger compartments.
The NTSB ""must investigate this incident and determine whether this company took appropriate precautions,"" said a statement by the senators, both Democrats.The senators noted that ammonium nitrate is also used in agricultural fertilizers and as an explosive for construction and mining industries. They said they want to protect against future incidents in highway shipments of the chemical compound.
""We also seek answers on what steps must be taken to ensure other towns and communities aren't endangered by the shipment of ammonium nitrate on our highways,"" they said.         The NTSB, an independent safety investigation agency, focuses on studying accidents to determine if lessons can be learned that could lead to increased safety.The Texas Department of Public Safety is also investigating the incident, and the NTSB said it stands by to assist Texas officials upon request.

By Dave Graham
| MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY Within minutes of Donald Trump saying he would visit Mexico, one of the front-runners to become the country's next president hit back, saying the brash White House hopeful would not be welcome.That was just a start.Scorn rained down on both Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and the U.S. Republican presidential nominee after the two announced late on Tuesday they would meet during a brief trip by Trump to the country he has repeatedly attacked during his presidential campaign.Before it even took place, the visit was a public relations disaster for Pena Nieto as politicians and diplomats condemned him for inviting a man who has united Mexican like few others in shared disdain.Since launching his White House bid in June last year, Trump has vowed to seal off the country behind a border wall he says Mexico will pay for, tarred its migrants as rapists and drug pushers and threatened to expel millions of them, as well as saying he will revise or tear up a trade deal with Mexico if he wins office in November.Mexican cabinet ministers have called Trump ignorant and racist, and Pena Nieto earlier this year likened Trump's tilt for the top job to the rise of Adolf Hitler, so the sudden invitation to the real estate mogul was a hard sell to the public.""Mr Trump may have been invited but he knows he's not welcome,"" presidential hopeful Margarita Zavala, wife of former president Felipe Calderon and one of the favorites to succeed Pena Nieto at the next election in 2018, said on Twitter. ""Mexicans have dignity and we reject his hate speech,"" she added.
A few dozen people gathered beneath a soaring monument to Mexican Independence in central Mexico City on Wednesday to protest the New Yorker's visit, some holding placards emblazoned with captions such as ""You are not Wall-come"" and ""Trump and Pena out"".""Trump has badmouthed Mexicans, it's appalling that the president has invited him,"" said Abril Marquez, a 23-year-old law student holding a sign saying ""Trump, you're not welcome!""Traditionally bitter political adversaries in Mexico have been united in their rejection of Trump, making Wednesday's hastily-arranged encounter a gamble with few obvious benefits for Pena Nieto, whose approval ratings are at all-time lows.Gang violence is at the worst levels of his term, anger over political corruption is widespread, the peso currency is near record lows and the centrist president's personal integrity is in question after a report that he plagiarized his university thesis. A government spokesman played down the accusation, saying there were ""style errors"" in the paper.
'UNWORTHY' OF GOVERNMENT
Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister responsible for North America, said he was at a loss to explain the Trump visit, describing it as a ""big mistake"" by the government.""Unless (Trump) comes out and makes a public statement disavowing all the things that he's said, which I doubt very much that he will do, I don't think there's really anything that Pena Nieto can get out of this,"" he said.
Miguel Barbosa, Senate leader of the leftist opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution, who worked with Pena Nieto to push through landmark economic reforms earlier in his term, said the president was allowing himself to be used by Trump.""You don't understand,"" Barbosa said, directing a tweet at Pena Nieto, ""the presence of (Trump) in Mexico at your invitation is behavior unworthy of the Mexican government.""Even the man Pena Nieto picked a year ago to be his ambassador to the United States did not hold back.""Nobody in the last 50 years has put Mexican-U.S. relations in such danger as Trump,"" Miguel Basanez, an old friend of Pena Nieto who was replaced in April as ambassador after seven months in the job, said on Twitter. ""I find the invitation deeply regrettable.""Trump has helped stir the bad blood with comments on Twitter during his campaign. Even as he prepared for his quick visit he was in a Twitter spat with a prominent critic south of the border, Vicente Fox, another former Mexican president.

By Jonathan Allen
| CINCINNATI

CINCINNATI Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, speaking to a U.S. veterans group on Wednesday, made an open appeal to Republican and independent voters concerned about rival Donald Trump's national security credentials and his fitness for office.""This election shouldn't be about ideology. It's not just about differences over policy,"" Clinton told an American Legion convention in Cincinnati. ""It truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as president and commander in chief.""Clinton, a former secretary of state and former U.S. senator, at times sounded like the Republican candidates Trump defeated to win his party's presidential nomination. She highlighted the United States' role as a global superpower and celebrated ""American exceptionalism,"" a term frequently used by conservatives in a foreign-policy context.""When we say America is exceptional ... it means that we recognize America's unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress,"" Clinton told the veterans. ""When America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum.""She harshly rebuked Trump, accusing him of advocating a retreat from global affairs and suggesting that his calls for U.S. forces to torture terror suspects and threaten their families would make the country less safe. 
The speech came on the same day that Trump was slated to meet with Mexico's president, Enrique Pena Nieto, in Mexico City in an attempt to bolster his own foreign-policy profile before delivering a speech on immigration policy Wednesday evening in Arizona.In her speech, Clinton cited the endorsements of dozens of members of the Republican foreign-policy establishment. On Wednesday, she secured another one from James Clad, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense under President George W. Bush.
In a comment that has sparked criticism from many Republicans, Trump has called the U.S.-led NATO military alliance obsolete, although he has since pledged to work with NATO to defeat Islamic State. He has also vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and to make Mexico pay for it.Brian Katulis, a national-security analyst at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank in Washington, said Clinton's remarks were in line with ""a bipartisan consensus about how we can best keep America safe and secure.""Trump, he said, stands outside that consensus - something the Clinton campaign has attempted to exploit in courting Republican voters concerned about his rhetoric and lack of government experience. 
John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said Clinton's approach could peel off some wavering voters, but could cost her support from liberals and others who are wary of overseas conflicts after protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.""It could lose her votes on the left from folks who are tired of us blundering into any more wars,"" he said. ""Most voters think we should focus on the home front.""

By Scott Malone

 (Editor's note: This story contains language that may offend readers in the fourth paragraph)By Scott MaloneBOSTON Years before Donald Trump dominated the news cycle with his style of angry politics, Maine Governor Paul LePage made headlines with a similarly brash approach.Since he was elected in 2010, the Republican has told critics of his decision to skip a civil rights breakfast to ""kiss my butt"" and accused a Democratic rival of forcing budget measures on taxpayers ""without Vaseline.""But when LePage, the second U.S. governor to endorse Trump, recently left an obscenity-laced voicemail message for a lawmaker who he believed had called him a racist, he put his career in jeopardy.LePage's widely circulated verbal attack, in which he called Democratic State Representative Drew Gattine a ""little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker,"" sparked the most intense firestorm of criticism the second-term governor has seen. Even legislative leaders from his own party called him into a closed-door meeting to discuss his future.The reaction shows that not all politicians can get away with the kind of bellicose approach that helped Trump wipe out his primary rivals and win the support of angry voters who feel U.S. politicians do not care about their problems.""Trump is a master of media and LePage is not. They are very different at the end of the day,"" said Michael Franz, chairman of the government and legal studies department at Maine's Bowdoin College. ""Trump says he hates the media, but he works it very well. LePage just hates it.""
The governor infamously joked in 2013 that he would like to blow up the offices of the Portland Press Herald newspaper, which he felt treated him unfairly.On Wednesday, LePage told reporters he had met with Gattine and apologized, and that he had no plans to resign from office. Asked what might change about his governing style, LePage responded that he would no longer speak with reporters.""I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,"" LePage said. ""I'm serious. Everything will be put in writing. I am tired of being caught, the gotcha moments.""That came a day after LePage openly discussed the idea of stepping down in a regular monthly interview with a Maine radio station. He later backed away from his comments, and paraphrasing Mark Twain, said in a Twitter post, ""The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated.""
""TRUMP BEFORE TRUMP""
LePage endorsed Trump's run in February, shortly after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie did. ""I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular,"" LePage said at the time, saying that the wealthy New York businessman and reality TV star ""could be one of the greatest presidents if he sits down and puts together a good team.""
Trump has also praised LePage, saying that he would offer him a role in his administration ""if he were available.""Both men describe their political styles as authentic and off-the-cuff and accuse more measured rivals of being career politicians who are out of touch with the needs of average voters.LePage's brusqueness played well in Maine until recently. He won re-election in a three-way 2014 race with the support of 48 percent of voters with a wider margin of victory than the 38 percent he garnered in his first run, also a three-way race.Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics said that success, coupled with Trump's rise, could have emboldened LePage to double down on attack politics.""Almost anything goes now. You can call your opponents almost anything, you can threaten them,"" Levesque said. ""This is the new norm in American politics."" (Editing by Andrew Hay and Jeffrey Benkoe)"

By Ian Simpson

Virginia Republican leaders said they will file a contempt motion on Wednesday against Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe over his efforts to restore voting rights to about 206,000 felons.The motion comes the week after McAuliffe said he had restored voting rights to almost 13,000 felons on a case-by-case basis after the state Supreme Court blocked his blanket clemency effort.McAuliffe's executive order was seen as a possible aid in tipping Virginia, a swing state in the Nov. 8 presidential election, in favor of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Opinion polls show her leading Republican candidate Donald Trump in the state.""After a thorough legal review, it is clear that Governor McAuliffe has once again illegally suspended the Constitution of Virginia,"" House of Delegates Speaker William Howell said in a statement. He was joined in the 27-page motion by Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment and four voters.
The Republican lawmakers said they would ask the high court to hold McAuliffe in contempt for his bid to work around the justices' July 22 ruling that he lacked the constitutional authority to restore felons' political rights as a group.McAuliffe criticized the motion, saying his office has complied with the order and set up a process that was in line with it.
""The people who have filed it are more concerned with the impact new voters could have on Donald Trump's campaign than they are with the dignity of the people whom they continue to drag through the mud with their political lawsuits and ugly attacks,"" he said in a statement.McAuliffe has said his original order would move Virginia away from lifetime disenfranchisement that hits African-Americans particularly hard.
Many of the convicts who benefited were African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, won Virginia in 2012 and 2008. (Reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican U.S. senators John McCain and Marco Rubio won their party's nominations on Tuesday to seek re-election in Arizona and Florida in November, as both of the high profile politicians defeated insurgent challengers.McCain, the 2008 failed Republican presidential candidate, now faces a spirited challenge in Arizona from Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick, who has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2011 and wants to move to the Senate.McCain has said this year's race could be the toughest of a political career spanning more than three decades.In advancing to the general election, the 80-year-old McCain handily beat ex-state Senator Kelli Ward, 47, a conservative Tea Party activist and a follower of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Like McCain, Rubio also is girding for a potentially tough challenge on Nov. 8.Also in Florida, U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz overcame a challenger - and the embarrassment of being stripped last month of her job as head of the Democratic National Committee - and will get a shot at a seventh House term in the Nov. 8 general elections.She beat law professor Tim Canova, an outspoken Wall Street critic aligned with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.The non-traditional campaigns of Trump and Sanders, who exceeded expectations in his failed Democratic White House bid, spurred speculation that other insurgent politicians could make an impact this year.
But that didn't happen in either of the closely watched nominating races in Florida and Arizona.Rubio, who abandoned his presidential campaign in March, cleared the initial hurdle in his battle for a second six-year term in the U.S. Senate. He defeated novice politician Carlos Beruff, a millionaire homebuilder, who embraced Trump.U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, a Democrat, won his party's Senate nomination on Tuesday, and is expected to give g Rubio a tough fight, especially if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads Trump in Florida.There is speculation that Rubio might still harbor presidential ambitions after media reports this week that he had refused to commit to serving all six years of a Senate term if he were re-elected.
Trump has endorsed McCain and Rubio in their re-election bids even though he has rocky relations with both.How McCain and Rubio fare could have a big say in whether Republicans can defy expectations and maintain majority control of the Senate after November's election.""The balance of the Senate and the outcome of the presidential election are all hanging on Florida,"" Rubio predicted in a fundraising appeal late on Tuesday. Trump offended McCain and many other Republicans last year by suggesting the maverick senator was anything but a war hero because he was captured during the Vietnam War after his airplane was shot down during a bombing mission.
In March, Trump ended Rubio's presidential run by trouncing him in the Florida primary to cap a race in which the New York businessman taunted the first-term senator as ""little Marco.""Rubio fired back, insulting Trump on everything from his hair color and the size of his hands to misspelled words in tweets.During their re-election efforts, both McCain and Rubio have offered support for Trump as the party's White House nominee and steered clear of attacks on that might antagonize Trump's core supporters.But they have tiptoed around Trump, mainly out of concern that his provocative comments on illegal immigration, Muslims and U.S. support for NATO could alienate moderate and independent voters in their states.(This version of the story corrects McCain's failed presidential bid in second paragraph to 2008, from 2012) (Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Peter Cooney and Simon Cameron-Moore)"

By Hilary Russ

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Tuesday vetoed a bill to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next five years.The legislation would have made New Jersey the third state to adopt a $15 per hour minimum wage, Christie said in a statement. State voters agreed to a previous wage hike in 2013, to $8.25 from $7.25. New Jersey's rate is tied to the consumer price index and is now at $8.38, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).""Despite having a constitutional mandate in place, the legislature now wants to increase the minimum wage by almost 80 percent just three years later,"" Christie said in a statement about his veto.Christie, a close ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said the wage bill passed by Democrats, who control both houses of state legislature, failed to consider the ability of businesses to absorb the increased labor costs.
Neighboring New York State, as well as California, became the first states to lift the minimum wage toward $15 earlier this year. While California's higher rate will be in effect statewide by 2022, New York created a two-speed system, with different timetables for New York City and nearby counties, versus the ""upstate"" regions where incomes are lower and labor markets less robust.Some cities are also stepping up to higher wage levels.     Washington, D.C.'s minimum wage will reach $15 per hour by July 1, 2020, after it enacted a law this year. The city's current level is $10.50.
Washington and 29 states have set minimum wages above the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, according to the NCSL.    Michele Siekerka, president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, praised Christie's veto, saying the increase was ""too much too fast.""
""Had this bill been signed, it would not only have hurt the New Jersey economy, but it would have hurt the exact workers the proponents of this policy are trying to help,"" she said in a statement.Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, lead sponsor of the bill, said in a statement the wage increase is a key component to Democrats' strategy to combat poverty.""A substantial minimum wage increase will help lift countless families out of poverty, decrease government dependency and boost commerce by pumping more dollars back into the economy,"" he said.
