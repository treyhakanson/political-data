MEXICO CITY Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Sunday defended his decision to host a visit by U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico, but he said it could have been carried out ""in a better way"".The hastily arranged meeting of Trump and Pena Nieto on Aug. 31 sparked outrage in Mexico because of Trump's verbal attacks on Mexicans as well as his threats to build a border wall and tear up trade deals with Latin America's No. 2 economy. ""I faced a dilemma of 'yes or no' once I had made the proposal and he said 'yes.' Because, at the end of the day, its all about ensuring the best interests of Mexico, even if it could be very controversial, as it turned out to be,"" Pena Nieto said in an interview on Mexico's Canal 11 television.Pena Nieto had invited both Trump and his rival Hillary Clinton, who turned down the offer. 
""Could we have done things better? Maybe yes, admittedly. I think that this genuine interest to bring about a meeting to take care of Mexico's interests, I think, could have been done in a better way,"" he said. 
During his visit, Trump struck a collaborative tone with Mexico. But as soon as he was back in the United States, he told a crowd in Arizona that Mexico would pay for his massive border wall ""100 percent.""Backlash from the visit forced the resignation of Pena Nieto's finance minister and trusted aide Luis Videgaray, who had helped arrange the meeting.

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Prospects that the presidential election will inject a hefty dose of volatility into U.S. stock markets are fading fast as Republican Donald Trump's victory odds lengthen.A reading of positioning data on options tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index shows little pickup in demand for contracts that would offer investors downside insurance in the event that stock prices take a major hit right after the Nov. 8 election.Moreover, based on options term structures - calculated from prices of options with different expirations - it is hardly evident at all that investors are positioning for an uncertain outcome, even with Election Day barely two weeks away, Michael Purves, head of derivatives research at Weeden & Co, said.""There had been a modest premium bump for November options a few weeks ago, but that seems to have faded steadily with Trump's slide in polls,"" Purves said.In a Reuters poll of equity strategists earlier this month, a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton was viewed as the more positive outcome for stock prices in the near term. Trump's chances of defeating Clinton to capture the White House have diminished markedly over the last several weeks, according to most polls and prediction markets.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which uses an online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that Clinton has a better than 95 percent chance of winning the minimum of 270 Electoral College votes to claim the presidency if the election were held today. The most likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump.On PredictIt, a popular online predictions and betting market, Clinton's implied chances of victory have risen to around 80 percent from around 63 percent a month ago.NO RUSH FOR INSURANCE      

The lack of positioning for an election-related volatility shock is consistent across the options market.""I just don't see a whole lot of shifting of positions. I don't see people taking on a very bearish stance or anything like that. It's a little bit surprising,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, Austin, Texas.""If it was a much closer race it might have been a different story, but the polls have Hillary Clinton in a pretty solid lead right now and the market seems to be on board with that idea,"" Frederick said.A Brookings Institution study published on Friday from two U.S. economics professors concluded that a Clinton victory would further suppress stock market volatility, whereas a Trump victory would send it soaring.Justin Wolfers, of the University of Michigan, and Eric Zitzewitz, of Dartmouth College, said recent market reactions to pre-election events, including the first Trump-Clinton debate and the release of a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women, signal that equity volatility could fall by 15 to 30 percent with a Clinton win. (tinyurl.com/zl4ew4u)
TRUMP ""INSURANCE"" IS CHEAP
While the options market might be only a moderate catalyst for the S&P 500 index, individual sectors such as healthcare and energy might be more prone to election-related volatility, derivatives analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent note.And just because investors are not braced for election-linked stock gyrations is no guarantee that markets will remain calm, analysts said.Given that the market is not pricing a lot of volatility for November, the absence of positioning could aggravate a volatility shock in the event of a surprise result.
""If you think Trump will win, you want to get long SPX puts or long CBOE Volatility Index calls right now as protection,"" said Purves, referring to options contracts that profit from a jump in volatility.A clean sweep by the Democrats of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House could also unleash volatility, Purves said.Indeed, there is a very modest skew toward protective put options over more bullish calls among contracts expiring near the election. For S&P 500 index weekly contracts expiring on Nov. 11, puts outnumber calls by a 2.1-to-1 margin, compared with 1.9-to-1 for all expirations, according to Thomson Reuters data.Prices for at-the-money put and call contracts that expire on the eve of the election suggest a 1.8 percent move, up or down, in the S&P 500 by then, while comparable contracts expiring later that week see an up or down move of 2.1 percent.Nonetheless, demand for volatility protection remains low and such options are relatively cheap, and getting cheaper. For instance, the cost for an S&P index option conveying the right to sell an S&P index future at the 2,050 level, about 4 percent below Friday's close, and expiring on Nov. 9, the day after the election, has plunged from $12.42 on Monday to $4.80 on Friday, a 61 percent decline.With Trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the Nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of Representatives.""Gridlock is the most market friendly outcome, and that is what the options market seems to be anticipating,"" Purves said.

| GETTSYBURG, Pa.

GETTSYBURG, Pa. U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump promised on Saturday to foil a proposed deal for AT&T to buy Time Warner if he wins the Nov. 8 election, arguing it was an example of a ""power structure"" rigged against both him and voters. Trump, whose candidacy has caused ruptures in his party, listed his policy plans for the first 100 days of his presidency in a campaign speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, near the site of a Civil War battlefield and a celebrated address by President Abraham Lincoln.But he also defiantly raised personal grievances, describing how, if elected, he would address them from the White House in a way he said would benefit Americans.The speech was billed by his campaign as a major outlining of his policies and principles. Many of the policy ideas Trump listed on Saturday were familiar, not least his promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico to deter illegal immigration and to renegotiate trade deals and to scrap the Obamacare health policy. Moments after promising Americans that he represented a hopeful break from the status quo, he promised to sue nearly a dozen women who have come forward in the last two weeks to accuse him of sexual assault, calling them liars. And he added a new threat to his repeated castigation of U.S. media corporations, which he says cover his campaign unfairly to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.""They're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people,"" Trump, who often rails against media outlets and journalists covering his events, told supporters in his speech. Trump has not provided evidence for his assertion that the election would be rigged. ""As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,"" Trump said. Telecommunications company AT&T Inc (T.N) has agreed in principle to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), one of the country's largest film and television companies, for about $85 billion and an announcement could be made as early as Saturday. 
Trump also said he would look at ""breaking"" up the acquisition by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) of the media company NBC Universal in 2013.""Deals like this destroy democracy,"" he said in explaining his apparent deviation from the traditional Republican position that seeks to minimize the taxation and regulation of American companies.Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), the online retailer, should also be paying ""massive taxes"", Trump said, reminding voters that Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper whose coverage Trump dislikes.Trump, a wealthy New York building developer and television star, acknowledged in a debate with Clinton on Oct. 9 that he had used investment losses to avoid paying taxes. The New York Times reported on Oct. 1 that Trump's declared loss of $916 million in 1995 was so large that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years.At a campaign event later on Saturday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Clinton criticized Trump's stance on news outlets, noting that she receives negative coverage too.
""When he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on - you know, I get criticized by the press,"" she said. ""I believe that's part of our democratic system.""In a statement, Clinton spokeswoman Christina Reynolds described the speech as ""rambling, unfocused, full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media, and lacking in any real answers for American families.""CHANCE OF A LIFETIME
Although Trump on Saturday described his plans at least in part as a response to his belief media organizations had treated him unfairly, he argued that less wealthy voters had even greater cause to worry.
""When a simple phone call placed with the biggest newspapers or television networks gets them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever, here is why this is relevant to you,"" he said. ""If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they could do to you, your jobs, your security, your education, your health care.""Trump, who has said he may not accept the election's outcome if he loses, is trailing Clinton in most polls - although he has narrowed the gap according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. Clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College, however, and claim the U.S. presidency, a Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project poll released on Saturday showed.    Trump has bluntly said that Mexico will pay for the wall, an idea the Mexican government has scoffed at. He tweaked his language on Saturday, saying the United States would fully fund the wall with the understanding that Mexico would reimburse the cost.Trump's campaign was thrown into crisis two weeks ago when  a 2005 video was released showing him bragging about groping and kissing women, prompting several prominent Republicans to announce they would not vote for him.Since then, at least 10 women have said Trump made unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, in incidents from the early 1980s to 2007, all of which Trump has denied. On Saturday, Jessica Drake, an adult film actor, accused Trump of pressuring her to have sex with him 10 years ago when they met at a golf tournament. After that, she said a man, possibly Trump, called her to offer her $10,000 if she would have sex with him, which she declined. Trump's campaign said the accusations were false.Trump, 70, said he was being attacked because he was an outsider who had never previously run for office, which he argues is a virtue.""The fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime,"" he said.

By Maurice Tamman
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project results released on Saturday.In the last week, there has been little movement. Clinton leads Donald Trump in most of the states that Trump would need should he have a chance to win the minimum 270 votes needed to win. According to the project, she has a better than 95 percent chance of winning, if the election was held this week. The mostly likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump.Trump came off his best debate performance of the campaign Wednesday evening but the polling consensus still showed Clinton winning the third and final face-off on prime-time TV. Trump disputes those findings.And some national polls had the race tightening a wee bit this week though others had Clinton maintaining her solid lead. But the project illustrates that the broader picture remains bleak for Trump with 17 days to go until the Nov. 8 election. 
Trump did gain ground in South Carolina where his slim lead last week expanded to seven points, moving it into his column from a toss-up. Unfortunately for him, he lost ground in Arizona, which is now too close to call.Additionally, he is facing a challenge for Utah's six Electoral College votes from former CIA operative and Utah native Evan McMullin. The independent candidate is siphoning votes away from Trump in a state that is Republican as any in the nation. In some polls, McMullin is even leading. (The States of the Nation is not polling on McMullin.)Utah, like almost all of the states, is a winner-take-all contest.
Clinton has also maintained a lead in Florida and Pennsylvania, which have a combined 49 Electoral College votes. Ohio remains too close to call.According to the project, lower voter turnout generally benefits Trump but his best hope for success is if Republican turnout surges and Democratic turnout is low.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will lay out on Saturday what he would do in the first 100 days of his administration should he win the Nov. 8 election.Trump's outline - which he will deliver in a speech in the historic town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania - will cover his plans for boosting Americans' economic and physical security and contrast them with those of Democrat Hillary Clinton, campaign aides told reporters on Friday.Clinton published a book of her own policy ideas earlier this year.Trump is trailing Clinton in most polls - although he has narrowed the gap according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday - and has less than three weeks to catch up. Much of the campaign in recent weeks has focused on allegations that he made improper advances to women over decades, something he denies.
It is also being dominated by Trump's accusation that the election is ""rigged"" and that he may not accept the result.Trump aides said Gettysburg, the site of a major Civil War battle and Republican President Abraham Lincoln's famous address, was a fitting place for Trump to lay out a positive vision for the future of his party, which has suffered a schism between his supporters and the party's establishment. 
Trump has planted some new policy details in recent speeches as he seeks to shift attention away from the recent controversies.In the past week, for example, he laid out ethics rules to shut the ""revolving door"" between government and lobbying and proposed term limits for members of Congress.
Trump's aides said he would unveil additional new policy details Saturday. They would not elaborate. (Reporting by Emily Stephenson and Roberta Rampton)"	['Abraham', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

A New York City Police Department spokesman said police were still investigating the precise nature of the substance, as well as the identity of the sender.
