By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Tuesday it had turned over to the U.S. Congress a number of documents related to its probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.The Democratic presidential nominee has for over a year been dogged by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nation's top diplomat.Republicans have repeatedly hammered Clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness.The FBI said it had provided ""relevant materials"" to congressional committees looking into the matter.""The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence,"" the agency said in a statement.The Clinton campaign criticized the delivery of the documents.""This is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the FBI,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. ""We believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.""A spokeswoman for the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in an email that staff for the panel was reviewing the information classified as ""secret.""
""There are no further details at this time,"" the aide said.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said in a statement that an initial review of the material showed most of it was marked unclassified, and urged the FBI to make as much of it public as possible.FBI Director James Comey told Congress last month that Clinton's handling of classified information while using  private email servers was ""extremely careless."" But he said he would not recommend criminal charges be brought against her.Comey's statement lifted a cloud of uncertainty from Clinton's White House campaign. But his strong criticism of her judgment ignited a new attack on her by Republicans, including Donald Trump, her Republican opponent in the Nov. 8 election.
'NOT CLEAR EVIDENCE'
The Oversight committee, chaired by Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, had asked the FBI for the complete investigative file from its review of Clinton's use of a private email server.The FBI has also provided documents from its investigation to the House Judiciary Committee, an aide said.Chaffetz and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, also a Republican, last month urged federal prosecutors to investigate whether Clinton had committed perjury.
They said some FBI findings about her email servers were at odds with her previous testimony to Congress about the matter, for example, her statement she had not sent or received information designated as classified.But the FBI, in a letter sent to the committee on Tuesday, said the fact that the agency had uncovered three instances in which Clinton had received emails containing ""(C)"" markings, which denote ""confidential"" information, was ""not clear evidence of knowledge or intent"" to mishandle such material.The letter, which accompanied the FBI's investigative documents, noted relevant emails had been forwarded to Clinton by staff, lacked ""header and footer markings"" indicating the presence of classified information, and only one email was later determined by the State Department to contain classified information.Clinton's fellow Democrats were scornful that Republicans were refusing to let the matter drop.""The FBI already determined unanimously that there is insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing,"" said Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Oversight committee. ""Republicans are now investigating the investigator in a desperate attempt to resuscitate this issue, keep it in the headlines, and distract from Donald Trump's sagging poll numbers.""

By Amanda Becker and Luciana Lopez
| WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA

WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA Hillary Clinton's White House transition team, a mix of former advisers of President Barack Obama, close confidants, long-time colleagues and former elected officials, reflects the sense of careful organization the Democratic candidate has aimed to project in her presidential campaign.But her Republican rival, Donald Trump, could seize on the group to make the point that she is part of the establishment he aims to defeat in November's election, and to reiterate his charge that a Clinton administration would be an Obama ""third term.""The group, which the Clinton campaign named on Tuesday and which will lay the groundwork for her to take charge quickly if she wins, is evidence of Clinton's long experience in Washington as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady.Transition teams aim to help the president-elect make key decisions during the period between the election and the inauguration, in this case from Nov. 8 to Jan. 20, so the new White House occupant can fill leadership posts quickly.""They are the names you would expect - people who have been advising her for a long time; people who have worked with her for a long time and people who are peers, who she respects,"" Matt Bennett of the moderate Democratic group Third Way said of Clinton's transition team. The group will be headed by Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. senator. He will lead four co-chairs: former Obama national security adviser Tom Donilon; former Obama aide Neera Tanden, who now leads the progressive think tank the Center for American Progress; former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, the director of Harvard's Institute of Politics.Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist. Two additional policy advisers from Clinton's campaign, Ed Meier and Ann O'Leary, will also move full-time to the transition team, the campaign said in a statement.
The transition team does not necessarily reflect future policy.""The job here is to give options, not just say there is one policy course you want to take,"" said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who advised the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and John Kerry.Clinton would be the first woman elected to the U.S. presidency and Shrum said Clinton's team ""has got to be the first transition team in history where the majority of its members are women.""Shrum added that Clinton is largely following Obama's template as he prepared for his transition after the 2008 election.
Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obama's health care overhaul, is a member of Clinton's tight-knit inner circle, and has also worked for her husband, former President Bill Clinton.Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House.Clinton worked closely with Donilon when she led the State Department from 2009-2013. Granholm, the former governor, is also a former state attorney general and has years of experience in Democratic politics.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee applauded the selection of O'Leary and Boushey, praising their economic positions. The environmental group Greenpeace criticized Salazar for not curbing fracking in his home state of Colorado.The announcement of the team came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls, with the current RealClearPolitics average of national polls showing her 6.7 points ahead, at 47.7 percent to Trump's 41 percent. Trump's campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his party's nomination last month.More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trump's inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his transition team in May.

By Ruffin Prevost
| CODY, Wyo.

CODY, Wyo. Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney's eldest daughter, claimed victory late on Tuesday in Wyoming's Republican primary race for the state's lone U.S. House of Representatives seat.Unofficial early results by 10 p.m. (0400 GMT) showed Cheney with 26,363 votes in the nation's least populous state. State Senator Leland Christensen was running a distant second, with almost 15,000 votes, while her six other Republican competitors each held fewer than 12,000 votes.""I'm honored by the trust Wyoming Republicans have placed in me to serve as our next Representative in Congress,"" Cheney said in a statement.The Casper Star-Tribune newspaper called the race late on Tuesday night.
Wyoming is a reliably red state, with the Republican primary winner all but assured of a general election victory in November.Cheney's apparent victory comes two years after she launched an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat that saw her withdraw from the race early.She drew criticism from some establishment Republicans two years ago when she ran against popular incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was labeled a ""carpetbagger"" for having only recently established residency in Teton County, one of the country's wealthiest zip codes, in a state widely populated by working-class miners, oil, and gas workers.
She said a family health crisis prompted her to withdraw.Cheney, 49, is a lawyer who worked in the U.S. State Department while her father was vice president.
Her campaign has received strong financial support from former high-ranking government officials, such as former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former White House political adviser Karl Rove.Cheney campaigned as a ""strong conservative voice for Wyoming,"" promising to protect the state's pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights, and generally work ""to reverse President Obama's devastating policies.""

WEST BEND, Wis. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said if elected he would force top administration officials to sign a pledge not to accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyists or foreign countries for five years after leaving office. The pledge - a rare policy pronouncement from the New York real estate mogul - was part of his criticism of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton who, along with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have accepted millions of dollars in speaking fees since he left office.

By Grant Smith
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a 6-percentage-point lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Tuesday.Clinton's support has ranged from 41 percent to 44 percent since late July, and was about 41 percent in the Aug. 11-15 online poll.Trump's support has experienced wider shifts ranging from 33 percent to 39 percent while his campaign has endured controversies and distractions in recent weeks. He is favored by about 35 percent of likely voters, according to the most recent poll.Trump has caused divisions in the Republican Party with his strong anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, and faced criticism from both parties earlier this month for a days-long feud with the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq. Last week, 70 Republicans, including former members of Congress and Republican National Committee staff, wrote a letter calling for the RNC to stop helping Trump, whose actions they said were ""divisive and dangerous.""
The number of likely voters who picked neither Clinton nor Trump in the poll was nearly 24 percent. At this point in 2012, President Barack Obama was ahead of Republican nominee Mitt Romney by nearly the same margin, favored by 46 percent of likely voters to Romney's 41 percent, with about 13 percent picking neither candidate.
Obama and Romney swapped the lead in the poll several times through the summer and early fall before the president took and held the lead in late October.In a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that gave respondents the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton also led Trump by 6 percentage points.
Of the alternative party candidates, Johnson came in third with 8 percentage points. Stein had about 2 percentage points. The Aug. 11-15 polls surveyed a sample of 1,132 and 1,131 likely voters, respectively, and had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.

By Ginger Gibson
| WEST BEND, WIS.

WEST BEND, WIS. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered his most aggressive call yet to woo African-American voters, vowing to restore law and order, only days after a fatal police shooting of a black man sparked more street violence.Speaking a few miles from Milwaukee, which was rocked by weekend riots, Trump accused his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of ""bigotry"" and vowed to protect the jobs of minorities from immigrants. Trump has been repeatedly called a ""bigot"" by his Democratic opponents.""I'm asking for the vote for every African-American citizen struggling in our society today who wants a different and much better future,"" Trump said.""Jobs, safety, opportunity, fair and equal representation: We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to, and talks down to, communities of color and sees them only as votes - that's all they care about - not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.""Earlier, Trump held three events in Milwaukee, a city still reeling from violent protests after the death of Sylville Smith, 23. Authorities said Smith was stopped for acting suspiciously and was shot by police because he was carrying an illegal handgun and refused orders to drop it. Trump encountered only a handful of peaceful protesters while in the city, including some at a closed fundraiser.He held a brief meeting with veterans and law enforcement, including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and Inspector Edward Bailey. But news media representatives were escorted out and not permitted to hear the discussions. Clarke, who is black and spoke at last month's Republican National Convention, has criticized the protests, writing in an opinion piece for The Hill that they were ""a collapse of the social order, where tribal behavior leads to reacting to circumstances instead of waiting for facts to emerge.""Trump also taped a town hall meeting with Fox News, in which he blamed President Barack Obama for what he sees as hostility toward police. ""He has not been good to the police, simply, and the police are not big fans of his,"" Trump said.
Trump traveled 45 minutes outside of Milwaukee, which is 40 percent black, to deliver his appeal to African-American voters in the suburb of West Bend, Wisconsin, a community that is 95 percent white. He spoke before an almost entirely white audience. ""A vote for her (Clinton) is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunities,"" Trump said. ""Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and it will never be accepted in a Trump administration."" Clinton won the Democratic nomination in part thanks to her large victory margins among minorities in nearly every state, including overwhelming support from African-Americans in the South.""With each passing Trump attack, it becomes clearer that his strategy is just to say about Hillary Clinton what's true of himself,"" Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said.""When people started saying he was temperamentally unfit, he called Hillary the same. When his ties to the Kremlin came under scrutiny, he absurdly claimed that Hillary was the one who was too close to Putin.
""Now he's accusing her of bigoted remarks - we think the American people will know which candidate is guilty of the charge.""Trump also took aim at Clinton's past acceptance of large speaking fees, saying he would force top administration officials to sign a pledge not to accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyists or foreign countries for five years after leaving office.Police violence against African-Americans has set off intermittent, sometimes violent protests in the past two years, igniting a national debate over race and policing in the United States and giving rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.Trump said critics of the police ""share in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and other places in our country.""""The war on our police must end and it must end now,"" Trump said. ""The war on police is a war against all peaceful citizens.""
The shooting of Smith was likely justified, Trump argued in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday morning.""But the gun was pointed at his (a police officer's) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That's what the narrative is,"" Trump said. ""Maybe it's not true. If it is true, people shouldn't be rioting."" SECURITY BRIEFING  
Officials from the Office of Director of National Intelligence are expected to give Trump a briefing on national security issues this week, an adviser to Trump and a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Presidential candidates are entitled to a briefing of classified information after formally securing the nomination, which Trump did last month. Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for the Nov. 8 election, is also entitled to receive a briefing if she requests one.Democrats have criticized Trump's positions on foreign policy and national security, besides some freewheeling remarks. Democratic President Barack Obama has called Trump ""unfit"" for the presidency and this month warned the Republican candidate that briefing information must be kept secret.

By Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The government is offering to help states protect the Nov. 8 U.S. election from hacking or other tampering, in the face of allegations by Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump that the system is open to fraud.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told state officials in a phone call on Monday that federal cyber security experts could scan for vulnerabilities in voting systems and provide other resources to help protect against infiltration, his office said in a statement.Trump has questioned the integrity of U.S. election systems in recent weeks, but his allegations have been vague and unsubstantiated.The attempts to sow doubts about the 2016 election results  coincided with Trump's slide in opinion polls against Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton and missteps in his campaign. His complaints have focused on fears of voter fraud - that people will vote more than once - rather than election rigging.
""I mean people are going to walk in, they're going to vote 10 times maybe. Who knows? They're going to vote 10 times. So I am very concerned and I hope the Republicans are going to be very watchful,"" Trump said in an Aug. 3 interview.President Barack Obama dismissed the claims as ""ridiculous."" ""Of course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?"" Obama said at a news conference the next day.
In his phone call, Johnson encouraged the state officials to comply with federal cyber recommendations, such as making sure electronic voting machines are not connected to the internet while voting is taking place, the department said.Concerns in both parties about manipulation of electronic electoral systems are not new. Hackers can wreak havoc in myriad ways, from hijacking a candidate's website to hacking voting machines or deleting or changing election records.
An Electronic Privacy Information Center report this week said 32 of the 50 states would allow voting by insecure email, fax and internet portals in this election cycle.  (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Grant McCool)"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

MEXICO CITY Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Tuesday he was  willing to meet with Donald Trump, months after comparing the Republican presidential candidate to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.""Yes, I would meet with him,"" Pena Nieto said, referring to Trump in a pre-taped television interview broadcast on Tuesday night. ""I have never met him. I can't agree with some of the things he has said, but I will be absolutely respectful and will seek to work with whomever becomes the next president of the United States.""
Trump has sparked outrage in Mexico with his campaign vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to make Mexico pay for it.In a Mexican newspaper interview in March, Pena Nieto said Mexico would not pay for the proposed wall under any scenario, likening Trump's ""strident tone"" to the World War II era dictators. 
But at a June summit in Canada, Pena Nieto said he only drew the comparison as a reminder of the devastation wreaked in the past.

BERLIN Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ignored the facts with his assertion that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy had resulted in a huge increase in crime, a German minister told Reuters on Tuesday.Trump said Merkel's decision to welcome more than a million refugees to Germany was a ""disaster"" during a campaign rally in Ohio on Monday and said his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton wanted to be like the German leader.""In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany,"" Trump said. ""Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe.""Statistics compiled by the German Interior Ministry showed the number of crimes reported in 2015 - excluding visa violations and other immigration violations - remained essentially unchanged from the previous year at 5.9 million.Michael Roth, Germany's European affairs minister, told Reuters Trump's statement was incorrect and it was important to correct campaign statements in other countries that were based on ""fears, lies and half-truths"", given the importance of the U.S. election for the world.
""I'm sorry that the Republican presidential candidate trumpets out things like that without any factual basis,"" Roth said.""If he had studied the actual situation in Germany, he would know that, while the many refugees who came to Germany and Europe pose a big challenge for us, and everything is still not completely resolved, they have not led to a massive increase in crime rates.""
Roth said Germany remained a peaceful country where people treated each other with respect, and efforts continued to integrate the refugees into the broader society and economy.German authorities identified 12,710 cases of illegal migration -  mostly from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq - in the first half of 2016, compared with 128,655 cases in all 2015, Germany's Funke Mediengruppe reported on Tuesday, quoting the government's response to a parliamentary query.
It said authorities had stopped about 1 million people to check their immigration status in the first half of the year, compared with about 3 million in the full year of 2015. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Janet Lawrence, Larry King)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
