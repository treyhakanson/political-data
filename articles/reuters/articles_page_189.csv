By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump staged a harsh attack on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, accusing her of corruption and dangerous incompetence as he tried to put his campaign back on track after recent setbacks.In a speech in New York that Clinton's campaign called ""nutty"" and that was criticized by some Republicans, Trump argued that the former secretary of state is part of a political establishment that has cheated American workers through bad trade deals and endangered U.S. national security.Both candidates are seeking to overcome their high unfavorable ratings among voters at the Nov. 8 election by painting the other as a villain who puts personal gain over the interests of less powerful Americans. Even by the standards of modern presidential races, the sparring between Clinton, a former secretary of state and U.S. senator, and brash businessman Trump has made for unusually acidic rhetoric.""Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States,"" Trump told a small crowd of supporters at a hotel he owns in Manhattan, accusing her of having run the State Department ""like her own personal hedge fund."" Clinton's staff quickly dismissed that attack and others as ""lies.""Trump read his speech from a teleprompter to curb his off-the-cuff comments but he pulled no punches. He said Clinton ""has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft"" and described her as ""a world-class liar.""Republican Lindsey Graham, a U.S. senator from South Carolina who has so far declined to support Trump, said he disagreed that Clinton may be the most corrupt person to have run for the White House, and challenged Trump to become more presidential.""My advice to Mr. Trump would be to make the case that you have the temperament, knowledge and judgment to be president,"" he said on CNN. ""That's the mountain you've got to climb.""Trump's campaign has been distracted in recent weeks by racially-charged comments he made about a Mexican-American judge and the Republican's firing of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski this week.    
The New York real estate mogul is trailing Clinton in most opinion polls, and campaign finance figures released on Monday show he has raised only a fraction of the amount Clinton has brought in, although Trump has said he is willing to loan his campaign more money.    CLINTON FOUNDATION 
In his speech, Trump repeated accusations that Clinton's decisions as America's top diplomat were influenced by donations to the Clinton Foundation and associated charities. Clinton and her staff have denied this and similar allegations, dismissing them as politically motivated smears.
""The only thing Donald Trump offered today was more hypocritical lies and nutty conspiracy theories,"" Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said.The State Department has said it is not aware of any evidence of improper influence, although it has acknowledged that new donations from foreign governments should have been submitted to the department's ethics advisers for prior review but were not, in breach of an ethics agreement Clinton signed before taking office.Trump attacked the Clinton Foundation for accepting millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and other countries criticized by the United States for not protecting the rights of women and gay people. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, has said that accepting such funding is not an endorsement of everything a foreign government does.Clinton added a pointed defense of the Clinton Foundation in a speech later on Wednesday.""The Clinton Foundation helps poor people around the world get access to lifesaving AIDS medicine,"" she told cheering supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""Donald Trump uses poor people around the world to produce his line of suits and ties.""
Trump also said Clinton had used bad political judgment in her four years as secretary of state, failing to stop the rise of Islamic State, keep strong sanctions on Iran or avoid chaos in Libya.""Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched,"" Trump said.         On Tuesday, Clinton delivered her own blistering attack on Trump, saying that putting him in the White House would be a disaster for the U.S. economy. On Wednesday, Clinton won the endorsement of former U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, a Republican who served under Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush.A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed that 44.5 percent of likely voters backed Clinton, while 35.5 percent supported Trump.Some of the accusations made by Trump on Wednesday appeared to contradict the public record.He said Clinton would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees to the United States without any prior screening. But under the current process, refugees must wait months or years in foreign camps while U.S. security agencies review their backgrounds, a system Clinton supports.Trump said Clinton was sleeping ""soundly"" in her bed as a deadly attack unfolded in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 in which four Americans were killed. State Department records show Clinton was in her State Department office when news of the opening assaults came through. She has said she later worked through the night on the U.S. response.             (Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Alistair Bell and Leslie Adler)"

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Facing slumping poll numbers and a shakeup of his team, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump takes a detour from the campaign trail this week to visit his golf resorts in Scotland.Trump leaves Thursday on a three-day trip centered on the grand reopening of Trump Turnberry, which the New York businessman bought in 2014 and renovated at an estimated cost of $290 million. He will also visit his other Scottish golf property in Aberdeen.His visit to Scotland, the birthplace of his mother, comes as Britain votes on Thursday on whether to remain in the European Union. Trump has said Britain would probably be better off if it left the EU. He will hold a news conference on Friday when he will doubtless be asked to respond to the vote.Trump's trip abroad comes at an unusual time given the political calendar.With less than a month left until the Republican convention in Cleveland where he is to be formally nominated, Trump is lagging in fundraising and campaign organization and taking heavy fire from Democrat Hillary Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election.He is under pressure to adopt a more presidential demeanor and strengthen his campaign organization after a rocky period in which he criticized a U.S.-born federal judge as unfair because of his Mexican heritage and took fire for his response to the killing of 49 people at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub.Just this week, he fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski at the urging of family members alarmed at the direction of his campaign. It also emerged that he had only $1.3 million in cash on hand at the end of May to fund his campaign, compared with  Clinton's war chest of $42 million.His poll numbers have also dropped. After sealing the nomination seven weeks ago, Trump was basically tied in national polls with Clinton. But she has crept ahead in many polls in the past two weeks.
'PLACE WITH NO VOTERS'
Trump and his aides see the Scotland visit as a chance to showcase his far-flung business empire and job-creating abilities.Aides said the trip also reinforced his ancestral ties to Scotland and his love of family, with his children playing an important role in his business dealings.
But many Republicans see Trump's trip to Scotland as a waste of valuable time.""It has nothing to do with running for president,"" said Republican strategist Rick Tyler, who was a spokesman for  former presidential candidate, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. ""It speaks to the non-seriousness of the campaign when you're taking time off the campaign trail to leave the country for a place where there are no voters.""Trump's golf properties are among his proudest business possessions and he is particularly proud of Turnberry, where the British Open has been played four times, including the famed ""Duel in the Sun"" in 1977 when Tom Watson edged Jack Nicklaus by one stroke.Limiting the trip to his golf properties means there are likely to be fewer chances for missteps like 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney's gaffe-filled trip to London, Jerusalem and Poland four years ago.
But it offers little chance for Trump to burnish his foreign policy credentials.""Traditionally, nominees take overseas trips to build their foreign policy chops,"" said Republican strategist Scott Reed.Trump is not meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has denounced Trump as divisive for his proposed Muslim ban and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

By Eric Beech and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled an alternative plan to overhaul the nation's healthcare system on Wednesday, slamming Obamacare even as they aimed to keep some of its more popular provisions.Their proposal, part of broader effort by House Speaker Paul Ryan to offer a Republican agenda ahead of the Nov. 8 elections, is conservatives' latest bid to ""repeal and replace"" the 2010 law.Ryan, the country's highest-ranking elected Republican, is offering the proposal as the party seeks to maintain control of both the House and the Senate and take over the White House. Other proposals cover tax reform, address poverty as well as national security.Republicans have challenged President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act since it was enacted and have voted repeatedly to repeal it. Obama, a Democrat, has said it has helped some 20 million Americans get health care coverage.Ryan acknowledged his agenda was unlikely to displace current law anytime soon.    ""We're not going to repeal Obamacare when the current president of the United States is a guy named Obama,"" he told reporters. ""What we are laying out today is a first-time-in-six-years consensus by the Republicans in the House on what we replace Obamacare with.""
In their plan, which is not formal legislation, House Republicans blasted Obamacare for limiting patients' choices, increasing consumer costs, and burying employers and health care providers under new regulations.Ryan's proposal would keep some popular pieces, including not allowing people with pre-existing conditions to be denied coverage and permitting children to stay on their parents' coverage until age 26.It would also allow states that have already expanded the number of people eligible for Medicaid under the law to maintain the additional coverage, although it would prevent any new states from doing so.     
For people without insurance through their jobs, the Republicans would establish a refundable tax credit. Obamacare also provides subsidies for people to buy insurance if they do not qualify for Medicaid.It also includes long-held Republican proposals such as allowing consumers to buy health insurance across state lines, expanding health savings accounts, reforming medical liability rules and giving block grants to states to run Medicaid programs for the poor.Democrats, who have said they are open to tweaking Obamacare, dismissed Ryan's proposals as little more than warmed-over ideas that have long been in the Republican playbook. 
House Republican would gradually raise the Medicare eligibility age, now 65, to match that of the Social Security pension plan, which is 67 for people born in 1960 or later.Like Obamacare's so-called Cadillac tax on expensive healthcare plans offered by employers, which goes into effect in 2018, the Republican proposal would cap the tax deductibility of employer-based plans. Industry groups struck a bipartisan tone in their reaction ahead of the election, as it remains to be seen who ultimately wins control of Congress and the White House. ""We stand ready to work with both parties on market-based solutions that improve access and affordability for consumers,"" said Marilyn Tavenner, president of America's Health Insurance Plans.

By Diane Bartz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Seven Democratic senators urged the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday to block two mergers of major health insurance companies, saying that the proposed deals would mean higher premiums and lower-quality healthcare for consumers.The department is reviewing Aetna Inc's $33 billion plan to buy Humana Inc and Anthem Inc's $48 billion proposal to buy Cigna Corp. If approved, the deals, both of which were announced last July, would reduce the number of national health insurance carriers from five to three.""We urge the DOJ (Justice Department) to challenge these mergers from proceeding and to prevent the damage they would cause to competition and consumers,"" wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Al Franken of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dianne Feinstein of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii.The letter was dated Wednesday and addressed to Renata Hesse, who heads the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.In the letter, the lawmakers said they were skeptical of the idea that the proposed deals would be good for consumers because the companies could use their larger size to hammer out better deals for patients. 
""The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that few if any cost savings secured by the merging firms through the exercise of market power will be passed on to consumers,"" they wrote.The lawmakers also disagreed with the notion that the sale of carefully chosen assets to a competitor could resolve antitrust issues, and pointed to past instances where mergers with divestitures led to higher premiums or where competitors bought divested assets, but then did not use them.
""We are not convinced that any divestitures required of the merging parties will succeed today, given that they have so clearly failed in the recent past,"" the lawmakers wrote.Capitol Hill does not have a say in whether the Justice Department sues to stop deals.Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said that the company planned to close the merger with Humana in the second half of this year.
""We believe a combined company is in the best interest of consumers. We continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice on its thorough review of the transaction,"" Crawford said.Representatives of Anthem could not immediately be reached for comment.
