By Julia Harte
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A criminal justice bill awaiting a vote by the U.S. Senate would reduce federal prison costs by $722 million over the next 10 years by releasing thousands of federal prisoners early, congressional forecasters said on Wednesday.Federal benefits received by the newly released prisoners would increase direct spending by $251 million and reduce revenues by $8 million over the same period, according to the estimate by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office.The new savings estimate buoyed supporters of the bipartisan measure to lower mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, which is central to President Barack Obama's efforts to overhaul the country's federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding. ""We have an obligation to change the way we think about incarceration, and today's CBO report shows that we have a fiscal obligation as well,"" said the bill's co-authors, U.S. senators Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, in a statement.
The bill was revised last month to exclude prisoners convicted of violent crimes in an effort to garner more support among conservatives. Still, its prospects for moving to a full Senate vote remain unclear. Some key Republican senators are reluctant to support the bill until it includes changes to ""mens rea"" laws that govern criminal intent. 
Parallel sentencing reforms await a floor vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.A White House study last month found that current sentencing and incarceration policies strain state budgets, take people out of the work force and pull families apart more than they reduce crime or boost the U.S. economy.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Tuesday cleared the way for approval of $1.1 billion in immediate funds to battle the Zika virus that is linked to birth defects, well above what is in legislation pending in the House of Representatives.By a vote of 68-29, senators limited debate on the measure, paving the way for likely Senate approval this week. Two other funding approaches failed to get enough support to advance in the Senate.Meanwhile, the White House threatened to veto a $622.1 million Zika bill poised to pass the House of Representatives later this week, saying it was ""woefully inadequate.""Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill also requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere.Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts.Republican Senator Roy Blunt from Missouri told reporters that the Senate measure ""trimmed this package back (from Obama's request) to what really addresses the emergency at the time.""
Democratic Senator Patty Murray from Washington, who crafted the legislation with Blunt, added, ""We are going to need to keep the pressure on House Republicans to set aside their partisan bill and actually get the administration the emergency resources they need.""It was unclear how long it might take the Senate and House to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.
Last year, Brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the Americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern U.S. states including Florida.House Republicans argue their $622.1 million bill, when coupled with $589 million the Obama administration already shifted to Zika from unused funds to battle Ebola, would provide enough money through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year.
The administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine.(This version of the story was corrected to say $622.1 million from $622.1 billion in the 3rd and 11th paragraphs.)

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON More than half the Democrats in the Senate, including many of President Barack Obama's strongest supporters, signed a letter to him on Wednesday urging him to move more quickly to admit Syrian refugees into the United States.Despite Obama's pledge to admit 10,000 of the people fleeing Syria's civil war in the year ending this September, only 1,736 have been allowed into the country so far. In contrast, more than 6,000 have been admitted from Myanmar and more than 5,000 have been admitted from Iraq.""We urge your Administration to devote the necessary resources to expeditiously and safely resettle refugees from Syria,"" the 27 senators wrote in the letter, which was seen by Reuters.""We are deeply concerned about the slow pace of admissions for Syrian refugees in the first seven months of the fiscal year,"" the letter said.
The lead signers on the letter included Senator Richard Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate, and Senator Amy Klobuchar. The letter was signed by 25 other members of the Democratic caucus, including presidential candidate Bernie SandersIt requested an update on specific measures the administration plans to take to fulfill its commitment to resettle the remaining 8,264 Syrians within five months.
Obama said in late April that he expected the United States to meet his goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees before Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.But Obama's promise sparked a firestorm of criticism in the United States, mostly from Republicans who say that violent militants could enter the country by posing as refugees. More than 30 governors, most of them Republicans, have tried to block refugees from coming to their states.
The United States has offered refuge to far fewer of the millions fleeing war in Syria and Iraq than many of its closest allies. Germany has taken in hundreds of thousands. Canada admitted 26,859 Syrian refugees between Nov. 4, 2015, and May 1, 2016.""Other nations, including ours, can and should do much more,"" the senators said in the letter.

By Daniel Wiessner

The Obama administration on Tuesday unveiled the final version of a long-awaited and controversial rule to extend overtime pay to 4.2 million U.S. workers, which marks one of the administration's most significant moves to address stagnant wages. The rule, which has drawn intense criticism from business groups and Republicans, doubles the maximum annual income a salaried worker can earn and still be automatically eligible for overtime pay from $23,660 to $47,476 and requires that threshold to be updated every three years. It takes effect Dec. 1.Officials said many workers will earn more money, an estimated total of $12 billion over the next decade, while others will work fewer hours for the same pay.""More than 4 million workers are either going to be paid more or get time back to raise their family, go to school ... or retrain to get a better job,"" Vice President Joe Biden said during a phone call with reporters on Tuesday.The rule will likely touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy but is expected to have the greatest impact on nonprofit groups, retail companies, hotels and restaurants, which have many management workers whose salaries are below the new threshold.
Business groups, which lobbied heavily against the changes, say companies will be forced to cut wages and hours and may slow hiring.The Obama administration and supporters of the new rule say the $23,660 threshold allowed companies to hold down labor costs by requiring workers with relatively low incomes to work well over 40 hours per week without additional pay.
The rule will likely face legal challenges, including claims that the U.S. Labor Department flouted legal requirements for creating new regulations. Republicans in Congress have said they will move to block the rule, but they would need to overcome a veto from President Barack Obama. The new threshold was lower than the $50,440 standard proposed by the Obama administration last year, but the last-minute change to lower it, which was widely expected, did little to appease critics. Any federal standard above the $35,100 overtime threshold in New York, which has a high cost of living, will inhibit economic growth in more rural states in the South and Midwest, Tammy McCutchen, a Washington D.C. lawyer who works with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Tuesday before the final rule was announced.
The threshold also disappointed proponents of the new rule, including Ross Eisenbrey of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, who first pitched an overhaul to the White House in 2013.""It means a million fewer employees will be helped,"" he said before the rule was released.

By Ginger Gibson and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each picked up primary wins on Tuesday in yet another demonstration of how divided the party is in the drawn-out national race to win the nomination for November's general election.Clinton narrowly defeated Sanders in Kentucky, a state where she was not expected to win. Sanders bested her in Oregon, a state that played to his strengths.In Kentucky, the two candidates will likely split the 55 delegates up for grabs. In Oregon, Sanders will take only a handful more of the 61 delegates that were awarded.    Clinton's sizeable lead in delegates means it is likely she will eventually be her party's nominee, but she remains more than 100 delegates short of sealing the deal. The Democratic primary now hits a two-week lull, with the final set major contests, including California, scheduled for June 7.Clinton, who spent the past two days campaigning in Kentucky, would like to lock up the nomination and turn her attention to the Nov. 8 general election and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Trump has begun to organize his general election campaign. On Tuesday, he signed a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee. The agreement allows him to raise $449,400 from a single donor by splitting the funds between his campaign, the RNC and state Republican parties. Trump, who eschewed donations in the political system through the primary, has thus far insisted on mostly self-funding his campaign. The shift to a more traditional fundraising approach could draw the ire of some supporters.Trump, in an interview with Megyn Kelly that aired on Fox News Tuesday night, said he did have regrets about his actions during the Republican primary process.""I could have used different language in a couple of instances, but overall I'm happy with the outcome,"" Trump said. NEVADA STILL RANKLES
Sanders supporters became angry when Nevada state party officials chose to end their convention and block efforts to award the U.S. senator from Vermont more delegates than he initially won in the February caucus. Clinton won the caucus.
The Nevada incident was a warning about the potential for fireworks at July's Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.Clinton's campaign continued to express confidence that she would be able to unify the party.""Hillary Clinton is grateful to the thousands of Nevadans who came out to participate in the caucuses and convention process,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said.""She believes every voice should be heard and no one should be intimidated, harassed or threatened in this process. When the primary process is complete, our party must come together and ensure a Democrat is elected to serve as our next president,"" Mook said.Sanders on Tuesday joined his supporters in criticizing the Nevada Democratic Party after Saturday's events.One Sanders supporter threw a chair, unhappy about being blocked in a rules vote that was part of the effort to help the senator win more delegates to the national convention. Others drew chalk graffiti on a party building, while the state's party chairwoman has been receiving death threats.
Sanders framed Nevada's incident as a warning.""If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned,"" Sanders said in a statement on the Nevada incident.  Sanders - who said he condemns violence and personal harassment of individuals - leveled some of the same complaints his supporters did, arguing that state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange did not allow a headcount on a disputed rules change. He also argued that 64 delegates to the state convention were not given a hearing before being ruled ineligible.THREATS OF VIOLENCE 
The state party disputed the Sanders campaign's interpretation of the events. It said some delegates did not show up at the convention and others were disqualified because they were not registered as Democrats in time.
""The Sanders campaign is continuing to be dishonest about what happened Saturday and is failing to adequately denounce the threats of violence of his supporters,"" the Nevada Democratic Party said in a statement.Sanders supporters began circulating a picture of Lange on the internet that included her cellphone number and encouraged others to contact her to express their unhappiness. Lange said on MSNBC she had been receiving death threats, including many containing vulgar language. Public messages sent to her Twitter account included a barrage of derogatory statements.MSNBC played some of the voicemails, including one saying ""people like you should be hung in a public execution.""""What you heard is a few of the thousands of emails and texts and Facebook messages and Twitter messages that I've gotten,"" Lange said on MSNBC. ""Threats to my family, to my grandson, to my husband. Sanders' continued presence in the race is prompting concerns among Clinton allies that he will damage her ability to take on Trump and hurt her in the fall. But Sanders supporters shrug off that worry, arguing that Trump is such a flawed candidate that Clinton will easily dispatch with him if she faces him in the Nov. 8 election.Clinton's camp seems to agree. ""Ultimately, we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose -- to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trump's hands,"" her campaign manager Mook said.

By Amanda Becker and Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton begins a two-day tour on Monday through rural, traditionally coal-reliant parts of the eastern Appalachian region where Republican rival Donald Trump's pro-coal, anti-trade message has resonated with economically distressed voters. Clinton, in a move to reclaim her early pledge to focus on helping the struggling region resuscitate its economies, will meet the head of a local steel workers union, retired mine workers and others in Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio affected by declining coal and steel prices.Her pledge of more than $30 billion to help coal regions was overshadowed in March when Clinton, at an Ohio town hall, said the country would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""Clinton's statement was seized upon by coal industry groups and Republican lawmakers such as U.S. Senators Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, both from Kentucky, as evidence she planned to continue carrying out President Barack Obama's regulatory ""war"" on coal.Clinton immediately sent an apology letter to Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, an early supporter, pledging to ""focus my team and administration on bringing jobs to Appalachia"" and help its residents adjust to a wave of coal company bankruptcies and changes in the U.S. energy market.Her decision to embark on an Appalachian tour is in part timed ahead of Democratic nominating contests in West Virginia on May 10 and in Kentucky on May 17 as she seeks to secure the nomination before the party's July convention.Clinton won Ohio's contest in mid-March, besting rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.
However, her aides say her decision to focus on the region also reflects her commitment to show voters she will work for them if elected, even if they do not support her now. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned on Sunday in West Virginia, encountering protests from Trump supporters and being asked about Clinton's town hall remark and subsequent apology, according to local media reports. Manchin accompanied the former president, who is also expected to campaign in Kentucky on Tuesday.West Virginia last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for his second four-year term. He is the only Democrat who has won Kentucky since 1980.During her first presidential run, Clinton defeated Obama in the 2008 primaries in those states but lost the nomination to him. Her tour is an early move to siphon support from Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, who has called for continued coal production and dismissed environmental concerns as a policy priority.
LAYOFFS, HEALTH CONCERNS
Clinton's first stop, at a restaurant in Ashland, Kentucky, will be a discussion with the leader of a local steel workers union and several of some 600 workers who were laid off when AK Steel Holding Corp announced in October that it would idle one of its furnaces amid a supply glut and lower steel prices.
Clinton last month criticized China's announcement that it was encouraging increased steel output amid a global surplus that is driving down prices and said, if elected, she would crack down on Chinese trade practices.She will continue to Williamson, West Virginia, a once-thriving town near the state's border with Kentucky in Mingo County, the heart of the coal-producing region. Its main streets had been dotted with empty store fronts as coal mining employment has been cut in half over the past four years. The town is now trying to reshape its economy.Clinton will meet retired mine workers there and also tour the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, which serves as the nerve center for a local program that aims to drive economic revitalization through a health-focused, local-foods movement using land once designated for mining to drive large-scale agricultural development.Aides say Clinton's interest in the region's economic troubles was piqued after she left the U.S. State Department in 2013. She circulated data to aides then about studies related to decreased life expectancies for less-educated white adults in Appalachia, where the decline in coal-related employment has been accompanied by a growth in opioid addiction, diabetes and other health issues.Clinton has throughout her campaign criticized attempts made by coal companies to ""shirk"" the responsibility to pay healthcare benefits for retirees during bankruptcy proceedings, saying the country owes them gratitude for fueling decades of economic success.

By Heather Somerville
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that a dangerous financial bubble has formed in the technology industry - and Silicon Valley responded with a collective eye roll. In a Reuters interview, the New York billionaire said technology start-ups that had never earned a profit were able to sell shares at very high prices, likening the situation to the overheated stock market in 2007.""I'm talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars, so here we go again,"" Trump said.Many tech watchers have repeatedly warned of a tech bubble as the number of private companies valued at $1 billion or more - known as unicorns - have soared to 163, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights.So Trump's declaration, in the eyes of Silicon Valley's entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, was nothing new. Investors and others took to Twitter to poke fun at Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again!"" by repeating the phrase, ""Make Bubbles Great Again.""    ""FINALLY someone calls it out,"" Marc Andreessen, a general partner at the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, tweeted, mocking Trump.In the interview, Trump said the high valuations that tech start-ups are able to fetch today remind him of 2007, when an overheated housing market helped drive U.S. stocks to unsustainable valuations before the bubble burst.
""You have a stock market that is very strange,"" the presumptive Republican nominee said. ""You look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company, and they're selling for so much money. And I would have said can that ever happen again? I think that could happen again.""Some startup founders rejected Trump's generalization that all companies are burning cash and overvalued; certainly many of them are, and in the last several months a correction has started to rectify years of exuberant investments. Still, other companies continue to raise money successfully and turn profits.
""So far he has been saying dumb things but they seem to be getting dumber and dumber,"" Vivek Wadhwa, an entrepreneur and Stanford University fellow, told Reuters.""I was going to tweet (the comments) while calling Peter Thiel and saying, 'Here is your buddy.'""Thiel, an influential investor well-known for his contrarian ideas, is one of the few Silicon Valley leaders to openly support Trump.Thiel was not immediately available for comment.
""There is nothing in his (Trump's) track record to show that he has been out here and met with any technology leaders and knows this industry and knows about innovation,"" said Aaron Ginn, co-founder of the Lincoln Initiative, a community that promotes libertarian and technology-friendly values. Which is ironic, Ginn said, given how much technology - especially Twitter - has helped Trump's campaign.""He says things and does things that are made for entertainment,"" Ginn said.Read more on our interview with Trump here (Reporting by Heather Somerville; Editing by Peter Henderson and Tiffany Wu)"	['Trump']	[]
7	7	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-exclusive-idUSKCN0Y82JO	Exclusive: Trump would talk to North Korea's Kim, wants to renegotiate climate accord	"


By Steve Holland and Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday he is willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program, proposing a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation.In a wide-ranging interview with Reuters, Trump also called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord, said he disapproved of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in eastern Ukraine, and said he would seek to dismantle most of the U.S. Dodd-Frank financial regulations if he is elected president.The presumptive Republican nominee declined to share details of his plans to deal with North Korea, but said he was open to talking to its leader. ""I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,"" he said. Asked whether he would try to talk some sense into the North Korean leader, Trump replied, ""Absolutely."" North Korea's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's remarks.    Trump, 69, also said he would press China, Pyongyang's only major diplomatic and economic supporter, to help find a solution.""I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China,"" he said in the interview in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan. ""China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call.""    A Chinese official said dialogue was needed to resolve issues on the Korean peninsula.""China supports direct talks and communication between the United States and North Korea. We believe this is beneficial,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters.Trump's preparedness to talk directly with Kim contrasts with President Barack Obama's policy of relying on senior U.S. officials to talk to senior North Korean officials.Obama has not engaged personally with Kim, but he has pushed for new diplomatic overtures to Iran and Cuba that produced a nuclear deal with Tehran and improved ties with Havana.Sitting at his desk with an expansive view of Central Park, Trump spoke at length about his economic and foreign policy ideas in the half-hour interview. Facing him on his desk is a framed photograph of his father, the late Fred Trump. A wall displays framed photos of Trump with various celebrities, as well as numerous magazine covers on which he has appeared.On Russia, Trump tempered past praise of Putin, saying the nice comments the Russian leader has made about him in the past would only go so far.
""The fact that he said good things about me doesn't mean that it's going to help him in a negotiation. It won't help him at all,"" he said.An adviser to Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential candidate, criticized Trump's foreign policy comments, noting they came soon after Trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""Let me get this straight: Donald Trump insults the leader of our closest ally, then turns around and says he'd love to talk to Kim Jong Un?"" Clinton's senior foreign policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a statement.Trump ""seems to have a bizarre fascination with foreign strongmen like Putin and Kim. But his approach to foreign policy makes no sense for the rest of us,"" he said.In the Reuters interview, Trump said he thought Cameron's criticism of him was inappropriate but ""I'm sure I'll have a good relationship with him.""CLIMATE ACCORD

Trump said he is ""not a big fan"" of the Paris climate accord, which prescribes reductions in carbon emissions by more than 170 countries. He said he would want to renegotiate the deal because it treats the United States unfairly and gives favorable treatment to countries like China. ""I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else,"" he said.A renegotiation of the pact would be a major setback for what was hailed as the first truly global climate accord, committing both rich and poor nations to reining in the rise in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet.Trump has been criticized for offering far fewer specific policy proposals than Clinton, his likely rival for the Nov. 8 presidential election.The New York billionaire said he planned to release a detailed policy platform in two weeks that would propose dismantling nearly all of Dodd-Frank, a package of financial reforms put in place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis.""Dodd-Frank is a very negative force, which has developed a very bad name,"" he said.Trump took a dim view of Clinton's stated desire to put her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in charge of building up the U.S. economy. 
""The wife wants to make him in charge of the economy,"" he said.Clinton described Trump's idea of dismantling Dodd-Frank as reckless. ""Latest reckless idea from Trump: gut rules on Wall Street, and leave middle-class families out to dry,"" she said on Twitter.FINANCIAL BUBBLE?
Trump said he perceived a dangerous financial bubble in the tech start-up industry, with some companies selling shares at high valuations without ever turning a profit.""I'm talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars,"" he said.Silicon Valley investors responded on Twitter by poking fun at Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again!"" by repeating the phrase, ""Make Bubbles Great Again.""On the U.S. Federal Reserve, Trump said that while he eventually wants a Republican to head it, he is ""not an enemy"" of current chair Janet Yellen, who was appointed by Obama.""I'm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low-interest rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head, which can happen at some point,"" he said, adding that inflation ""doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon.""    The real estate mogul said he would maintain the current level of benefits for Social Security recipients, a position championed by former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. Trump said he would not raise the retirement age or impose a sliding scale of benefits depending on income levels.Some Republican lawmakers have pushed for structural reforms to Social Security to extend its solvency.The depleted Social Security Trust Fund, Trump said, would be replenished by the increased tax revenue that would flow into the government from the higher job growth spurred by his economic policies.

By Emily Flitter and Steve Holland
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential contender Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would renegotiate America's role in the U.N. global climate accord, spelling potential doom for an agreement many view as a last chance to turn the tide on global warming.A pull-out by the world's second biggest carbon-emitting country would hobble the deal reached in Paris last December by nearly 200 nations, who for the first time in more than two decades found a common vision for curbing greenhouse gas emissions.""I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else,"" the New York real estate mogul said in an interview with Reuters. ""But those agreements are one-sided agreements and they are bad for the United States.""Trump said he did not believe China, the world's top emitter of the carbon dioxide gas that many scientists believe is contributing to global climate change, would adhere to its pledge under the Paris deal.""Not a big fan because other countries don't adhere to it, and China doesn't adhere to it, and China's spewing into the atmosphere,"" he said.The accord to transform the world's fossil-fuel driven economy was a potent signal to investors. 
It seeks to limit a rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius through combined national pledges to cut emissions, and provide funding for developing nations to mitigate the damaging effects of a sea level rise and climate change.The Obama administration pledged a 26 to 28 percent domestic reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005, while China promised it would halt increases in carbon emissions by 2030. Both countries have promised to ratify the deal this year.Many U.S. Republicans have found fault with the deal for overreacting to what they see as an uncertain threat.
Former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who helped broker the deal, said this month that the U.S. election was critical to its future. ""If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption,"" he said.Trump has said that he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business. One of his energy policy advisers is a climate change skeptic, U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota.Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic contender for the White House, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030.Trump's comment drew fire from environmental advocates.
""This is another example of Trump's dangerous lack of judgment and the very real impacts it could have for all of us,"" said Gene Karpinski, president of the U.S.-based environmental group League of Conservation Voters. ""Trump's denunciation of the Paris climate accord is not only short sighted, but would be terribly costly for America and our ability to lead the world. We cannot go backwards on this important step towards a clean energy economy that benefits all our families,"" billionaire environmental financier Tom Steyer said in a statement.The Paris agreement has an article built into it meant to protect countries in the accord in the event that a new government comes in and wants to dismantle it. The clause says any nation wanting to withdraw will first have to wait four years.U.S. chief climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said last week that regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election, other countries were likely to be bound by the pact.

NEW YORK - Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump told Reuters in a wide-ranging interview on Tuesday that he would be willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program.He also called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord and said he would dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations if he is elected president.Here are excerpts of the interview.NORTH KOREA
On speaking to Kim Jong Un:""I would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him. At the same time, I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China. People don't realize that. They are extracting vast billions of dollars out of our country. Billions. And we have tremendous power over China. China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call.""WALL STREET REGULATION
On breaking up big banks: ""The big banks aren't big banks compared to other big banks. In other words if you look at the big banks in Germany or if you look at the big banks in China, I have the biggest bank in the world right downstairs four or five floors below us. ... If we make our big banks too much not big, they won't be able to compete with the banks from China and the banks from Germany and other big banks.""On repealing Dodd-Frank: ""I'm going to be making a statement about this in approximately two weeks having to do with Dodd-Frank. Much of it is very bad. Much of it gives so much power to the regulators that the bankers are unable to function.""""Dodd Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function. ... It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop. And will there be bad loans made? Yes, but there are bad loans made now with Dodd-Frank, OK, I mean all you have to do is take a look.""""The rules and regulations of Dodd Frank have made it so impossible to carry out business and to, especially with respect to lending to businesses who are going to employ a lot of people. So I'm going to make a statement about it. But Dodd-Frank - I mean there are some things in Dodd-Frank that can stay but overall Dodd-Frank has been very bad.""STOCK MARKET, TECH INDUSTRY    
On tech stocks:""You have a stock market that is very strange. Could be a little bit similar to, would you say it's nine years ago now? I guess it's sort of nine years ago. But you know, you look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company and they're selling for so much money. And I would have said can that ever happen again? I think that could happen again.""""I'm talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars. So here we go again.""
FEDERAL RESERVE
On auditing the Fed: ""I think number one, the Federal Reserve should be audited. You know, they're not auditing it. And so far not too many people have been able to tell me why. I'm not one that says we should get rid of the Federal Reserve because I think the Federal Reserve has an important function, but it should certainly be audited and ... we should at least watch what they're doing from the dollar standpoint.""On timing for audit-the-Fed legislation: ""It's not my highest priority. I have other priorities like rebuild our military. ... It's not my number one priority. But certainly it's one of the things that we'll be doing.""On replacing Fed Chair Janet Yellen: ""I'm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low interest rate person, unless inflation rears its ugly head, which could happen at some point. It doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon. I don't think I want to at this point - I mean, number one, she's got time left.""""I would rather have a Republican in the position, but I am not the enemy of Janet Yellen. ... Look, if interest rates were raised and if the dollar went up more, we'd be doing no business. We're being killed by other countries devaluing their currencies.""CLIMATE

On the Paris accords:""Not a big fan. No. Not a big fan because other countries don't adhere to it and China doesn't adhere to it, and China's spewing into the atmosphere.""""Take a look at China with certain agreements where they have to do it within 30 years, and we have to do it almost immediately. You understand what I mean by that? The agreements are not fair agreements, number one. And I would say that I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum, I will be renegotiating those agreements. At a minimum. Ok? And at a maximum, I may do something else. But those agreements are one-sided agreements, and they're bad for the United States.""CHINA
On devaluation of the yuan:""China was in big trouble a year ago, now all of a sudden they cut their currency. They're taking more business out of the United States. ... China, whenever they have a problem, they devalue their currency. And they take more money out of the United States. Jobs, money, product.""Trade:""We cannot allow China and other countries to rip the soul out of our country. And they will understand that.""South China Sea:
""They're building a massive fortress in the South China Sea. They're not supposed to be doing that."" RUSSIA
On Russian presence in Ukraine:""I don't like it. I don't like it at all.""On Russian President Vladimir Putin:""Putin made very nice statements about me. Very strong, very nice statements. I think that's not a bad thing, that's a good thing. I think I'll have a good relationship with Russia, and I may not. And the fact that he's said good things about me doesn't mean that, you know, it's going to help him in a negotiation. It won't help him at all. And I'll know pretty soon in whether or not I'll have a good relationship with Russia. But wouldn't it be wonderful if we actually did have a good relationship with foreign countries as opposed to the way they're treating us now?""OBAMACARE
""Everyone knows. You know on Nov. 1, they're going to announce new - the numbers are going to come out for Obamacare. They are going to be catastrophic.""""It's beyond terrible healthcare. And Obamacare in '17 collapses. Don't forget, Obama pushed everything to '17 because he'll be out on the golf course. He'll be playing a nice round of golf someplace. Obamacare is part of the bubble problem. Now, we're going to terminate Obamacare, and we're going to replace it with something much better and much less expensive.""""Well, the lines are very important. The lines meaning the state borders. These people are protected from competition. And you go to these states and they have - it's almost like a monopoly in many of the states. You have to get rid of the lines. And they almost did it with Obamacare. It almost worked out. ""ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS
""I think that Medicaid should be sent to the states. Ok? Let them work it.""""It's very important that we protect Social Security and our Medicare without cuts. And I'm the only Republican that says that.""  BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON
""I think he was inappropriate. I think he was totally inappropriate. He's got plenty of problems, and I think he was inappropriate. So that's fine... I'm sure I'll have a good relationship with him.""  (Compiled by Alana Wise, Emily Stephenson and Caren Bohan; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Leslie Adler)"	['Trump', 'Obama']	['healthcare']
