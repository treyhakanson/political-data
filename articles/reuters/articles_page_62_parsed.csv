| WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. North Carolina will pay up to $5,000 for tips leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the weekend arson and graffiti attack at a local Republican Party headquarters, the state's governor said on Wednesday.Local, state and federal investigators are searching for suspects after they said a device commonly described as a Molotov cocktail was thrown through a window of the Orange County Republican Party headquarters in Hillsborough on Sunday.The glass bottle containing a flammable liquid ignited inside the strip-mall office, burning furniture and campaign signs before extinguishing. A swastika and the message ""Nazi Republicans leave town or else"" were spray-painted on a nearby building.""The firebombing of a local political headquarters was clearly an act of intimidation, and I'm going to do everything I can to find the individual or individuals who committed this assault on our democracy,"" Republican Governor Pat McCrory said in a statement announcing the reward money.
Investigators on Tuesday collected video from locations around the party office, according to a statement from Hillsborough, a town of about 6,400 people located 40 miles (65 km) from the state capital of Raleigh.Evidence from the crime scene is being analyzed at the FBI's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.
Mike Pence, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's running mate, called the incident an ""attack on the American political system"" during a visit to the scene Tuesday afternoon.Pence urged voters to help provide accountability at polling places when Americans turn out for the Nov. 8 election. 
However, Pence's remarks were well short of allegations by Trump in recent days that the race is being rigged against him at voting locations. Trump has provided no evidence for such assertions.North Carolina's State Board of Elections said in a statement later on Tuesday that officials had taken steps to protect the safety of voters, observers and poll workers during the voting process. Early voting begins in the state on Thursday. (Reporting by Colleen Jenkins; Editing by Frances Kerry)"	['Pence', 'McCrory', 'Trump']	[]

By Ayesha Rascoe
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to the White House on Tuesday, using the pomp of the formal state visit to highlight the link between the sluggish European economy and populist discontent in the continent.The spotlight comes at an opportune time for Renzi, who seeks a boost ahead of a constitutional referendum on Dec. 4 that could determine his political future.But even Renzi admitted that the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8 loomed larger.""I have a feeling, and I think that rightly so, our American friends are a little more interested in November 8 than in the Italian vote on constitutional reform, and so are we, might I add,"" Renzi said, drawing laughter from the Rose Garden press conference.Obama slammed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for ""whining"" that the U.S. election was ""rigged.""
He praised Renzi's proposed economic reforms and said he supported the attempt to modernize political institutions at the referendum because it would help accelerate economic changes.""I do believe that there is a connection between stagnation and some of the less constructive, populist impulses that have been rising up,"" Obama said, saying more jobs needed to be created for Europe's younger generation.
This is the second time this year Obama has weighed in on domestic political battles facing his European allies. In April, he visited London in support of former Prime Minister David Cameron's unsuccessful efforts to persuade Britain to vote to remain in the European Union. On Tuesday he said he expected Renzi to stay in office for some time.""As you fight for the cause of reform, know that we stand with you. I believe that Italy and the world will continue to benefit from your leadership for many years to come,"" Obama said during a toast at the state dinner. The leaders discussed the fight against Islamic State and the battle to take the Iraqi city of Mosul from the militant group, something Obama called a ""key milestone.""
Obama insisted the U.S.-led coalition had an extensive strategy to deal with what could be ""heart-breaking"" humanitarian consequences of the fight.The state dinner was the last scheduled for Obama before he leaves office in January. Notable guests included former racing driver Mario Andretti, designer Giorgio Armani, actor Roberto Benigni and celebrity chef Mario Batali, who helped plan and cook the meal.

By Ginger Gibson
| SHERMANS DALE, Penn.

SHERMANS DALE, Penn. While Donald Trump often rails against a ""rigged"" election on Twitter and at rallies nationwide, he goes a few steps further in Pennsylvania, a state crucial to the Republican's fading chances to win the White House.Here, he has made direct appeals since August to recruit voters as poll monitors on Election Day and has pointed specifically at Philadelphia as a city beset by voter fraud.Despite offering little evidence for any of his claims, his ""rigged"" election message is resonating with his followers in this traditional battleground state where Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has opened up a wide lead. But his calls for poll watchers on Nov. 8 is drawing a mix of confusion, concern and tepid support.In some cases, Trump's talk of fraud appears to have made some of his own followers more resigned to an election loss, even though independent studies show U.S. voting chicanery is exceptionally rare and certainly never on a national scale.Since Aug. 8, when Trump first urged supporters in the state to ""watch other polling places and make sure that it's 100-percent fine,"" civil rights groups have expressed fears that some supporters will take the idea too far by forming roaming, vigilante-style crowds intimidating voters.Trump supporter Mark Bowman, 53, says he isn't the type to attend a political rally or put campaign stickers on his car. And he isn't confident the election results will be correct.""I hate to say it, but I don't have a lot of faith,"" Bowman said. ""Voter fraud is rampant especially in the cities.""But, in a comment echoed by nearly two dozen Trump supporters in the state's reliably Republican central regions, he said he thinks nothing can be done to stop it and that becoming an amateur poll watcher is a step too far.""What authority do I have to confront someone?"" said the resident of Shermans Dale, a rural community of about 5,000 people. ""Your average citizen, you're going to end up in a confrontation with someone. You're going to end up in a bad situation.""There are official channels to monitor elections. Pennsylvania has a system that allows campaigns and political parties to designate official poll monitors, who are allowed into the polling places and can register official complaints if they think someone isn't a valid voter.
A form on the Trump campaign's website asks voters to help Trump ""stop crooked Hillary from rigging this election"" by becoming a volunteer Trump election observer.But in an example of the Trump campaign's near non-existent effort to organize field operations in key swing states, there is little evidence that the recruitment drive is translating into legions of officially sanctioned volunteers. Repeated inquiries from Reuters about efforts to staff polling places went unanswered by his campaign.The rules allow each candidate and the state parties to name monitors. With federal and local candidates both on the November ballot, there could be dozens of watchers in a single precinct. But those familiar with past elections say rarely does that happen. Instead, campaigns tend to focus on only the most fought over swing districts.Steve Reigh, 57, a realtor from Elliottsburg, Pennsylvania, agrees with Trump that the election is likely to be rigged, but says he also resigned to the outcome of the election, win or lose.""What are you going to do?"" he said.
'REALLY CLOSE VETTING'
Some Trump supporters are branching out on their own.Jack Posobiec, a navy veteran and special projects director at Citizens for Trump, a grassroots support group, says he hopes to mobilize 3,000 volunteers in several key swing states in the final days of the campaign, including busing supporters from Texas to Ohio.On Oct. 1, Trump told a largely white rally of supporters in Manheim in central Pennsylvania that they should go to neighborhoods other than their own on election day and ""watch"".
""You've got to get everybody you know and you got to watch your polling booths, because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania, certain areas,"" Trump said. ""So go and vote and then go and check out areas because a lot of bad things happen and we don't want to lose for that reason.""Dale Ho, a voting rights lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said on Twitter that Trump's calls for ""poll watchers"" were a ""recipe for intimidation and discrimination.""The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.     Married Trump supporters Gina, 75, and Larry Snyder, 77, of Newport agree the election could be rigged but doubt anything can be done about it, including poll-watching. Candace Lowe, 40, of Elliottsburg, Pennsylvania, said she is resigned to a Trump loss because the government ""can fudge stuff."" Turning out en-masse to watch polling centers on election night won't change that, she said.In Mechanicsburg, an overwhelmingly Republican borough of nearly 9,000 people, realtor Steve Johansen helped to set up a Trump field office in a skating rink, but he has no plans to monitor any polling places.""I have faith in the system,"" he said.

By Scott Malone

 (The 18 October 2016 story was refiled to correct the typo in the last sentence to read likely ""voters"")By Scott MaloneBOSTON Young Americans are so dissatisfied with their choices in this presidential election that nearly one in four told an opinion poll they would rather have a giant meteor destroy the Earth than see Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in the White House.The tongue-in-cheek question was intended to gauge young Americans' level of unhappiness about their choices in the Nov. 8 election, said Joshua Dyck, co-director of UMass Lowell's Center for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll alongside Odyssey, a social media platform.The choice alluded to the Twitter hashtag ""#GiantMeteor2016,"" a reference to an imaginary presidential candidate used to express frustration about this year's election choices.Some 53 percent of the 1,247 people aged 18 to 35 said they would prefer to see a meteor destroy the world than have Republican New York real estate developer Trump in the Oval Office, with some 34 percent preferring planetary annihilation to seeing the Democratic former Secretary of State win.
Some 39 percent said they would prefer that U.S. President Barack Obama declare himself president for life than hand over power to Clinton or Trump, with 26 percent saying the nation would do better to select its next leader in a random lottery.Some 23 percent, nearly one in four, preferred the giant meteor outcome to either Trump or Clinton.""Obviously we don't think that they're serious,"" Dyck said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ""The fact that one in four of our young people pick 'Giant Meteor' tells you something about the political disaffection that is being shown by American youth.""
That contrasts with the surge of participation by young voters that helped propel Obama into the White House for his first term in the 2008 election.When asked to choose between the actual candidates, Clinton easily led Trump with 54 percent of respondents to 21 percent in a two-way race.
In a four-way race also including Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton led with 48 percent support, to Trump's 20 percent, Johnson's 10 percent and Stein's 4 percent.In national polls surveying the whole population, Clinton is leading Trump, but not by nearly as much.The poll, conducted Oct. 10-13, intentionally included a large number of people seen as unlikely to vote, with just 680 described as likely voters. It had a margin of error of 3.2 percent. (Reporting by Scott Malone; Additional reporting by Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Frances Kerry)"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Emily Stephenson and Ayesha Rascoe
| WASHINGTON/GRAND JUNCTION, Colo.

WASHINGTON/GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. U.S. President Barack Obama lacerated Donald Trump on Tuesday over his repeated assertions that the Nov. 8 election is rigged against him, telling the Republican presidential candidate to ""stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.""With opinion polls showing him falling further back against his White House rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump has intensified his allegations, although numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is rare.At a campaign rally in Grand Junction, Colorado, Trump continued his attack, saying, ""The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the minds of the voters.""But he also used his speech to detail a new initiative if elected president: a constitutional amendment imposing term limits for members of Congress, six years for members of the House of Representatives, 12 years for members of the Senate.Obama was asked about Trump's voter fraud assertions on Tuesday at a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden following meetings with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.He responded with a blistering attack on the Republican candidate, noting that U.S. elections are run and monitored by local officials, who may well be appointed by Republican governors of states, and saying that cases of significant voter fraud were not to be found in American elections.Obama said there was ""no serious"" person who would suggest it was possible to rig American elections, adding, ""I'd invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.""Trump, speaking at the Grand Junction rally Tuesday evening, said that Obama should stop campaigning for ""Crooked Hillary"" and ""get out and work on jobs and work on the border.""Trump has raised the possibility for weeks of illegal activities that could tarnish the November election result, citing scant or questionable evidence, including the possibility of votes being cast by dead people, and he has urged his supporters to show up at polling locations on Election Day. He has sharpened his allegations even as Republican lawyers called his assertions unfounded.In a report titled ""The Truth About Voter Fraud,"" the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law cited voter fraud incident rates between 0.00004 percent and 0.0009 percent.
An August study by the Washington Post found 31 credible cases of impersonation fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014. Arizona State University studies in 2012 and 2016 found similarly low rates.In pointed remarks that were part civics lesson, Obama said that if Trump wins on Nov. 8, ""It would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech"" and ""it would be my job ... and escort him over to the Capitol, in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power"" at his swearing in.Trump's vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, took a softer tone than Trump during a campaign appearance in North Carolina, saying he was ""confident"" that the integrity of the election will be ensured.But Pence added that ""in recent years we've had instances, proven instances of voter fraud.""A number of Republican-led states, citing the need to prevent voter fraud, have passed laws with stricter identification requirements. But several have been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting.  
Trump trails Clinton by 7 points in national opinion polls, according to an average of polls compiled by RealClear Politics.CONTROVERSIES ECLIPSE POLICY DISCUSSION
Over the last few weeks, Trump, who has never previously run for office, has been embroiled in one controversy after another, eclipsing policy issues such as taxes, trade, the economy and national security that normally dominate the final push in presidential campaigns.With three weeks left until Election Day and early voting both by mail and in person already under way in many states, Trump has been grappling with the fallout from the release earlier this month of a 2005 videotape in which he was heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances.
He has said the remarks were just ""locker room"" talk and has strongly denied allegations by a string of women who have come forward since the video emerged to say Trump groped or touched them inappropriately, denouncing his accusers as liars and fame-seekers.The controversies will be the backdrop for the third and final of three presidential debates, to be held on Wednesday evening in Las Vegas.Trump was widely viewed as having been on the defensive during the first debate. He appeared to have improved his performance in the second debate, but according to polling, more voters saw Clinton as the victor.Wednesday's debate, like the first one, will be a traditional format with the moderator posing all the questions. Topics chosen by moderator Chris Wallace include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots, and fitness to be president. At Tuesday's press conference, Obama also criticized Trump for his ""continued flattery"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying ""it is out of step with"" the country.Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader and on Monday suggested that if he wins next month he might meet the Russian leader before he is even sworn in as president.

By Andy Sullivan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump supporters who plan to stake out polling sites on Election Day may find their own activities tracked closely by thousands of civil-rights activists who are mounting a nationwide effort to prevent problems at the polls.The Republican presidential candidate, who has repeatedly said that the election is rigged, has urged his backers to monitor voting sites for evidence of fraud, raising concerns that overzealous supporters could intimidate voters in the Nov. 8 election.They will not be the only ones out in force on Election Day. Civil rights groups say they plan to deploy thousands of volunteers on the ground in 27 states to ensure that voters will not be turned away by harassment, long lines or confusing rules. Teams of lawyers will file legal challenges if necessary.While previous elections have been marred by irregularities, Trump's rhetoric might lead to greater problems at the polls this year, activists say.""When Trump says, 'Go and watch certain areas of Philadelphia,' that's either intentionally reckless or it's a thinly veiled call to engage in racial profiling,"" said Dale Ho, the head of the American Civil Liberties Union's voting rights project. ""Whether people will heed it, I don't know.""Non-partisan groups have mounted ""election protection"" programs since the disputed Bush-Gore presidential election of 2000, but they faced a more daunting landscape this year even before Trump began warning of a ""rigged election."" 
The Supreme Court in 2013 weakened the U.S. government's ability to monitor voting activity in states with a history of racial discrimination, and dozens of Republican-led states have also passed laws that require voters to present photo identification or that restrict voting in other ways.As early voting gets underway in many states, voting-rights groups are publicizing a national hotline, 866-OUR-VOTE, and establishing lines of communication with the election officials who are tasked with resolving problems.""We haven't encountered a situation yet where we feel there's a need to call the police,"" said Marcia Johnson-Blanco, a co-director of the voting rights project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.This year, civil-rights groups are broadening their efforts beyond perpetual battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida to conservative states like Texas, where they plan to field 200 volunteers to monitor polling sites in Houston's Harris County.
""We've seen an uptick of folks saying they're going to be out patrolling in a way that we think is trying to be intimidating,"" said Zenen Jaimes Perez, communications director for the Texas Civil Rights Project. In New York, volunteers with Common Cause are expanding their monitoring programs to Muslim neighborhoods in New York City and some areas of the rural Hudson Valley.""What Trump's efforts have caused us here in New York to think about are places where there are concentrations of voters who, I hate to say, are easy targets - a magnet for people who are extreme,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York.
Democratic officials have stepped up their efforts as well. In Arizona, a traditionally Republican state that is competitive this year, Democrats plans to deploy a record 200 lawyers to make sure that everybody who is in line when polls close at 7 p.m. will get a chance to cast a ballot, said Spencer Scharff, the state party's voter protection director.But at the end of the day, poll monitors do not have the power to fix problems - they can only point them out to election officials.""States have the most important role. They're the ones who write these laws and they have to enforce these laws,"" said Danielle Davis, a staff attorney at the Advancement Project, a national civil-rights group.

NEW YORK Michael Moore, the left-wing filmmaker known for provocative documentaries that deliver a biting message, will release an anti-Donald Trump movie on Tuesday as Hollywood ramps up efforts to support Democratic White House contender Hillary Clinton in the final weeks of the 2016  election campaign.Moore, the Oscar-winning maker of documentaries about guns, the Iraq war and the U.S. health system, said on Twitter he would release ""Michael Moore in Trumpland"" in a free screening in Manhattan on Tuesday night at one movie theater, followed by commercial release in theaters in Los Angeles and New York on Wednesday.The film's release comes three weeks before the Nov. 8 election.The film is based on a one-man show, ""October Surprise,""  that Moore, a vocal critic of the Republican presidential contender, recently performed in Ohio and shows Moore ""dive right into hostile territory,"" according to a brief description.The film is being released as scores of celebrities rally round Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 election. More than 30, including Barbra Streisand, Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, Helen Mirren and Lena Dunham, staged a fundraising show on Broadway on Monday with tickets that sold for up $10,000 each and which was streamed live online.
Singer Jennifer Lopez and rocker Jon Bon Jovi will play separate Get Out The Vote gigs in Florida next week on behalf of Clinton's campaign.""Iron Man"" star Robert Downey Jr. and actors Neil Patrick Harris, Don Cheadle and Julianne Moore are among those asking Americans to ""save the day"" in a social media campaign aimed at getting people to vote against Republican businessman and former reality star Trump.
Clinton counts more, and more vocal, celebrity supporters than Trump, whose backers include Clint Eastwood, Jon Voight, country singer Loretta Lynn, Kirstie Alley and rapper Azealia Banks.But fans of celebrities are not necessarily fans of the candidate they support. Comedian Amy Schumer was booed at her stand-up show in Florida on Sunday after she attacked Trump and Republican voters, causing some 200 audience members to walk out, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

By Jon Herskovitz

A federal judge in Phoenix will hear arguments this week about resuming executions in Arizona, where a 2014 lethal injection that took nearly two hours raised questions about the state's death chamber protocols and the chemicals it uses to kill inmates.The case is the latest to challenge the drugs used in many states to execute prisoners, and may wind up putting the issue back for review by the U.S. Supreme Court.Arizona last year changed its lethal injection procedures following the troubled 2014 execution of Joseph Wood, but lawyers for seven Arizona death row inmates contend new guidelines and drugs will violate U.S. constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.One issue at the hearing set for Wednesday in U.S. district court will be the sedative midazolam, a valium-like drug critics contend does not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery and is therefore unsuitable for executions.The drug was used in Wood's execution along with a narcotic, hydromorphone. He was seen gasping for air during a nearly two-hour procedure where he received 15 rounds of drug injections. Lethal injections are supposed to result in death in a matter of minutes.
Under the new protocols, Arizona has listed one mix where it will use midazolam along with a drug that causes paralysis and another that stops the heart. A similar combination was used in Oklahoma, which had a troubled execution where an inmate was seen twisting on a death chamber gurney.The state said in court papers filed late on Monday it intends to revise its protocols and remove midazolam as an option, pledging not to use it even if it becomes available. It has three other options for lethal injection mixes that do not use the drug in the new protocols. Lawyers for the inmates contend the source of the drugs and their purity have been cloaked in secrecy, since European makers and U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc halted sales of drugs used in executions to prison systems in recent years. 
As a result, states have turned to lightly regulated compounding pharmacies that mix chemicals. The few states that have obtained lethal injection drugs since then have kept the names of their suppliers confidential.The lawyers want to put future executions on hold while the court reviews the protocols.""Officials in Arizona have fought tooth and nail to protect that secrecy, which, along with the use of an experimental drug combination, only serves to increase the risk of more problematic executions,"" said Dale Baich, an attorney for the inmates.
The state contends its protocols correct previous problems and it should be permitted to implement capital punishment.""Victims and state governments have rights and interests, too, including an important interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence and the state's interest to enforce its own laws,"" David Weinzweig argued on behalf of Arizona at a hearing this year.

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A Super PAC backing Republican Donald Trump is buying TV airtime in parts of Florida beginning this week for a commercial aimed at using first lady Michelle Obama's words against Hillary Clinton to erode the Democratic presidential candidate's support from women voters in the battleground state.The ad - which the Super PAC has already been running online - shows Michelle Obama in 2007 saying, ""If you can't run your own house, you can't run the White House,"" which could be taken as a reference to infidelity by Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton.The ad says Michelle Obama was talking about Hillary Clinton. However, at the time, then-candidate Barack Obama denied that his wife's words referred to his opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination.Representatives for Clinton and Michelle Obama declined to comment on the commercial.
The Super PAC, Make America Number 1, is hoping the ad, to be aired in the Orlando and Tampa areas, will resonate with women, a spokesman, Hogan Gidley, told Reuters on Tuesday.
Trump has struggled for support from women voters, many of whom have cited his temperament and past negative comments about women, including comedian Rosie O'Donnell and Fox News host Megyn Kelly.Eleven days ago, the New York businessman's campaign was shaken by the release of a tape showing Trump lewdly bragging about kissing and touching women without their permission. A series of women have since come forward with allegations about such behavior on his part, but he has denied the accusations.In Florida, a Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday found Clinton leading among likely women voters, with support from 54 percent of those surveyed, compared with 39 percent for Trump.
Michelle Obama has become one of the most powerful campaigners for Clinton. A speech the first lady gave in New Hampshire last week attacking Trump for the tape was praised by many as one of the most powerful speeches of the campaign.Make America Number 1 plans to spend $400,000 to put the ad on TV, spokesman Gidley said.In addition to the TV run, the commercial initially appeared as a Facebook ad. The group spent $72,000 targeting women in nine key battleground states - states where the vote could swing to either candidate.
Super PACs - or super political action committees - are permitted to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, but are prohibited by law from coordinating with a campaign. Make America Number 1 is one of a handful of such groups supporting Trump's White House bid.Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton have never directly addressed how they mended their relationship after the fierce 2008 primary campaign, in which Clinton lost to now-President Barack Obama. Both Obamas have campaigned aggressively for Clinton this year.During last week's second presidential debate, Clinton called Michelle Obama ""my friend.""
