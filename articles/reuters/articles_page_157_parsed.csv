CLEVELAND Police in Cleveland said that no gunshots had been fired on a transport vehicle near the site of the Republican National Convention on Tuesday following a Reuters report of gunshots.""There were no shots fired on any of our police transport vehicles right now near the Quicken Loans Arena,"" officials said in a statement released by the Joint Information Center overseeing security at the four-day event. ""We called all transport vehicles. They reported all clear.""
Earlier, a Reuters reporter standing near a police officer heard radio traffic stating that shots had been fired. Asked about the radio traffic, officers on the street said shots had been fired at a police transport about half a mile (0.8 km) from the arena.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Justice Department is changing its social media policy following a tweet mistakenly sent from the department's official account on Tuesday that called CNN ""the biggest troll of them all,"" a department official said.In a statement, the staff member in the public affairs office ""erroneously used the official Department of Justice Twitter handle to post a tweet that was intended for a personal account.""The statement did not identify the staff member, but said the person's access to the department's social media accounts had been revoked.
Going forward, the Justice Department's public affairs office will implement ""procedural changes"" around the use of social media accounts and provide additional training to its employees, the statement said. The tweet was sent early on Tuesday in response to a CNN story about the campaign of Donald Trump denying his wife Melania's speech at the Republican Nominating Convention was plagiarized from a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama.
""CNN is the biggest troll of them all lmao #petty,"" said the tweet, which was later deleted.The Justice Department said, ""the tweet does not represent the department's views and was inappropriate for the Department of Justice's official account.""
""The Justice Department takes this matter very seriously and will continue to take the appropriate steps to prevent it from happening in the future,"" said the statement. (Reporting by Julia Edwards, editing by G Crosse)"	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Ginger Gibson and Emily Stephenson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Donald Trump's wife Melania, in her first major political speech on Monday, portrayed her husband as a talented, compassionate and unrelenting leader who would unify rather than divide the country if elected to the White House.The Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model delivered the speech, part of which strongly resembled an address given by current First Lady Michelle Obama in 2008, to a cheering crowd at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland after a one-minute introduction from Trump. The presumptive Republican nominee made a dramatic entrance, silhouetted against a white background, to the accompaniment of Queen's 1977 rock anthem, ""We Are the Champions.""""I have been with Donald for 18 years and I have been aware of his love for this country since we first met,"" the aspiring first lady told the convention. ""He's tough when he has to be, but he's also kind and fair and caring.""""Donald wants prosperity for all Americans,"" she said, reading from a teleprompter, as people applauded. Her roughly 15-minute speech was a bid to soften the image of the New York businessman-turned-politician, who has been accused of bigotry and callousness for his calls to suspend Muslim immigration and deport millions of undocumented immigrants if elected. He has also been criticized for insults directed at women, political opponents and journalists.Part of the text referring to the values held by her family was strikingly similar to a section of Michelle Obama's speech to the Democratic convention in 2008. A Trump campaign official suggested the similarity was the result of an error by her speech writers.""In writing her beautiful speech, Melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,"" Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications advisor, said in a statement.Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has accused Trump, 70, of lacking the experience and temperament needed to work in the Oval Office. On Monday, Clinton, 68, used an address to a largely black audience to cast Trump as someone who would divide the country along racial, ethnic and religious lines.The convention's opening night featured a string of emotional speakers attacking Clinton's record as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, many arguing she had made Americans vulnerable to Islamist militancy.""I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son,"" said Pat Smith, the mother of an information management officer who was among the four Americans killed in an attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose administration has been credited with sharply reducing crime in the city during the 1990s and who oversaw the city's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed almost 3,000 people, gave a highly charged speech slamming Clinton and making the case for Trump.
""What I did for New York, Donald Trump will do for America!"" he said.REBELLION QUASHED
The convention erupted in chaos earlier when Trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted, in a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy.The turmoil threatened efforts by the Trump campaign to show the party had united behind him and distracted from the day's theme of ""Make America Safe Again"".The anti-Trump forces wanted to change the party's nominating rules to allow delegates to support alternative Republican candidates over Trump.
Party leaders held a voice vote, then declared the opponents lacked enough support, triggering pandemonium on the floor of the Cleveland basketball arena where Trump is due to be formally nominated this week for the Nov. 8 election.""This entire system is rigged to force the vote for Donald Trump,"" said Kendal Unruh, a delegate from Colorado.While delivering a jolt to the highly scripted program, the rebellion by the anti-Trump forces was quashed.But the furor, an embarrassment to Trump, put a spotlight on the deep divisions within the party that have emerged over his candidacy. A string of senior Republicans, worried about Trump's temperament and policies, were already avoiding the convention. KILLINGS OVERSHADOW CONVENTION

The gathering opened on Monday afternoon in the shadow of racially tinged killings of police officers and black men, and as protesters for and against Trump faced off in a plaza a few blocks from the convention, shouting slogans at each other, separated by a wall of police.The protests were largely peaceful, with law enforcement officers outnumbering demonstrators. Sunday's shooting of three policemen in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - a targeted attack that may have been retaliation for a series of police killings of black Americans - hung over the gathering.Trump criticized Obama early on Monday over the shootings, saying the Democratic president ""doesn't have a clue.""  The Baton Rouge shootings happened nearly two weeks after police fatally shot a black man there, and after another such death near St. Paul, Minnesota, both of which sparked nationwide protests. Five policemen were also killed in an ambush in Dallas this month.Trump has sought to position himself as the law-and-order candidate, in an echo of Republican Richard Nixon's successful presidential campaign of 1968.

By Gary Robertson
| RICHMOND, Virginia

RICHMOND, Virginia In a case that could have an impact on the November presidential election, the Virginia Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday over a Republican lawsuit challenging the blanket restoration of voting rights for 206,000 felons by Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe.If upheld, McAuliffe's order could help tip Virginia, a swing state where the vote is traditionally close in presidential elections, in favor of presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Lawyers for leaders in the Republican-controlled state legislature argued that McAuliffe exceeded his authority by restoring voting rights en masse, rather than on a case-by-case basis.""Never in Virginia's 240-year history has a governor exercised clemency power en masse,"" Charles Cooper, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the court.Cooper said history and the language of the state constitution clearly indicate that the restoration of a felon's rights must be done individually.But Stuart Raphael, Virginia's solicitor general, said nothing in the constitution restricts McAuliffe's authority to restore such rights across the board, even though no governor has done so in the past.
""If he has the power,"" Raphael said, ""he has the power.""The plaintiffs have asked the court to block McAuliffe's action, which also allows felons to serve on juries and hold public office.The court did not say on Tuesday when it may issue a decision in the case.
Almost 12,000 felons have registered to vote since McAuliffe's April 22 executive action, the state elections board said. Many of the convicts benefiting from the order are African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past.Democrat Barack Obama won Virginia in 2012 by about 150,000 votes and in 2008 by about 235,000 votes. Before the order, felons had to petition the governor individually to restore their voting rights. Virginia is one of four states whose constitutions permanently disenfranchise felons but allow the governor to restore voting rights, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan civil liberties group.
McAuliffe and other Democrats have said the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation is long overdue.The McAuliffe administration has refused to release the names of felons whose rights have been restored, a decision that drew criticism on Tuesday from Justice William Mims.""I cannot understand why a document of such importance has been shielded from litigants and the citizens of Virginia,"" he said.

By Steve Holland
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND As Republicans spilled into Cleveland on Monday to nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate, 2012 nominee Mitt Romney had an equally crucial task: Entertaining his grandchildren at his lakeside summer house in New Hampshire.U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican nominee who has endorsed Trump despite the latter's insults, attended an ice cream party with his wife, Cindy, and volunteers in his re-election campaign in Prescott, Arizona. He also took part in a veterans' gathering.""Working out of my office in Miami this week,"" former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the Republican presidential race in February, said in an email to Reuters. Bush had been the most active in attacking Trump on the campaign trail and has said he will not be voting for either Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8.His brother, former President George W. Bush and father, former President George H.W. Bush, were also not at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.These are some of the big names from a long list of prominent Republicans who are not venturing this week to Cleveland, where Trump is to be formally nominated on Thursday after a rough-and-tumble Republican primary fight that ripped wounds in the party that have yet to heal.Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters the convention is a ""healing time"" for the party and that Republicans will leave Cleveland united, but he criticized Ohio Governor John Kasich for not participating in an event in his own backyard.And Republicans have moved past the Bush era, he added.""They're part of the past. We're dealing with the future,"" he said.Kasich, a one-time rival of Trump's for the nomination, is making the rounds in Cleveland without endorsing Trump or speaking at the convention, a snub that Manafort told NBC's ""Today"" show is ""embarrassing the state"" of Ohio.Kasich adviser John Weaver shot back: ""Governor Kasich has made it clear why he hasn't endorsed Mr. Trump. They share a different world view in how to move the country forward.""
Some of the party's best diverse talent was missing from Cleveland or limiting their participation, including U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American, and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, an Indian-American.Many Republicans feel the party is in sore need of more Republicans like Rubio and Haley to appeal to a broader segment of the electorate.As Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gaveled the convention to order, Rubio was in Fort Myers, Florida, talking about how to tackle toxic algae polluting some of the state's waterways.Rubio, who lost to Trump in the primary battle and is running for re-election to the U.S. Senate, is to deliver a short videotaped message to the convention on Wednesday.Haley is to speak at a breakfast for the South Carolina delegation in Cleveland on Wednesday.
""Chairman Reince Priebus asked if Governor Haley would speak at the convention a couple weeks ago. Governor Haley was grateful for the invitation and looks forward to attending the convention, but, as we have said before, she has no plans to speak so she declined the opportunity,"" said her deputy chief of staff, Rob Godfrey.Romney, who has been a prominent voice among the anti-Trump forces, was in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, with 36 members of his family for their annual summer gathering, a spokeswoman said.CHENEY HITS TRAIL FOR DAUGHTER
Danny Diaz, who was campaign manager for Jeb Bush's presidential campaign, said the convention is missing a chance to show off some of its most talented Republican politicians.
""It speaks to where we are as a party at the moment more than anything else,"" he said. Former Vice President Dick Cheney was in Wyoming helping the congressional campaign of his daughter, Liz Cheney, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was talked about as a possible vice presidential running mate for Trump, was at home in Palo Alto, California.""Writing her book about democracy!"" said her chief of staff, Georgia Godfrey.Some of Trump's former rivals for the nomination are speaking in Cleveland, like U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.But some of the others felled by Trump were doing other things.U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, an eye doctor, was providing free eye care in Paducah, Kentucky. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham was in his home state of South Carolina for the week.Republican strategist Ryan Williams said the no-shows are  evidence of a party still deeply fractured, despite the calls for unity.""It shows that Trump has more work to do uniting the party and that he should continue to try to bring Republicans together even after the convention,"" Williams said.

By Scott Malone and Kim Palmer

Protesters for and against Trump faced off in a plaza a few blocks from the site of the Republican National Convention in downtown Cleveland on Monday, shouting slogans at each other but avoiding physical confrontation. Dozens of protesters were separated by a wall of police that looked equal in number. To one side of the police line at the foot of the Key Tower, Cleveland's tallest building, demonstrators shouted, ""Black Lives Matter."" From the other side came, ""You're a bunch of anarchists.""The exchanges marked the first emotionally charged demonstration at the 2016 Republican National Convention, where security forces are on alert for potentially disruptive conflicts. 
A combination of intense rhetoric by presumptive Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, recent police shootings of African- Americans in Baton Rouge and the Minneapolis area, and the killings of police in Dallas and Baton Rouge has raised tensions in the run-up to the convention. Alicia Street, 31, a Black Lives Matter activist from Ferguson, Missouri, told Reuters that police appeared to outnumber the protesters. ""We don't need all these police. This is just free speech,"" Street said shortly after a group of pro-Trump protesters left the area. ""They are going to make people afraid.""
Smaller demonstrations were held elsewhere in the downtown area. At least two protesters were seen carrying firearms. A  group of people identifying themselves as ""anti-gay Christians"" shouted at a rival group. One person carried a sign that read, ""Stop being a sinner and obey Jesus.""A speaker at an anti-Trump rally was arrested, but police said it was unrelated to the campaign.
One protest leader, Kait McIntyre, 27, said organizers from her group had sought permission for weeks to march outside the protest zone and only recently received it from the city. ""We wanted to get within sight and sound of the actual convention. We wanted our voices heard,"" she said.

By Lisa Richwine and Jessica Toonkel

U.S. TV networks, buoyed by strong demand from advertisers, are adding hours of coverage for this week's Republican National Convention compared to four years ago and planning to use social media to capture any  unexpected moments, executives said.Presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump may be new to politics. But the former star of his own reality show ""The Apprentice"" is a TV veteran who has promised to throw out the traditional convention script and provide a ""showbiz"" feel. Adding to the programing uncertainty are protests outside the convention hall in Cleveland and the possibility of dissent among delegates. ""It's safe to say that there are going to be surprises,"" said Sam Feist, Washington bureau chief for CNN, the cable news network owned by Time Warner Inc (TWX.N).     The stakes are high for broadcast and cable networks. Media analysts predict viewership for Trump's acceptance speech could surpass the record 38 million who watched Barack Obama address the Democratic convention in 2008.The potential for the unexpected at what is usually a meticulously staged event is driving strong advertiser demand, network executives said. CNN is pulling in between $40,000 and $100,000 for 30-second spots, a source familiar with the matter said. That is far above the typical cost of roughly $7,000 for a primetime ad on CNN.""We are 100 percent sold on primetime and about 95 percent sold on other slots,"" said Katrina Cukaj, executive vice president of portfolio sales and client partnerships at CNN parent Turner Broadcasting. She declined to comment on rates.Quick service restaurants and movie studios are running more spots than in past conventions, Cukaj said. ""The advertisers are a lot more diverse than I have ever seen,"" Cukaj said.
Broadcaster CBS (CBS.N) has seen strong ad sales for both conventions and has booked ads from the entertainment, packaged goods, travel and other industries, a network source said.In 2012, TV advertisers spent $5.8 million during both conventions, compared to $7.8 million in 2008, according to Kantar Media.Cable networks will provide coverage throughout each day and into the evening. Broadcast networks plan one hour of primetime coverage each of the four nights, plus online reports. In 2012, broadcasters aired an hour of only the last three nights.CNN will have hundreds of staff on the ground, more than any previous convention, Feist said. For the first time, the channel is anchoring every show from Cleveland through noon Friday.
The network will face plenty of competition. Fox News Channel, owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), began its coverage from Cleveland on Thursday, four days before the start, compared to Sunday in years past. It also added staff outside to cover protests. Trump's acceptance speech could attract more than 40 million viewers, said Kyle Roberts, president and chief executive of Smart Media Group, a media buyer that works with Republican candidates.Some brands will avoid the convention, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a media buyer.""It's just dangerous territory,"" Lowenthal said. ""It's very unpredictable content. I'm not sure that convention is going to enhance any brand's image. Why go there if you can go elsewhere?""
Media outlets say they will rely more heavily this year on social media and live streams.MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff said he expects to broadcast live most of the week. When not on television, he plans to be on Snapchat, Twitter and possibly Facebook Live.""This is going to be a different kind of convention,"" Soboroff said. ""It doesn't feel like business as usual because there is a lot of energy around that feels uncertain.""Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) ABC News will run up to six live streams simultaneously on its website and apps. Live coverage from CBS will appear on Twitter and the 24-hour CBSN mobile app.CBS is preparing for the possibility that Trump will appear in some role every night, another break from tradition, CBS News President David Rhodes said.

| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND The normally straight-laced Council on American-Islamic Relations tried humor to win over Republicans at their national convention on Monday, handing out packets of a satirical medicine called ""Islamophobin,"" a treatment for Islamophobia.Islamophobin, which is really just chewing gum in a clever package, promises to treat ""blind intolerance, unthinking bigotry, irrational fear of Muslims, (and) U.S. presidential election year scapegoating.""On the first day of the Republican convention to nominate Donald Trump for the Nov. 8 election, CAIR leaders urged the party not to push Muslims voters away.Trump has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. He opposes letting in refugees from the Syrian war, suggesting some may be militants posing as the downtrodden. He has made claims, unsupported to date, that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey openly cheered the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.In an interview broadcast Monday on CNN, Trump's wife Melania, due to speak at the convention later in the day, said of her husband: ""He's not racist, he's not anti-immigrant,"" and added, ""He wants to keep America safe.""CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad urged Republicans instead to court Muslims voters, saying they could be crucial in swing states that decide presidential elections.
""Too often over the course of this campaign, Republican presidential candidates have pandered to these inner-core Islamophobic leaders and their supporters with proposals like patrolling so-called Muslim neighborhoods, surveilling and shutting down mosques, and openly questioning whether a Muslim can serve as president,"" Awad said.As a prescription, Awad offered Islamophobin, a concept borrowed from Muslims in Sweden who created a similar product. CAIR sells a package of 12 sugar-free pieces for $1.99 on amazon.com. The package says: ""Take two and call a Muslim in the morning.""
But it comes with a warning.""Those who already believe in religious diversity, tolerance and mutual understanding should not use this product,"" the package says. ""Stop taking this product if you begin to develop warm feelings toward Muslims, immigrants or refugees.""
Nearby at a separate event, Christian demonstrators tried to eclipse a speech by Rose Hamid, a Muslim woman who was ejected from a Trump rally in South Carolina in January for her silent protest, by standing up wearing her head scarf and a T-shirt reading, ""Salam, I come in peace.""As Hamid spoke in favor of a peaceful coexistence at a platform in Public Square set aside for scheduled speeches, the small group behind her hoisted signs such as one saying, ""Muhammad is a liar, false-prophet, child-raping pervert.""When they tried to drown out Hamid with a bullhorn, she turned around to see them for the first time and remarked, ""Oh, they're lovely."" Police then removed them from the scene for demonstrating without a permit. (Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Howard Goller)"	['Trump']	[]

By Emily Stephenson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND The U.S. Republican Party on Monday approved a new policy platform that calls for reinstating the 1933 Glass-Steagall law requiring the separation of commercial and investment banking, an addition White House hopeful Donald Trump's campaign said it backed.Trump, who will formally accept the Republican presidential nomination in Cleveland this week, has vowed to dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that was passed under President Barack Obama following the 2007-2009 financial crisis.The language in the Republican platform offered further details on Trump's regulatory policies.Trump, who has sought to cast himself as a populist, has accused presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of being too close to Wall Street. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the legislation that repealed Glass-Steagall in 1999.
""The Obama-Clinton years have passed legislation that has been favorable to the big banks, which is why you see all the Wall Street money going to her,"" Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager, told reporters on Monday. ""They know she's their champion, and they are supporting her fully.""Some U.S. lawmakers in both parties support a modern Glass-Steagall to keep banks from becoming ""too big to fail,"" or so big their collapse would destabilize the financial system. The Democratic Party's 2016 platform, which has not been approved, calls for an updated version. Republicans universally despise Dodd-Frank, which their platform calls ""Democrats' legislative Godzilla."" But senior congressional Republicans back other alternatives.
""Glass-Steagall is dumb politics and dumb economics,"" said Tony Fratto, who worked in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. ""Returning to Glass-Steagall would be destructive and unworkable.""Clinton has said she would break up banks based on risk, not size, and frequently focuses on the risks posed by non-bank institutions.
Manafort listed the Glass-Steagall language among platform points he said ""reflect the issues that Mr. Trump has raised during the course of the campaign,"" including building a wall at the border with Mexico and calling for tougher trade deals.The platform also calls for control of national parks and other lands to be handed over to states, an effort by the party's conservative wing that got national attention during a 2014 standoff involving a Nevada cattle rancher.

NEW YORK Hillary Clinton promised on Monday to bring the ""full weight of the law"" against people who kill police officers if she becomes the next U.S. president after two recent episodes of gunmen slaying police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge.Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate ahead of a Nov. 8 election, made the promise in a speech in Cincinnati at the annual convention of the civil rights group the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.""Anyone who kills a police officer and anyone who helps must be held accountable,"" Clinton said. ""As president, I will bring the full weight of the law to bear to make sure those who kill police officers are brought to justice."" 
The penalties for killing a police officer are rightly more severe than those for killing a civilian because police are symbols of the rule of law, she said.Clinton's remarks come among heighten tensions between police forces and many black and Latino Americans, who have been rallying in protests across the country against a spate of police killings of black men, often unarmed, during encounters.
A black former soldier killed five police officers during one such protest in Dallas, Texas, on July 7. On Sunday, another black former U.S. Marine sergeant killed three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
