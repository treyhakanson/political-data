| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced his resignation on Thursday and said it ""felt pretty good"" to step down, ending a six-year tenure as the top U.S. spy that included a sometimes rocky relationship with Congress.Clapper, 75, a retired three-star U.S. Air Force general, will stay on until Democratic President Barack Obama leaves office in January. He has said for months he intended to leave when Obama departed and his replacement will be chosen by Republican President-elect Donald Trump.Clapper's term was marked by efforts to grapple with the re-emergence of an aggressive Russia, extremist attacks and growing cyber threats, as well as misleading a Senate committee about federal policy on collecting data on millions of Americans.His formal letter of resignation was issued in response to a White House request that all Obama administration political appointees submit resignations effective at noon on Jan. 20, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said.Clapper appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee hearing on Thursday and Representative Adam Schiff, the committee's top-ranking Democrat, lightheartedly said he hoped Clapper would stay in the job for four more years.""I submitted my letter of resignation last night, which felt pretty good,"" Clapper responded. ""I've got 64 days left.""
""LEAST UNTRUTHFUL"" 
In March 2013 Clapper found himself at the center of controversy after testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, telling Senator Ron Wyden that the U.S. government did ""not wittingly"" collect data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.His statement was disproved months later when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden exposed classified details of U.S. surveillance programs, including one that collected domestic U.S. phone call data in bulk.Clapper later said his response to the Senate was the ""least untruthful"" one he could provide.
On Thursday, Wyden said senior intelligence officials ""engaged in a deception spree regarding mass surveillance"" during Clapper's tenure.Others praised Clapper with Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, saying he had ""served our country honorably and with distinction in every capacity requested of him.""Before last week's presidential election Clapper's office issued a pre-election declaration accusing Russia of hacking U.S. political operatives and individuals as part of a scheme to ""interfere with the U.S. election process."" On Thursday he declined to comment on whether the Russians had shared any of the hacked information with unnamed Americans in the past 18 months.Clapper said he did not expect ""a significant change in Russian behavior"" when asked about Russia's alleged involvement in hacking. He added that Russia was planning to expand its presence at a naval base it maintains in Tartous, Syria.    
The leading candidates to replace Clapper in the Trump administration include Robert Cardillo, director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and a previous deputy director of national intelligence under Clapper, according to national security officials and people close to Trump's transition team.Retired Lieutenant General Ronald Burgess, who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency during Obama's first term, and former Republican Representative Pete Hoekstra, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, also may be in contention, sources said.The director of national intelligence oversees 17 U.S. intelligence agencies and serves as the president's principal intelligence adviser and briefer.As deputy director of national intelligence, Cardillo had served as Obama's ""alternate"" principal briefer, an official said.Clapper's service in military and intelligence spanned six decades, beginning in the 1960s in the U.S. Marine Corps followed by enlistment as a U.S. Air Force officer.

By David Lawder
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Two California housing advocacy groups have alleged that a bank formerly controlled by Steven Mnuchin, a top candidate to be President-elect Donald Trump's Treasury secretary, engaged in discriminatory practices against black and Latino communities. In a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the groups are seeking an investigation of claims that OneWest Bank violated the Fair Housing Act through ""redlining"" practices such as failing to locate bank branches in black and Latino communities and extending very few or no mortgage loans to borrowers of color.Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood film financier who is under consideration for the Treasury post, was not mentioned in the complaint, submitted on Wednesday by the California Reinvestment Coalition and Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California.But their allegations against a bank that was Southern California's largest during Mnuchin's ownership could fuel attacks from Senate Democrats if he is nominated to lead the Treasury, which is charged with safeguarding and regulating the U.S. financial system. 
Mnuchin could not immediately be reached for comment through his office at Dune Capital Management, the New York-based hedge fund that he leads. Earlier on Thursday, he was seen entering Trump Tower in New York, where Trump's transition team is meeting. The submission is the latest in the two housing groups' long-running campaign against OneWest, which also included complaining about its foreclosure practices and opposing its sale by a Mnuchin-led investor group to CIT Group Inc for $3.4 billion last year.The complaint to HUD alleges that OneWest originated just two mortgages to African American customers in the bank's assessment area. It also maintained and marketed bank-owned homes in predominantly white neighborhoods better than in neighborhoods of color.
CIT said in a statement: ""CIT is committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.""Kevin Stein, deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, insisted that the housing groups had long planned to file the complaint this week and the timing was not influenced by Mnuchin's emergence as a candidate for Treasury.
Mnuchin in 2009 led a group that acquired assets of failed mortgage lender IndyMac Bank for $1.55 billion from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, a deal that included a loss-sharing agreement on failed mortgages. Rebranded as OneWest, it subsequently grew to have 73 branches and $23 billion in assets at the time the CIT deal was announced in 2014.

BERLIN U.S. President Barack Obama called German Chancellor Angela Merkel an ""outstanding"" ally on Thursday and said she might get his support if he were a German citizen and she decided to run for a fourth term as leader of Europe's largest economy.Merkel, whom many expect to stand again, declined to show her hand, despite Obama's words of support. She said she would announce her decision at the appropriate moment, but ""that is not today"". ""Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner,"" Obama told reporters in Berlin when asked if he wanted her to run again, praising her integrity and their shared core values. Merkel told a joint news conference that it was difficult to say goodbye to Obama after their close partnership over the past eight years.""The parting is hard for me,"" she said, before adding that the U.S. constitution limited a president's time in office to a maximum of eight years and that she had to accept this.
Obama smiled at journalists and winked.He said Merkel faced ""big burdens"" if she chose to run again. ""I wish I could be there to lighten her load somewhat, but she is tough.""
Merkel, in power since 2005, is expected to announce on Sunday whether she will run for chancellor again in next year's federal election, the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland media group reported on Wednesday.Close Merkel aides have said she is moving toward another run, and one lawmaker in her conservative party this week told CNN that she would definitely put herself forward.
A poll conducted for German broadcaster ARD, released on Thursday, showed Merkel's conservatives would get 32 percent of the vote if the elections were held on Sunday, down one percentage point from a poll taken on Nov. 3.The center-left Social Democrats, junior partner in her  ""grand coalition,"" would get 23 percent, up one percentage point from the last poll, while the pro-environment Greens would get 13 percent, also up one point, the poll conducted by Infratest dimap showed. The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party dropped one percentage point to 12 percent.
