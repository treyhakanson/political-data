By Amy Tennery and Jonathan Allen
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA New York media mogul Michael Bloomberg assailed fellow billionaire Donald Trump on Wednesday, calling his U.S. presidential race a ""con"" and ripping into his history of bankruptcies and lawsuits.""Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's running his business? God help us,"" Bloomberg told the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to roaring applause. ""I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one.""Formerly a Republican and now an independent, Bloomberg was for the most part greeted warmly by the audience in the Wells Fargo Center arena where he threw his support behind the Democrats' presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.The owner of the Bloomberg media empire and a former New York City mayor, Bloomberg was an odd choice for a speaker at the Democratic conclave, where many party progressives have railed against the influence of billionaires in politics.""Let me thank all of you for welcoming an outsider here, to deliver what will be an unconventional convention speech,"" he said when he took the stage, eliciting cheers. ""I am not here as a member of any party. I am here for one reason: to explain why I believe it is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States.""
Bloomberg had considered running for the White House as an independent this year but dropped the idea in March, saying it could increase the chances Trump would win.Bloomberg has known Trump casually for years and twice appeared on Trump's reality TV show ""The Apprentice."" 
But since Trump entered the race for president in June 2015, Bloomberg has taken issue with him, lashing out at his policies and fiery rhetoric, especially his call to ban Muslims from entering the country and his promise to wall off the Mexican border and deport millions of undocumented foreigners.On Wednesday, he went a step further and favorably compared his own business record to Trump's. ""I've built a business, and I didn't start it with a million-dollar check from my father,"" Bloomberg said.Forbes lists Bloomberg, 74, as America's sixth wealthiest American, with a fortune amounting to $47.7 billion. 
Trump, 70, who often boasts about his extravagant wealth and success in the real estate business, is listed 113th with $4.5 billion, though that figure has been widely challenged.A Reuters review of Trump's federal filings showed he had cash and other liquid investments worth between $60 million and $180 million in May, far short of the amount he would need to self-fund his campaign.

By Steve Holland and Emily Stephenson
| MIAMI/WASHINGTON

MIAMI/WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ""missing"" emails from Hillary Clinton's time at the U.S. State Department, vexing intelligence experts and prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans.""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, told reporters.Trump made the remark at a testy news conference at his Doral golf resort in Florida that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the Philadelphia convention where Clinton on Thursday will accept the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election.The Clinton campaign shot back that Trump was posing a possible national security threat by encouraging a foreign power to conduct espionage in the United States. Some intelligence experts said the comments raised questions about Trump's judgment.A spokesman for Trump, Jason Miller, tried to tamp down the storm of protest, saying Trump did not urge Russia to hack Clinton's emails.Trump said on Twitter that if anyone had Clinton's emails, ""perhaps they should share them with the FBI!""The criticism of Trump's comments reverberated at the Democratic National Convention where speakers brought up the episode to try to intensify Democratic support for Clinton, who is running neck and neck with Trump in the polls.""Donald Trump today once again took Russia's side. He asked the Russians to interfere in American politics,"" longtime Clinton supporter and former CIA Director Leon Panetta said. ""Donald Trump ... is asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the United States of America to affect the election.""Another speaker, retired U.S. Rear Admiral John Hutson, said of Trump: ""This morning, he personally invited Russia to hack us. That's not law and order, that's criminal intent.""'TOTAL DEFLECTION'

Trump was referring in his remarks to a private email system Clinton kept while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She handed over thousands of emails in 2015 to U.S. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 emails she said were personal and not work-related.A Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of the issue found no basis for criminal charges, but FBI Director James Comey said this month there was evidence Clinton was ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified information.Trump dismissed suggestions that WikiLeaks' release of embarrassing Democratic Party emails last week was engineered by Russia to help nudge the U.S. election toward Trump, who has been called ""very talented"" by Russian President Vladimir Putin.""It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia,"" said Trump. ""I never met Putin. I don't know who Putin is."" The Democratic Party chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned on Sunday after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, for the presidential nomination.
Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the sensitive party emails in order to influence the presidential election.Throughout a day of campaigning, Trump suggested the culprit could be China or even, as he said in Scranton, Pennsylvania, ""a 400-pound person lying in bed.""'FOUR-LETTER WORDS'
Russia has brushed aside suggestions it was involved. ""I don't want to use four-letter words,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday.Trump has alarmed European allies and many U.S. national security experts with talk of forcing NATO nations to pay more for the U.S. security umbrella.
""By the way, if they don't pay, bye bye,"" he said in Toledo, Ohio, on Wednesday night.He has praised Putin in the past and said this week that if elected, he would seek an alliance with Moscow to take on Islamic State militants.But he sought to distance himself from Putin at his news conference, saying his closest interaction with Russia was selling a Florida home to a Russian for more than he paid for it.A U.S. State Department spokesman declined to comment on Trump's remarks on Wednesday.Trump's vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, took a different approach from the Republican nominee, saying he expected the FBI to get to the bottom of the matter.""If it is Russia, and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences,"" Pence said in a statement.During the news conference, which lasted more than an hour, Trump also called Barack Obama, a Democrat, the most ""ignorant"" president ever and said Vice President Joe Biden was not bright.Asked if he would recognize Crimea as Russian territory, Trump said he would be ""looking into that."" Crimea has long been part of Ukraine, but Russia annexed it in 2014 after pro-Russian separatists and special forces took over the region. The U.S. government considers it still part of Ukraine.

By Richard Valdmanis
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer is expanding his political agenda beyond climate change to embrace issues ranging from immigration to income inequality, which he expects will be critical to mustering votes for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November presidential election.Steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co-founded in order to devote himself full-time to environmental activism, said he hoped the broader agenda for his NextGen Climate organization would help undermine Republican nominee Donald Trump. He derided the New York real estate magnate's policies as ""dangerous"" and ""delusional."" Steyer has directed NextGen, his main advocacy arm, to delve into immigration, racial justice, wealth inequality and education instead of just environmentalism to better drive youth and minority voter turnout for the Nov. 8 election.""We're talking about a broader group of connected issues,  and we don't think any of them stand without the others,"" Steyer told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, explaining the shift.NextGen has already produced ads in California attacking Trump on immigration and his temperament. In one, a group of young people are filmed listening to Trump describe Mexicans as rapists and drug dealers and promising to wall off the border. In another, women look into the camera as Trump's voice is heard calling women fat, disgusting, and ugly.Steyer said he hoped the broader agenda for NextGen would help undermine Trump. ""I show him no respect,"" Steyer said.A Trump spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.NextGen's shift into new issues began a few months ago, Steyer said, and was inspired by his work on California's progressive Fair Shake commission, launched last year by a group of high-profile activists, academics and former politicians focused on wealth inequality in the state. 
""That was the genesis to some extent. It allowed us to look deeply at all the related issues,"" he said. NextGen has spent about $20 million so far on the U.S. election, and is likely to spend at least another $55 million by election day. MIXED RESULTS 

Steyer, who has earned a reputation as America's most influential environmental advocate, has had mixed results in his crusade on climate change, despite the money he has poured into mobilizing voters around the issue.Steyer has battled large-scale oil industry infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by the administration of President Barack Obama last year, and has sought to bolster climate-friendly politicians.In 2014, NextGen pumped around $75 million into efforts to support six climate-friendly Democratic candidates in mid-term elections, but only two of whom won their contests.In the current presidential contest, NextGen has fallen short of its aim make climate change a critical issue, eclipsed by voter rage over issues including immigration, the economy and national security. 
Reuters/Ipsos polling shows only about 25 percent of likely American voters will make a choice on the basis of a candidate's views on climate change, although most agree that the United States should act to combat it.Steyer endorsed Clinton last month after she clinched the Democratic nomination following a heated battle against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Clinton has said she would seek to advance renewable energy use, boost regulation and reduce U.S. consumption of oil and coal if elected. ""I can take them at their word that they are going to prioritize this,"" Steyer said.Trump has called climate change a hoax and has vowed to cut U.S. environmental regulation to expand U.S. drilling and coal mining, part of his bid to win over blue collar voters.Steyer called that position dangerous. ""It would be funny if it weren't so serious,"" he said. (Editing by Leslie Adler)"

WASHINGTON The top Democrats on the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees called on Wednesday for the White House to consider declassifying and releasing any intelligence community assessments of the hack into the Democratic National Committee email system.Experts have attributed the breach to Russian hackers.""Given the grave nature of this breach and the fact that it may ultimately be found to be a state-sponsored attempt to manipulate our presidential election, we believe a heightened measure of transparency is warranted,"" Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama.
Obama said in an interview broadcast by NBC News on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the leak of more than 19,000 DNC emails, which showed the committee had favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders for the party's presidential nomination.

By Tom Miles
| GENEVA

GENEVA The head of the World Trade Organization said on Wednesday he would not get into an argument with U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has described the global trade body as a ""disaster"" and threatened to quit it.But WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told a news conference he thought the arguments in favor of global trade needed to be put more forcefully.He said he had warned before Britain's referendum last month of the risks of leaving the European Union, saying it would require years of complex trade talks to complete, but ""sometimes people don't want to hear the arguments"". Appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on July 24, Trump said U.S. companies that move production to Mexico should be taxed and shrugged off suggestions this would break WTO rules. ""We're going to renegotiate or we're going to pull out,"" he said.
""We think trade is so obviously positive for every economy that it's like trying to argue with a friend that he needs to breathe,"" Azevedo said, adding: ""I don't think we do enough in making the case for trade.""Azevedo, who said earlier on Wednesday that he would seek a second four-year term as the head of the WTO, said he was impressed by the number of people who had responded to Trump by speaking up for trade, ""sometimes from unexpected quarters"".
He declined to comment on what would happen if the United States did withdraw from the 21-year-old trading club, which now boasts 163 members and governs the vast majority of global commerce through a system of mutually agreed rules.Under President Barack Obama, the WTO has been an important arena for the United States to defend its commercial interests against China, India and other major trading powers. 
A debate over trade also raged before Britain's June 23 referendum on leaving the European Union. Britain voted in favor of Brexit despite warnings from Azevedo and others about the risks, and the country now faces years of protracted and complex trade talks to try to extricate itself from the EU.Asked how to improve the quality of debate and help voters understand the issues, Azevedo said people sometimes make decisions ""on a basis of things that is completely foreign to the rationale of the issue that you are discussing. It has nothing to do with how trade helps or does not help"". (Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"

Pence's comments come as the FBI is investigating the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails. He spoke moments after Trump told reporters that it's ""far-fetched"" to think Russia hacked Democrats to help him.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ""will not be releasing"" his tax returns due to a federal audit, his campaign manager said on Wednesday, despite pressure to release them and provide a window into his finances before the Nov. 8 election.""Mr. Trump has said that his taxes are under audit, and he will not be releasing them,"" campaign manager Paul Manafort said in an interview with CBS on Wednesday. ""That issue will be dealt with when the audits are done.""His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has released tax returns and called on Trump to put out his. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called it ""disqualifying"" for a party's White House nominee not to make tax returns public. Trump has come under new pressure to release financial information and show whether he has any ties to Russia. That came after U.S. officials this week said there was evidence that Russia was involved in the recent release of sensitive Democratic Party emails, potentially to influence the U.S. election.
Trump has often praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""strong leader,"" but on Tuesday he said it was ""crazy"" for Democrats to suggest Russia would try to help his election bid.
""For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.Manafort said on CBS on Wednesday that Trump's hesitance to release his tax returns has nothing to do with Russia. Asked to clarify that Trump has no financial relationships with any Russian oligarchs, Manafort responded, ""That's what he said. ... That's obviously what our position is.""

By John Whitesides and Amanda Becker
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA When Hillary Clinton first ran for president in 2008 she was badly stung by a backhanded compliment from rival Barack Obama, who called her ""likable enough"" before going on to win the Democratic nomination and the White House.Eight years later, with her party's nomination to succeed Obama firmly in hand, the question of her likability, trustworthiness and honesty still hangs over her bid to become America's first woman president, this time in a Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump.The Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this week is, in part, an effort to reintroduce her to American voters, more than half of whom view her unfavorably, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.The criticisms have dogged her for years: She can appear stiff in front of crowds, struggling to show off the compassion her supporters say she shares in private and leaving some voters with the impression she is not giving straight answers to tough questions.Clinton recognizes the problem, aides say.""She knows that she has work to do to earn people's trust,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director. ""She also realizes there aren't some magic words you can say to earn that trust overnight.""Speaker after speaker at the convention took the stage on Monday and Tuesday to offer testimonials on her behalf, including her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who filled his prime-time speech on Tuesday with anecdotes and private moments shared by America's best-known political couple.Gay basketball player Jason Collins told of the support she offered when he went public with his homosexuality; a grandmother described how her daughter's battle with drug addiction inspired Clinton to address the drug crisis.A parade of others offered behind-the-scenes glimpses of the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, describing how she drove through a blizzard to attend a funeral, planned birthday parties and visited survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
Clinton's personal image, which has fluctuated during her 25 years in the public eye, slumped after a divisive Democratic primary, a lingering controversy over her use of a private email system while serving as the top U.S. diplomat, and repeated Republican attacks on ""crooked Hillary.""Reuters/Ipsos polling showed 55 percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of Clinton. Trump is even less popular, with 61 percent holding an unfavorable view.Many Americans think both candidates struggle with the truth. Some 59 percent of Americans believe she is not ""honest and truthful,"" while 53 percent think the same of Trump, according to the poll.Republican strategist John Feehery said it was too late to rehabilitate Clinton's image. ""You only get one decade to make a first impression,"" he said. 
Instead, a  better strategy would be to focus on tearing down Trump, given that his negatives surpass her own, Feehery added.Clinton's campaign appears to be trying just that, running an ad in which Trump can be seen in newsclips, as children watch, swearing, condemning Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers, and mocking a disabled journalist.POUNDING YOU
Clinton, 68, has been a lightning rod for conservative attacks for more than two decades and Republicans serenaded speakers at their convention in Cleveland last week with chants of ""Lock Her Up"" and signs touting ""Hillary for Prison."" 
For many Democrats who back Clinton, the poor polling numbers are the result of those relentless attacks - along with a strong dose of sexism toward a woman seeking power.""If you have somebody who is out there pounding you and pounding you and pounding you, eventually it's going to take a toll,"" Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said. ""I've said this and I've said it publicly: Hillary Clinton has to do A+ work to get a C-.""For Democrats, this week affords perhaps their best chance before the election to fortify her against inevitable attacks by Trump that could further dent her image. Praise came from invitees ranging from party superstars (First Lady Michelle Obama) to unknowns (former White House interns).   In one video broadcast to delegates, Clinton embraces and comforts an 11-year-old girl who fears her parents will be deported. In another, shown before the appearance of the Mothers of the Movement - mothers who lost children to gun violence or in police-involved incidents - she encourages them in a private meeting to band together and speak out.""A 30-minute meeting turned into two hours because she listened to us. Nobody else listened to us,"" said Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old whose fatal shooting death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012 launched a series of protests around the country.Actress Eva Longoria said it was time for Democrats to rally to Clinton's defense.""She's had a 25-year smear campaign run against her. It's understandable Americans are confused about what is true and what is not,"" she told a women's delegate caucus on Tuesday.

The Kremlin on Tuesday said unidentified individuals in the United States were trying to cynically exploit fear of Russia for electoral purposes.

By Amy Tennery and Emily Stephenson
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA Former President Bill Clinton portrayed his wife Hillary on Tuesday as a dynamic force for change and a longtime fighter for social justice as he made a case for her historic 2016 bid for the White House.     The ex-president told the Democratic Party convention in Philadelphia that Hillary Clinton was ""a natural leader"" with an in-built sense of responsibility.""Hillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face, and she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known,"" he said.Earlier in the day, Hillary Clinton secured the Democratic Party's nomination for the Nov. 8 election, coming back from a stinging 2008 defeat in her first White House run and surviving a bitter primary fight to become the first woman to head the ticket of a major party in U.S. history.Bill Clinton told the convention in a keynote speech that Hillary had been an activist for social justice since the couple's early days as law students together. He told how she gave legal aid services to poor people and went undercover to expose a segregationist school in Alabama in the 1970s.  
After a tough battle with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the state-by-state nominating contests, Clinton is now the party's standard-bearer against Republican nominee Donald Trump. Bill Clinton said Republicans led by Trump had made Hillary out to be ""a cartoon"" but the real thing was nothing like the their portrayal of her.     ""They're running against a cartoon. Cartoons are two-dimensional, they're easy to absorb. Life in the real world is complicated and real change is hard, and a lot of people even think it's boring,"" he said.
Then speaking directly to the crowd, he said to cheers and applause: ""Good for you because earlier today you nominated the real one.""    President from 1993 to 2001, Bill Clinton, 69, left office with high approval ratings and is known as one of the most powerful political orators in the country.His speech offered an unusual twist to the warm spousal endorsement of a presidential candidate traditionally given in party conventions by a wife, not a man - let alone a former president of the United States.
Hillary Clinton's nomination was a milestone in America's 240-year-old history. U.S. women got the right to vote in 1920 after ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Supporters of Hillary Clinton say her Washington credentials show she has the experience needed for the White House during troubled times as the United States tries to speed up its economic recovery and faces security challenges abroad.Detractors view her as too cozy with the establishment and say she carries political baggage dating back to the start of Bill Clinton's first White House term in the 1990s.
