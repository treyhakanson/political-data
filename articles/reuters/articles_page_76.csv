By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Two groups that support far-reaching curbs on legal immigration to the United States and ideological screening of would-be immigrants to test their beliefs say Donald Trump's presidential campaign has consulted them on his immigration policy.NumbersUSA and the Center for Immigration Studies, which for years have denied accusations they harbor radical views on immigration, told Reuters they had met or had telephone calls with either Trump or senior members of his campaign over the past year.Trump's campaign declined to confirm the meetings.Trump, the Republican nominee, has won over millions of supporters with his calls for a wall on the Mexican border and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. But the calls have also drawn an outcry from immigrant rights groups and condemnation from abroad. While Trump's immigration proposals push the Republican Party sharply to the right, NumbersUSA and CIS also want to slash legal immigration, going beyond the New York businessman's call to keep it ""within historical norms.""NumbersUSA says on its website that immigrants are the main driver of population growth, take jobs that should go to U.S. workers, and fuel urban sprawl that threatens farmland and wildlife habitats. ""The aim should be to halt all immigration possible,"" NumbersUSA head Roy Beck wrote in a blog in March.NumbersUSA wants to cut legal immigration to 500,000 a year immediately, said Chris Chmielenski, the group's director of content and activism.About a million immigrants obtain legal permanent residence status in the United States every year, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Around 11 million undocumented immigrants were living in the United States in 2014, down from a peak of 12 million in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center.The head of CIS, Mark Krikorian, has argued against legal immigration extensively. Last year he wrote in the National Review that mass legal immigration would end U.S. conservatism, because immigrants tend to have more liberal views on issues like gun rights.  
CONVERGENCE OF IDEAS      

Beck told Reuters he had met with Trump in New York and had also spoken with people ""at the top"" of his campaign repeatedly since last autumn, when NumbersUSA accepted invitations to meet several Republican presidential hopefuls.Much of the contact was by phone and email. Beck would not provide details of what was discussed or say who took part in the discussions.In early August, NumbersUSA shared a 10-point immigration plan with the Trump campaign. Of the 10 points, six were echoed by Trump in a major immigration speech on Aug. 31.Those points included calls for the immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal records and the mandatory use of the ""E-verify"" system to check a job applicant's legal status. The Trump campaign declined to comment on the apparent overlap. The policy was written with input from Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents.Beck said the overlap showed the ""convergence"" of ideas between his group and the campaign but he acknowledged he had ""no indication that they sat down and looked at our 10 steps and said let's take six of them.""    
Based in Arlington, Virginia, NumbersUSA describes itself as the ""the nation's largest grassroots immigration-reduction organization with more than 5 million participants."" It is credited with helping block immigration bills in 2007 and 2013 that aimed to make it easier for undocumented immigrants to become citizens. 
""EXTREME VETTING""
Krikorian, of CIS, whose slogan is ""Low-immigration, pro-immigrant,"" said his group had also received requests for research and studies from the Trump campaign for months. In an Aug. 15 speech, Trump outlined his plan for ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants, calling for an ideological test to gauge their views on things like religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights to ensure the country only admits people ""who share our values and respect our people."" CIS was an early proponent of ideological screening - widely criticized as discriminatory and a violation of freedom of thought - to protect U.S. culture and national security following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but it was unclear if Trump consulted CIS on the idea.
The Department of Homeland Security already requires people seeking legal status in the United States to show they adhere to the principles of the Constitution.Krikorian took part in a roundtable of national security advisers at Trump's New York headquarters in August, after which he said he was asked by Trump's campaign to be a ""surrogate."" A surrogate can act on behalf of a campaign, by speaking at rallies and other events.Krikorian said he turned down the Trump campaign's request. Hate watchdog groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have accused NumbersUSA and CIS of attempting to use mainstream arguments to sell proposals aligned with white nationalism.""These are the organizations that are the leading edge of the nativist movement in this country,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of immigrants' rights group America's Voice. Both organizations reject the claims.""We're absolutely opposed to nativism,"" said Beck, adding that NumbersUSA's recommendations come from a desire to protect American workers. His group stresses that it blames bad immigration policy and not immigrants themselves.Krikorian said CIS wants ""an ethnically neutral policy that lets in fewer people in the future and does a better job of welcoming those people we do legally admit to our country.""(Adds dropped word, ""plan,"" in paragraph 14.)

By Douglas Busvine
| NEW DELHI

NEW DELHI Donald Trump sympathizes with India in its recent escalation of tensions with Pakistan and supports skilled immigration, an adviser said on Friday, portraying the U.S. presidential hopeful as a friend of India and Indian Americans.Trump, a real estate billionaire, has earned a reputation of hostility toward minorities with proposals such as ""extreme vetting"" of potential immigrants and building a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration. The Republican nominee has proposed a ban on immigration from countries where vetting would be difficult, such as nations faced with Islamic militancy.Some Indian officials worry the United States could become more isolationist under Trump, leaving allies like New Delhi without the support it has enjoyed under President Barack Obama against China's growing regional influence.     Shalabh Kumar, a Chicago-based businessman of Indian origin tasked by the Trump campaign with reaching out to Asian-Americans, said India and the Indian-American community had nothing to fear from a Trump presidency.   
There may be only 4 million Indian Americans but the potential to develop the relationship with their country of origin, a land of 1.3 billion, was huge, Kumar told a news conference at a hotel in New Delhi that drew a curious audience of about 30 journalists and several TV cameras.""Our overarching goal is for the 21st century to be an Indian-American century - instead of a Sino-American century,"" said Kumar, wearing a dark suit and gold-rimmed pilot glasses, his white hair swept back.    ""Mr Trump is a businessman - he has no bone in his body, not a drop of blood that is anti-immigrant,"" Kumar said. ""He wants to have legal, skills-based immigration.""
The Punjabi-born businessman, who emigrated in 1969 and was converted to the Republican cause by Ronald Reagan, also said Trump's determination to keep Islamic militants out of the United States played well with his community. Around four in five Indians profess the Hindu faith, while 14 percent are Muslims. Hindu nationalist groups, including many Indian Americans, have applauded Trump's anti-Muslim comments.
""There is a war declared on the free world by Islamic terrorists,"" Kumar said. ""We are very happy that India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a very firm stand.""Kumar said the Republican Hindu Coalition, a group that he set up last year, would hold a cultural event and charity fundraiser in New Jersey on Oct. 15 at which Trump will deliver a keynote address.Half of the gate receipts would go to victims of terrorism, in particular Hindu refugees from Kashmir and Bangladesh.

By Chris Kaufman
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said as many as 70 percent of federal agency regulations could be eliminated if he is elected in November, just hours after an adviser said the candidate would seek to cut 10 percent.    Trump, who blamed regulations for stifling business, told a crowd at a town hall event in New Hampshire on Thursday night that regulations for the environment and safety would remain. ""We are cutting the regulation at a tremendous clip. I would say 70 percent of regulations can go,"" Trump said. ""It's just stopping businesses from growing.""Earlier in the day during an online discussion with Reuters, Trump campaign adviser Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street financier who has raised campaign money for Trump, said Trump would eliminate 10 percent of regulations.""We need regulation but immediately every agency will be asked to rate the importance of their regulations and we will push to remove 10 percent of the least important,"" he said.    Another Trump campaign adviser reached by Reuters confirmed the 10 percent regulatory cut was part of their economic plan. Jeff Holmstead, a former assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under George W. Bush's presidency, said the goal was hard to comprehend.""You could reduce the number of regulations by 10 percent without accomplishing very much,"" he said.
He added it would make more sense for Trump to try to reduce the cost of regulatory compliance by 10 percent.""I think it probably would be possible for a new administration to make changes that would reduce the cost of these programs by at least 10 percent while still maintaining essentially the same level of environmental protection,"" he said.Officials at the EPA and the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment, citing internal policies.Scaramucci also said that Trump, a fierce critic of the Federal Reserve, would probably get along well with Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Trump has repeatedly accused the Fed of serving as a political arm of the Obama White House. He says Yellen has put off raising interest rates in order to let President Barack Obama end his term in January without the economic shock that a rise in interest rates might entail.
Scaramucci, a founder of SkyBridge Capital, joined Reuters Global Markets Forum to discuss his views of the campaign. He said Trump would strive for a better balance in federal regulations.    Scaramucci was not as dismissive of Yellen as Trump is, saying he believes the New York property developer would warm to her eventually.""There are many well-qualified candidates but I think Mr. Trump has to spend some time with chairwoman Yellen. I think knowing what I know about his personality he will like her,"" he said.Trump would seek to streamline regulations as a way to generate economic growth and help the flow of capital, the adviser said. Trump has specifically singled out the energy industry as an area that he would look at for reducing regulations.
""Wall Street is not the devil,"" said Scaramucci. ""In fact we are at our best when (there) is harmony between Main Street and Wall Street and we hope to restore that.""Scaramucci singled out several areas that Trump would look to for reforms:--Labor Department rules expanding the fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products would likely be stopped.--Legislation similar to the former Glass-Steagall Act that limited the banking industry would be on the table for review.-- The Dodd-Frank banking reforms that emerged from the Great Recession of 2008-09 will be reviewed and ""the worst anti-business parts of it will be gutted.""-- The Volcker rule will be adjusted. Named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, it is part of the sweeping 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. It aims to reduce risk-taking by preventing banks from using their own capital to make speculative bets.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The National Rifle Association is on track for record spending this year on U.S. political campaigns, including Missouri's U.S. Senate race where a gun-owning Democrat is waging a tough fight against an incumbent Republican backed by the gun rights group.Democrat Jason Kander, an Afghanistan war veteran, is running just 2.5 percentage points behind Republican U.S. Senator Roy Blunt in opinion polls in Missouri, despite the NRA's expenditure of $1.8 million so far trying to protect Blunt as well as the Republicans' U.S. Senate majority.Gun violence has transfixed the United States in 2016, from a massacre at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub to a rash of police shootings, fueling demands by some Democrats and activists for tighter gun laws.Those efforts have been thwarted, as in years past, by the NRA and its supporters, who say such measures would infringe on the right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Congress has not approved major gun-control legislation since the 1990s.An Aug. 19 Reuters/Ipsos poll found 41.8 percent of respondents agreed there should be strong restrictions on firearms and 22.4 percent supported moderate regulations.     Per-capita firearm ownership in the United States far exceeds any other country, according to government estimates.  In the Missouri race and other Senate contests in states such as North Carolina, Nevada, Florida and New Hampshire, the gun-control battle gripping Washington is playing out on the campaign trail.The NRA has spent $23.4 million in this election cycle, with a month to go before voting on Nov. 8, compared with a previous high of $27 million in the entire 2014 campaign cycle, according to federal data gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics.The NRA did not respond to requests for comment.In addition to Senate Republicans, the lobbying group is also backing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.Blunt, 66, is a two-decade veteran of Congress. He accuses Kander, 35, of being soft on gun ownership rights.
Blunt has an ""A"" rating from the NRA. Kander has an ""F,"" which the NRA says he earned by backing expanded background checks on gun buyers and legislation that failed this year in Congress to bar people on ""terrorism watch lists"" from buying guns.""The difference between Senator Blunt and myself is that I want to stop criminals and suspected terrorists from having the same access to guns as the rest of us, which is why I support background checks,"" Kander said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday.'RESET THE DEBATE'
Kander, Missouri's secretary of state, counterpunched against Blunt last month with a 30-second TV commercial that has had more than 1 million views on youtube.com. 
In the ad, the former U.S. Army captain assembles a military-style rifle while blindfolded. He says he has supported gun ownership rights, but adds: ""I also believe in background checks so that terrorists can't get their hands on one of these.""A fierce debate in Washington over such background checks in June led to a 25-hour sit-in by Democrats on the floor of the House of Representatives. ""The reaction to that ad has reset the debate"" in the Missouri Senate race, said Tim Daly, managing director of guns and crime policy for the liberal Center For American Progress, a think tank in Washington.Kander's polling numbers were already rising when the Sept. 15 ad was first broadcast. But Daly said Kander planted fresh doubts over the NRA position on background checks.Blunt and his campaign spokesmen were not available for comment.
 The NRA is Blunt's No. 2 financial backer in the Missouri race, surpassed only by a group closely associated with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that backs Republicans.SENATE MAJORITY AT STAKE
Like the Blunt-Kander battle, other key 2016 Senate races feature intense debate over guns as Republicans work to defend their control of the Senate.In North Carolina, the NRA has pumped in $2.8 million to support threatened incumbent Republican Senator Richard Burr.The first televised debate in New Hampshire this week between Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte and her Democratic challenger, Governor Maggie Hassan, began with a moderator asking how they could reduce gun violence without infringing on gun rights.Ayotte has come under attack from Americans for Responsible Solutions for her opposition to tough gun background checks. The group works to reduce U.S. gun violence in the United States. (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Peter Cooney)"

| HAVANA

HAVANA Jill Biden, wife of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, arrived in Cuba on Thursday, the latest sign of the rapprochement between the Cold War foes that saw President Barack Obama and his family visit in March.Biden was greeted at Havana's international airport by Josefina Vidal, who is leading negotiations with the United States as head of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry.Biden plans to watch a match between the U.S. and Cuban soccer teams on Friday in Havana, go on social media at one of Cuba's new WiFi hot spots and visit a teachers college, among other activities, according to U.S. diplomatic sources in Havana. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues Cathy Russell and Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Evan Ryan are accompanying Biden, who will also travel to central Camaguey province before heading to the Dominican Republic on Sunday.A White House statement said Biden, herself an educator, was scheduled to meet with ""government officials and engage with a diverse range of Cubans on topics related to culture, education, and health.""    
The Obamas' visit highlighted the warming trend in bilateral relations announced by both countries in December 2014 after 18 months of secret talks and more than a half-century's estrangement.Some U.S. lawmakers strongly oppose the move, arguing that Communist-ruled Cuba must do far more to improve human rights before it can deal normally with the United States.
Agreements have been reached in areas such as law enforcement, the environment, resumption of postal service and commercial flights, while talks on such thorny issues as  fugitives and reparations continue.The decades-long U.S. trade embargo on Cuba remains in place and can only be lifted by Congress, although Obama has used his executive authority to chip away at it.Both sides have said they want to strengthen their economic relationship, but the United States has complained the Cubans have been slow to take advantage of openings carved out by Obama, for example, trade with the private sector, while Cuba says U.S. sanctions make most trade and investment impossible.
U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman is also in Havana where he is scheduled to meet on Friday with Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and Foreign Trade and Investment Minister Rodrigo Malmierca. (Reporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump has backed away from a total ban on Muslims entering the United States, vice presidential running mate Mike Pence said on Thursday, a shift from one of the Republican presidential candidate's most provocative proposals.Trump's call last December for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" followed an Islamic State-inspired mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by a husband-and-wife team.Critics have called the proposed ban discriminatory and probably a violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom of religion, and Democrats have used Trump's policy to declare him a bigot.
In recent months, Trump has said he would suspend immigration from countries where Islamist militants are active but has left vague as to whether this amounted to a narrowing or an expansion of his original policy position.Pence said in a round of television interviews that if elected on Nov. 8, Trump would suspend immigration from ""countries that have been compromised by terrorism.""Asked if this amounted to a ban on Muslims, Pence said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" show: ""Of course not.""
On CNN's ""New Day,"" Pence was asked why, given that he had been against the ban before becoming Trump's running mate, he was not opposing it now.""
""Well, because it's not Donald Trump's position now,"" replied Pence. (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Alistair Bell)"

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy, preserve the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.	Here are the proposals the former secretary of state has made as part of her argument that she is best qualified to occupy the Oval Office. (For a Factbox on Republican opponent Donald Trump's proposals, please see)ECONOMIC POLICY
Clinton has said the rich, not the middle class, would see their taxes go up.She supports billionaire investor Warren Buffett's eponymous tax proposal calling for those making more than $1 million a year to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Clinton has also called for an additional 4 percent tax on those making more than $5 million annually.Clinton has pledged to raise the estate tax levied on property transferred from a deceased person to their heirs. She also supports a tiered inheritance tax structure, with a top rate of 65 percent on the wealthiest estates of more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple.Clinton has pledged to unveil a plan to rebuild U.S. infrastructure during her first 100 days, saying this would create new jobs.She would use some of the revenue generated from her tax plan to pay for making community colleges tuition-free and ensuring students can graduate from public colleges and universities without incurring debt.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that independently scored Clinton's proposals in their totality, estimated her policies would cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade and would be offset by $1.6 trillion, mostly generated by taxing high earners. The group said the remaining $200 billion could be covered by $275 billion in corporate tax revenue the Clinton campaign has called for but not yet spelled out in sufficient detail for them to credit as an offset at this time.IMMIGRATION
Clinton has promised to propose broad legislation within her first 100 days in office to overhaul the immigration system and establish a process for undocumented workers to become citizens.Clinton has said she will defend executive actions taken by Democratic President Barack Obama to defer deportations of children brought illegally to the United States and the parents of children who are citizens or legal residents. She has said if Congress does not pass comprehensive immigration reform, she will similarly use executive action to defer deportations in ""sympathetic cases.""
A federal court has ruled that Obama did not have the authority to issue his executive orders on immigration, known as DACA and DAPA. The U.S. Supreme Court, currently short one member, split 4-to-4 on whether to hear the administration's appeal, leaving the lower court's ruling in place for the time being.WALL STREET REGULATION
Clinton has promised to preserve the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, and to pursue further measures to toughen Wall Street regulations.She has proposed a fee for large financial institutions based on their size and the level of risk they pose. She would also give regulators additional authority to force institutions that pose high risks to break apart or reorganize.Clinton has also urged strengthening the Volcker Rule, which restricts proprietary trading by commercial banks. She has called for a new tax on high-frequency trading and for stricter oversight of hedge funds, private equity firms and other players in the so-called shadow-banking system.She has promised stiffer policies on people who commit financial crimes, including an extension of the statute of limitations on such crimes and a requirement for bank executives to return bonuses if their institutions suffer major losses.
Changes to Dodd-Frank have stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress, and it is unclear whether Clinton could get congressional backing to strengthen the law, unless Democrats win control of one or both chambers in the Nov. 8 election.ISLAMIC STATE 
Clinton has pledged to defeat Islamic State and has said the first step to fighting the militant group is to eliminate its strongholds in Iraq and Syria.In a departure from the Obama administration, she supports the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria and has called for an intensified air campaign by the U.S.-led coalition. Clinton has said she would send additional American special forces to help Arab and Kurdish forces already on the ground. She opposes sending additional U.S. ground troops to the region.Clinton has said the United States and European allies must share intelligence more effectively in order to thwart potential attacks.She has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with the government to track militant recruitment tactics on the internet. 
RUSSIA
Current and former Obama administration officials have told Reuters they believe Clinton would  take a harder line on Russia than either Obama or Trump.Clinton has said she believes Russian hackers are behind the breach of Democratic Party systems in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election.Clinton has said Russia should play a role in fighting Islamic State in Syria, and her foreign policy adviser has said she would consider arming government forces in Ukraine, one of Russia's neighbors, in a move to combat Russian ""aggression in Europe."" Russia has backed ethnic Russian separatists in Ukraine.CHINA
Clinton was a key player in Obama's ""pivot"" to Asia when she served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.Clinton has said she will ""aggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences"" against China when it commits trade abuses.She opposes granting China market-economy status, which China will be seeking when a World Trade Organization clause expires in December, and has said she would make sure a newly installed trade prosecutor would ensure that China is playing by the rules.Clinton has said she would treat cyber attacks from countries such as Russia and China ""like any other attack"" and that the United States ""will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.""
