WASHINGTON Emails between U.S. diplomats in Islamabad and State Department officials in Washington about whether to challenge specific U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan are at the center of a criminal probe involving Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.The 2011 and 2012 emails were sent via the ""low side"" -government slang for a computer system for unclassified matters - as part of a secret arrangement that gave the State Department more of a voice in whether a CIA drone strike went ahead, according to congressional and law enforcement officials briefed on the FBI probe, the Journal said.Some of the emails were then forwarded by Clinton's aides to her personal email account, which routed them to a server she kept at her home in suburban New York when she was secretary of state, the officials said, according to the newspaper.Investigators have raised concerns that Clinton's personal server was less secure than State Department systems, and a recent report by the State Department inspector general found that Clinton had broken government rules by using a private email server without approval, undermining Clinton's earlier defenses of her emails.   The still-secret emails are a key part of the FBI investigation that has long dogged Clinton's presidential campaign, the officials told the Journal.
Clinton this week clinched the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election and was endorsed by President Barack Obama on Thursday.The White House rebuffed questions by reporters on Thursday on whether Obama's endorsement might be seen as unduly influencing a criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department involving Clinton.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama ""has reiterated his commitment to this principle that any criminal investigation should be conducted independent of any sort of political interference.""The emails, which did not mention the ""CIA,"" ""drones"" or details about the militant targets, were written within the often-narrow time frame in which State Department officials had to decide whether or not to object to drone strikes before the CIA pulled the trigger, the officials said, according to the Journal.
Law enforcement and intelligence officials said State Department deliberations about the covert CIA drone program should have been conducted over a more secure government computer system designed to handle classified information, the Journal reported.

By Rory Carroll

S&P Global Ratings warned on Thursday that the credit rating for key Alaska bonds could go down if lawmakers fail to agree on a budget that addresses the state's long term-fiscal problems. Alaska Governor Bill Walker convened a special session of the legislature late last month aimed at passing a budget for fiscal 2017 and closing the state's nearly $4 billion deficit, which has been driven by a collapse in global oil prices. S&P on Thursday put the state's AA-plus general obligation, AA appropriation, and A-plus moral obligation ratings on Alaska's debt on CreditWatch with negative implications. The bond proceeds are expected to pay for several transportation-related projects. 
""The CreditWatch placement indicates that we may lower Alaska's credit rating if state policymakers defer adopting fiscal reforms to correct the state's structural budget deficit,"" said Gabriel Petek, a S&P Global Ratings credit analyst. Since the special session began late last month the legislature has passed a $4.4 billion spending plan for fiscal 2017 and a bill to reduce the cost of the state's oil and gas tax credit program, S&P said. 
But it is unclear if a hotly contested bill that would transfer money from the state's permanent fund to its general fund will overcome opposition in the state House of Representatives. The bill, SB 128, would reduce the amount paid out to residents annually from the fund.Even if it passes, S&P said it remains to be seen whether SB 128 and other fiscal reforms would be sufficient to put Alaska's fiscal structure on a sustainable trajectory. 
""Enactment of SB 128 alone would shrink the deficit, but it wouldn't eliminate it. In order to fully close the structural fiscal gap, other measures - such as new income tax or more spending cuts - would also be necessary,"" S&P said. Despite the budget deficit, S&P said Alaska continues to have very strong credit quality due to the large reserves it built up over times when oil prices were high.

By David Shepardson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. Senate panel disclosed Thursday it is investigating pay TV competition and customer service issues and will call executives from top cable and satellite providers to testify.The investigation comes as the U.S. cable and satellite TV industry ranks among the lowest in consumer surveys over billing and other practices. Senators Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who chairs a panel on investigations and Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said in a statement Thursday that they will hold a June 23 hearing that will include testimony from Comcast Corp, Charter Communications, DirectTV, a unit of AT&T Inc and Dish Network Corp.The pair said in a joint statement the panel has been investigating the largest cable and satellite TV companies for more than a year, looking at potential barriers to competition in the industry, ""including the difficulties faced by companies attempting to create innovative new television delivery models."" The committee has also been examining billing, fees, refunds and other customer service issues.
""We believe our hearing will be a big step forward for consumers, allowing them to understand how their TV providers really work and make informed decisions about their video service,"" the pair said. Comcast declined to comment. Charter, which completed its acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in May, said in a statement ""our overall customer satisfaction ratings are trending in the right direction. Call volume into our call centers is declining, as are service calls.""
The senators noted that a recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey found pay television service ranked near the bottom of the 43 industries surveyed - a year after the pay-TV industry tied for the lowest score among all industries ranked.The hearing follows a Federal Communications Commission proposal to allow consumers to swap pricey cable and other pay TV boxes for cheaper devices and apps, a change that would boost competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market.The proposal would let customers get video services from providers like Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo Inc. It set off a lobbying battle between tech companies eager to tap into the market and cable and TV companies which could lose billions of dollars in rental fees.
The FCC says 99 percent of U.S. customers now must get their boxes from their cable companies, and they pay on average $231 a year to lease the devices.Cable companies say the video marketplace is already evolving as more customers replace traditional pay TV services with streaming internet video.

By Michelle Conlin
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump's presidential campaign is likely to launch a small donor fundraising effort akin to the grassroots one that powered another insurgent presidential contender, Democrat Bernie Sanders, according to two top donors who attended the first official meeting of Trump's national finance team. The Trump finance machine kickoff took place at New York City's Four Seasons Hotel amid growing concerns about the Republican presidential candidate's lack of a campaign infrastructure heading into a Nov. 8 election battle against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.""The pitch to this group in the room was a traditional pitch, but the backroom discussion was, because of this being a populist movement, there's going to be significant outreach to, you know, those who give $1, $2, $20,"" said Trump Texas fundraising co-chairman Gaylord Hughey. ""There's a huge opportunity there.""Sanders, who has effectively lost the 2016 presidential nomination to Clinton, broke fundraising records during his long-shot bid for the presidency, collecting more than $210 million through more than 7.4 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece.   Trump could well find his supporters eager to pitch in $1, $5 or $20. For a story in May, Reuters found that nearly all three dozen Trump supporters it interviewed were not only unmoved by Trump's about-face to accept money from outside donors, they said they would also happily contribute.The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment about replicating the fundraising apparatus of Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont.
LATE START?
Some donors were fearful of the late start of Thursday's gathering. Normally such a meeting would take place two years earlier in a candidate's campaign. But others in attendance said they left assured that Trump would be able to easily plug into the Republican National Committee's robust infrastructure.Trump, a wealthy businessman, became the presumptive Republican nominee last month after seeing off 16 rivals in a largely self-funded primary campaign.The gathering featured talks by Trump, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, chief strategist Paul Manafort, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, former rival-turned-ally Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Republican fundraisers Ray Washburne and Lew Eisenberg.
Trump's late start on fundraising has raised questions about whether he can achieve his previously stated aim of raising $1 billion before November. On the Democratic side, Clinton's well-oiled operation is well ahead of schedule.FREE MEDIA

Trump is also pulling back from his earlier statements on his fundraising goal. Campaign manager Lewandowski told Reuters on Wednesday that he sees no need for Trump to raise that sum and that Trump may be able to stick to his low-cost style of campaigning.That includes garnering free media, which is estimated will reach a value of $5 billion by November, according to media analytics firm mediaQuant. That is more than double what Clinton is likely to get, mediaQuant says.While Trump shot to the top of the Republican race with freewheeling rhetoric, insults of rivals and promises to get tough on issues such as illegal immigration, even his biggest donors say they are discouraged by the candidate's attacks in recent weeks on a Mexican-American judge.In comments that have been widely condemned, Trump has suggested that U.S. Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a case against Trump University, has an inherent bias because of his heritage.""He needs to stop the campaign infighting, shut up and stop calling an American who was born in Indiana a Mexican,"" said Texas billionaire Doug Deason.

By Alana Wise

The U.S. presidential election battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has barely begun but their Twitter war is on.After receiving President Barack Obama's endorsement on Thursday to succeed him in the White House, Clinton, who this week clinched the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 election, tweeted she was honored to have his support and ""fired up and ready to go.""Trump, who has made extensive use of Twitter during his insurgent Republican presidential campaign, took the opportunity to tweet back: ""Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama--but nobody else does!""Clinton's account quickly responded: ""Delete your account,"" in a tweet to her 6.7 million Twitter followers.
Within minutes, the phrase, a popular form of online dismissal, became Clinton's most popular tweet ever, with more than 194,000 retweets and 213,000 likes. Prominent Republicans rushed to their presumptive nominee's aid, taking thinly veiled shots at Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. 
"".@HillaryClinton If anyone knows how to use a delete key, it's you,"" tweeted Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.  Clinton has repeatedly said she chose ""not to keep"" some 30,000 emails her lawyers deemed personal, which has been widely interpreted as meaning she deleted the personal emails.
Trump later rejoined the battle, tweeting: ""How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?""

WASHINGTON Leaders of the congressional committee that investigates data breaches and computer hacking blasted the main U.S. banking regulator on Thursday for possibly jeopardizing the work of its inspector general, an internal watchdog, and hunting out potential whistleblowers. Part of the House Science Committee for months has been looking into the theft of thousands of records from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, including two breaches in which workers downloaded more than 10,000 sensitive and private records onto portable storage devices before leaving the agency's employ.In a letter to FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, Lamar Smith, the committee's chairman, and Barry Loudermilk, chairman of the subcommittee on oversight, described an agency slow to cooperate with lawmakers that fails to conduct ""good faith"" searches for requested information.Moreover, the two, both Republicans, said the FDIC had gathered and reviewed internal communications of its inspector general's office while collecting documents that the committee had requested. By law, inspectors general are independent. They function as the ethical and legal consciences of federal agencies, rooting out fraud and mismanagement, often with information provided confidentially by employees.
""Not only is the committee troubled that the FDIC continues to withhold pertinent and responsive information to its cybersecurity posture,"" it is ""even more concerned by the FDIC's gathering and review"" of the inspector general office's internal communications, they wrote.That could compromise the inspector general's ""ability to conduct its work in a manner uninhibited by the very agency it was created to oversee,"" they added.The FDIC was not immediately available to comment.
When the committee received documents from the FDIC earlier this week, the lawmakers said, it noticed a ""distinct watermark included on each page."" ""Given the committee's concerns about potential retaliation against whistleblowers discussed in previous letters to the FDIC, the FDIC's inclusion of a novel watermark raises serious questions about whether the agency it attempting to identify the source of committee materials,"" they said.
They added that some of the watermarked pages covered communications between the inspector general and FDIC employees, raising concerns that the agency is attempting to identify confidential informants.The committee is demanding that the FDIC send it information on actions to protect whistleblowers and inspector general communications by Monday, June 13.

Legislation approved by Michigan lawmakers on Thursday to bail out the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) will keep the district operating, but falls short on funding to fix its crumbling buildings, according to school officials.The bill package, approved over objections by Democratic lawmakers, creates a new, debt-free district governed by an elected school board, while leaving the current district in place solely to levy property taxes to pay off outstanding debt.DPS, which has nearly 46,000 students, has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency.The American Federation of Teachers-Michigan and Detroit Federation of Teachers criticized the lack of a bipartisan compromise in a joint statement on Thursday.""These bills are a statement by non-Detroit Republicans that they know what is best for Detroit, a city that is overwhelmingly people of color,"" the groups said. ""It has been this attitude that resulted in Detroit Public Schools' massive debt, low academic performance and a 'wild west' system of school openings.""
Under the measures approved on Thursday, Michigan would commit $617 million from the state's share of a tobacco settlement in annual increments of $72 million for the new Detroit Community School District. An emergency state loan for transition costs was capped at $150 million, with only $25 million of that amount available for capital improvements, less than the overall $200 million sought by DPS.""We also look forward to working creatively with the governor's office, the state superintendent, and the Michigan Department of Education to identify the remainder of the critical resources necessary to educate our students,"" DPS state-appointed transition manager Steven Rhodes said in a statement.A smaller bailout passed by the House in May raised concerns that DPS would run out of cash later this summer.
Republican lawmakers contended the final $617 million bailout legislation would prevent DPS from filing for municipal bankruptcy even though Rhodes, a former federal bankruptcy judge, has said such a move would be ineffective because much of the district's debt is guaranteed by the state.Democrats objected to the absence of a Detroit Education Commission to oversee the opening and closing of public and charter schools in Detroit.
The House and Senate approved the package with a series of votes late Wednesday and early Thursday, sending the legislation to the desk of Republican Governor Rick Snyder, who signaled in a statement that he supports it.
