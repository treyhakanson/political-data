WASHINGTON U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he is not ready to support or endorse Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now,"" Ryan, a Republican, said in an interview with CNN. 
Ryan, who added he hoped to support Trump's candidacy, was making his first public comments since Trump's Republican primary rivals dropped out of the race for the White House this week.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON For some Democrats, Donald Trump may seem to be a gift - set to steer Republicans into a trainwreck election in November - but senior Democrat Harry Reid said on Thursday he worried people might be too confident. ""Am I concerned about it? Of course I am,"" the U.S. Senate Democratic leader said in a conference call with reporters. ""I think this race could be a debacle for the Republicans,"" Reid added. ""But I'm not taking anything for granted. I'm not being over confident.""Trump effectively clinched the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election this week after a primary battle that angered many - including in his own party's establishment - for his bombastic style and proposals such as building a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out Mexicans. 
Some Democrats believe that divisive style makes him an easier opponent than some of the other 16 Republicans who started out in the race. Trump's Democratic opponent will likely be former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Reid, who is retiring from the Senate after this year, used his position as the Senate's Democratic leader in 2012 to aggressively attack then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
During a teleconference to discuss Trump and Republican opposition to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, Reid made clear that he will perform in a similar role against Trump.""By nominating Trump, I guess it's the natural evolution of a party that's spent eight years defining itself entirely on what it's against: anti-immigrant, anti-woman,...anti-Obama, anti-working people,"" said the senator from Nevada.
Reid, who has called Trump a ""monster,"" said there should be a closer look at Trump's business dealings and called on the real estate developer to open up his tax records.Reid recalled some of his own campaigns in his political career that were lost or won by razor-thin margins, adding, ""I can speak from personal experience. You cannot be over-confident."" (Reporting By Richard Cowan; Editing by Dan Grebler and Frances Kerry)"	['Reid', 'Romney', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton took quick aim at presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday, saying the United States should not take a risk on an unreliable candidate.""He is a loose cannon, and loose cannons tend to misfire,"" Clinton said in an interview with CNN, citing Trump stances including an allegation that climate change was a Chinese hoax. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said Trump would have to offer policy specifics in ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election and criticized him for his positions on issues including nuclear weapons and abortion.""He makes these grand statements and grand accusations,"" Clinton said of the real estate magnate and former reality TV star. ""At some point when you're running for president, you actually have to put a little meat on the bones. You've got to tell people what it is you're going to do and how you're going to do it.""Clinton lost the Democratic primary contest in Indiana on Tuesday but still looks set to win her party's nomination, leading her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, by more than 800 delegates. Trump's win in Indiana on Tuesday pushed his rivals out of the race and left him as the presumptive nominee.In a preview of the likely general election battle, Clinton laughed when asked if she was ready to take on Trump, saying: ""Oh, please.""
""This is to me a classic case of a blustering, bullying guy who has knocked out of the way all the Republicans because they were just dumbfounded,"" she said.Clinton said she knew how to run a campaign against Trump and took a swipe at Trump's 16 Republican presidential rivals who started out in the 2016 campaign.
""They didn't know how to deal with him,"" Clinton said. ""They couldn't take him on the issues because they basically agreed with them. And they didn't know how to counterpunch.""Asked how ""scorched-earth"" the campaign was likely to be, she replied: ""You know, he's the one making that decision. ... He's the one who's run the campaign insulting people, demeaning women, degrading people with disabilities, talking about keeping Muslims out of the country, he's the one that's been running that kind of very negative, aggressive, bullying campaign.""I'm going to keep staying on the kind of campaign I'm running,"" she said.

WASHINGTON The White House on Thursday said that it sees no reason to wait until after the Nov. 8 presidential election for Congress to take up discussions on the Trans-Pacific Partnership""There's no reason we need to wait that long, particularly when you consider that ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership would hasten the end to 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at the daily briefing.

By Ginger Gibson and Grant Smith
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump named a national finance chairman for his presidential campaign on Thursday, picking an investor with little experience in campaigns but a long history of political donations, including to Trump's likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.Steven Mnuchin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who now works in entertainment financing, is chairman and CEO of private investment firm Dune Capital Management LP. He is taking one of the first high-profile jobs in the campaign that Trump has filled.Trump, a real estate developer who this week became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the November election, worked with Mnuchin in a business capacity before, the campaign said.Since 1998, Mnuchin has given about $71,000 to Democrats and their associated committees, compared to about $37,000 to Republicans. Since Hillary Clinton's campaign to be elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000, Mnuchin donated $7,400 to Clinton, according to the Federal Election Commission. He also gave $10,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2004.
More recently, Mnuchin donated to Republicans, including $22,500 in 2012 to Mitt Romney's joint fundraising committee and another $4,800 to the former Republican nominee's campaign.His history of donations to Democrats may well add to distaste for Trump among some establishment Republicans who have opposed the billionaire's rise to likely presidential nominee on the grounds his proposals are not truly Republican.
Trump said on Wednesday he will begin to raise money for his general election bid after self-funding a majority of his primary campaign. Fundraising will require a balance, especially since much of Trump's campaign message has rested on his refusal to raise money and his decision to self-fund his campaign during the party nominating contests.Historically, political parties have depended on the ability of their nominee to raise money in order to fund their other operations, including working to elect members of the House and Senate. Trump said he will work closely with the Republican National Committee - which already has a fundraising operation - to help both his own campaign and those of other members of the party for the Nov. 8 election.    
U.S. Representative Chris Collins of New York, who was the first lawmaker to endorse Trump, said the move to start raising money will help bring the party together.""You'll see that pivot to the general election, which is uniting the party, and fundraising is a very big part of uniting the party, with the influence money has in elections these days,"" Collins told Reuters in an interview.

By Elisabeth O'Leary
| ISLE OF LEWIS, Scotland

ISLE OF LEWIS, Scotland Donald Trump has played up his family roots from Lewis, an island off the northwestern tip of Scotland, but his success in the U.S. Republican presidential battle has not drawn the kind of rapture the billionaire might like from his home crowd.Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, emigrated to the United States from the Lewis village of Tong in the early 1930s, and a visit from her property mogul son would certainly interest the friendly inhabitants of this weather-beaten isle. But the kind of fiery oratory that has catapulted him to unexpected victories in the U.S. primaries might be taken with a pinch of salt, according to Tim Durbin, manager of the post office in the capital Stornoway.""People here like proof and anything less than that is suspect,"" said Durbin, a 43-year-old American originally from Kentucky who has lived here for a decade. ""There would certainly be lots of talk about him after he left, but the talk would be subdued and the laughter would be gentle."" The islanders' wariness is apparent when the New Yorker's name is mentioned; many smile politely and refuse to talk about him at all, making it difficult to gauge sentiment among the 20,000-strong population. But even such silence is significant in a place of strong community ties, according to critically-acclaimed Lewis novelist Kevin MacNeil. ""If people from Lewis were genuinely supportive of Trump they would be more vocal in their views,"" he said. ""The lack of support for a grandson of the island speaks volumes.""An exception is a Facebook page called ""Isle of Lewis supports Trump for President"" which has 84 ""likes"".The businessman has become the presumptive Republican nominee with a headline-grabbing campaign in which he has traded insults with rivals. A suggestion Muslims should be banned from entering the United States drew criticism from Europe and led to the withdrawal of Scottish business and academic accolades.Trump argued last month, in a column in Aberdeen's Press and Journal newspaper, that he had won over the skeptical people of Scotland through tenaciousness after he built his golf course despite environmental hurdles, local opposition and lawsuits.""Scotland has already been won - and so will the United States,"" he wrote. 
Trump called his Scottish business project a ""labor of love"" and his Trump International Golf Links website has a section dedicated to his Scots' family genealogy. FREEZING GUSTS
""It would be funny if Trump won. It might boost tourism,"" said Donald, a Lewis pensioner living near the MacLeod family seat.""But only for a while,"" interjected his wife Anne, with the caution habitual of the island.
The couple recalled that Trump's mother would visit from the United States in the summer, and Trump's millionaire father Fred would ship over a Cadillac to carry her around the marshy island during her stay.""You'd end up in the ditch if you were trying to drive past them, I remember that,"" said Donald with a laugh.Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides island chain, is a picturesque place, dotted with lakes, hills and open tracts of moor and almost devoid of trees. A freezing gust can whip your breath away or a warm breeze can surprise you with its gentleness. Trump stopped for a brief visit in 2008, jetting in on his private plane when he was trying to launch a golf business near Aberdeen in mainland Scotland and holding a news conference. He has not returned since, although he has visited Scotland several times and runs two golf courses on the mainland, one in Ayrshire and another in Aberdeenshire. 
He was then offered the possibility of an investment in Lews (sic) Castle, a run-down Victorian country house in Stornoway built by another millionaire, Sir James Matheson, when he bought the island in the mid-19th century.""He just didn't think he was going to make any money out of it. He knows his roots are here but he's more interested in his golf investments elsewhere,"" said council official Nigel Scott.    People are not easily swayed in Lewis, where strong bonds between neighbors and family are necessary to withstand the harshness of rural life, said Calum Iain Macleod a Presbyterian minister from the parish where Mary Anne MacLeod was born.""When the Atlantic is throwing a force 10 and you can barely stand and your windows are caked with salt, it is extreme and it is tough,"" he said.""Being on this island where The Minch separates you from the center of gravity, you feel more vulnerable,"" he said, referring to a strait that separates the Outer Hebrides from the mainland.The influence of the Church itself, which is well-attended, also makes for a tranquil place. Sundays are still almost entirely commerce-free and pubs and hotels which serve alcohol are very few, in contrast to the rest of Britain.Trump's desire to recall his historic Scottish roots may have another purpose, suggests novelist MacNeil.""Perhaps he simply wants a Scotland-shaped mirror to reflect back his own perceived glory.""

By David Shepardson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON More than 50 automakers, state transportation agencies and other groups urged the White House and other federal policymakers on Thursday not to open a portion of the wireless spectrum reserved for connected vehicles in the near future.The letter was signed by major auto trade groups representing nearly the entire auto industry, including Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Honda Motor Co. It came a week after a cable industry trade group and some tech companies, including Qualcomm Inc, and public interest groups urged the White House to take quick action to open the spectrum to more wireless devices.Automakers and companies seeking to use the 5.9 GHz unlicensed spectrum band for wireless devices have been sparring for several years.In January, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx sent a proposed regulation to the White House that would require all new cars to be equipped with ""vehicle-to-vehicle"" technology that could eventually prevent up to 80 percent of crashes in which alcohol is not a factor. The proposal will not be final until approved by the White House and opened for public comment.The technology, which involves cars repeatedly sending wireless signals to each other, could help alert drivers if an oncoming vehicle may disregard a traffic light. It can detect threats from hundreds of yards away and indicate whether  vehicles can, for example, pass safely or make a left turn.
""One of the most - if not the most - significant advances in vehicle safety is now coming into existence. We urge you to stay the course and complete the action your administration has undertaken to improve the safety of drivers and passengers on America's roadways,"" said the letter, signed by the auto and auto parts trade groups as well as the Michigan, California and Arizona state transportation departments and the National Safety Council and National Sheriffs Association.Automakers say vehicle-to-vehicle technology could also help speed self-driving cars to the roads.Last week in a separate letter to the Obama administration, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and other groups said the president needs to act quickly because as connected device use ""continues to skyrocket, the spectrum resources that power our devices are perilously insufficient.""
The groups urged speedy action. ""We must act now to find more unlicensed spectrum,"" they wrote.Michael Calabrese, director for wireless policy at New America's Open Technology Institute, said the ""auto industry ignores the fact that their unused band has enough spectrum to deploy - and protect - both crash avoidance safety applications and next generation Wi-Fi.""Dave Sullivan, an analyst at AutoPacific, said automakers have a lot at stake and have made significant investments in the technology. ""It's imperative that this spectrum not be encroached on,"" he said.
In 1999, the Federal Communications Commission allocated 75 megahertz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for highway safety. But critics say the technology has not progressed much beyond the testing phase.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and Foxx agreed in January to conduct testing on whether the spectrum can be shared with wireless devices.The government officials said it is ""imperative to ensure the future automotive safety and efficiency of the traveling public"" that testing be completed before they make any decisions on sharing the spectrum.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Thirteen U.S. industry groups representing technology companies  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Uber Technologies Inc, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and others are pushing for the next U.S. president to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and to make it easier to hire high-tech workers from abroad, according to a joint letter seen by Reuters.Ahead of the Republican and Democratic conventions in July, the tech industry plans to issue on Wednesday an open letter charting a dozen policy recommendations for the candidates running in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The groups are not aligning themselves with either of the two major political parties.Backing for the TPP runs counter to positions taken by presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Trump has made criticism of international trade agreements and a call for tougher immigration policies central themes of his campaign. In a Republican debate in March the billionaire real estate developer shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, saying he was ""softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country.""Clinton has not said if she would try to renegotiate TPP, which was signed in February but has not yet got congressional approval. She has said she supports expanding the number of visas for high-skilled workers.
Silicon Valley has struggled to notch policy wins in recent years on its legislative priorities, including immigration and patent reform, though the tech industry has succeeded in strengthening net neutrality protections and curtailing some government surveillance programs.The coalition letter, signed by groups including the Internet Association, Telecommunications Industry Association and Information Technology Industry Council, is the first time a wide range of technology trade organizations have staked out a common platform during a presidential campaign, according to a person familiar with its writing.The platform also calls for ""narrowly targeted government access to user data"" and recognition of encryption as a ""critical security tool.""
Trump has urged the restoration of the National Security Agency's (NSA) bulk collection of U.S. phone records, saying that U.S. authorities should err on the side of protecting national security over privacy concerns.Trump also urged a boycott of Apple during the company's high-profile clash earlier this year with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation over unlocking an encrypted iPhone linked to a San Bernardino, California gunman.
Clinton has supported some reforms to the NSA and has said a balance needs to be found between privacy and security in the encryption debate.The letter also calls for preventing censorship online by limiting unreasonable third-party liability for speech, support for the sharing economy, and an updated and simplified tax code, among other issues.Signatories also include Allied for Startups, BSA The Software Alliance, Computing Technology Industry Association, Computer & Communications Industry Association, Consumer Technology Association, Semiconductor Industry Association, Silicon Valley Leadership Group, Software & Information Industry Association, Technology CEO Council and TechNet.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outlined economic policy initiatives on Thursday that he would pursue if elected to the White House in November, including refinancing longer-term U.S. debt, lowering taxes and scrapping a slew of federal regulations.The Manhattan real estate mogul said his aim would be to clear the way for U.S. businesses to succeed.""We're lowering taxes very substantially and we're going to be getting rid of a tremendous amount of regulations,"" Trump said in a wide-ranging interview with CNBC.""The business people they talk about regulation more than they talk about taxes,"" he said.Trump's path to the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election became clear after a decisive primary victory in Indiana on Tuesday forced his two remaining rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, to drop out of the race.The candidate, who has never held elective office, has been pressed to provide more details on policy proposals. On Wednesday, he said he was ""open to doing something"" with the country's minimum wage, but that any increase would have to be weighed against a potential loss of competitiveness.
In the CNBC interview, the billionaire said he supported low interest rates for now and believed the United States should try to refinance some of its debt to help pay for infrastructure repairs.""I would refinance debt. I think we should refinance longer-term debt,"" Trump said.Trump has experience in restructuring his business debt,  including two of his Atlantic City casino companies, and said he has been successful on that front. 
Trump told CNBC he would not renegotiate U.S. bonds but would buy back at discounts, depending where interest rates are.""Part of the problem is when a lot of this debt comes due,  what happens if the rates are high and we have no budget that can even conceivably take care of this,"" Trump said.If interest rates go up just 1 percent, Trump said, it would be devastating for the economy.
""I think there are times for us to refinance, refinance debt with longer term,"" he said. ""Because you know we owe so much money. Nobody talks about it - nobody talks about it until the bubble pops. And the bubble could pop, and it could pop and it could be ugly.""Trump also warned about the downside of a strong U.S. dollar.""I love the concept of a strong dollar, in many respects obviously I like a strong dollar. But when you look at the havoc that a strong dollar causes,"" he said on CNBC. ""While there are certain benefits, it sounds better to have a strong dollar than in actuality it is.""
