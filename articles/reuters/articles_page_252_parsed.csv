By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Federal Bureau of Investigation is likely to interview Hillary Clinton in the next few weeks about her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state and have already interviewed some of her aides, CNN reported on Thursday.The nine-month investigation into whether laws were broken as a result of the server kept in her New York home has overshadowed Clinton's campaign to become the Democratic Party's candidate in November's presidential election. With only a few states left to vote in primary elections, she retains a commanding lead over her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.More than 2,000 emails sent and received by Clinton while working as President Barack Obama's top diplomat include classified information, which the government bans from being handled outside secure, government-controlled channels.Clinton has said she did not send or receive any information that was marked as classified and has accused the State Department and other government agencies of ""over-classifying"" her emails after a judge ordered them released to the public. She has said she expects to be exonerated by the FBI, a point her campaign staff echoed on Thursday.""We are confident the review will conclude that nothing inappropriate took place,"" the campaign told CNN.
David Kendall, Clinton's lawyer, and Melanie Newman, a spokesperson for the U.S. Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, both declined to comment.  CNN said those interviewed included Huma Abedin, a senior aide to Clinton and the vice chairwoman of Clinton's presidential campaign.Lawyers for Abedin and other Clinton aides did not respond to questions.
The timeline in the CNN report appeared to contradict answers Clinton gave in an interview on Tuesday, in which she told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell that neither she nor her representatives had yet been contacted by the FBI.Asked about this, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon suggested the definition of words Mitchell used in her question were open to interpretation.""What does representatives mean to you, sir?"" he said in an email, but declined to elaborate.
Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, and other Republicans have used the FBI inquiry to attack Clinton's integrity. ""These FBI interviews are another reminder of the gross negligence Hillary Clinton displayed as Secretary of State,"" Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said in a statement.

WASHINGTON Former Texas Governor Rick Perry has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and is open to being his running mate, CNN reported on Thursday.In September, Perry was the first member of the initially crowded Republican field to drop out of the 2016 White House race, following a failed bid in the 2012 race. The longest-serving governor in Texas history had languished near the bottom of the 17-strong Republican presidential pack since entering the current race in June. 
Trump is now the last one left and the presumptive Republican nominee.

By Colleen Jenkins
| WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. Republican leaders in North Carolina on Thursday refused to back down from a law regulating which restrooms can be used by transgender people after the federal government told the state the law violated the U.S. Civil Rights Act. The state's leading Republican lawmaker, House Speaker Tim Moore, told reporters in Raleigh that North Carolina would not be ""bullied"" into meeting the U.S. Justice Department's Monday deadline to change the law.North Carolina is the first U.S. state to pass a law requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate instead of the gender with which they identify. Republican legislators in several other states have proposed similar laws, making transgender rights a hot-button social issue in an election year.The Justice Department's challenge is similarly unprecedented, though the agency has in the past intervened on behalf of transgender individuals who have alleged discrimination.The Republican National Committee urged state legislators in January to resist federal policies that allow transgender people to use restrooms of their choice at public schools.The Justice Department said in letters to North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and other state officials on Wednesday that the state had until Monday to decided if it would stop discriminating against transgender state employees.
McCrory affirmed his support for the ""very common-sense rule"" before a group of business leaders on Wednesday night but said he did not know if the state would fight the Justice Department. His office did not respond to questions on Thursday.If McCrory does not stand down from enforcing the law, the Justice Department's civil rights division could push for a court order. If a federal judge sides with the agency, North Carolina would have to comply or face a reduction in federal funding. On Thursday, Republican Senate leader Phil Berger's spokeswoman, Amy Auth, said state lawyers were reviewing the letter. Berger on Wednesday said the department's position represented ""a gross overreach."" 
North Carolina's Secretary of Public Safety and officials at the University of North Carolina also received similar letters on Wednesday.Margaret Spellings, president of the University of North Carolina system, said her office would respond to the department's letter by the deadline.""We take this determination seriously and will be conferring with the Governor's Office, legislative leaders, and counsel about next steps,"" she said.Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson would not say whether the department would take legal action against the state. 
The state law is being challenged in federal court by critics including the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights.""We've never before seen a state do something as aggressive as require mandatory discrimination against its own transgender employees,"" said Peter Renn, an attorney with Lambda Legal, in a phone interview with Reuters. Jillian Weiss, an attorney who has argued in federal court for transgender rights, said the Justice Department's action against North Carolina showed the federal government was willing to intervene when states passed laws reducing rights based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Weiss predicts Mississippi, where a law allowing businesses to refuse service to gay people takes effect in July, will be the department's next target.

By David Shepardson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Two U.S. Senators urged auto safety regulators to publicly name the makes and models of tens of millions of vehicles with potentially faulty Takata air bag inflators, according to a letter made public late on Thursday.""There may still be 50 million airbags installed in vehicles whose owners not only have no idea, but also no way to find out, that they are driving a car containing potentially lethal airbags,"" wrote Senators Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.On Wednesday, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirmed the Japanese air bag manufacturer would declare between 35 million and 40 million additional inflators defective by 2019, which will prompt automakers to recall vehicles with the inflators.The 50 million inflators that could still be recalled include 27 million side air bags and 23 million frontal air bag inflators. As part of a November agreement with NHTSA, those vehicles must also be recalled by 2019 unless Takata can prove they are safe.Takata must issue five separate defect reports starting May 16 and ending in 2019. Takata said the first report will cover 14 million of the 35 million to 40 million inflators being recalled. The second report is not due until Dec. 31 and subsequent reports are due in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas said automakers ""will provide the information about the models and makes in the coming weeks."" He did not directly respond to the senators demands on the inflators that have not yet been recalled. Takata spokesman Jared Levy declined to comment.
The senators want NHTSA to release regular updates regarding testing data on Takata airbags and their failure rates.To date, 14 automakers have recalled 28.8 million Takata inflators in about 24 million vehicles. Three additional automakers are part of the expansion.The latest recall means all Takata ammonium nitrate-based driver and passenger frontal air bag inflators without a chemical drying agent, known as a desiccant, will be recalled. But 23 million Takata frontal air bags with a desiccant have not been recalled.
When exposed to moisture, ammonium nitrate, which is used to inflate the air bag, can cause the inflator to rupture with deadly force, spraying shrapnel into vehicle occupants. The defect is linked to at least 11 deaths and more than 100 injuries worldwide since 2008.Takata said it is not aware of any ruptures in the inflators in the vehicles that are part of recall announced Wednesday.

By Dave McKinney
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO For the second time in two weeks, the Illinois Senate moved to loosen the financial death grip on the state's higher education system, which has been starved of operating revenue by a record-setting, 11-month state budget stalemate.The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved and sent to the House of Representatives a $454 million spending package for eight public universities, community colleges and low-income students dependent on Monetary Award Program grants.The bipartisan move, which could stave off mass layoffs at several state universities, builds on a $600 million, higher-education appropriation that Republican Governor Bruce Rauner signed on April 25.Thursday's action also represents another encouraging break in the state's acrimonious budget fight between the governor and Democrats, who control the state legislature, as they face a scheduled legislative adjournment at the end of May.
""We have since found more dollars which we can appropriate to our universities to make them more competitive, to make them more viable and to give them a bridge going forth into the 2017 budget,"" said state Senator Donne Trotter, a Chicago Democrat and a sponsor of Thursday's legislation.The latest appropriation was supported financially by companion legislation that passed the Senate on Thursday authorizing Rauner's administration not to repay $454 million borrowed from state special-purpose funds during the 2015 fiscal year. Without legislative action, that amount would have had to be repaid June 30 from the state's main operational fund.
The approach drew isolated claims of budgetary sleight of hand during floor debate.""This is ridiculous, swapping money from one pocket to another, saying you have it when you don't,"" said state Senator Kyle McCarter, a Republican from Lebanon, Illinois, a rural enclave nearly 300 miles southwest of Chicago.
The Senate-passed legislation cannot be acted on by the House until Tuesday at the earliest when that legislative chamber is scheduled to reconvene.The respite for the state's higher-education system comes after its community colleges received rating downgrades and  negative outlooks by Moody's Investors Service in recent weeks, and Chicago State University had faced the threat of possible closure.

By Brendan O'Brien

The Michigan House of Representatives approved on Thursday a $500 million spending package for Detroit's cash-strapped schools, which could run out of money to pay employees at the end of June.The legislation, which still needs approvals from the state Senate and Governor Rick Snyder, was passed early Thursday morning after hundreds of Detroit teachers called in sick over paycheck concerns. The move closed nearly all of the district's 97 schools on Monday and Tuesday. Detroit school teachers returned to their classrooms on Wednesday following the ""sick-out"" after receiving assurances from officials that they will be paid for their work.The Detroit public school system, or DPS, has nearly 46,000 students. It has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency.""This is the right plan to fix Detroit's schools and give the city a good, working school system for the long term,"" said House Speaker Kevin Cotter in a statement.
The DPS, the state's largest public school system, will run out of money to pay employees after the fiscal year ends on June 30, the school system's state-appointed transition manager, former federal bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, has said.The spending package, which provides $500 million in aid to the school district, is less than the $715 million requested by Republican Governor Snyder and approved by the Republican-controlled Senate as part of a different plan.
In a joint statement, the leaders of the city, state and national teachers' unions called the legislation ""some of the most despicable anti-student, anti-public school, anti-teacher provisions we've seen in America."" They called on Snyder to veto the bill passed by the Republican-controlled House if it reached his desk.Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, said in a statement that previous state Senate bills aimed at funding the schools were ""a thoughtful attempt,"" but the House legislation will repeat past mistakes that included a lack of clear planning.Republican state Senator Goeff Hansen, lead negotiator on the Senate bills, said in a statement he had serious concerns with many aspects of the House legislation, but would work toward a bipartisan solution that he said must include compromise.
Hansen spokesman Peter Wills said in an email that a schedule for reconciling the Senate and House bills has not been set.Rhodes called the passage of the legislation ""an important step in the right direction"" and said he supported talks between the House and Senate to resolve their differences.

Trump has struggled to gain the support of Latino voters since launching his presidential campaign last year with comments accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the U.S. border.He has also vowed to deport all the illegal immigrants living in the United States and build a wall along the border with Mexico and have that country pay for it.
