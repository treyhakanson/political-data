| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump rejected criticism from the father of a soldier killed in Iraq who said the Republican presidential nominee had ""sacrificed nothing and no one"" and questioned whether the mother was allowed to speak during the couple's appearance at the Democratic convention. ""I think I've made a lot of sacrifices,"" Trump told ABC News in excerpts of an interview posted on Saturday. ""I work very, very hard."" Khizr Khan, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin and a Muslim, won widespread praise when he spoke Thursday at the Democratic National Convention, telling the story of his son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed by a bomb in Iraq in 2004. He also attacked Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and asked if the candidate had read the U.S. Constitution.He pulled out a pocket-copy from the inside of his suit coat, in one of the most commented moments on the night that Hillary Clinton accepted her party's nomination for president.  
""Did Hillary's script writers write it?"" Trump asked ABC's George Stephanopoulos in the interview, saying he has indeed sacrificed by employing thousands of people, and raising ""millions of dollars"" for veterans. Trump said Khan appeared ""very emotional and probably looked like a nice guy to me.""But the businessman also cast doubt on why Khan's wife did not speak.
""She was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably, maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say, you tell me,"" Trump said.Clinton at a campaign rally Saturday night in Youngstown, Ohio, said the Khans specifically and Muslims generally are the most recent recipients of Trump's insults, and referenced his past statements about immigrants and the disabled.""It's a long list my friends. I don't know, maybe he doesn't have anything positive to say,"" Clinton said. 
Earlier in the day, Clinton said in a statement that she was ""very moved to see Ghazala Khan stand bravely and with dignity in support of her son on Thursday night. And I was very moved to hear her speak last night, bravely and with dignity, about her son's life and the ultimate sacrifice he made for his country.""Ghazala Khan told MSNBC on Friday that she chose not to speak because she still cannot bear to see her son's photographs. Khizr Khan told the New York Times that the Clinton campaign asked if he need speechwriting help or coaching.""I said: 'I really don't, I have my thoughts in my head,'"" Khan told the Times, adding, ""'Just let me say what I want to say. It will be heart-to-heart'.""       (Additional reporting by Amanda Becker in Pennsylvania and Ohio; Editing by Mary Milliken and Kim Coghill)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

MOSCOW The Kremlin said on Monday that U.S. allegations Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails were part of a cover-up designed to hide the fact that the U.S. election campaign had been manipulated by domestic forces.U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Sunday Russian intelligence services had hacked into Democratic National Committee computers, and she questioned Republican rival Donald Trump's overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin.""Such pronouncements by Mrs Clinton are of the pre-election rhetoric genre and do not contain anything tangible,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.""In this case they (the Americans) are trying to camouflage some of their own (pre-election) shenanigans by demonising Russia. We consider that to be wrong.""
Peskov said Clinton's comments were absurd and emotional and lacking in facts, saying it was wrong to accuse Moscow of wrongdoing without first investigating the accusations.""Official Russian bodies ... do not carry out cyber terrorism,"" he said, saying the Kremlin wanted to see U.S.-Russia relations normalised. 
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied involvement in the hacking incident and said it does not favour any candidate in the Nov. 8 U.S. election.
Despite its official stance, Kremlin-backed TV has tilted its coverage in favour of Trump whom Putin has called ""very talented."" (Reporting by Andrew Osborn/Dmitry Solovyov; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Christian Lowe)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Russian intelligence services hacked into Democratic National Committee computers and she accused Republican contender Donald Trump of showing support for Russian President Vladimir Putin.""We know that Russian intelligence services hacked into the DNC and we know that they arranged for a lot of those emails to be released and we know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin, to support Putin,"" Clinton said in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday.""The United States has not publicly accused Russia of being behind the hack of Democratic Party computers. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials, however, said they believed Russia engineered the release of the emails to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.Asked if she believed Putin wanted Trump to win the White House, Clinton said she was not going to jump to that conclusion.""But I think laying out the facts raises serious issues about Russian interference in our elections, in our democracy,"" Clinton told Fox in the interview, taped Saturday.
The United States would not tolerate that from any other country, especially one considered an adversary, she said.""For Trump to both encourage that and to praise Putin  despite what appears to be a deliberate effort to try to affect the election I think raises national security issues,"" she said.
The New York businessman has praised Putin, saying he was a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat.Trump last week invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time at the U.S. State Department. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump told reporters.
The Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election later said he was being ""sarcastic"" in his comments, which raised concerns among intelligence experts and criticism that  Trump was urging a foreign government to spy on Americans.

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Sunday that Russian intelligence services hacked into Democratic National Committee computers and she questioned Republican rival Donald Trump's overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin.""We know that Russian intelligence services hacked into the DNC and we know that they arranged for a lot of those emails to be released and we know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin, to support Putin,"" Clinton said in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday.""The White House has declined to speculate on who was behind the hack of Democratic Party computers, referring to an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Cybersecurity experts and U.S. officials, however, said they believed Russia engineered the release of the emails to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Reuters reported a computer network used by Clinton's campaign was hacked as part of the broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations.The United States would not tolerate that from any other country, especially one considered an adversary, Clinton said.""For Trump to both encourage that and to praise Putin  despite what appears to be a deliberate effort to try to affect the election I think raises national security issues,"" she said.Asked if she believed Putin wanted Trump in the White House, Clinton said she was not going to jump to that conclusion.""But I think laying out the facts raises serious issues about Russian interference in our elections, in our democracy,"" Clinton told Fox in the interview, taped on Saturday.

""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump told reporters.He later said he was being ""sarcastic"" in his comments, which raised concerns among intelligence experts and criticism that Trump was urging a foreign government to spy on Americans.Senator Jeff Sessions, a supporter of Trump, criticized  Clinton for leaving her email system vulnerable to Russian penetration and defended Trump's comments.
""I have people come up to me all the time and say 'Why don't you, if you want to find out where those 30,000 emails are, why don't you ask the Russians?"" Sessions told CNN. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange refused to answer questions on Sunday about whether a foreign government leaked the DNC emails to the group. ""It's an interesting speculative question for the press,"" he told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Trump's ""absolute allegiance to a lot of Russian wish-list foreign policy positions"" is among the reasons he is unfit to be commander in chief, Clinton, a former U.S. senator, secretary of state and first lady, said in the Fox interview.Trump alarmed allies this month when he indicated he might abandon NATO's mutual defense guarantee in the face of potential Russian aggression if members had not paid their bills. He also  suggested he would consider easing sanctions on Russia and recognizing its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.
On Sunday, Trump referred to that annexation again in a way that appeared to justify it. ""The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week.""He also said Putin was ""not going to go into Ukraine,"" prompting a rebuke from Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan.""Russia is already in Ukraine. Does he not know that?"" Sullivan said in a statement.Trump often speaks wistfully about smoother relations between Washington and Moscow. ""Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,"" he said on ABC.Such comments often leave his campaign to try to toughen the rhetoric. ""I think Mr. Trump has made it very clear he views Russia to be somebody that we need to be firm with,"" campaign manager Paul Manafort said on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican candidate Donald Trump said he is unhappy with the dates set for this fall's presidential debates, but White House rival Hillary Clinton countered that the schedule was decided long ago and vowed to show up regardless of his objections.     The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has scheduled three televised debates ahead of the Nov. 8 election - Monday, Sept. 26, Sunday, Oct. 9, and Wednesday, Oct. 19. The dates were set almost a year ago.Trump and other Republicans said they should be changed because of conflicts with National Football League games.""I think two of the three are against the NFL, so I'm not thrilled with that,"" the Republican presidential nominee said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" that aired on Sunday.Speaking to reporters while campaigning at a cheese barn in Ashland, Ohio, Clinton noted that the debate schedule had been established long before the two major political parties chose their nominees.""I'm going to be there. That's all I'll say,"" Clinton said just days after the end of the Democratic National Convention, where the former secretary of state accepted her party's presidential nomination.In a statement, the commission said the chosen dates ""will serve the American public well,"" adding that it was impossible to avoid all sporting events when working out the schedule. It said the debates had never been rescheduled for such conflicts.Trump, who tweeted on Friday that Clinton was ""trying to rig the debates"" so that fewer people would watch, suggested in the ABC interview that his rival wanted the debates to be held ""when nobody's home"" to watch.
Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser and former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, tweeted that the scheduling ""makes me think the commission is rigged to help hide Hillary from the voters.""'MAXIMUM AUDIENCE'
The commission was established in 1987 by the Republicans and Democrats to ensure the debates became a permanent part of the campaign after a series of ""hastily arranged"" events in 1976, 1980 and 1984 - and no debates in 1964, 1968 and 1972.
Neither party is involved with running the commission, which is governed by an independent board of directors. It is co-chaired by former Republican National Committee chairman Frank Fahrenkopf and Mike McCurry, a former press secretary in Bill Clinton's White House.David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, suggested on Twitter that Trump could be ""just trying to ditch"" the debates.When asked directly whether Trump would participate, his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said the Republican candidate ""wants to participate"" but also seeks ""the maximum audience.""""So we're going to sit down with the commission in the next week or so and we're going to start talking to them and we want to make sure we have a broad audience, understanding, watching the debates,"" Manafort told CBS's ""Face the Nation.""
RNC Chairman Reince Preibus said the debates would get more viewers if they were on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday nights.""We're going to be working with the commission and what they're putting together,"" Preibus said on CBS. ""We're not going to agree with anything that our nominee doesn't agree with.""Clinton adviser John Podesta called the complaints ""more Trump debate malarkey. We will be at the debates set by the bipartisan debate commission and expect he will too,"" Podesta said on Twitter.Trump also told ABC he had received a letter from the NFL saying the debate dates were ""ridiculous.""But Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the NFL, said there was no such letter.""While we'd obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Mr. Trump,"" McCarthy said on Twitter.

DUBAI Islamic State on Sunday condemned as an ""apostate"" a U.S. Muslim soldier killed in Iraq whose story has re-ignited debate in the 2016 presidential election on the role of Muslims in American life.Dabiq, the militant group's online magazine, showed a picture of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan's tombstone in Arlington National Cemetery with a caption, ""Beware of Dying as an apostate.""An accompanying article, penned by an unnamed ""American convert in the Islamic State,"" urged Muslims to resist Western influences and to either migrate to Islamic State-controlled lands or carry out lone attacks.""Reject these calls to disunity and come together. Live the life of Islam, for which you have already left the path of falsehood,"" the militant wrote.""You are behind enemy lines, able to strike them where it hurts them most,"" the article added.
Khan's death in a bomb attack in Iraq in 2004 re-emerged as an election issue when his father gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday in which he paid homage to his son.Khizr Khan, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin and a Muslim,  also criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and asked if the candidate had read the U.S. Constitution.Trump rejected the criticism and questioned whether the soldier's mother was allowed to speak during the couple's appearance at the podium.
Ghazala Khan later said the outspoken billionaire was ignorant of Islam and of sacrifice. Trump has stoked outrage during his unorthodox campaign by supporting racial profiling for Muslim Americans in the wake of a deadly shooting by a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June.
