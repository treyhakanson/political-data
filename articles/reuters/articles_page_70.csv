| GREENSBORO, N.C.

GREENSBORO, N.C. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's comments on a 2005 videotape about groping women would disqualify him from even a job at a convenience store.    Speaking at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama said the choice was clear in the Nov. 8 election even before the tape was leaked last week showing Trump speaking crudely about women.""Now you find a situation in which the guy says stuff that nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven,"" Obama told the crowd, referring to the convenience store chain. Trump said during Sunday night's presidential debate he was embarrassed by the video, but dismissed it as ""locker room talk.""
Obama also criticized some Republicans who have condemned the remarks but are still backing the New York businessman.""The fact that now you've got people saying: 'We strongly disagree, we really disapprove ... but we're still endorsing him.' They still think he should be president, that doesn't make sense to me,"" Obama said.
Earlier on Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the remarks in the recording amounted to sexual assault. Obama also took aim at Trump's business credentials,  referring to a New York Times report that showed he claimed a nearly billion dollar loss in one year on his taxes in the 1990s.
""They say the house always wins,"" Obama quipped about Trump, who was a casino developer at the time. ""I don't know how that happens.""  (Reporting by Ayesha Rascoe; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

| OCALA, Fla./WASHINGTON

OCALA, Fla./WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday, deepening a fracture in the party with only four weeks to go until the Nov. 8 election.Trump, at a rally before thousands of supporters jammed into a livestock arena in Ocala, Florida, also attempted to drive voters away from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton with an overwhelmingly negative speech in which he described her as corrupt and unqualified for the presidency.Ryan said on Monday he was no longer going to campaign for or defend Trump and advised House Republicans not to support the White House candidate if they did not want to. His move followed outcry over a video that surfaced last Friday showing Trump bragging in 2005 about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances.Trump's response to being abandoned by Ryan, the country's most senior elected Republican, has veered between saying he feels free now to campaign on his own terms and assailing Ryan and other ""disloyal"" Republicans. ""Already the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people,"" the New York businessman said on Wednesday, complaining that Ryan and others had not called to  congratulate him on what he felt was a strong performance at a debate against Clinton on Sunday.""You'd think they'd say great going Don, let's go. Let's beat this crook,"" Trump said.""No, he doesn't do that,"" he added of Ryan, as the crowd booed in sympathy. ""There is a whole deal going on there. There is a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on.""The release of the video has plunged Trump and the Republican Party into a deep crisis that has jeopardized his chances of winning the White House, when he was already lagging Clinton in national opinion polls, and possibly put Republican control of the U.S. Congress in danger.
WRONG FOCUS, LAWMAKERS COMPLAIN
Trump's fresh round of attacks came even as his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, heard concerns from some House Republicans that Trump's criticism of Ryan was distracting from his message on how to defeat Clinton and win the White House.Conway convened a conference call with House Republicans who support Trump that lasted about an hour.
A congressional aide said Conway went through a list of differences between Trump and Clinton and talked about how to make the case for Trump and against Clinton.The general theme of comments from lawmakers on the call was that Trump needed to focus on his message to the United States and distinguish it from Clinton's, the aide said.The aide said members specifically brought up Trump's attacks on Ryan as a distraction from that message. The tone from House Republican was one of frustration at Trump's attacks on a fellow Republican, the aide said.The campaign and Conway did not respond to requests for their comments about the call.
Nonetheless, Ryan has been facing considerable blowback from a number of his fellow House Republicans since announcing his decision to focus on electing Republicans in Congress.Oklahoma Republican Jim Bridenstine, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, tweeted on Wednesday that he will not support Ryan - presumably, for speaker in the next Congress -- because of Ryan's failure to defend Trump.""Given the stakes of this election, If Paul Ryan isn't for Trump, then I'm not for Paul Ryan,"" Bridenstine tweeted.Republican Senator John Thune, who called for Trump to withdraw from the race in a Saturday tweet, says his position has not changed but that he will vote for all Republican candidates on the ticket including Trump.""I intend to support the nominee of our party. But he's got a lot of work to do, I think, if he's going to have any hope of winning this election,"" Thune told KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in an interview that aired late on Tuesday.Thune was among a string of Republican officials and former officials who called on Trump to withdraw from the race over the weekend.

MOSCOW The scandal that erupted in the United States over allegations Russia hacked Democratic Party emails has not been in Moscow's interests and both sides in the U.S. election campaign are just using Russia to score points, Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.The U.S. government on Friday formally accused Russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.And the White House said on Tuesday it would consider a variety of responses to the alleged hacks.""They started this hysteria, saying that this (hacking) is in Russia's interests. But this has nothing to do with Russia's interests,"" President Putin told a business forum in Moscow. Putin said the accusations were a ploy to divert U.S. voters' attention at a time when public opinion was being manipulated.
""Everyone is talking about 'who did it' (the hacking),"" said Putin. ""But is it that important? The most important thing is what is inside this information.""The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday it took a negative view of White House statements about a planned ""proportional"" response to the alleged cyber attacks.
Putin complained that all sides in the U.S. presidential race were misusing rhetoric about Russia for their own ends, but said Moscow would work with whoever won the election ""if, of course, the new U.S. leader wishes to work with our country"".""About a decade ago, they wouldn't mention Russia at all, because it was not even worth talking about, such a third-rate regional power and not interesting at all. Now Russia is problem number one in the entire election campaign,"" said Putin.
""All they do is keep talking about us. Of course it's pleasant for us, but only partly because all participants are misusing anti-Russian rhetoric and poisoning our bilateral relations.""   (Reporting by Katya Golubkova and Alexander Winning; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Andrew Osborn)"

WASHINGTON A U.S. lawmaker urged the Obama administration to suspend cooperation with a Saudi-led coalition conducting airstrikes in Yemen, saying in a letter released on Wednesday that civilian casualties from the strikes ""appear to be the result of war crimes.""Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday, saying the coalition had conducted more than 70 ""unlawful airstrikes"" in Yemen.""It appears that either the Saudi coalition is intentionally targeting civilians or they are not distinguishing between civilians and military targets. Both would be war crimes,"" wrote Lieu, who had taught classes on the law of war when he was a lawyer in the U.S. Air Force. His letter increases pressure on the White House over Yemen after the administration announced Saturday it was reviewing support to the Saudi-led coalition after an air strike killed 140 mourners at a funeral.U.S. arms sales to Riyadh and other support to the coalition should be halted until the White House review is completed, Lieu  wrote.    
Lieu also cited a Reuters article published on Monday, which reported that the Obama administration went ahead with arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite some officials' fears that Washington could be implicated in war crimes for supporting the Saudi-led air campaign.The Saudi-led coalition has said it takes its responsibilities under international humanitarian law seriously, and is committed to the protection of civilians in Yemen.State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement on Wednesday: ""We have received the letter, and are aware of congressional concerns regarding arms sales to Saudi Arabia. We, too, remain gravely concerned by the high toll of the conflict, including civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure caused by all sides of the conflict.""
""Aid and assistance for any country are always under review and subject to modification. We are going to review our position and continue to have further policy discussions,"" Kirby said.Several recent efforts in the U.S. Congress to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia have failed.
But the White House on Saturday announced it was initiating an ""immediate review"" of U.S. support to the Saudi-led coalition  after the apparent coalition air strike on the funeral.Saudi Arabia has said it will investigate the circumstances of that strike.

MOSCOW It is hard to hold a dialogue with the current U.S. administration because it prefers diktat to dialogue, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.Saying that Russia was worried about the worsening of its relations with the United States, Putin said Washington had financed Ukraine's radical opposition and assisted a coup d'etat there. Russia was then forced to protect ethnic Russians living in Ukraine, he told an economic forum.
""There is a need to behave like partners and take each other's interests into account,"" Putin said, referring to U.S.-Russian ties. ""We are ready for that.""

By Stephanie Nebehay
| GENEVA

GENEVA The world will be in danger if Republican nominee Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the top United Nations human rights official said on Wednesday.U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein cited Trump's views on vulnerable communities including minorities and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations, banned under international law, as ""deeply unsettling and disturbing"".""If Donald Trump is elected on the basis of what he has said already - and unless that changes - I think it is without any doubt that he would be dangerous from an international point of view,"" Zeid told a news briefing in Geneva.Trump lashed out at U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other ""disloyal"" Republicans on Tuesday and vowed to campaign in whatever style he wants now that the party establishment has largely abandoned him. This occurred after a 2005 video surfaced last week showing him bragging crudely about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances.
Trump has said he would immediately re-authorize the waterboarding of suspected militants if elected on Nov. 8, contending that ""torture works"". U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, signed an executive order after taking office in January 2009 that banned waterboarding and other ""enhanced interrogation techniques"". Such executive orders can be rescinded by a successor.Zeid said that he would rather not interfere in political campaigns. But when a candidate's comments pointed to a potential use of torture, prohibited under the Convention against Torture, a pact ratified by Washington, or to vulnerable groups possibly losing their basic rights, he had to speak out.
In a speech in The Hague last month, Zeid accused Trump of spreading ""humiliating racial and religious prejudice"" and warned of a rise of populist politics that could turn violent.""I always believe that it's incumbent on leaders to lead and to lead in a way that is ethical and moral,"" Zeid said on Wednesday, when asked about Trump. ""The use of half-truths is a very clever political device. Because as every propagandist knows, you allow the listener to fill in the rest.""
Trump has portrayed himself as tough on national security and promised to build a wall to stop Mexican immigrant ""rapists"" from crossing the border. ""We have to be on guard to see that in the end vulnerable populations, populations at risk do not again see their rights deprived because of a view that is in the ascendancy based on false premises,"" Zeid said.

By John Whitesides and Susan Heavey
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lashed out at U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other ""disloyal"" Republicans on Tuesday and vowed to campaign in whatever style he wants now that the party establishment has largely abandoned him.Trump, in a barrage of stinging Twitter posts, condemned the Republicans who have backed away from his White House run, deepening a dramatic rift in the party over his struggling campaign for the Nov. 8 election.""It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,"" Trump said on Twitter, adding he would engage Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on his own terms.Describing ""disloyal"" Republicans as more difficult than Clinton, he said: ""They come at you from all sides. They don't know how to win - I will teach them!""A string of Republican officials and officeholders have distanced themselves from Trump since a 2005 video surfaced on Friday showing him bragging crudely to a reporter about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances.Despite the turn away from Trump by some elected Republicans, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters, released on Tuesday, found 58 percent of Republicans wanted Trump to stay atop their party's ticket and 68 percent said the Republican leadership should stand by him.The poll, which was conducted after the second presidential debate on Sunday, showed Clinton's lead over Trump widening to 8 points from 5 points last week, before the release of the video. Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, told party lawmakers on Monday he was breaking with Trump and would not campaign for him, all but conceding Clinton would win the presidency. The move angered some Trump supporters, although Ryan said he would not withdraw his endorsement of the New York businessman.Trump slammed Ryan as a ""very weak and ineffective leader"" and complained in another tweet that it was hard to do well with ""zero support"" from Ryan and others. He later said in an interview with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly he neither wanted nor needed Ryan's support.Ryan's spokesman, Brendan Buck, said on Tuesday that the speaker ""is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same.""
Trump also took aim at U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, who said on Saturday that he could not vote for Trump.""The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks,"" Trump said. There was no immediate reaction from McCain, who secured his primary election win in August. Many Republicans worry that Trump's chaotic campaign could hurt their chances of holding majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in next month's election, and will inflict long-term damage on the party.PARTY REVOLT

In an extraordinary party revolt, nearly half of all 331 incumbent Republican senators, House members and governors have condemned Trump's lewd remarks on the video, and roughly one in 10 has called for him to drop out of the race, a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage indicates.Unlike Ryan, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told RNC members on Monday that the committee, the party's leadership and fundraising arm, still backed Trump, two RNC members told Reuters. Trump's vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also reinforced his support in television interviews on Monday.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former 2016 Republican presidential contender who has became a close ally of Trump, also reaffirmed his backing, although he called Trump's comments in the 2005 video ""completely indefensible."" Trump, 70, who has portrayed himself as tough on national security, released a hard-hitting television advertisement on Tuesday featuring footage of Clinton, a 68-year-old former secretary of state, stumbling last month after leaving a service commemorating the Sept. 11 attacks. Her campaign said she had been diagnosed a few days earlier with pneumonia.
""Hillary Clinton doesn't have the fortitude, strength or stamina to lead in our world,"" the ad's narrator says. ""She failed as secretary of state. Don't let her fail us again.""'INSULTED EVERYONE'
Both Trump and Clinton headed to the key battleground state of Florida on Tuesday.Before her Florida rally with former Vice President Al Gore, Clinton told a Miami radio station that Trump had ""insulted everyone.""""People need to understand what's at stake in this election,"" she told WMBM.The White House said on Tuesday that Trump's remarks about groping women in the video amounted to sexual assault. President Barack Obama said Trump's remarks would disqualify him from a job at a convenience store, and should disqualify him from becoming president. Clinton, the first woman to be picked as a presidential nominee by a major U.S. party, tried to focus on Tuesday on issues that could win over undecided women voters, proposing to expand the child tax credit so that more low-income families can benefit and to increase by $1,000 a year the tax credit available to families for each child up to age 4.

MIAMI, Fla. Hillary Clinton recruited Al Gore, the former vice president in her husband's administration, to raise the specter of Gore's loss to former President George W. Bush in the contentious 2000 U.S. election to urge voters to go to the polls next month.""Take it from me,"" Gore told a crowd of several hundred Clinton supporters at a campaign event in a college gymnasium. ""Every single vote counts. Every single vote counts.""As he campaigned for Clinton at Miami Dade College ahead of the Nov. 8 election that pits her against Republican nominee Donald Trump, Gore reminded voters of the Florida recount saga 16 years ago. Bush was declared the winner in the state by a mere 537 votes after the intervention of the U.S. Supreme Court.""Your vote really, really, really counts,"" Gore said. ""You can consider me as an exhibit A of that. For those of you who are younger than 25 you might not remember the election of 2000 and what happened here in Florida. For those of you older than 25, I heard you murmuring just now, but take it from me it was a very close election.""A chant grew out of the crowd: ""You won! You won!""
Gore, who served as vice president under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, also sought to put a spotlight on the fight against climate change, which has long been his signature issue.""When it comes to the most urgent issue facing our country and the world the choice in this election is extremely clear: Hillary Clinton will make solving the climate crisis a top national priority,"" Gore said. ""Her opponent, based on the ideas he has presented, would take us toward a climate catastrophe.""
Clinton highlighted comments from her rival Donald Trump expressing skepticism about climate change.In 2012, he said on his Twitter account that the ""concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese"" in order to benefit its manufacturing sector. 
""We cannot put a climate denier in the White House, at all,"" she said. ""We need a president who believes in science."" (Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)"
