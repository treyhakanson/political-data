Puppets resembling U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump squared off in New York City on Monday a few hours before the real candidates were due to engage in their first debate.The puppets took questions from a human moderator on such topics as climate change and women's rights. The event was performed by cast members of Avenue Q, a Broadway musical starring people and puppets.""It's a hoax. It's hoax. It's fake. It's fake. You've got Bill Nye the science guy, and Neil deGrasse Mike Tyson saying whatever they want,"" puppet Trump said about climate change, referring to television presenter Nye and a mash-up of astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and the former boxer Mike Tyson. ""We all know the sun is going to crash into the Earth. We know it's fine. It's huge. It's huge,"" the Trump puppet added. 
When asked for their impressions of each other after their first debate, puppet Clinton said, ""I expected him to be crass and rude, and he delivered. So I guess he delivered on his promise.""
Puppet Trump said puppet Clinton ""is a two, a three on a good day.""The real Clinton and Trump are scheduled to face off for the first time in a debate on Monday night, six weeks before the Nov. 8 election.

MEXICO CITY Mexicans favor U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump by a 10-1 ratio, according to a poll.The poll, conducted by Consulta Mitofsky and released last week, showed that 2.9 percent of Mexicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, compared to 30.4 percent for Clinton. The poll comes almost a month after a meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City sparked outrage across the country and led to the resignation of Luis Videgaray as finance minister.Roy Campos, director of the Mitofsky polling firm, said Mexican interest in the U.S. presidential election signified a change from years past. 
""While in the election of 2008 the interest awakened by [Democratic President Barack] Obama was based on approval ... now the interest is because of fear,"" Campos said, adding that Trump is the least popular U.S. presidential candidate among Mexicans in history.
When he announced his candidacy last year, Trump said Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States and that he would build a wall on the southern U.S. border and make Mexico pay for it. He also has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Mexico, deport millions of migrants and ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement.The poll, which was conducted between Sept. 2 and 5, surveyed 1,000 Mexicans and had a margin of error of 3.1 percent.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate will vote on Wednesday on whether to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill allowing relatives of victims in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia.The vote, which Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell set as the chamber reconvened on Monday, would be the first action in an attempt by lawmakers to override Obama's Sept. 23 veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.A successful override requires support from two-thirds of lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Representatives, which are controlled by Republicans.Known as JASTA, the legislation passed the Senate and House in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government.
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.
In vetoing the bill, Obama warned that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, members of the military or companies, even for actions of foreign organizations that had received U.S. aid, equipment or training.McConnell said Wednesday's vote will follow two hours of debate divided between Republicans and Democrats. No time for the vote has been set.

By Maurice Tamman
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton has pulled ahead of Republican rival Donald Trump in the traditional battleground state of Florida, strengthening her position in the race for the White House, the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project showed ahead of the pair's first presidential debate on Monday night.If the election were held on Monday, Clinton would lead Trump in the Electoral College by 259 to 191, with an 88 percent chance of reaching the 270 needed to win, according to the project's results.The project, based on a weekly online tracking poll of more than 15,000 Americans, estimates state-by-state results that will drive the voting in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president.The results marked the first upward swing in the project for Clinton in several weeks. The last release of the poll, on Sept. 16, gave her a 61 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 14 Electoral College votes. The big difference now is that Florida, with its 29 Electoral College votes, favors Clinton 49 percentage points to Trump's 45 points, the results showed.
Trump has also lost ground in New Mexico, where he trails 47 points to 38 points. Colorado and Nevada, which had leaned toward Trump, are now too close to call. Together, those states represent another 20 Electoral College votes. Clinton lost ground in Oregon and Wisconsin, which are also too close to call. They amount to 17 votes combined.As many as 100 million viewers have been estimated for Monday evening's debate at Hofstra University in New York state's Long Island, which will begin at 9 p.m. 
Whether that high interest translates into a higher turnout on Election Day on Nov. 8 remains to be seen. A higher turnout would likely benefit Clinton, while the opposite would benefit Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, whose latest estimate is for a moderate turnout.Trump's easiest path to victory would depend on a surge in turnout among white Republicans and lower-than-expected turnout among minority Democrats, according to the project. In that scenario, several Clinton-leaning states could flip. Florida, for example, would be a tossup, while Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina would lean toward the Republican. 
The States of the Nation results came as Clinton's standing in national opinion polls have seen a small bounce in recent days. A separate Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Friday, for example, had her ahead by four points, up from a near tie two weeks ago.  (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Richard Chang)"

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK (This story corrects sixth paragraph to say Matt Schlapp was White House political director, not deputy.)Dozens of former appointees of the administration of former President George W. Bush announced their support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday in a bid for party unity ahead of Trump's first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton.The Bush family and many connected to it remain cool to Trump. Former President George H.W. Bush reportedly plans to vote for Clinton in the Nov. 8 election while his Jeb, a former Trump rival, has said he will not vote for Clinton or Trump. George W. Bush has avoided the presidential race while helping raise money for Republican congressional candidates.But a number of former Bush appointees have decided to endorse Trump, the New York businessman who is in a tight race with Clinton and is to debate her one-one-one at Hofstra University on Monday night in Hempstead, New York.
Fifty former Bush appointees were on a list of people described as founding members of a coalition of Bush alumni supportive of Trump. The list was provided by a Republican official close to the Trump campaign.The list included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, former Treasury Secretary John Snow and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.
The list also included former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi and former White House political director Matt Schlapp, who is chairman of the American Conservative Union.Thompson, in a statement, explained his decision to be on the list.
""Americans want to trust our leaders again, to know that they are fighting for everyday Americans by creating jobs, growing our economy, defending our nation from terrorism, and respecting the voters enough to be straight-forward and honest with them,"" Thompson said.Trump has struggled to rally many in the Republican Party behind him. On Friday, he received the endorsement of former rival Ted Cruz, but many establishment figures remain skeptical about him, such as Ohio Governor John Kasich.

By Steve Holland
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump picked up the endorsement on Monday of the union representing 5,000 federal immigration officers, a boost of support for his immigration policy ahead of his first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton.Trump has laid out a hardline position on illegal immigration, proposing to build a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico and take other steps to crack down on the flow of undocumented people crossing into the United States.With immigration likely to be discussed at the debate, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a union representing 5,000 federal immigration officers and law enforcement support staff, announced it would support Trump, in what was described as its first endorsement of a candidate for elected office.
The union's president, Chris Crane, outlined in a statement why his group is backing Trump, saying his union members are ""the last line of defense for American communities"" and that his members ""are prevented from enforcing the most basic immigration laws.""
A CNN/ORC poll released on Sept. 7 said that among registered voters, 49 percent said they trusted Clinton to handle immigration, a slight advantage over Trump, who was at 47 percent. Crane said the endorsement was conducted by a vote of the union's membership and that Clinton received only 5 percent of the vote.

By David Ljunggren
| OTTAWA

OTTAWA Canadian diplomats are fanning out across the United States to talk up the benefits of trade with state and local leaders and counter what senior officials see as a worrying mood of protectionism swirling through the U.S. election campaign.Amid voter anger about the supposed harm done by international trade deals, both Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton have talked about altering the three-nation North American Free Trade Agreement. That could have calamitous results for Canada, which sends 75 percent of all its exports to the United States.From trade forums in Kentucky, California and Illinois addressing state legislators and small-business owners to meetings with mayors, labor unions and interest groups, a team of diplomats has gone coast to coast to explain how important Canada is as a trading partner.The diplomatic offensive comes amid concerns in Ottawa about both candidates, who opinion show are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 election.Trump has talked about renegotiating the NAFTA treaty with Canada and Mexico to secure more favorable terms for the United States. But he has also said he would revive TransCanada Corp's cross-border Keystone XL pipeline project, which Democratic President Barack Obama's administration blocked over environment concerns. Clinton has said she opposes Keystone XL.Current and former government officials in Ottawa said a Clinton presidency posed its own challenges for Canada.They see the Democrat as tough on trade and more hawkish than Democratic President Barack Obama, who quickly struck up a warm relationship with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. While tough talk on trade has occurred in previous U.S. election campaigns, ""there is an undercurrent and a mood here which is concerning me,"" said David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to Washington.A Clinton campaign representative declined to comment when asked about her approach to Canada if she were elected. Trump's campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.MacNaughton, who took up the job in March, has already visited Denver, Colorado Springs and Boston and plans trips to Massachusetts, Michigan and California next month.
An embassy spokeswoman said diplomats were intensifying their outreach effort and doing more events than usual. At every meeting, they hand out tip sheets showing Canada is the top export destination for 35 U.S. states and that 9 million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Canada.'PRETTY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS'
Trudeau will not say which candidate he favors, stressing he is happy to work with whomever U.S. voters elect. But his center-left Liberals have more policies in common with U.S. Democrats. Elected last October, he and Obama have become close, exchanging visits to each other's countries. ""Some of the issues that we are going to be facing will be very much the same regardless of who wins. ... I think we have to prepare to deal with some pretty difficult situations on the trade front,"" said MacNaughton, adding that some Americans had little idea about the size of the U.S. trading relationship with Canada.
Roland Paris, who served as Trudeau's foreign policy adviser until late June, said Trump had tapped into some very strong anti-trade sentiment.""Those feelings aren't going away any time soon ... we may be heading into some protectionist headwinds, even with a Hillary Clinton presidency,"" he said. Trump and Clinton also oppose a proposed Pacific trade deal that could benefit Canada. One person with day-to-day knowledge of the U.S.-Canada trade file also predicted strains over Canadian exports of softwood lumber, as well as Canada's system of protection for its dairy industry, which U.S. producers strongly dislike.MILITARY SPENDING

Another potential area for concern is Canada's defense spending, which is 0.98 percent of gross domestic product, far below the 2 percent commitment agreed on by NATO members.MacNaughton said that in his talks with Republicans and Democrats, both had raised the issue of ""U.S. allies stepping up to the plate"" in military terms.Trump stirred concerns among allies and even some Republicans earlier this year by saying he would decide whether to come to the aid of Baltic NATO allies in the event of Russian aggression only after reviewing if they ""have fulfilled their obligations to us.""Former Canadian diplomat Colin Robertson, who had several postings in the United States, also predicted hard discussions with Clinton administration officials over defense.""We will be circled because we are at 0.98 percent,"" said Robertson, vice president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.That may not sit well with Trudeau's government, which is pledging to run large budget deficits for at least the next five years to fund investment in infrastructure and social programs.A government source said Canada had taken part in a number of high-profile NATO missions and was ready to push back on demands to increase spending in the military.""We're quite prepared and proud to stand up on our record and explain why there might be a discrepancy between numbers ... and our actual contribution,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the topic.

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Half of America's likely voters will rely on the presidential debates to help them make their choice between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday.The results show the stakes for the White House rivals as they prepare to face off on Monday at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, for their first of three one-on-one debates, a prime-time TV spectacle expected to draw a Super Bowl-sized audience of 100 million Americans.Some 50 percent of likely voters think the debates will help inform their decision of whom to support, including 10 percent who say they are not currently leaning either way, according to the opinion poll. Some 39 percent said the debates will not help, and 11 percent said they did not know how the debates would affect them.In a strong signal that most viewers will also be hoping the debates bring clarity, some 72 percent of respondents said they want to see moderators point out when a candidate says something that is untrue. That included 73 percent of people who identified themselves as Trump supporters and 82 percent of those who said they back Clinton, according to the results.""It helps the audience, particularly me, to recognize what's bull crap and what's real,"" said Harvey Leven, 63, a teacher from Farmington Hills, Michigan. ""It's easy for the candidates to quote a statistic and people accept it.""
Clinton currently leads in most national polls and holds critical advantages in key swing states like Ohio and North Carolina. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll finds Clinton leading Trump nationally by 4 percentage points.Clinton had seen her popularity dip in recent weeks after more questions arose about her family foundation and the use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.     

""NO"" TO NAME-CALLING 
Many voters are hoping to see a relatively civilized debate, after months of mutual attacks between Trump and Clinton on the campaign trail. Trump has called for Clinton to be jailed for her handling of emails as America's top diplomat. Clinton has accused Trump of racism and of being temperamentally unfit for the Oval Office.Of those polled, 61 percent said they are not interested in those kinds of attacks.
""Quit picking on each other,"" said Lisa Miller, 48, of St. Louis, Missouri. ""This isn't a playground. Grow up and talk about your plan."" A plurality of likely voters want to hear both Clinton and Trump talk about jobs and the economy, the poll found. ""I'll tell you with Donald Trump I want to see that he has rational answers to questions without name calling,"" said Leven. ""I want to try to get beyond the political hocus pocus that both of them are doing and try to see who they really are.""The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 2,124 American adults, including 1,337 people who were deemed to be likely voters due to their voting history, registration status and stated intention to show up on Election Day. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for all respondents and 3 percentage points for likely voters.

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if elected, the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the campaign said, marking a potential dramatic shift in U.S. policy. During the meeting that lasted more than an hour at Trump Tower in New York, Trump told Netanyahu that under his administration, the United States would ""recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel.""While Israel calls Jerusalem its capital, few other countries accept that, including the United States. Most nations maintain embassies in Tel Aviv. Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in a 1967 war, as capital of the state they aim to establish alongside Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Netanyahu held a separate meeting later on Sunday that lasted just under an hour with Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump's rival in the Nov. 8 U.S. election.Clinton emphasized her commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship and her plan to take the relationship to the next level, according to a statement from her campaign.She also talked about her commitment to a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict ""that guarantees Israel's future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity,"" according to the statement.
""Secretary Clinton reaffirmed her opposition to any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council,"" the statement said.During the meeting with Trump, the Republican candidate's campaign said he agreed with Netanyahu that peace in the Middle East could only be achieved when ""the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State."" 
The Trump campaign said he and Netanyahu discussed ""at length"" Israel's border fence, cited by Trump in reference to his own controversial immigration policies, which include building a wall on the U.S.- Mexico border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country.Other regional issues, including the fight against Islamic State, U.S. military assistance to Israel - ""an excellent investment"" - and the Iran nuclear deal, which both parties have criticized, were also discussed.

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton will press Republican Donald Trump to provide more specifics on his policies in their presidential debate on Monday, two top Clinton campaign aides said ahead of a face-off that could set U.S. television audience records.    On the eve of the debate at Hofstra University in suburban New York, aides to Clinton have sought to cast Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV host, as lacking the temperament and experience to serve as president.Trump's aides for their part have sought to reinforce voter doubts about Clinton's trustworthiness.The debate, the first of three face-to-face matchups between the two candidates, will begin at 9 p.m. on Monday (0100 GMT on Tuesday). It comes as opinion polls show a tight race between Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Trump, six weeks before the Nov. 8 election.""We're going to have a lot of people really tuning into this election for the first time. They're going to see these two candidates onstage,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said on Sunday in an interview with ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think they're going to see that Donald Trump is unfit, unprepared, and over his head. I doubt he will have a command of the issues.""Mook said Clinton would challenge Trump at the debate ""to reveal what his plans are. You know, for example, he has not revealed any plan whatsoever to defeat ISIS (Islamic State) militants.""Trump has said he would work closely with NATO allies to defeat Islamic State and vowed to wage a ""military, cyber and financial"" war against the militant group.""Donald Trump's been all about himself. But she's got to tell people what she wants to do for them,"" John Podesta, chairman of Clinton's campaign, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.
Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, in a separate ""This Week"" interview on Sunday, attacked Clinton's trustworthiness.""You know, if you're running against a Clinton, veracity is certainly always on the table,"" she said. ""Hillary Clinton's casual relationship with the truth is well known to Americans. I'm sure we'll see it on full display tomorrow night.""MANAGING EXPECTATIONS

The Trump campaign put to rest on Sunday the prospect that he might invite Gennifer Flowers, who had an affair with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, to attend the debate.After Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, a Clinton supporter and vociferous critic of Trump, tweeted that he had a ""front-row"" seat to watch the Hofstra debate, Trump raised the possibility in a tweet of inviting Flowers to the debate.But Mike Pence, Trump's running mate, told ""Fox News Sunday"" that Flowers would not attend the debate.""Donald Trump was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by Hillary Clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from what the American people are going to be focused on tomorrow night, which is on the issues, on the choice that we face,"" Pence said.
Supporters of both candidates sought to manage expectations before the debate.Mook said the moderator of Monday's debate, NBC News anchor Lester Holt, should fact-check candidates' statements, although Trump's campaign said it should be up to American voters to gauge who they thought was telling the truth.To prepare for the debate, Clinton has been holding mock debate sessions where longtime aide Philippe Reines plays the role of Trump.Trump aides said their candidate, who like Clinton participated in numerous TV debates during their respective parties' nominating races, was preparing for Monday's event but not doing mock debates where someone plays the role of Clinton.Trump's advisers said the Republican presidential nominee was going up against a highly seasoned politician.""He's the outsider, he's a person who has never run before, let alone be in a presidential debate, but he's going to be ready,"" said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. ""And I think one of the things Donald Trump has going for him is he's got very good instincts."" (Additional reporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by Caren Bohan and Peter Cooney)"
