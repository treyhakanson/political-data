By Amanda Becker
| CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio

CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump on Sunday of scapegoating the parents of a Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, after the Republican nominee took issue with remarks the soldier's father made at the Democratic National Convention.Trump, in an ABC interview that aired on Sunday, questioned why Ghazala Khan, mother of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, stood quietly by her husband, Khizr Khan, as he took the stage at last week's Democratic convention in Philadelphia.Trump suggested the mother might not have been ""allowed"" to speak.Speaking at a church service, Clinton said Trump had been insulting to a family who had sacrificed so much. She also used the episode to contrast her own religious faith with that of Trump, who has spoken of religion on the campaign trail infrequently.""I don't begrudge anyone of any other faith or of no faith at all, but I do tremble before those who would scapegoat other Americans, who would insult people because of their religion, their ethnicity, their disability,"" Clinton said in remarks at the Imani Temple Ministries, an African-American church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. ""It's just not how I was raised, that's not how I was taught in my church,"" said Clinton, who grew up as a Methodist. ""Tim Kaine and I are people of faith,"" she said, referring to her vice presidential running mate, who is a Catholic.Top Republican lawmakers House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also condemned Trump's remarks in separate statements, although they did not mention their presidential candidate by name.""Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example,"" Ryan said.
""His sacrifice - and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan - should always be honored. Period."" he said.Earlier on Sunday, Ghazala Khan took up her own defense in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, saying her husband had asked her in advance whether she would want to speak at the convention but that she had decided she would be unable to do so on stage because of her pain over the 2004 death of her son.""Donald Trump said that maybe I wasn't allowed to say anything. That is not true,"" she wrote. ""When Donald Trump is talking about Islam, he is ignorant.""In a statement issued on Sunday evening by the Trump campaign, Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, said that he and the Republican nominee ""believe that Captain Humayun Khan is an American hero"" that his family, like other families of fallen soldiers, ""should be cherished by every American.""
But Pence added that Captain Khan had died defending the country against terrorism and that Trump's policies would reduce the likelihood that other families would face the kind of heartbreak the Khans had.Khizr Khan, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin and a Muslim, spoke about his war hero son at the Democratic convention and took issue with Trump's call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States.Khizr Khan invited the Republican nominee to read the U.S. Constitution and visit the graves of American soldiers from many backgrounds at Arlington National Cemetery.In the interview aired on Sunday morning on ABC's ""This Week,"" Trump cast doubt on why Khan's wife did not speak.
""She was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably, maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. You tell me,"" Trump said.Trump on Sunday tweeted that Khan's son had died 12 years ago: ""Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!"" Trump also tweeted that he had been ""viciously attacked"" by Khan at the convention. ""Am I not allowed to respond?"" he asked. The candidate also tried to change the subject to the war itself: ""Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!""On Twitter, Republican strategist Ana Navarro called Trump's comments about the Khans ""gross"" and labeled him a ""jerk.""Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said he sympathizes with the Khan family but that their loss is not the issue at hand.""The issue really is radical Islamic jihad and the risk to the American homeland,"" he said on CBS, defending Trump's proposal to suspend immigration from some geographic regions.

By Michelle Conlin
| COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. The billionaire industrialist Koch brothers rejected pressure over the weekend from dozens of big donors in their sprawling political network to back U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying that their money was better spent trying to influence congressional races.The rejection deprives Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously run for elected office, of a major source of fundraising and reflects how his unorthodox White House bid has sparked some disarray among fundraisers who would normally be squarely behind a Republican nominee.The Kochs, with a nearly $300 million political warchest,  have earned a reputation as powerful allies in Republican politics. Charles Koch, the dominant player in his political partnership with brother David Koch, told attendees at a bi-annual donor retreat at a luxury resort in Colorado Springs, Colorado: ""At this point, I can't support either candidate"" for the White House. He said network's mandate was to shore up ""the country's financial future and eliminate corporate welfare,"" a reference to government subsidies provided to some industries.""But since it appears that neither presidential candidate is likely to support us in these efforts, we are focused on maximizing the number of principled leaders in the House and Senate who will,"" he said. Trump's protectionist stances and pledges to review free trade agreements and to get tough on immigration have clashed with the Kochs' free-market political philosophy. Charles Koch has described as a ""a blood libel"" the idea he would instead support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election.
A group of wealthy Republican donors, who paid the minimum $100,000 per year to be members of the 700-strong Koch network, had been urging the brothers to step off the sidelines of the election and back Trump.SEEKING FUTURE INFLUENCE
The donors argued that if Trump is elected, the Koch network would want to have influence on his emerging policies and cabinet picks, and to have access to a Trump administration.
Over cocktails on the patio overlooking the Rocky Mountains, in private meetings and on text message threads, some donors voiced their concern that if the Kochs alienate Trump, ""it could hurt us down the road.""  Some suggested that some donors could leave the Koch network over the decision not to back Trump. Oil magnate Harold Hamm, a leading candidate to serve as Trump's energy secretary, did not attend the weekend gathering.Other donors who had been at the forefront of a movement to urge the Kochs to get on board with Trump, like billionaire broadcasting magnate Stanley Hubbard, said that in a private meeting with Charles, they had now been convinced that the Kochs were ""doing the right thing.""  
Trump has shown no hesitation in spurning the Kochs.On Friday, he tweeted that he had turned down an invitation to meet with the brothers. Koch insiders quickly disputed that characterization, saying an invite was never extended.      Nonetheless, the Koch brothers also did not act to stop Trump from beating 16 presidential rivals and winning the party nomination. During the primary contests, many Koch donors were urging the brothers to perform a ""Trump Intervention,"" whereby the brothers would leverage their political operation to support Trump's rivals. The Kochs refused.Trump officially accepted the Republican nomination in Cleveland last month, with a speech that painted a bleak picture of rising crime at home and increasing threats from overseas.The top Koch official on criminal justice reform, Mark Holden, said the speech was inaccurate. ""We are safer (now),"" he said. (Reporting by Michelle Conlin; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Frances Kerry)"

By Gina Cherelus

A war of words between Donald Trump and the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier killed in Iraq in 2004 is dominating the election campaign. Khizr and Ghazala Khan were criticized by the Republican presidential candidate after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention last Thursday and shared the story of their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan.The Khans are what is known in the United States as a ""Gold Star Family,"" meaning they have lost an immediate relative in a military action. The gold star refers to the centerpiece of flags given to these families.On Monday, more than 20 Gold Star Families wrote to Trump condemning his treatment of the couple, saying he was ""cheapening the sacrifice"" of soldiers who have died and demanding that he apologize to the Khans.  The following are some facts about Gold Star Families:* What are Gold Star Families? Gold Star Families have lost a member of their immediate family in a war or other conflict while serving with the U.S. military. The military awards each family an official flag bearing a gold star or a lapel pin with a gold star on a purple background. 
Called a service flag, families with relatives on active duty display a flag with a blue star.  * History of Gold Star FamiliesGrace Seibold, whose son was killed in Europe in 1918 during World War One, founded a group that came to be known as American Gold Star Mothers for women who lost sons in the war. In the same year, President Woodrow Wilson approved a suggestion to let U.S. women wear a gold gilt star on a traditional black mourning arm band signifying their loss.
In 1936, the United States began observing Gold Star Mothers Day on the last Sunday of September. An organization called The Gold Star Wives was formed before the end of World War Two, and the Gold Star Lapel Button was created in 1947. The term Gold Star Families was widely used after World War Two.* Different Service FlagsA blue star signifies a relative serving in the military while a gold star means a family member has died in service. During World War One, relatives of active duty service members flew service flags bearing a blue star. As the gold star tradition took hold, families covered the blue star with a gold one to symbolize their loss. These flags were often hung in windows. 
* How many Gold Star Families are there?The National Gold Star Family Registry notes on its website that 472,045 fallen service members have been registered by relatives. here * Which families wrote to Trump? Monday's letter to Trump was signed by relatives of U.S. service members killed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and Korea.  (Reporting by Gina Cherelus; Editing by Daniel Wallis, Toni Reinhold)"

By James Oliphant

MIDDLETOWN, CONN. - Two years ago, Judy Konopka and Craig Diangelo lost their jobs in the IT department of what was then known as Northeast Utilities, a regional electricity provider, when the company decided to replace about 220 employees with guest workers from India. In order to receive a more lucrative separation package, they had to train their foreign replacements both here and overseas.Both had trouble finding new work. Konopka, 56, is still looking. Diangelo, 64, is working as a contractor for a company that provides no benefits, making substantially less than he did before. He views himself as a victim of globalization, a casualty of offshoring--and he credits Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has cast himself as the champion of displaced and disaffected U.S. workers, for bringing the issue to light.""I'll vote for him,"" says Diangelo, over dinner at a Thai restaurant on this town's Main Street. Two others at the table murmur in assent.He continues, his voice rising: ""I wasn't planning on retiring early. I wasn't planning on making $35,000 less. I've had to cut back a lot. I basically live paycheck to paycheck.""""I could never vote for Hillary Clinton,"" Diangelo says, citing Clinton's support of the North American Free Trade Agreement, passed while her husband, Bill, was president, as well as her advocacy of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact that's still being negotiated by the Obama administration. (Challenged by Bernie Sanders, Clinton has since retracted her support of TPP.) Even Konopka, who favors Clinton (she calls Trump ""the biggest idiot""), has to admit Clinton's support of trade deals such as NAFTA gives her pause. When Northeast Utilities fired her after 21 years, ""I felt betrayed."" Konopka took advantage of a federal trade assistance program to improve her skills in web design, then discovered she couldn't compete with designers outside the country who were willing to work for much less. Now, to get by, she sells vintage books on the web. ""It's starting to get really scary,"" she says.This presidential election is, purportedly, the Year of the Angry Voter, with images of scuffles at Trump rallies occupying cable-news screens. But as befitting someone who lives in a place called Middletown, Konopka is more typical of voters: consumed by a stomach-churning uncertainty, a vague sense of something lost, and an inescapable belief that an array of powerful forces--corporations, politicians, government--aren't looking out for them.Economists and pundits have been struggling to explain why, with unemployment below 5 percent and a bounty of positive economic indicators, voters seem so dismayed, so distrustful. It might be something as simple as bargaining power.In his best-known book, The Art of the Deal, Trump advises every negotiator to ""use your leverage."" But increasingly, U.S. workers, white-and blue-collar alike, feel they have none. They've seen their power erode as they are tossed into a global labor pool, as companies consolidate and shed jobs to please Wall Street, as unions wither, state budgets tighten, technology advances and iconic brands such as Nabisco pack up and move to Mexico.The squeeze is on.""There's a feeling among workers that not only are they replaceable, but that they will be replaced,"" says Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in nearby Worcester, Massachusetts. ""That there is no security anymore, that someone is making a profit by letting them go.""""Trump,"" he adds, ""has tapped into that very well.""According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, 71 percent of Trump supporters either have had to take a lower-paying job in the last few years, have a family member who has had to do so, or have a family member whose home has been threatened by foreclosure. In a sign of how widespread the phenomenon has become, 63 percent of Clinton supporters reported the same dismal tally.""People feel more insecure about trade than terrorism,"" Chaison tells me. ""Everyone knows someone who has lost their job.""What bothers Diangelo most is that he was let go by a company that still valued his skill--just not him. ""The sad part is that my job is still there,"" he says. ""It didn't go away. I went away."" CANDIDATES IN HARD HATS
None of this should feel particularly new. The United States has been bleeding middle-class workers--especially in the industrial and manufacturing sectors--as long as Bruce Springsteen has been around to sing about it. Candidates adorned with hard hats vowing to bring back factory jobs have become a set-piece of modern politics.The United States has lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the past 15 years as the trade deficit has mushroomed, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington. Wage growth in almost all sectors has flatlined over that time, including for the bottom 70 percent of fouryear college graduates--and growth overall has been anemic, at under 2 percent. And while the 9 million jobs vaporized in the flash of the Great Recession have been recovered, the majority of them are of lesser quality than the ones they replaced.Perhaps most fundamentally, the relationship between employee and employer has shifted. Workers' share of the pie has decreased substantially since the 1970s, when the country's corporate and industrial base began to erode. Last year, workers' share dropped to 75.5 percent of corporate income, even as technology has made workforces more productive and efficient. U.S. corporate profits, meantime, returned to pre-recession levels in 2012. Workers ""sense that the recovery is only partial. It helps employers more than it helps workers,"" Chaison says.If workers' sense of slippage seems familiar, the way their discontent is rippling through our politics feels newly transformative. Voters threw out the Republicans running Congress in 2006, then two years later elected the first African-American president, an outsider who vowed reform. Souring on him, they replaced Democrats then controlling Congress with another set of Republicans in 2010 and 2014, making governance as unstable as the business sector. In a period of war, terrorism and economic chaos, all that churn might best be viewed as a deeply frustrated electorate trying to use what little leverage they have to change a system they consider to be otherwise unaccountable.Trump has been the main beneficiary of that frustration. He makes those in the crowd feel like they matter, that they finally have a bully of their own who can push back at what they view as an alliance of unprincipled corporate culture and an enabling government. ""You're looking at a situation where the jobs are being ripped out of our states, out of our country, like candy from a baby,"" Trump said at a rally this spring.It has been Trump, along with Democrat Sanders, who has pushed the issue of job losses to countries such as China, Mexico and India to the forefront. Trump has threatened to slap a tax on imports and tear up trade deals. In Indiana earlier this year, he ripped air conditioner manufacturer Carrier for announcing it would lay off 2,100 workers and move its operations to Mexico. He gave Nabisco the same treatment, pledging he would no longer eat Oreos. He has slammed companies such as Apple and Boeing for their overseas operations, as well.Few presidential candidates have such temerity to challenge well-known American brands, but clearly it is resonating. ""They might not like everything he says, but they believe he says what he thinks,"" Lewis Gossett, president of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance, told me last summer. ""I think we're repeating a time in history when the very rich are removed from the very poor."" 
'TWO TYPES OF CEO MINDSETS'Michael Smith is one of the Americans Trump rallies for. Smith was among 600 Nabisco employees laid off at the bakery on Chicago's South Side earlier this year, after the company announced it was transferring some work to Mexico. He got the news at 3 a.m. ""It was,"" Smith tells me, ""a dark night when all your livelihood passes in front of you, and you feel like you've been given the royal shaft.""Smith operated the machines that wrapped Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers. With overtime, he could clear $85,000 a year. He's 59 and wasn't thinking he would have to re-enter the job market.The day before, Smith had shown up at a shareholders meeting in Chicago to confront Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Mondelez International, the holding company that oversees the Nabisco brand, about the move to Mexico. While sympathetic, Rosenfeld said it was her duty to maximize the corporation's value to its shareholders worldwide by cutting costs.""There are two types of CEO mindsets,"" Smith responded, ""those who care about shareholders and those who care about the shareholders and the people.""In our conversation, Smith didn't begrudge the company's legal right to relocate the jobs, but he questions a CEO who earned more than $40 million in compensation over the last two years exhorting the virtues of cost-cutting to a room full of laid-off blue-collar workers. ""That's not good citizenship,"" he says. ""Wealth comes from the workers. That profitability comes from us.""Clinton met with a small group of the Nabisco workers in March, the day before the Illinois primary. But the visit didn't leave Smith with much hope that as president she could do much either for the workers' situation or to reverse the demands of a globalized economy. In part, that's due to Clinton's support of NAFTA, which Smith terms an ""infection,"" but also because of the lobbying might of Mondelez, a $30 billion company, and other big corporations.Smith is the unusual American voter who says he hasn't decided between Clinton and Trump. He'll focus on the election later. First, he has to keep his household afloat and his daughter in school at Columbia College in Chicago. He has six months' salary to cushion him.He's trying to stay optimistic about finding work, saying his wife and daughter are counting on him. But, he concedes, ""I think I have been a little bit in denial. Even people of faith have bouts of depression."" PINK SLIPS
Angela Valero gives a one-word reply when I ask her about a potential Clinton-Trump matchup: ""Ugh."" I might as well be asking about who's going to win the next regatta on Mars, so far is the election from her daily concerns.
Valero's dream job was to be a corrections officer. She was finally hired on by the state of Connecticut last fall. The single mother of an 8-year-old girl thought that, at last, she had a reliable, stable position with benefits.But after completing an academy training course and being posted as a guard at the state maximum-security facility in nearby Uncasville, she found out this spring that she was being laid off, a consequence of a decision made by Connecticut's Democratic governor, Dannel Malloy, and the state legislature to not raise taxes on the wealthy to cover a budget shortfall. Lawmakers worried that the state's richest residents would relocate to Florida, which has no state income tax, or other states with lower taxes.During the downturn, Connecticut lost a bevy of high-paying jobs in the financial services sector in the corporate hub of Stamford and elsewhere. The jobs created during the recovery were less lucrative, resulting in lower tax revenue. In addition, the state was spooked when General Electric, responding to an effort by the legislature to raise business taxes, announced it was relocating its headquarters from Fairfield to Boston. Aetna, the health insurer based in Hartford, also threatened to leave the state.That shelved any notion of new taxes. The state looked to trim its public workforce instead. ""Easy targets,"" says Lori Pelletier, president of the state AFL-CIO.Rape counselors, child-service workers, prison guards began receiving pink slips. Ultimately, 2,500 or more state workers could be let go. Pelletier contrasted that with the 200 jobs GE is moving to Boston--something that drew substantial media attention.The state of Massachusetts and the city of Boston helped recruit GE with a generous benefit package, including $25 million in property tax relief for a corporation that critics have long held pays little in U.S. taxes. ""Angela last year paid more taxes than GE,"" Pelletier says. ""And she's the one losing her job.""Valero tells me she has little faith that anyone in Washington can help her. She doesn't sleep more than four hours a night, kept up by worrying about paying the electric bill and keeping her house. She has no idea whether she'll ever be recalled to work.Throughout the interview, she stays stoic, determined, like the corrections office she was trained to be. Only at the end of our conversation does she slip a bit. ""I held back the tears,"" she says with relief. CULLING AND CUTTING
Ron Ozer greets me at the door with the sheepishness of someone who isn't used to being at home during the workday. Ozer, 53, was laid off from DuPont Co. in January after a 23-year career. A Ph.D in chemical engineering, he has more than 20 patents to his name. He worked on long-term projects at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, one of the more storied research facilities in the country, where products such as nylon, Lycra and Kevlar were created.""Some of the great developments in American industry came out of that site,"" Ozer says. ""It was a time when America was growing so dramatically.""
But a lack of growth and pressure from investors forced DuPont to announce a merger with another giant, Dow Chemical. In advance of the merger, it has begun to shed jobs. In Delaware alone, DuPont plans to dump 1,700 workers--many in the area of long-term research, which can be expensive without yielding immediate rewards to shareholders. Ozer's group was eviscerated.The $130 billion merger of DuPont and Dow blends two U.S. companies that date back to the 19th century. Barry Lynn, an economist at the New America think tank, says that industry consolidation chills the labor market, sapping demand for skilled workers such as Ozer. Dominant companies can use their market power to charge customers more or make suppliers pay less--all without having to grow and create jobs to survive. Indeed, the push from Wall Street is to cull and cut, not grow. And when companies do expand today it's largely through acquisition, not investment.""That's a huge amount of the energy that's behind Trump,"" Lynn says, ""the sense of power being consolidated and being out of control and harming me and my family and my community.""Ozer will try to take advantage of his contacts at DuPont to become a consultant, but admits that's a gamble. Asked if he thinks he can replicate the six-figure salary he enjoyed at DuPont, he laughs. ""I'm not confident of that.""His chief concern is his two daughters, both of whom are out of college. In order to give his youngest a leg up in the market, he sent her to private Haverford College in Pennsylvania (tuition: $46,000)--going deep into debt to do so. ""I have a lot of possibilities, but I need things to start turning into dollars soon,"" he says. OUTSOURCING AND GLOBALIZATION
For Sara Blackwell, representing U.S. workers displaced by the federal H1-B visa program began as a gig. Now, it's a full-blown cause.The Tampa lawyer has been giving away clients who would distract her from her work. She jokes she's stopped sleeping and exercising. Recently, she launched a website called ProtectUSworkers.com. ""I speak to an average of 10 people a day who are victims of this,"" she tells me. ""The more I learn about this, the more I have to fight.""She began by representing IT workers at Walt Disney World in Florida who were replaced by guest workers from India brought in on temporary visas by outsourcing firms that contracted with Disney. She has filed a long-shot conspiracy lawsuit in federal court.Blackwell contends that the practice of outsourcing low-end, back-office IT jobs to cut costs has become endemic. Globalization, she says, is systematically lowering the standard of living of American workers. ""It's a race to the bottom,"" she says.The Disney case garnered the attention of some in the U.S. Senate, including Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama who now is at the forefront of a fight against the American tech industry, which wants to expand the guest-worker program citing a lack of domestic qualified engineers and programmers.But those tech companies are at the back of the line. According to Ron Hira, a professor at Howard University who tracks applications, outsourcing firms have been crowding out tech companies in the race to acquire the highly coveted H1-B visas, which are capped at 85,000 a year.Sessions, who is also a fierce opponent of immigration reform, was one of the first U.S. politicians to embrace Trump--and Blackwell has spoken out against the program at several Trump rallies.She also has consulted with the outsourced employees who worked at Northeast Utilities in Connecticut, including Craig Diangelo.Part of Diangelo's frustration--and part of what is driving him toward Trump--is that Washington has done so little to curb what he views as abuses of the H1-B program. There is a greater push now on Capitol Hill to broaden the program rather than rein it in. ""There's nobody to help us,"" he tells me. ""There's nobody to say you can't do this.""Richard Blumenthal, a U.S. senator from Connecticut, has been part of efforts to expand the program, but also to reform it. ""It's a desperately serious problem,"" he says.He told me that even though there is some bipartisan consensus on reform, efforts still aren't moving forward, consumed by the same paralysis that's stalling everything else.""There are powerful forces against us,"" Blumenthal says, ""including the companies that exploit these programs.""To Diangelo, that's the dilemma of the modern, middle-class voter. He worked hard for years, lost his job when his only transgression was being too old and making too much money, was humiliated when he had to train his replacement, and then watched how state and federal politicians have been able to do nothing to help him.Why shouldn't he support Donald Trump? What's worth preserving? He's a tech worker, sipping Pinot Grigio over pad thai. He's no militant or conspiracist. Yet...""There is going to be an uprising,"" he says. ""People are starting to say: `I've had enough of this. I've really had enough.'"" This report first appeared in ""The American Voter,"" Reuters' special election issue, available on iTunes or Google Play."

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raised nearly $90 million in July for her campaign and the Democratic Party, with more than half the donations coming from new donors, the campaign said on Tuesday.Clinton's campaign said it had $58 million in the bank as it starts August, and that the donations it received last month averaged $44. Of the $90 million raised, $63 million was for Clinton's presidential campaign while about $26 million was for other Democrats, it said in a statement.In June, Clinton, the Democratic nominee raised $68.5 million.
The campaign credited last week's Democratic National Convention with the boost in fundraising in July. It said its best 24-hour period for online fundraising began Thursday night when Clinton accepted the party's nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The campaign said it raised $8.7 million during that period.In a fundraising email to supporters, the Clinton campaign stressed it could not take a single vote for granted as it seeks to make history in November with the election of the first woman to be U.S. president.
""If we underestimate our opponent or take this race for granted, we'll lose,"" the email said, referring to Republican nominee Donald Trump.

LONDON A British man detained in the United States for allegedly trying to wrestle a gun from a police officer at a Donald Trump rally is suffering from severe mental illness and risks dying in prison, his mother said on Tuesday.Michael Sandford, 20, is due to face trial in Nevada on Aug. 22. He has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and one felony count of impeding and disrupting the orderly conduct of government business.His mother, Lynne Sandford, told a news conference in London that her son, who has been diagnosed in the past with autism, depression and other mental health conditions, had been on suicide watch in a Nevada prison for the past three weeks.She portrayed her son as a compassionate, child-like man who enjoyed watching ""Peppa Pig"", a British children's television program, and who was bewildered and frightened by his incarceration.She said her son had attempted to take his own life when he was 14 years old and was suffering from anorexia.Michael Sandford was arrested after an incident at a Trump rally at the Treasure Island hotel in Las Vegas on June 18, and later told an investigator he wanted to kill the Republican presidential candidate, according to U.S. court papers.
He has not been charged with attempted murder.""I accept that Michael has tried to do a bad thing but he is mentally ill and is not a bad or dangerous person,"" said his mother, adding that she had last spoken to him on the phone on Sunday.""He kept breaking down and sobbing on the phone, saying 'please, please, I just want to come home'. He's very remorseful ... He's just in a really bad way,"" she said.
Sandford has launched a campaign to have her son repatriated to Britain so he could be treated in a secure medical facility. She has raised $25,950 through the crowd-funding website Crowd Justice to pay for legal and other expenses.She said a British consular official who had visited her son in prison had reported that he was shackled and handcuffed.""It's not clear that Michael actually understands what he has done,"" said Saimo Chahal, the family's British lawyer, speaking alongside Lynne Sandford.
""Because of his Asperger's, OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and other psychological conditions there is a question mark over whether he's fit to plead and to undergo the trial process in the States,"" she said.Chahal said she was working to provide the public defenders' office in Nevada with independent evidence of Michael Sandford's mental illness.She expected the trial to be postponed by at least 56 days initially to allow time for that. She hoped a trial would not happen and that Sandford would be repatriated to Britain as part of a plea bargain agreement. (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Giles Elgood)"

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday campaigned alongside U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a rowdy rally in his home state of Nebraska, where he challenged Republican Donald Trump to release his tax returns and questioned Trump's business acumen.Trump, a New York real estate developer making his first run at public office, has said he cannot release his tax returns, a ritual of U.S. presidential campaigns, until the Internal Revenue Service has completed an audit.""Now I've got news for him,"" said Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based in Omaha. ""I'm under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election.""I'll bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions about the items that are on there,"" Buffett added, saying Trump was ""afraid"" not of the tax-collecting IRS but of voters.In response, Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: ""As you know, Mr. Trump is undergoing a routine audit."" She had no immediate comment when asked to respond to Buffett saying that he too was under audit but would release his tax returns.Trump has asserted his success as a businessman qualifies him to lead the country, but Buffett, who backs Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, said Trump lost money the only time he went to the American people and asked them to invest. He said it was in 1995 when Trump listed his Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange. He said the company lost money every year for the next decade. A monkey would have outperformed Trump's company, Buffett said.
In 1995, ""if a monkey had thrown a dart at the stock page, the monkey on average would have made 150 percent,"" he said.Buffett spoke for nearly 30 minutes to a raucous capacity crowd of roughly 3,100 people in a suburban Omaha high school with Clinton sitting at his side.He said Trump's ""final straw"" was an ABC interview broadcast on Sunday in which he criticized the Muslim parents of a decorated U.S. soldier killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago.The father Khizr Khan spoke at last week's Democratic National Convention about their son and attacked Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.
Trump said he was ""viciously"" attacked by Khan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, when the father publicly doubted Trump had read the U.S. Constitution. Khan said that Trump had ""sacrificed nothing,"" prompting Trump in his ABC interview to say, ""I think I've made a lot of sacrifices.""Buffett on Monday bluntly contradicted Trump.""No member of the Buffett family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan. No member of the Trump family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan,"" Buffett said. ""We've both done extremely well during this period and our families haven't sacrificed anything.""
In his remarks Buffett announced the launch of a get-out-the vote effort, pledging to take at least 10 people to the polls who would otherwise have difficulty getting there. Buffett said he was backing a website, Drive2Vote, that would coordinate transportation to cast votes and that he had reserved a trolley that seats 32 people for the same purpose.""I'm going to be on it all day. I'm going to do selfies, whatever it takes,"" Buffett said.Buffett said his goal is to generate the highest voter turnout in the congressional district that includes Omaha of any in the country. Nebraska is one of two U.S. states that award electoral votes in presidential elections by congressional district.Clinton responded to Buffett's pledge with a promise of her own, if his turnout goal is met.""Warren and I will dance in the streets of Omaha together! Maybe if we're really lucky he'll wear his Elvis costume again!"" she said.

Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper on Monday criticized Donald Trump's comments about fracking, saying the Republican presidential candidate does not completely understand the issue,  the Denver Post reported.Trump, during a campaign in Colorado, said that while he supports fracking, he also believes state and local governments should be able to ban fracking, the Denver Post reported. (dpo.st/2aIHGZy)Hickenlooper, a former geologist, called the issue a ""tricky thing"" when asked why he thought Trump was wrong to support locals' ability to ban fracking, the publication wrote. 
He also added that if total responsibility is given to local authorities, any oil and gas activity would be voted to be banned, and people who own these private properties with the minerals would lose out, the publication reported. The Colorado Supreme Court has a ruling in force which does not allow local governments to ban fracking.
A representative for Trump was not immediately available for comment.
