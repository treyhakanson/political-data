WASHINGTON U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Wednesday he is  considering running for re-election and may decide to jump into the race as early as this weekend, a move that could help Republicans retain their majority in the U.S. Senate. ""I'll go home later this week. And I'll have some time with my family. And then, if there's a change in our status, I'll be sure to let everyone know,"" the former Republican presidential candidate told reporters in the U.S. Capitol. Rubio, 45, first elected to the Senate in 2010, announced his retirement from the Senate in March after losing Florida's presidential primary. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others have been pressuring him to reconsider, citing polling data showing him to be the only Republican who can win the election in Florida. 
Rubio confirmed a Politico report that he was urged to run for re-election on Sunday in Orlando, Florida, by one of the Republicans contending for the seat, his friend Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera. The two men were in Orlando after the shooting that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub.Another Florida Republican hopeful, U.S. Representative David Jolly, has indicated he would step aside if Rubio entered the race.
Rubio must decide whether to seek re-election by June 24, the filing deadline for Florida's August primary.

By Ginger Gibson and Grant Smith
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has taken more money from employees of America's 15 biggest pharmaceuticals companies than all of the Republicans who attempted a run for the White House this year combined, according to campaign finance disclosures.The donations, which were nearly double those accepted by Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, came even as the former senator and secretary of state vowed to curb price gouging in the industry if elected.Clinton's campaign took nearly $240,000 from employees of the industry between its launch and the end of April, compared with just under $168,000 for all of the Republicans together, including around $1,700 for presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the filings. The money, a drop in the bucket of Clinton's nearly $190 million in overall individual contributions, has tended to come from people in top jobs: 54 percent of the donors list their position as executive, director, manager or lawyer. Donors and company officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment on the contributions.Industry insiders say the sector may be drawn to Clinton for a few reasons: She has a good chance of winning against Trump in November, her policies are relatively transparent and predictable, and she's more supportive of international trade than rivals.Many of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies are also headquartered in areas of the country that are more heavily populated by liberals, like New Jersey and New York - another potential reason for the Clinton-heavy employee donations.
""(Trade) is, in particular, an issue for the pharmaceutical industry. They all operate trans-nationally,"" said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm that works with companies across the health sector.He added: ""We have very limited ability to predict what would happen in a Trump administration. We don't know the people, we don't have a lot to go on.""Trump, who largely self-funded his primary bid, only recently began soliciting donations for the general election, meaning his contributions from supporters in all industries are likely to rise in the coming months.
Clinton tapped into widespread public frustration over soaring health costs this winter when she outlined a plan to curb drug price hikes and singled out pharmaceuticals company Valeant, saying she would ""go after them"" if elected.Trump's campaign seized on Clinton's donations from the industry as proof that she would be unlikely to follow through. ""Hillary Clinton will be totally controlled by the special interests,"" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said.
Clinton has rejected the idea.""Hillary Clinton has spent her career fighting to crack down on rising prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable,"" spokesman Josh Schwerin said. Clinton's donations from drug companies have grown since the last time she ran, in 2008, but fall far short of her rival in that race, President Barack Obama, who took in more than $500,000 in contributions from employees of pharmaceutical companies during the equivalent period of time.Clinton's total in this race so far, however, beats the combined take in the 2012 election of Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney from employees of the industry of $170,000, according to the filings.

""I think it's pretty definite,"" he said of the Monday time frame.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday imposed some limits on the kind of fraud claims that can be brought against federal contractors in a case involving a suit against one of America's largest hospital operators over a woman's death at one of its facilities.But the 8-0 ruling was not the broad victory for business sought by the company, Universal Health Services, and other healthcare providers fearful of suits under the U.S. False Claims Act, which lets individuals make claims that the federal government has been defrauded.The justices threw out a 2015 appeals court ruling that had allowed the parents of Yarushka Rivera to sue Universal Health Services under the False Claims Act, but sent the case back to a lower court, meaning the suit could potentially still proceed.Rivera suffered a fatal seizure in 2009 at age 19 a mental health facility owned by the company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The lawsuit said the facility provided ""gravely inadequate treatment"" and used ""unsupervised and unqualified personnel.""The ruling represented a partial victory for the business community because it rejected the lower court's expansive view of a company's liability under the False Claims Act. 
Roy Englert, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services' lawyer, said he was pleased the justices threw out the appeals court ruling and set a ""new rigorous standard"" for determining if the claims can move forward.Rivera's parents, Julio Escobar and Carmen Correa, accused the company of defrauding the government because it was getting federal Medicaid funding to provide treatment to low-income people and did not comply with personnel regulations at the Lawrence facility.
The ruling ""accepts the basic notion that fraudsters can't provide shoddy services to the government and expect payment without incurring significant liability,"" said David Frederick, the lawyer for Rivera's family.Businesses had hoped the justices would put more limits, or disallow completely, lawsuits based on a federal contractor's failure to meet certain legal or regulatory requirements not specifically outlined in a government contract. The court instead said such lawsuits can be filed as long as they are relevant to the government's decision to make the payment to the company.
Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the parents ""may well have adequately pleaded a violation"" of the fraud law, but added that the False Claims Act ""is not a means of imposing treble damages and other penalties for insignificant regulatory or contractual violations.""The Obama administration had backed the parents.

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton is considering U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren for her running mate for the Democratic presidential ticket, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing several people familiar with the process.Warren, a leading progressive voice among Democrats, is among those Democratic presidential candidate Clinton is vetting for the vice presidential position, the newspaper reported. Clinton's rival Bernie Sanders is not, it added. Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Warren, who represents Massachusetts, is considering the potential role. Representatives for Clinton, Sanders and Warren did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the report.Clinton is the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, having won the last primary contest this week in the District of Columbia. Although Clinton and Sanders met this week, the senator from Vermont does not plan to end his campaign or endorse Clinton in a video speech to supporters scheduled for later on Thursday, his spokesman said.    
While the search for a potential partner in the race is still in its early stages, the Journal reported several Democrats said Clinton's campaign is looking at a number of potential candidates, including Warren.Other prospective running mates include U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez and U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, according to the report. Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Cory Booker of New Jersey as well as U.S. Representatives Xavier Becerra of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio are also under consideration, it said. 
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is also a potential candidate, it added. Warren threw her support behind Clinton last week as the former secretary of state moved her sights from the nominating contest toward a Nov. 8 match-up against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Warren could help Clinton win over Sanders supporters from the party's more liberal wing after a surprisingly protracted primary race. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, has not yet dropped out. 
She also would give Clinton a vocal boost in her fight against Trump. Warren has called Trump a threat to the country and has vowed to keep lashing out at him.(This story has been refiled to remove superfluous word ""endorsed"" in paragraph nine.) (Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)"

By Kouichi Shirayanagi

The largest labor federation in the United States, the AFL-CIO, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Thursday, vowing to throw the full weight of more than 50 unions representing 12.5 million members behind the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.     ""Hillary Clinton is a proven leader who shares our values,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""We will run a sophisticated, targeted ground campaign. And with the dire consequences Donald Trump poses for America's working families, it has to be."" While the federation generally does not endorse a Democratic candidate until there is an official nominee, Trumka has warned for months that he believes Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump would be disastrous for working people if elected. 
After the endorsement, Clinton pledged to spend more on public infrastructure and to fight to improve schools. She vowed to increase the federal minimum wage, offer paid family leave and ensure that women receive equal pay.""As president, I will stand proudly with the AFL-CIO and fight to protect the rights and values that helped build the mighty American middle class. Workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House,"" Clinton said in a statement.
The AFL-CIO has already run digital ads criticizing Trump's candidacy and will now work to boost Clinton's campaign on the ground. Working America, one AFL-CIO affiliate that deals with nonunion workers, already has teams in crucial so-called battleground states.In response to the federation's endorsement of Clinton, Trump's campaign said the AFL-CIO no longer represents the interests of American workers. ""I will fight harder for American workers than anyone ever has,"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump attacked Clinton for supporting free trade agreements and said he would win a majority of votes from U.S. union families. (Reporting by Kouichi Shirayanagi and Amanda Becker; Editing by Susan Heavey, Toni Reinhold)"

A ""lone hacker"" has taken responsibility for a cyber attack on the U.S. Democratic National Committee, which the DNC and a cyber-security firm have blamed on the Russian government.The DNC and cyber firm CrowdStrike disclosed the attack on Tuesday, saying that hackers working for Russia broke into the DNC's computer network, spied on internal communications and stole research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.A Russian government spokesman responded by saying that Moscow had not been involved.On Wednesday, an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 took responsibility for the attack in a post on the blogging site WordPress.com, saying the DNC was ""hacked by a lone hacker.""
The DNC did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday evening on Guccifer 2.0's claim. CrowdStrike said it stands by findings that the Russian government was behind the attacks. Guccifer 2.0's blog includes images of documents it claims were stolen from DNC servers, including one titled ""Donald Trump Report,"" which was dated Dec. 19, and spreadsheets purportedly containing information about party donors. 
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the documents, which the blog said were among ""thousands of files and mails"" removed from DNC servers that would soon be published on WikiLeaks. CrowdStrike issued a statement saying it ""stands fully by its analysis"" that two groups affiliated with Russian intelligence were discovered in the DNC's network last month. 
The company said it was reviewing the documents published by Guccifer 2.0 to determine whether they were authentic.  (Reporting by Jim Finkle. Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by Nick Macfie)"

By Dave McKinney and Karen Pierog
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Illinois will sell $550 million of bonds on Thursday but lacks authority from the state legislature to spend all of the proceeds due to an ongoing budget impasse.""The General Assembly needs to grant appropriation authority to fully expend the proceeds from the bond sale, although existing FY16 appropriations could be used to expend a portion of them,"" Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Governor Bruce Rauner, said on Wednesday.Her statement followed a news conference earlier on Wednesday with the Republican governor and his transportation department head, who warned of the imminent shutdown of hundreds of construction projects if the Democrat-controlled legislature does not approve Rauner's temporary budget plan.All but $20 million of the state's general obligation bond issue is earmarked for mass transit and road construction projects.The odd timing of the announcement on the eve of the state bond sale handed Rauner's Democratic rivals in the state legislature fodder to question the first-term governor's actions. 
""We're hoping none of his activities or staff work is going to drive up borrowing costs like it did for the Chicago Public Schools in February,"" said Steve Brown, spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan.The school district delayed, then downsized its bond sale,  after Rauner threatened a state takeover of CPS and said the system was headed for bankruptcy, comments Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called ""shameful"" because of their possible impact on the bond sale.
Rauner on Wednesday pleaded with Democratic lawmakers to return to session to pass a spending plan that would keep the state operating until January and fully fund K-12 schools.""Allowing the crisis to continue is wrong,"" Rauner said, referring to the ongoing impasse that has left Illinois as the only state without a fiscal 2016 budget.Illinois has been dependent on court orders and a muddle of ongoing and stopgap appropriations to continue operating and lawmakers have not reached any agreement on a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
The state's GO bonds trade at wide spreads over Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A yield scale. But Illinois' upcoming debt issue will likely benefit from yields in the municipal market that are at or near record lows as cash-heavy investors chase scarce supply of bonds issued by states, cities, schools and other issuers.Illinois' already low credit ratings were downgraded last week ahead of the sale.

By Julia Edwards

As facts emerge about Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday, questions have arisen about how well-known he was to U.S. intelligence agencies.Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Monday that Mateen was on a watchlist between May 2013 and March 2014 while he was under investigation after claiming a connection to or support for multiple Islamist extremist groups, including al Qaeda, Hezbollah, al-Nusra and Islamic State.The FBI maintains three watchlists and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence runs one database. People are placed on a watchlist according to the threat level they are believed to pose. Comey did not specify which watchlist named Mateen. Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton has supported stricter gun laws and said on Monday she would push for laws that would prevent people on a no-fly list from buying guns.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has embraced gun rights, said he would meet with the leading U.S. gun rights group about preventing people on a government watchlist from buying guns.The U.S. government maintains the following databases:Terrorist Watchlist or Terrorist Screening Database (about 420,000 names): Established after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Terrorist Watchlist is intended ""to positively identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the U.S, board aircraft, or engage in other activity."" Prior to 2001, intelligence agencies maintained dozens of individual lists. The Terrorist Watchlist is run by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center with the goal of consolidating the U.S. government's watchlists into a single database.  
No-Fly List (about 16,000 names): A subset of the Terrorist Screening Database, the No-Fly List prohibits people known or suspected of terrorism from boarding a plane that departs from or arrives in the United States.  Selectee List (about 16,000 names): A subset of the Terrorist Watchlist, the Selectee List includes individuals who are permitted to fly, but receive more intensive screening. In addition to the thousands of records updated daily from federal, state and local law enforcement, the Selectee List provides an additional level of screening for individuals thought to present a greater threat. 
Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database (about 1.1 million names): Run by the National Counterterrorism Center, part of the Office of the National Director of Intelligence, the TIDE Database shares information with the FBI's watchlists. As of December 2013, it contained about 1.1 million people, about 25,000 of them U.S. citizens. Unlike the FBI's database, TIDE is viewable only by counterterrorism professionals in the U.S. intelligence community and is not shared with local law enforcement. Federal agencies propose people for inclusion on the TIDE database based on an evaluation of the threat they pose. Reasons someone may be added to the TIDE database include committing terrorist activity, preparing or planning a terrorist activity or providing support, such as funds or housing, for a terrorist organization.
