By Jean Luis Arce
| MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY Mexico's new finance minister on Thursday delivered a stern reproach to Donald Trump, saying the only thing he agreed on with the U.S. Republican presidential candidate was that his predecessor in the ministry was an excellent public servant.The comments follow the resignation of Luis Videgaray as finance minister on Wednesday after he came under fire for Trump's visit to Mexico City last week, which Mexican diplomats said he was instrumental in arranging.Trump has infuriated Mexicans with a series of broadsides against the United States' southern neighbor, and his hastily arranged visit to meet President Enrique Pena Nieto a week ago sparked heavy criticism of the government.Presenting the government's 2017 budget plan just a day after his appointment, the new finance minister, Jose Antonio Meade, did not mince his words when he was asked about recent comments by Trump on Videgaray at a news conference.
""I'd like to point out that the only thing, absolutely the only thing I agree on with candidate Trump is that Luis Videgaray is an exceptional public servant,"" Meade said.The outspoken American real estate mogul has vowed to make Mexico pay for a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants, as well as threatening to carry out mass deportations and tear up trade treaties crucial to its economy.Late on Wednesday, Trump commented on Videgaray's resignation on NBC television when he was asked if the United States could take a chance with him as commander-in-chief.
""Well, I think absolutely,"" he said. ""I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day...I let them know where the United States stands. I mean, we've been badly hurt by Mexico...And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. That's how well we did.""In an apparent u-turn on those remarks, on Thursday Trump tweeted his appreciation for Videgaray, who was widely seen as Pena Nieto's closest advisor in the Cabinet.
""Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pena Nieto,"" he said. ""With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the United States would have benefitted.""Meade, a friend of Videgaray's, was foreign minister when Trump launched his presidential bid in June 2015. He later moved to another ministry before his appointment on Wednesday as finance minister, a job he also held in the previous government.

WASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday said the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement still faces an uphill battle for support in Congress and that he was not inclined to bring it up for a vote, because it would not pass.U.S. President Barack Obama's Pacific trade deal with partners in Asia would ""go down"" in any vote held now, Ryan told reporters at a regular press briefing.
""If you bring it up, it's going to go down, I don't think we should bring up a bill that goes down,"" Ryan said.

By Jeff Mason
| WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton slammed Republican rival Donald Trump on Thursday for talking about things he learned in classified intelligence briefings and for praising Russia's Vladimir Putin as a better leader than President Barack Obama.Speaking to reporters the day after a New York security forum featuring separate appearances by the two candidates, Clinton also criticized the businessman for saying U.S. generals had been ""reduced to rubble"" by Obama's policies.At the televised forum on Wednesday night, Trump said he was ""shocked"" by information he got during the briefing. ""What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts ... said to do,"" Trump said.Clinton, who was secretary of state during Obama's first term, said Trump's comments on the briefing were ""totally inappropriate and undisciplined.""""I would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing I received,"" Clinton said before boarding her campaign plane. As nominees for the Nov. 8 presidential election, she and Trump are entitled to receive intelligence briefings.Clinton said Trump's praise of Putin as a better leader than Obama was ""not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country, as well as to our commander in chief, it is scary.""""It suggests he will let Putin do whatever Putin wants to do and then make excuses for him,"" Clinton said.Trump fired back at Clinton, saying her comments were an effort to make up for a poor performance during the security forum.""Hillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong,"" he said during a campaign stop in Cleveland, where he visited a charter school and proposed federal spending on ""school choice"" programs. ""I just watched her on the tarmac. She tried to make up for her horrible performance last night,"" Trump said.The intensifying political combat came as Clinton's lead in opinion polls has slipped in recent days. The current average of polls by website RealClearPolitics puts her at 45.6 percent support, compared with Trump's 42.8 percent.
Obama also hit back at Trump for criticizing his foreign policy record, saying the Republican nominee was unfit to follow him into the Oval Office and the public should press Trump on his ""outright wacky ideas.""The televised ""Commander-in-Chief"" forum on Wednesday, attended by military veterans, was the first time Trump and Clinton had squared off on the same stage since accepting their parties' White House nominations in July, although they did not appear at the same time.A PRELUDE TO DEBATES
The forum offered a prelude to how Clinton and Trump will deal with questions of national security in their three upcoming presidential debates later in September and in October.Clinton has said her experience in government as secretary of state and a U.S. senator makes her uniquely qualified for the White House, and that Trump's series of controversial comments make him temperamentally unfit for the office.
Some of Trump's foreign policy positions, such as his proposal to fight terrorism by imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, have alarmed not just Democrats but many in his own party's leadership. Trump, who has never held elected office, has criticized Clinton's judgment for backing the 2003 Iraq war and her support for the U.S. intervention in Libya in 2011. The Republican candidate was widely criticized recently when he called her a ""co-founder,"" along with Obama, of the Islamic State militant group.Clinton, who voted in favor of the 2003 Iraq war as a senator but has since said she regrets doing so, said she would convene a meeting of bipartisan security experts on Friday to discuss the fight against Islamic State.""What you didn't hear from Donald Trump last night was any plan to take on ISIS,"" Clinton told reporters, using an acronym for the group. ""That's not only dangerous, it should be disqualifying.""Trump and Clinton supporters went on the offensive on social media Wednesday night and Thursday morning, defending their candidates' performances during the forum.
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway spoke with Trump supporters in Congress on Thursday morning, and Trump spoke with the group by phone to thank them for their support. Some supporters shrugged off his comments about Putin.""I think he is being very smart in how he addresses Putin and you know, maybe he's playing with Putin's ego,"" said Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.Mike Pence, Trump's vice presidential running mate, told CNN it was ""inarguable"" that Putin had been a stronger leader of Russia than Obama had been in the United states.House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican official, who has frequently broken with Trump, took a sharply different view.""Putin is an aggressor that does not share our interests. Vladimir Putin is violating the sovereignty of neighboring countries,"" Ryan told reporters at his weekly news conference.    Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told reporters at the Cleveland rally that Trump was not endorsing Putin with his praise.""He doesn't agree with his style of government. He wasn't saying that,"" he said.Clinton said Republicans holding or seeking office across the country should be pressed on whether they agree with Trump's comments, including his views on Putin and U.S. generals that surfaced during the forum.""Republicans are just in a terrible dilemma trying to support a totally unqualified nominee, I have no sympathy for them, it's their nominee,"" she said.

By Steve Holland
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday said he was against the Iraq war all along despite telling radio interviewer Howard Stern in 2002 that he favored it.Trump used the start of a speech about education at a charter school in Cleveland to push back at Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's statement that his position on Iraq is pretty much like her own: She voted for the 2003 war as a U.S. senator from New York but has since disavowed the vote.At an NBC forum on Wednesday night, Clinton pointed to a September 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern to say that Trump had supported the war. Trump had said ""Yeah, I guess so,"" when asked about a potential conflict in Iraq. Various fact-checkers have cited this interview to debunk Trump's statement that he was always against the war.
In Cleveland, Trump cited a Jan. 28, 2003, interview he did with Fox News' Neil Cavuto to say he was skeptical.In that interview, Trump said: ""I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.""He said in his Cleveland remarks that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq had left a power void filled by Islamic State militants.
""But I was opposed to that war from the beginning, long before my interview with Howard Stern,"" Trump said.He also cited what he said was a March 25, 2003, interview.
""Just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is a mess,"" Trump said, calling it ""more evidence that I had opposed the war from the start."" (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Leslie Adler and Dan Grebler)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. lawmakers said Thursday they will seek to recover the missing emails of Colin Powell from his time as U.S. secretary of state by going directly to AOL Inc, whose email service he used for his work.The decision came a few minutes after U.S. State Department officials testified in a hearing that the department never contacted AOL to recover the missing records, despite repeated requests by the National Archives and Records Administration over the last year.The hearing, by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, was the latest in the fallout from Hillary Clinton's decision to use an unauthorized private email system for official email while secretary of state. Clinton, the Democratic Party presidential candidate, has said her decision was wrong, but it has continued to dog her effort to defeat Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. Her defenders have pointed to some similarities in Powell's earlier use of private email, which drew fresh scrutiny at Thursday's hearing.
""I don't get this, it's ridiculous,"" said Democrat Stephen Lynch, a committee member. ""This is the National Archives asking you to contact AOL, but you didn't do that.""Patrick Kennedy, the State Department's most senior management official, said that Powell, a Republican, never replied to the department's request to ask AOL to attempt to recover his work emails, which were not properly archived at the agency. He said the department's lawyers decided to decline the National Archives' requests that the department go to AOL directly.""We cannot make a request for someone else's records from their provider,"" Kennedy said in his testimony. ""That request has to be made by them.""
Jason Chaffetz, the Republican who chairs the committee, then agreed to a request by the committee's most senior Democrat, Elijah Cummings, to try to recover the emails from AOL, using a subpoena if necessary. AOL is owned by telecommunications provider Verizon Communications Inc.A spokeswoman for Powell did not respond to a request for comment. AOL did not immediately respond to questions, and has previously said the its privacy policy precludes it from discussing a customer's emails.
The State Department did not have a fully functioning email system when Powell joined it in 2001, according to agency officials. Powell has said he told technology officials to set up a computer with his AOL account in order to become the first secretary of state to use email.In contrast, Clinton eschewed the official state.gov email system when she took office in 2009. Department officials have said she would not have received permission for this had she asked.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Four U.S. senators introduced a joint resolution on Thursday seeking to block the U.S. sale of $1.15 billion of Abrams tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia, citing issues including the conflict in Yemen.The measure was introduced by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Democrats Chris Murphy and Al Franken, the latest indication of strong disapproval of the deal among some U.S. lawmakers.""Selling $1.15 billion in tanks, guns, ammunition, and more to a country with a poor human rights record embroiled in a bitter war is a recipe for disaster and an escalation of an ongoing arms race in the region,"" Paul said in a statement.In August, 64 members of the House of Representatives signed a letter urging President Barack Obama to delay the sale.The Pentagon announced on Aug. 9 that the State Department has approved the potential sale of more than 130 Abrams battle tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment to Saudi Arabia.
The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which implements foreign arms sales, said that General Dynamics would be the principal contractor for the sale.Introducing the resolution, the senators cited the conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition in support of forces loyal to the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi who are trying to oust Iran-allied Houthi forces from the capital, Sanaa.Human rights groups have criticized the coalition's air strikes because of the deaths of civilians.
""Thousands of civilians are being killed, and terrorist groups inside the country, like al Qaeda and ISIS, are getting stronger. Until the Saudis' conduct changes, the U.S. should put a pause on further arms sales,"" Murphy said in a statement.Some congressional aides questioned whether Congress had the right to try to block the sale, since it has been more than 30 days since Congress was notified about it.
But the four senators said the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 allows senators to force a vote on an arms sale by a president.Human rights activists applauded the resolution.""Congress' silence would signal to the Yemeni people that U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen is unconditional - no matter how cruel the parties' methods of warfare or how unwilling they are to make peace,"" Scott Paul, senior humanitarian policy advisor at Oxfam America, said in a statement.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday called on the Republican-led U.S. Congress to allow an up-or-down vote on funding to combat the Zika virus without other provisions attached, calling the health threat posed by the pathogen a national emergency.Congress has failed to approve any funding to fight the mosquito-borne virus since President Barack Obama asked for $1.9 billion in February. Lawmakers have been deadlocked for months over a $1.1 billion funding bill. Democrats have accused Republicans of attaching controversial provisions related to abortion that they cannot accept.Republicans have accused Democrats of blocking the bill to gain political advantage by portraying Republicans as obstructionists on Zika funding.""Give us an up-or-down vote, straight, on Zika,"" Biden said at an event on Capitol Hill with fellow Democrats from the Senate and House of Representatives.
""I understand attaching controversial issues to important legislation ... but this is a national emergency,"" Biden added. ""People's health, the well-being of unborn children, the health of the country at large, is at stake. Act.""U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika.Two top federal health officials also visited Congress on Thursday to underscore the importance of Zika funding.
""We're all hopeful that the Congress will come through with the money that's needed to respond effectively to Zika,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters after meeting with Senate Democratic leaders alongside Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters that Democrats want Zika funding added to stop-gap legislation that Congress must pass by Oct. 1 to keep federal agencies operating. ""By Zika, I mean for a year. I don't mean for three months,"" Pelosi said. ""Zika should be emergency spending. It should not be off-set (requiring cuts in other government programs), because it is an emergency."" 
A main issue is Democrats' opposition to language, backed by Republicans, that they say would prevent Zika funds for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, mainly in Puerto Rico.The virus, first detected in Brazil last year, has spread rapidly through the Americas. Florida is the only U.S. state so far where local mosquitoes are known to be transmitting Zika.

By Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON About 10,000 retired coal miners and their families descended on the U.S. Congress on Thursday to pressure lawmakers to pass stalled legislation that would prevent 22,000 of them from losing their pension and health benefits as soon as early 2017.A bipartisan group of senators is trying to pass legislation to ensure the retirees' coverage with the United Mine Workers of America's retirement and healthcare funds, which are dwindling as some coal companies drop benefits in their bankruptcy proceedings. The future of the coal industry and its workers has been an issue in national politics. With just weeks to go before the presidential and congressional elections in November, time for passage of the bill is limited.The union said the federal government was obligated to ensure coal workers continue to get the benefits. The UMWA pension currently supports about 120,000 former miners and their families.""These miners put in decades of back-breaking work in America's coal mines to energize our nation,"" UMWA International President Cecil Roberts said.But some Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have hesitated to support the legislation, either because they do not want to be seen bailing out unionized workers or because it does not address what they say is President Barack Obama's regulatory ""war"" on the coal industry.Legislation backers say they are obligated to uphold a guarantee made in 1946 by President Harry Truman to protect the benefits to avert a strike.  Republican West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said on Wednesday that the payments were less than $600 a month. 
""These aren't lavish pensions,"" she said. ""This is food. This is the trip to see the doctor.""  If Congress fails to pass the Miners' Protection Act, the $5 billion federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, an agency that backstops failed private-sector pension programs and is already financially strained, would be responsible for the plans.Mervn Click, a retired coal miner from Hueytown, Alabama, who traveled more than 20 hours by bus for the rally, said his benefits could cease by year's end. ""I don't know what I will do if it runs out,"" he said as he stood under a tree facing the Capitol.
West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said 46 Democratic senators and at least eight Republicans backed the bill. Three of the Republicans - Rob Portman of Ohio, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mark Kirk of Illinois - are up for reelection this November in tight races in coal-producing states. Portman told the crowd he was confident the bill will pass in the Senate Finance Committee, where it will be discussed on Wednesday.""We hope it's a strong vote because that will get it to the (Senate) floor like a torpedo,"" he said.Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is the ranking member of the Finance Committee, said he was ""working both sides of the aisle"" to make sure the bill gets passed. 
""Today it's mine workers; tomorrow it can be woodworkers,"" he said, referring to his state's logging industry.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has criticized bankrupt coal companies for ""shirking"" their responsibility to pay healthcare benefits for retirees, voiced support for the bill.""I firmly believe that if you spent your life keeping the lights on for our country, we can't leave you in the dark,"" Clinton said in a statement. She has also proposed a $30 billion package to help coal states adapt to a changing economy. That plan has been overshadowed by a comment she made earlier this year that she would put coal companies out of business.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to put coal miners back to work but has not offered any details. His campaign was unavailable for comment.McConnell spokesman Robert Steurer told Reuters that the issue ""deserves an open, transparent debate through regular order."" Vera Newton, a member of the United Auto Workers' Louisville, Kentucky, chapter joined her members at the rally in solidarity with the coal workers.""If they lose this fight, we're next,"" she said. ""It's like dominoes - if they lose their pension, other unions will follow."""	['Portman', 'Manchin', 'Clinton', 'Moore', 'Toomey', 'McConnell', 'Roberts', 'Kirk', 'Capito', 'Trump']	['healthcare']

By Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson framed an embarrassing lapse on foreign affairs as simple human error on Thursday after he responded to a question about a flashpoint in the Syrian civil war by asking, ""What is Aleppo?""The gaffe came during an MSNBC interview about the continuing battle for Syria's biggest city, Aleppo, which has been divided for years into government and rebel sectors and has been in the news daily in recent weeks.""What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo,"" Johnson was asked. ""About Aleppo. And what is Aleppo?"" he responded.""You're kidding?"" the MSNBC interviewer said. ""No,"" Johnson said.""Aleppo is in Syria. ... It's the epicenter of the refugee crisis,"" the interviewer said. 
""OK, got it. Got it,"" Johnson said.The embarrassing exchange followed a forum on Wednesday night in which Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump sought to showcase their national security and defense credentials. Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, has been trying to turn the two major candidates' low approval ratings to his advantage in the race to win the Nov. 8 election.
However, he has just 8.6 support in the current average of opinion polls by website RealClearPolitics in a matchup with Clinton, Trump, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.While the Libertarian Party has long rejected U.S. military intervention abroad, the candidate's failure to recognize one of the most troubled spots in the Middle East drew ridicule and prompted speculation that his campaign was essentially over. Clinton, asked at a news conference about Johnson's remarks, laughed and quipped, ""You can look on the map and find Aleppo.""In a statement after the MSNBC interview, Johnson said the mistake showed he was human and explained that, when asked about Aleppo, he was thinking of an acronym and not the Syrian war.
""Can I name every city in Syria? No. Should I have identified Aleppo? Yes. Do I understand its significance? Yes,"" he said.In the 2012 presidential election, Johnson set a record for most votes won by a Libertarian candidate - about 1 percent of the popular vote - and was aiming to attract disaffected Republicans and Democrats to sustain steady growth in the party.The Libertarian agenda promotes civil liberties and a small-government agenda. Johnson has pledged to cut spending, stick to conservative fiscal policies and legalize marijuana.Appearing on ABC's talk show ""The View"" later, Johnson reacted mildly to suggestions the gaffe would kill his campaign. ""I guess people will have to make that judgment,"" he said. (Additional reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry and Jonathan Oatis)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
