WASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Tuesday nominated career diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis to be the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than five decades, setting up a fierce confirmation battle with Republicans in Congress opposed to Obama's opening with the communist-ruled island.The appointment of DeLaurentis, the top American official at the U.S. embassy in Havana since relations were restored last year, marked Obama's latest move to go as far as he can in normalizing ties between the former Cold War foes before he leaves office in January.The nomination must be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, which is seen as a long shot, especially in a presidential election year and given expected strong resistance from Cuban-American senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas.Rubio, in a blistering statement, derided the nomination as a ""last-ditch legacy project"" by Obama and said it ""should go nowhere.""An individual senator has the power - one that is often invoked - to put a ""hold"" on an ambassadorial nomination to delay a full Senate vote.In a veiled appeal to lawmakers, Obama praised DeLaurentis for his leadership during the normalization process. ""We only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador"" in Havana, he said in a statement.
""Having an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government,"" Obama said.DeLaurentis had been widely tipped for the post. But the president held off naming him until now even as Cuba appointed its own ambassador to Washington shortly after embassies were reopened in both countries' capitals in July of last year.He would be the first U.S. envoy since Philip Bonsal, an appointee of President Dwight Eisenhower, left the post vacant in late 1960.
NOMINATION FOLLOWS OBAMA VISIT
Obama traveled to Havana in March, the first visit by a U.S. president in 88 years. The trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cuba's 1959 revolution.
Since the opening, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing Cuba to accelerate cautious market-style reforms and allow greater political and economic freedom.Even so, the U.S. embargo against Cuba remains in place, a major irritant in relations. Only Congress can lift the embargo, and the Republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon.DeLaurentis has been U.S. chief of mission in Cuba since August 2014, his third posting in Havana. He has also held diplomatic posts at the State Department in Washington, at the U.S. mission to the United Nations and in Bogota.

By Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The centerpiece of President Barack Obama's climate change strategy faced a key test on Tuesday as conservative appeals court judges questioned whether his administration overstepped its legal authority under an air pollution law to make sweeping changes to the U.S. electric sector.Twenty-seven states led by coal-producer West Virginia and industry groups are challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan rules before 10 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.They argue that the EPA overstepped its regulatory authority under the federal Clean Air Act when the agency issued rules to curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. The U.S. Supreme Court has put the regulations on hold while the case is litigated.Tuesday's highly anticipated arguments drew a crowd of hundreds at sunrise to watch the opponents face off against the EPA, 18 states and some supportive power companies. The EPA told the judges that the agency had the power under the Clean Air Act to craft the rule, and that it was cost-effective and achievable.The challengers could face an uphill battle to win over a majority of the 10 judges, six of whom are Democratic appointees. Judge Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by former President George W. Bush, said while he understands the political and moral obligation to address global warming and the importance of the United States to international climate action, the Clean Power Plan's impact on the U.S. economy and on certain coal-reliant communities should require Congress to have a say.""This is a huge case. It has huge economic consequences,"" said Kavanaugh.He added that climate change does not give the EPA a ""blank check"" to use the Clean Air Act flexibly. Judge Thomas Griffith, another Bush appointee, questioned: ""Why is this (debate) not going-on on the Congress floor but in front of a room full of unelected judges?""  
The EPA argued before that the Supreme Court has already given the EPA authority in previous cases to use the section of the Clean Air Act at issue to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.Justice Department lawyer Eric Hostetler, representing the EPA, said the agency designed the rule to be cost effective and ""deepen"" the shift already taking place toward cleaner energy.""The EPA looked at what was going on in the real world,"" he said, noting that most states are already shifting the make-up of their electric generation.    In comments indicating support for the government's position, Judge Judith Rogers, appointed to the court by former President Bill Clinton, said the EPA should not close its eyes to trends in the electric sector which have seen utilities diversify their energy mix.""You can't survive in this market unless you do that,"" she said. Some of the other Democratic appointees voiced similar sentiments indicating they did not think the regulations constituted a major shift as the challengers argue.
The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. Power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions.  The Clean Power Plan is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged to reach at U.N. climate talks in Paris last December. The fate of the Clean Power Plan was thrown into question on Feb. 9 when the Supreme Court made a surprise 5-4 decision to grant a request by the challengers to put the rule on hold while the appeals court considered the matter.The eventual appeals court ruling could decide the case, even if it goes to the Supreme Court. The Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left the court ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals. A 4-4 ruling by the high court would leave in place the appeals court ruling.
GARLAND STEPS ASIDE
The case is being heard by 10 judges rather than 11 because the court's chief judge, Merrick Garland, has recused himself from the case. Garland is Obama's nominee to replace Scalia. A 5-5 ruling would leave the regulations in place. A ruling is unlikely before the end of the year and possibly not until after Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. The outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election could be pivotal for the regulations. If Republican Donald Trump wins, the government could reverse the rules or decline to appeal to the Supreme Court should the appeals court strike them down. If Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected, the losing side in the appeals court ruling could be expected to take the case to the Supreme Court.If the case does reach the high court, it may not make it in time for the justices to hear it during the court term that begins next Monday and ends in June.

CHICAGO Bonds sold by U.S. states, cities, schools and other issuers in the municipal market could be held as liquid assets by banks under legislation introduced on Tuesday in the U.S. Senate, bolstering the case for purchasing the debt while helping financial institutions weather market crises.The bipartisan measure would classify high-quality municipal bonds at the same level as corporate debt, allowing banks to use munis to comply with new 30-day federal liquidity requirements.Federal rules approved in 2014 and effective next year are aimed at ensuring big banks will be able to access sufficient cash during a financial crisis. But the rules excluded muni bonds from the types of securities that count as high quality liquid assets, or HQLAs. Muni debt issuers fear the exclusion would deter banks from buying muni debt, hurting their ability to fund everything from schools and bridges to water treatment plants and hospitals.
""If banks retreat from the muni-bond market, it could choke off a critical source of investment on which our cities and localities rely. This bill protects the stability of our markets while providing continued access to muni bonds for local governments,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement.  Schumer, along with Senators Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, and Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, led a group sponsoring the legislation.
Putting munis on par with corporate debt ""would be acceptable,"" according to Washington State Treasurer James McIntire, president of the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), which has been pushing for the inclusion of munis under the rules. 
A House bill would also allow banks to count munis toward banks' liquidity but at a higher face value, 85 percent, versus 50 percent in the Senate bill, according to NAST. (Reporting by Karen Pierog; editing by Daniel Bases, Bernard Orr)"

A Kansas judge extended voting rights through the Nov. 8 election of about 17,500 people who registered to vote at motor vehicle offices, court documents showed on Tuesday in one of the cases highlighting a political battle over identification laws enacted in Republican-led states.The ruling impacts people who submitted voter applications through Kansas motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of U.S. citizenship. The ruling by Judge Larry Hendricks of the third judicial court in Shawnee, Kansas, extends the temporary injunction he issued last month. Under a state law that took effect in 2013, they were required to present a document such as a birth certificate.The judge's ruling made on Friday said that the Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach, must instruct election officials to allow the around 17,500 residents to ""...vote for all offices on the ballot and to count all the votes cast on that ballot.""Kobach, a Republican who has become a national leader in pushing for anti-immigration and voting changes, said on Tuesday that his office would continue with the case. Hendricks has not made a final ruling.   
""The state will proceed with discovery as directed by the court. As is normal, the temporary injunction remains in place until a final order is issued by Judge Hendricks,"" Kobach said in a statement.Kansas' law is one of the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Opponents, mostly Democrats, say they discriminate against minorities.The American Civil Liberties Union has argued that the statute conflicts with a federal law designed to make it easier to register to vote while getting a driver's license. 
Kobach asked the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to place on hold a decision in May by a lower-court judge ordering the state to begin registering the roughly 17,500 residents affected by the law. [nL1N19301N] In requesting the stay, the state said the order to begin to register voters would ""result in extraordinary confusion on November 8, 2016.""
But the Denver-based court rejected this argument in June.The law will not affect the state's status as a safe Republican stronghold in the presidential election being contested by Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.

By Timothy Mclaughlin
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO A federal judge in Illinois on Tuesday blocked same-day registration at polling places in the state's most populous counties, saying a law enacted last year disproportionately favored urban voters over their rural counterparts.The ruling resulted from a federal court lawsuit brought in August by a group aligned with a conservative think tank challenging a state law allowing Election Day voter registration at polling places in counties with populations of 100,000 or more.""The application of this legislation favors the urban citizen and dilutes the vote of the rural citizen,"" Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan of the Northern District of Illinois wrote in his opinion on Tuesday, six weeks before the Nov. 8 election.The Chicago-based Liberty Justice Center, which filed the lawsuit, argued the population threshold unconstitutionally discriminated against voters in less populated counties and boosted Democrats in heavily Democratic Cook County, where Chicago is located. ""The court ruled that if Illinois is going to have Election Day voter registration at polling places, it should be available statewide - and it should be fair,"" Jacob Huebert, a senior attorney for the Liberty Justice Center, or LJC, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Maura Possley, a spokeswoman for the state Attorney General's Office, was not immediately available to comment on whether there would be an appeal. LJC was founded by the Illinois Policy Institute, which keeps its donors secret, but Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, who took office in January 2015, has publicly acknowledged giving the group at least $500,000 over a period of years. 
The law, passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, allowed Election Day voter registration for the first time, including at polling places.But the section of the law pertaining to polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more.Democratic state Senator Don Harmon said in a statement on Tuesday he was disappointed by the decision, which came on National Voter Registration Day, calling it a ""blatantly political effort to quell participation in Illinois elections.""    
Civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, also expressed unhappiness with the ruling. ""We are concerned about the impact of this decision, changing the rules of voting so close to this hotly contested election,"" Edwin Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois said in a statement.

WASHINGTON The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it was providing an additional $364 million in humanitarian assistance to help Syrians caught up in the country's civil war, bringing total U.S. humanitarian spending for Syria to about $5.9 billion.Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration Anne Richard said the funding would help provide food, shelter, safe drinking water, medical care and other support for millions of Syrian refugees and the communities that host them.Richard told a State Department briefing about three-quarters of the additional funding would help people still inside Syria and the rest would assist Syrians who have fled the country.She also said the United States had admitted some 85,000 refugees over the past fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That figure included about 12,500 Syrian refugees, exceeding the administration's goal of 10,000, she said.State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the push for additional humanitarian aid funds came in part because of deteriorating conditions in Aleppo after the collapse of a ceasefire sponsored by the United States and Russia.
The forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have launched a massive push against rebel-held areas of the city, where some 250,000 civilians are believed to be trapped. Intensive bombing has killed hundreds of people, many of whom died in buildings collapsed by bunker-buster bombs.""Until the past few weeks we felt like we were on a firm path towards a possible diplomatic resolution to this. We still believe that's possible,"" Toner told a briefing.""That doesn't mean we're not mindful ... of the tremendous humanitarian suffering that's going on right now in Aleppo. And that's why we're working so hard to ramp up our assistance,"" he added.
While saying the United States continued to seek a diplomatic resolution of the problem, he left the door open to other action.""We'll continue to weigh all options. Those discussions are ongoing. I don't want to rule anything out, but right now we're focused on the diplomatic one,"" Toner said.
He noted the United States has warned that failure to achieve a ceasefire could lead to an escalation of the conflict.""We cannot dictate what other countries ... may or may not decide to do in terms of supporting certain groups within Syria,"" Toner said. ""You may have a further deterioration on either side ... and by deterioration I mean more arming and more conflict between them, and intensification of the conflict.""

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A stop-gap funding bill to avoid a federal government shutdown later this week failed to garner enough votes to move forward in the Senate on Tuesday, with Democrats and Republicans both opposing the measure.The must-pass continuing resolution, or CR, which would keep federal agencies operating from Saturday through Dec. 9, received only 45 of the 60 votes needed to limit debate and be considered for passage by the 100-seat Republican-controlled Senate. Forty Democrats and two independents opposed the CR because it lacked a $220 million aid package to address the drinking-water crisis in Flint, Michigan. It also drew opposition from 13 Republicans, including Senator Ted Cruz, the former presidential candidate.Senate leaders said they would explore alternatives to avoid a shutdown.  Without an extension, many federal agencies will run out of operating funds when the government fiscal year expires at midnight on Friday.
The bill includes $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus and $500 million for flood relief in Louisiana and other states.""This is a 10-week funding bill. Its contents command broad support. It contains zero controversial riders,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said before the vote.Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives vowed to oppose the resolution until Republicans agree to a Flint aid package that the Senate passed by a 95-3 margin this month as part of a separate water resources bill.
Flint, a city with over 100,000 people, has had lead-tainted drinking water for more than two years. Democrats, who say it is unfair to aid flood-ravaged areas and not Flint, want Republicans to include Flint aid in the CR or a version of the water resources bill that the House will vote on this week. Republicans say they will consider Flint later. Both sides say the aid package is paid for.""There is no excuse - none - for not including this provision,"" said Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat.
McConnell told reporters he would consider the possibility of removing the flood-relief provision from the CR to win support from Democrats.""Let's see him do it,"" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said when asked about McConnell's remarks.Reasons for Republican opposition ranged from disapproval of Zika funding in the measure to frustration over the absence of provisions to boost the U.S. Export-Import Bank and block international oversight of the internet.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A senior U.S. Justice Department official who oversaw efforts to prosecute Islamic State sympathizers and pursue cyber criminals is leaving the Obama administration next month, he told Reuters on Tuesday.Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, chief of the national security division at the Justice Department, is departing on Oct. 15, less than a month before the U.S. presidential election.    The departure comes as the Obama administration has struggled to develop clear guidelines on how to pursue hacking amid growing threats posed by foreign nation-states and criminal groups.In an interview, Carlin, 43, declined to say where he was headed next. He intends to spend time with his family before starting a new job, likely involved in cyber security, he said.Carlin, who has served in government for more than 15 years, oversaw a range of prominent cases in three and a half years since assuming an acting rank of the Justice Department's top national security lawyer in March 2013, including the prosecution of one of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers. He was confirmed full-time to the position in a 99-1 vote by the U.S. Senate in April 2014. 
Carlin focused on pursuing cyber criminals during his tenure running the national security division. His tenure included the unprecedented indictment of five Chinese military hackers in 2014 for alleged hacking into six U.S. companies in order to steal trade secrets, and the indictment of Iranian hackers earlier this year for alleged hacks on U.S. financial institutions and a New York dam.In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Carlin was a ""trusted and tireless leader"" who ""used all the tools at his disposal to enhance our public safety and uphold our national security.""
Carlin will be replaced by Mary McCord, principal deputy assistant attorney general, on an acting basis, the Justice Department said.Through a combination of legal cases, diplomatic sanctions and an effort to publicly name and shame hacking adversaries, Carlin sought to tame what he often called the wild west of cyberspace, where international norms for appropriate cyber activity are nascent or nonexistent.""We've laid a strong foundation in cyber, but we've got to do more, faster, given the state of the threat,"" Carlin told Reuters. He said he hoped the next presidential administration could further ""institutionalize"" consequences from cyber crime.
Most recently Carlin announced this month the formation of a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other Internet-connected tools.Carlin's appointment in early 2014 coincided with territorial gains by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria that propelled the militant group to global notoriety. Since then, the department has prosecuted dozens of people on counts related to Islamic State: more than 100 people have been charged since 2014 in public federal cases. Under Carlin, the national security division has also ramped up the Justice Department's efforts to combat what it sees as a rising threat from domestic anti-government extremists.

WASHINGTON Opponents of a bill that would allow lawsuits against Saudi Arabia's government over the Sept. 11 attacks kept up their fight against the measure on Tuesday, a day before the U.S. Senate is expected to oppose President Barack Obama's veto, allowing the bill to become law.Opponents circulated a letter from Ash Carter, Obama's Secretary of Defense, saying that the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,"" known as JASTA, posed risks for U.S. forces abroad.""While we are sympathetic to the intent of JASTA, its potential second- and third-order consequences could be devastating to the Department and its Service members and could undermine our important counterterrorism efforts abroad,"" Carter wrote to Representative Mac Thornberry.As Reuters reported on Friday, Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has circulated a letter to his fellow House of Representatives Republicans saying that he will vote to sustain Obama's veto and urging them to do the same.
Obama vetoed the legislation on Friday. If Congress gets enough votes to override the veto for the first time since Obama became president in 2009 the bill would become law.It takes two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and House to override a veto. The legislation passed the Senate and House without opposition, in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Riyadh, that the hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government.
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.While a few lawmakers have expressed concerns about the implications of the bill, it still has strong support, among both Republicans and Obama's fellow Democrats.
Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, told reporters on Tuesday she would vote to override.She said the vote was about giving a day in court to survivors and relatives of victims of the 2001 attacks, not a rebuke of Obama. ""It isn't anti-president,"" she said.  (Additional reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Sandra Maler)"
