By Caroline Humer and Emily Stephenson

When former President Bill Clinton called parts of Obamacare ""crazy,"" he put his wife Hillary Clinton on the defensive and gave much-needed ammunition to her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, who wants to scrap it.Bill Clinton said this month that while millions more Americans now have insurance coverage under President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law, small businesses and some families are still ""getting killed"" by surging healthcare costs. He later clarified that he was not criticizing the entire  initiative, he was just making an argument for fixing it. Still, Clinton's comments may not have been so crazy. He put a spotlight on an uncomfortable truth: after six years, billions of dollars and a sweeping reform that stands as Obama's single biggest domestic policy achievement, health care is still unaffordable for many Americans.Americans are growing increasingly anxious about rising healthcare costs, and critics of the law have said it is not living up to its promises. Two of the nation's largest health insurers, Aetna and United Healthcare, are also pulling out of the state-based health insurance exchanges that are the best-known creations of Obamacare.Clinton says she wants to save the best of Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, while reducing costs. Trump says it is an expensive ""disaster"" that is on track to implode in 2017. He wants to replace it with something cheaper.Whoever wins the presidency on Nov. 8 will likely face pressure to move quickly to reshape a healthcare initiative that affects millions of Americans.WHY CONSERVATIVES THINK OBAMACARE IS CRAZY
Republicans opposed Obamacare from the start, labeling it a government intrusion into the healthcare market.Some of them say the individual exchanges where Americans shop online for coverage are already in a ""death spiral."" They warn that with fewer consumers using the exchanges, more health insurers will exit them, sending premiums even higher, and further deterring people from signing up.As the U.S. population ages, U.S. spending on healthcare - $2.9 trillion in 2014 - is projected to rise to more than one-fifth of the nation's gross domestic product. Spending rates under Obamacare did slow for a time, but they are on the rise again.
Trump has proposed getting rid of the exchanges and setting up tax-free health savings accounts for people with high-deductible insurance plans. He has also said he would set up state-based high-risk pools for people with medical conditions that make it hard to get coverage on their own. He also wants to allow companies to sell insurance across state lines to boost competition and drive down prices.His advisers say he would draw on a plan proposed by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, which includes a refundable tax credit to help Americans buy individual plans.Republicans, like Trump, also want to change how they fund Medicaid, which serves poor families. Obamacare increased federal funding to states that expanded the program to more people with low incomes. Now Trump wants to limit funding by switching to pre-set, block grants.Health policy experts are skeptical selling insurance across state lines would do much to rein in health insurance costs. And health wonks on both sides of the aisle said Republicans would likely balk at any proposals that threatened to yank health insurance away from 20 million people.""Even Republican members of the House and the Senate are going to end up resisting rolling back the Medicaid expansion if that means that lots of people in their states would go uninsured,"" said Jim Capretta, a health policy expert at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. 
LIBERALS DON'T THINK IT'S CRAZY, BUT...
Liberals like former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders haven't called Obamacare crazy, but Sanders does believe it doesn't go nearly far enough. During his campaign, he proposed replacing it with a single-payer insurance system he called ""Medicare for all,"" based on the government plan for elderly and disabled Americans.Hillary Clinton's plan doesn't go that far, but she would build on Obamacare by expanding tax credits for people shopping on the individual marketplaces, letting Americans buy into Medicare at a younger age, and adding a ""public option,"" or a government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers on the exchanges. She has also proposed reducing Americans' out-of-pocket expenses outside their private insurance by offering a new refundable tax credit, and she would give states more federal funding to expand Medicaid for low-income people.Two-thirds of states expanded Medicaid under the 2010 law, and that's where most of the newly insured people got coverage. Policy experts said that after Obama leaves office, more Republican-led states that objected to a plan so closely identified with Obama might be willing to expand Medicaid too. Clinton's ability to expand tax incentives likely depends on which party controls the U.S. Congress. And while some states could act independently to launch public plans on their exchanges, many Republicans view the idea as wildly expensive and would strongly resist any effort by Clinton to require them nationwide.
WHAT EVERYONE THINKS IS CRAZY - DRUG PRICES
Obamacare did little to deal with soaring drug prices for lifesaving treatments like Mylan NV's EpiPen. Democrats and Republicans say that's a problem for the next president, even though it's getting little attention on the campaign trail.Trump and Clinton both want Americans to be allowed to buy cheaper drugs from overseas (Americans pay the highest prices in the world for drugs). Former Democratic U.S. Representative Henry Waxman made a similar proposal in 2009, but he was defeated by pressure from drug companies, which would likely oppose it again. Clinton says Medicare should negotiate drug prices with companies, using its 55 million users to get a better deal. Trump made a similar call during the Republican primaries but it does not appear on his campaign website now.Some health policy experts believe drug companies would respond to lower prices for Medicare patients by raising prices for everyone else. And to negotiate better prices, Medicare would have to be willing to stop covering certain drugs, which would be unpopular, they say.Clinton has also suggested creating a commission that would watch for sudden spikes in prices of older life-saving drugs, a proposal that health policy experts said is achievable through rule making rather than legislation. She has also proposed a cap on drug co-payments.Clinton has already put Wall Street on watch. Her tweets have brought down shares of Mylan and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which helped push many institutional investors out of healthcare stocks.Drug companies are already responding to political pressure. Botox maker Allergan Inc, for example, recently committed to keeping price increases below 10 percent.

HANOI Vietnam supports U.S. ""intervention"" in the Asia-Pacific if it helps keep peace and stability, the defense ministry said, in a timely endorsement of a continued U.S. presence amid uncertainty over Washington's faltering ""pivot"".Vice defense minister, Senior Lieutenant-General Nguyen Chi Vinh, met on Monday with Cara Abercrombie, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia, and told her Vietnam backed a positive U.S. role.The general's words of support, conveyed by a normally reclusive defense ministry, come when the United States most needs them, with its ""rebalance"" - aimed at boosting its Asian foothold and tempering China's rise - now under strain in the run-up to a U.S. presidential election.Vinh ""affirmed that Vietnam will support the U.S and other partners to intervene in the region as long as it brings peace, stability and prosperity"", it said in a statement.At the dialogue, Abercrombie said the United States would not change its rebalance strategy, the statement added.
Uncertainty lingers in Asia over changes ahead at the White House and whether a new leadership would give less priority to keeping China in check as it grows increasingly assertive in the South China Sea, a waterway vital to global trade.Washington's traditional defense alliances in Southeast Asia are currently being tested, with ties with Thailand frosty since a 2014 coup and questions about the future of a tight military relationship with the Philippines under volatile new President Rodrigo Duterte, a staunch U.S. critic.Relations between the United States and Vietnam, in contrast, have warmed substantially in the past two years, much to do with jitters over the South China Sea to which Hanoi has disputes with Beijing.
The latest affirmation of those ties came after the full lifting of a U.S. lethal arms embargo on Vietnam in May, allowing closer defense links and some joint military exercises between the former enemies.Two U.S. warships earlier this month made a call at a new international port built at Vietnam's strategic Cam Ranh Bay in a brief but symbolic return for U.S. combat vessels.
The U.S. ambassador to Vietnam last week admitted the U.S. dynamism once seen in the region had ""a little bit diminished"", but said there was still appetite for U.S. involvement.Ted Osius also said a dramatic change in U.S.-Vietnam ties was ""not about to happen"" because of Philippine leader Duterte's outreach toward China.

By Joseph Ax

Republican candidates in tight races across the country have tied themselves in knots trying to decide whether to disavow or support their party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, especially since multiple sexual assault allegations against him have surfaced.But U.S. Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is in a virtual tie with his Democratic challenger in a race that could tip control of the Senate, has chosen a third option: say nothing.Toomey appears to be the only vulnerable Republican senator to have avoided answering the question of whether he will vote for Trump, even as he has denounced the billionaire real estate developer's lewd comments about women and allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior.His Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, has spent days hammering Toomey for his reticence, coining the term ""Fraidy-Pat"" and tying his candidacy to that of Trump's at every turn.But Pennsylvania political analysts say Toomey may have taken the safest path given his need to stitch together a coalition of working-class, white voters who support Trump and moderate, college-educated suburbanites who find his rhetoric distasteful.Polling averages show Trump losing the state to Hillary Clinton by a margin of 6 to 7 percentage points, while McGinty held a lead of less than 1 point in the Senate race, in polls before the Senate candidates debated on Monday.Pennsylvania has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Toomey won his seat in 2010 by just 2 percentage points.""I think for him he's making the right choice, because I think he has to have it both ways,"" said G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. ""He's between a rock and a hard place, and he's chosen to stay in the middle.""
The question of whether to back their party's presidential nominee - a non-issue in virtually any other election year - has bedeviled Republicans facing competitive races across the country, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance.Some, like Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, have rescinded their support, angering Trump's core supporters. Others, like Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, have stuck with Trump and risked losing moderate voters.A handful of Republicans, including Ayotte before she recently changed her mind, have tried to straddle the issue by withholding a formal endorsement while saying they still planned to vote for Trump.The Pennsylvania campaign, one of half a dozen close contests with the Senate up for grabs, has been the most expensive Senate race in the country, with more than $100 million from the parties and outside groups pouring into the state as of August.
McGinty, who served as an environmental adviser in former President Bill Clinton's administration, has spent months trying to link Toomey to Trump.She has redoubled her efforts over the last 10 days, as multiple women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them following the release of a video recording from 2005 in which he bragged in lewd terms about such behavior. On Thursday, for the second time since the tape became public, McGinty held a conference call for reporters to assail Toomey for what she described as his tacit support for Trump.""Senator Pat Toomey now has the distinction of being the only Senate candidate in the entire United States of America to refuse to come clean about whether or not he supports Donald Trump,"" she said. ""So, there's only one way to interpret that: Pat Toomey is still standing by Donald Trump.""
Toomey has criticized Trump's ""outrageous comments"" but has declined to say whether he will vote for him, a position he reiterated on Monday at the first of two debates with McGinty. He did, however, say he ""probably"" will announce a decision before the Nov. 8 elections, after previously suggesting he might not.In a statement, a Toomey spokesman turned the criticism around, calling McGinty a ""rubber stamp"" for the Democratic establishment in Washington.""Pat Toomey has proven he will stand up to his own party for Pennsylvania families, like on gun safety, fighting corporate welfare, or ending the Wall Street bailouts once and for all,"" the spokesman, Ted Kwong, said in an email. ""Katie McGinty can't name a single disagreement with her party, whether it's the reckless Iran deal or thousands in new middle-class tax hikes.""Charlie Gerow, a veteran Republican political consultant in Pennsylvania who is not involved in the race, said Toomey's middle-of-the-road strategy was necessary given the deficit Trump is facing in the state.Toomey, Gerow said, cannot afford to alienate Trump backers in places like southwestern Pennsylvania, even as he tries to appeal to voters in the Philadelphia and Lehigh Valley suburbs.""I think it is the best strategy among several unpalatable options,"" Gerow said. ""I don't think there was any better way to approach that dilemma."" (Reporting by Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty and Leslie Adler)"

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A senior State Department official sought to shield Hillary Clinton last year by pressuring the FBI to drop its insistence that an email on the private server she used while secretary of state contained classified information, according to records of interviews with FBI officials released on Monday.The accusation against Patrick Kennedy, the State Department's most senior manager, appears in the latest release of interview summaries from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's year-long investigation into Clinton's sending and receiving classified government secrets via her unauthorized server. Although the FBI decided against declassifying the email's contents, the claim of interference added fuel to Republicans' belief that officials in President Barack Obama's administration have sought to protect Clinton, a Democrat, from criminal liability as she seeks to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 election. The FBI recommended against bringing any charges in July and has defended the integrity of its investigation.Clinton has said her decision to use a private server in her home for her work as the U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 was a mistake and has apologized.One FBI official, whose name is redacted, told investigators that Kennedy repeatedly ""pressured"" the various officials at the FBI to declassify information in one of Clinton's emails. The email was about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, and included information that originated from the FBI, which meant that the FBI had final say on whether it would remain classified.A State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said Kennedy was not pressuring the FBI but was just trying to understand better how the FBI's classification process worked.The dispute began in the summer of 2015 as officials were busy reviewing the roughly 30,000 emails Clinton returned to the State Department ahead of their court-ordered public release in batches in 2015 and 2016.The official said the State Department's office of legal counsel called him to question the FBI's ruling that the information was classified, but the FBI stood by its decision.Soon after that call, one of the official's FBI colleagues received a call from Kennedy in which Kennedy ""asked his assistance in altering the email's classification in exchange for a 'quid pro quo.'"" The FBI official said he also joined at least two discussions in which Kennedy ""continued to pressure"" the FBI about the email. The official said Kennedy appeared to be trying to protect Clinton by minimizing the appearance of classified information in emails from the server that Clinton used while she was the country's most senior diplomat.AGENCIES SAY NO 'QUID PRO QUO""

In a separate interview summary among the 100 pages released on Monday, another unnamed FBI official confirmed a discussion of a ""quid pro quo."" He said Kennedy told him in a phone call that the FBI's classification of the email ""caused problems"" for Kennedy. The official said he told Kennedy he would look into the email, which he had not yet seen, if the State Department would consider allowing more FBI agents to be posted in Iraq in exchange. The State Department and the FBI both confirmed that a conversation about the email's classification and an increase in FBI slots in Iraq took place, but both agencies said there was no ""quid pro quo.""After a year-long FBI investigation into the server, FBI Director James Comey said in July he found that while laws governing classified information may have been broken no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges. He said, however, that Clinton and her staff had been ""extremely careless"" in handling information that had been classified to protect national security.Toner, the State Department spokesman, said there was ""no quid pro quo,"" and told reporters that it was the FBI official who raised the possibility with Kennedy of allowing more agents in Iraq during the conversation about the email.""After the conversation took place about the upgrading classification, at the end of that, there was a kind of, 'Oh, by the way, hey, we're looking at how we want more slots"" in Iraq, Toner said, calling it a ""clear pivot"" in the topic of conversation. ""No increase in FBI Iraq slots resulted from this conversation,"" he said.The FBI also confirmed both topics were raised in the same conversation, and that the FBI official who discussed the email and Iraq with Kennedy had since retired. ""Although there was never a quid pro quo, these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review,"" the FBI said in its statement, which did not say what the outcome of the review was.
TRUMP CALLS IT ""COLLUSION""
Other officials have made similar complaints to investigators of unusual pressure not to mark information as classified in Clinton's emails last year. According to earlier documents the FBI released last month, at least one official at the State Department told investigators that there was pressure by senior department officials to mislead the public about the presence of classified information in Clinton's emails ahead of their public release.A summary released on Monday showed at least two other State Department officials making similar allegations. One official who worked in the State Department's office that deals with Freedom of Information Act requests told investigators they felt ""intimidated"" by senior department officials if they suggested that any of Clinton's emails on Benghazi contained classified information, and named Kennedy as one of the officials who pressured ""employees to not label anything as classified.""The State Department has said these allegations are also false.
Ultimately, the FBI told Kennedy that declassification was not possible, according to the interview summaries, and the State Department posted it online last year marked as classified, with heavy redactions.Clinton's Republican rival for the White House, Donald Trump, posted a video online on Monday in which he said the FBI documents showed ""corruption at the highest levels.""""This is collusion between the FBI, Department of Justice and the State Department to try and make Hillary Clinton look like an innocent person when she's guilty of very high crimes,"" Trump said. Later on Monday, Trump proposed a series of ethics rules he said would crack down on government corruption, including a five-year ban on former administration officials lobbying after leaving government and a lifetime ban on senior officials lobbying for foreign governments. He said former President Bill Clinton had a five-year lobbying ban but lifted it at the end of his administration.  Obama put his own ""revolving door"" rules in place at the beginning of his time in office.Several Republican lawmakers called on Obama to investigate Kennedy and remove him from the department. Toner of the State Department said Kennedy ""has the full confidence"" of John Kerry, Clinton's successor as secretary of state.Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee's chairman, said in a statement that Obama, who is campaigning for Clinton to become his successor as president, was trying to ""shield"" Clinton and that she ""cannot be trusted"" with classified information.Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican in the U.S. Congress, referred to the FBI summaries on Twitter. ""This bears all the signs of a cover-up,"" he wrote.In 2015, Clinton repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information via her server, but since the release of the FBI report in July she has said she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the department.Robby Mook, her campaign manager, downplayed the account from the FBI interview summary, telling reporters it was ""not uncommon for officials within a department to fight over classification.""

By Colleen Jenkins
| WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. Police in North Carolina sought leads on Monday about a fire they believe was deliberately set at a local Republican headquarters over the weekend and a graffiti message warning the political party to ""leave town or else.""Investigators are treating the incident as arson. The fire caused heavy damage to the Orange County Republican Party's office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, about 40 miles (65 km) from the state capital of Raleigh. ""This is political terrorism,"" said Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party. Both Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton condemned the attack. North Carolina is considered a battleground state that could play a pivotal role in the Nov. 8 presidential contest.""We are taking this incident very seriously and have significant resources at the local, state and federal level committed to this investigation,"" Hillsborough Police Chief Duane Hampton said in a statement on Monday, asking anyone with information to come forward.Hillsborough police said a bottle containing flammable material ignited after being thrown through a front window of the headquarters between midnight and about 9 a.m. on Sunday, when a nearby business owner reported the crime.""Someone has firebombed through the window (of) the Republican party up here beside me and sprayed all over the side of my building, 'Nazi Republicans leave town or else,'"" the caller told a 911 operator in a call released on Monday.
A swastika also was spray-painted on the neighboring building, police said. They said no one was in the party office at the time, but the substance burned furniture and charred campaign signs.White House spokesman Josh Earnest praised the efforts of self-described Democrats who raised about $13,000 in an online GoFundMe campaign to help Republicans reopen the office.""That's consistent with the values that we lift up in this country,"" he said at a news briefing. ""There is no justification for the use of violence to advance a political agenda.""In a tweet on Sunday, Clinton said she was grateful no one was hurt in the attack, which she called ""horrific and unacceptable.""
Trump blamed his Democratic opponent's supporters for the crime.""Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning,"" he said on Twitter.Registered Democrats far outnumber Republicans in Orange County, according to elections board data. 
Republicans said the incident took them by surprise but left them undeterred as they started clean-up efforts at their strip-mall headquarters and worked in a bus being used as a temporary mobile office. ""We're not going to be intimated; we're not going to be cowed,"" Woodhouse said. On Monday, the Arizona Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix was evacuated for about two hours after a bomb threat was left by phone. Police said nothing was found during a search of the premises. Party officials said the call was received from an adult male at about 3:15 p.m. local time saying there was a bomb in the building and for occupants to get out.

By Joseph Ax
| NEWARK, N.J.

NEWARK, N.J. After days of complaints about traffic jams at a major New York bridge in 2013, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's associate demanded to know if lane closures were political retribution, he testified on Monday.On trial over his alleged role in the ""Bridgegate"" scandal, Bill Baroni, Christie's top political appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said he confronted fellow authority executive David Wildstein to ask whether the lane closures in September 2013 were an act of retribution against the Democratic mayor of a commuter town.""I said, 'David, tell me right now, is this true?'"" Baroni testified in federal court in Newark, where he is on trial on fraud charges. ""He looked me in the eye and said, 'Absolutely not.'""In his first day of testimony, Baroni asserted that Wildstein orchestrated the lane closures without his knowledge to punish Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, for his refusal to endorse Christie's re-election bid.Baroni also rejected Wildstein's contention that they discussed the scheme with Christie as it was unfolding.
Christie had soared to national prominence in late 2012 for his response to Superstorm Sandy and wanted to use that spotlight, and an aura of bipartisan spirit, to catapult himself towards the White House. But the scandal hurt his image and his campaign ultimately collapsed early this year, though he has always denied involvement.Baroni's story was entirely at odds with the narrative U.S. prosecutors have presented at trial. They have accused Baroni, Wildstein and former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly of conspiring to create the traffic jam to punish Sokolich.Kelly, on trial alongside Baroni, is also expected to testify. Wildstein has pleaded guilty and appeared as the government's star witness earlier in the case.
Baroni said he confronted Wildstein after receiving a letter from Sokolich suggesting the closures had ""punitive overtones.""But during cross-examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes pointed out that days before, Sokolich left him a voicemail asking ""who's mad at me?""""So the first time you heard from him, he was asking if someone was mad at him? It wasn't Thursday?"" Cortes asked.
Baroni said he believed Wildstein's representation that the George Washington Bridge lane closure was part of a traffic study and that he should not respond to Sokolich. ""I've regretted it ever since,"" Baroni said.Wildstein said he and Baroni invented the traffic study as a cover story. (Reporting by Joseph Ax; editing by Scott Malone and Cynthia Osterman)"

Kushner, the owner of the weekly New York Observer newspaper, is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka.Kushner did not respond to requests for comment. LionTree declined comment.
To set up a television network, Trump would have to negotiate with cable and satellite carriers, which can be an arduous task. It can then take years to turn a profit. Fox News Channel, the most-watched U.S. cable network, took five years to be profitable. It might be easier and less expensive for Trump to launch an online streaming service.

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's charitable foundation has stopped fundraising in New York state, the state attorney general's office said on Monday, weeks after the office warned that a failure to do so would constitute a ""continuing fraud.""    The Donald J. Trump Foundation also received an extension to file financial paperwork with the state, a spokesman for the attorney general's office said in a phone interview.The Trump campaign said in a statement: ""The Trump Foundation is cooperating with the Office of the NY AG in its investigation of the Foundation and, given the scope of the NY AG's requests, is working with the NY AG to respond in a reasonable and timely manner."" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman warned the group last month that it was in violation of a state law requiring charitable organizations that solicit outside donations to register with the office's Charities Bureau.
The organization has been under increased scrutiny following reports in the Washington Post suggesting possible improprieties within the small-scale nonprofit organization.Trump's campaign has suggested that the probe launched by Schneiderman, a Democrat, was politically motivated.
Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the Nov. 8 election, also has ties to a charitable organization, the Clinton Foundation. Trump has called it a ""pay-to-play"" operation in which the former secretary of state and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, rewarded big donors to the foundation with political access.There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. While some donors were able to obtain meetings with her or senior State Department officials, Clinton has said the fact that they had donated to the foundation did not play a role in her decision to meet with them.

By Richard Cowan
| ORLANDO

ORLANDO Ask John Mica why he sticks by Donald Trump, amid the defections of many fellow Republicans, and the U.S. congressman from central Florida instead touts his own work on easing traffic congestion in this tourism Mecca.Ask again about his support for Trump and the mild-mannered Mica shows subtle signs of becoming annoyed.Mica has become adept at tiptoeing around Trump questions as his support for the controversial presidential candidate complicates his effort to extend a 24-year reign in Congress.The race between Mica and his Democratic challenger, newcomer Stephanie Murphy, 38, could be a bellwether for Republicans who seek to support the party's presidential nominee while maintaining a safe distance from some of Trump's more controversial positions and alleged bad behavior. The course of the campaign could provide clues on whether Republicans maintain control of the House of Representatives in a year in which Trump has shaken his party and the political world with his bombast. Voters in his Orlando district ""don't care about all this garbage that's going on"" in the presidential race, says Mica, as he steers the conversation to improving healthcare for military veterans, creating jobs and expanding local airports.Mica's re-election bid is also made unusually tough because of a newly-drawn congressional district that gives Democrats hope of a win. Murphy has sought to use Mica's support for Trump against him by saying that just as Mica has stuck with Trump too long, he follows Republican leaders in Congress all too often.She ticks off Mica's support for gun positions pushed by the powerful National Rifle Association, especially after June's massacre in Orlando of 49 people at a gay nightclub.Murphy has said Mica is out of step with the reconfigured district, which she said is ""evenly split"" and not especially partisan. As Mica campaigns on his ability to deliver goods to his district in the form of job creation and infrastructure investment, Democrats are making sure to remind voters that he is aligned with the man who arguably is one of the most controversial major party presidential candidates in history.
Democrats punctuate that with a photo of Trump and Mica side-by-side at a 2014 ceremony celebrating the start of construction of a Trump hotel in Washington.A MIRROR FOR THE COUNTRY
Early trends of mail-in ballots in the 7th congressional district point to a competitive race.In Orange County, 10,975 Democrats have cast early votes compared to only 6,732 Republicans and 3,525 independents.Orlando may be famous as the home of the fantasy land that is Disney World. But Mica's district is a real-life mirror of America.
Its residents are politically divided, in this case about evenly split between Republicans and Democrats and with a strong dose of independent voters.Furthermore, as in other parts of the country, Latino voters in central Florida are building political muscle.As Mica, 73, wages a ground-war that has him knocking on constituents' doors in Orlando's heat and humidity, he walks a fine line.He is a grandson of immigrants who boasts of being ""hard nosed"" against ""amnesty"" for the 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. But he suggests there could be exceptions to Trump's promise to deport them all.Building a wall on the southern border with Mexico, a linchpin of Trump's campaign, should be done ""where it makes sense,"" Mica said during an interview with Reuters amid a lunchtime crowd of mainly Hispanic customers at the Lechonera El Barrio restaurant.
Still, as prominent Republicans offended by the tenor of Trump's campaign, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, distance themselves from Trump, Mica stands firm, saying, ""I'm pretty much a party loyalist.""Such loyalty can come with a price, though, and Mica acknowledges, ""I'm stuck with the Republican (presidential) nominee"" whom he said made ""vulgar, reprehensible"" remarks about sexual advances on women captured in a 2005 videotape that recently became public.But there is an upside to supporting Trump as well. Mica said some supporters want to know that he is sticking with the nominee. ""These people are very passionate. They're going to be voting,"" he said.Miriam Ramirez, a former Republican legislator in Puerto Rico who lives part-time in Florida and has been stumping for Mica, worries Trump could complicate Mica's re-election. Asked whether Mica's appeal to the district's booming Puerto Rican population could suffer because of his association with Trump,  Ramirez said, ""Yes, especially in lower-income families.""Murphy, who came to the United States as a child after she and her family escaped Vietnam and were adrift in the South China Sea before being rescued by the U.S. Navy, said Trump's ""hateful and divisive rhetoric"" has voters worried that he ""will act on the prejudices he has laid out"" if elected.""Voters choose political leaders they believe will do the best for them but also represent the best in them,"" Murphy said, challenging Mica's support of Trump.One thing seems certain in the closing weeks of the campaign: Mica is staying on message as he tiptoes around Trump, instead talking about the ""interstate (highway) massive rebuild"" and the airport in Seminole County that ""had weeds growing up...out of the runway"" and now supports thousands of jobs.
