WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. Republicans extended their majority of U.S. governorships on Tuesday as 12 states voted for chief executives, though the high-profile race in North Carolina was too close to call and the outcome may not be known until next week.Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper declared victory after gaining a razor-thin lead over incumbent Republican Governor Pat McCrory, who has been dogged by the backlash against a law he signed that restricts bathroom rights for transgender people and limits non-discrimination protections for gays and lesbians. But McCrory told supporters early on Wednesday that the process of tallying an unknown number of provisional ballots could take until Nov. 18.""The election is not over in North Carolina,"" McCrory said.About 4,400 votes separated the candidates with all precincts reporting, according to unofficial election results from the state.
The state extended voting times in eight Durham County precincts after problems with electronic voting rolls there earlier in the day. The county then uploaded about 90,000 early voting results late Tuesday, prompting concerns among Republicans as Cooper overtook McCrory in the ballot count.Elsewhere in the country, Republicans picked up seats in Missouri and Vermont in races that had been considered toss-ups. A winner had not been declared as of early Wednesday in the competitive race in New Hampshire.The outcomes of votes across the country were not expected, however, to dramatically alter the 31-18 advantage Republicans had over Democrats in the states' executive offices going into Election Day. Alaska has an independent governor. 
Republican Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott clinched his victory in Vermont over Democrat Sue Minter, a former state transportation secretary, despite the state voting overwhelmingly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. In West Virginia, where Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won by a landslide, billionaire businessman Jim Justice held on to the governor's seat for Democrats by beating Republican state Senate President Bill Cole.
Republicans successfully defended the governorship in Indiana for a fourth straight term. Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb, who had trailed slightly in polls, won the race left open after Trump tapped Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate.Pence offered his congratulations to Holcomb on Twitter, saying the governor-elect was ""the leader who will keep our state moving forward.""Republicans also celebrated in Kentucky, where they gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, the last Democratic-held chamber in the South. The takeover ended 95 years of a Democratic majority in that chamber. (Additional reporting by Steve Bittenbender in Louisville, Kentucky; Editing by Alistair Bell and Jonathan Oatis)"

By Yeganeh Torbati
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's election as president raises the prospect the United States will pull out of the nuclear pact it signed last year with Iran, alienating Washington from its allies and potentially freeing Iran to act on its ambitions.Outgoing President Barack Obama's administration touted the deal, a legacy foreign policy achievement, as a way to suspend Tehran's suspected drive to develop atomic weapons. In return Obama, a Democrat, agreed to a lifting of most sanctions.The deal, harshly opposed by Republicans in Congress, was reached as a political commitment rather than a treaty ratified by lawmakers, making it vulnerable to a new U.S. president, such as Trump, who might disagree with its terms.A Republican, Trump ran for the White House opposing the deal but contradictory statements made it unclear how he would act. In an upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump won on Tuesday and will succeed Obama on Jan. 20.A businessman-turned-politician who has never held public office, Trump called the nuclear pact a ""disaster"" and ""the worst deal ever negotiated"" during his campaign and said it could lead to a ""nuclear holocaust."" In a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC in March, Trump declared that his ""Number-One priority"" would be to ""dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.""  He said he would have negotiated a better deal, with longer restrictions, but somewhat paradoxically, he criticized remaining U.S. sanctions that prevent American companies from dealing with Iran.By contrast, he has conceded it would be hard to destroy a deal enshrined in a United Nations resolution. In August 2015, he said he would not ""rip up"" the nuclear deal, but that he would ""police that contract so tough they don't have a chance.""Iran denies ever having considered developing atomic weapons. But experts said any U.S. violation of the deal would allow Iran also to pull back from its commitments to curb nuclear development. Those commitments include reducing the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds, capping its level of uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bomb-grade material, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile from around 10,000 kg to 300 kg for 15 years, and submitting to international inspections to verify its compliance.
'DIVISIVE DEAL'
""Say goodbye to the Iran deal,"" said Richard Nephew, a former U.S. negotiator with Iran now at Columbia University.""There is very little likelihood that it stays, either because of a deliberate decision to tear it up by Trump, or steps that the U.S. takes which prompt an Iranian walk back.""The spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency: ""Iran is prepared for any change,"" adding that Iran would try to stand by the deal.
The nuclear deal was divisive in Iran, with hardliners opposed to better relations with the West arguing that pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani was giving up too much of the country's nuclear infrastructure for too little relief.Rouhani said on Wednesday the U.S. election results would have no effect on Tehran's policies, state news agency IRNA quoted him as saying. [nL8N1DA46H]Some of Washington's closest Middle East allies have been skeptical of the nuclear deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been outright hostile. Gulf leaders say the deal has emboldened Iran's pursuit of regional hegemony in part through support for proxy groups fueling regional conflicts.Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, whose power supersedes that of Rouhani, regularly criticizes the United States and says it should not be trusted, but ultimately assented to the terms of the deal, known by its acronym JCPOA.
KHAMENEI BIG WINNER
""The big winner in the aftermath of a Trump victory is Iran's Supreme Leader,"" said Suzanne Maloney, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution.""He will have the most cartoonish American enemy, he will exult in the (hopefully brief) crash of the American economy, and he will be able to walk away from Iran's obligations under the JCPOA while pinning the responsibility on Washington.""Further complicating any Trump effort to renegotiate the deal is that it is a multilateral agreement involving U.S. allies in Europe as well as fellow world powers Russia and China. European and Asian firms have been returning to Iran and making major investments there, meaning the United States would likely be alone in pulling out of the deal, possibly isolating it from its partners.On Wednesday, the head of gas, renewables and power for French oil and gas company Total TOTF.PA in Iran said Trump's election would have no impact on investments [nP6N1CW004].Khamenei has already promised to ""set fire"" to the nuclear deal if the West violates it. Iran has repeatedly complained it has not received benefits promised. Though European companies have been eager to explore business prospects in Iran, few deals have been enacted in part because European banks have been reluctant to finance deals involving Iran.""As to whether he can negotiate a 'better' deal, it takes two (or seven) sides to agree to begin that process, something I rate as highly unlikely,"" said Zachary Goldman, executive director of the Center on Law and Security at New York University and a former U.S. Treasury official.""And if we walk away from the deal I think we will be in the worst of all worlds - Iran will feel freed from its commitments and we may be blamed for the deal falling apart.""

By Michael Martina and Sue-Lin Wong
| BEIJING

BEIJING Donald Trump's upset election victory cracks open pressing strategic and economic questions in U.S.-China ties, and has likely surprised and worried Chinese leaders, who prize stability in relations between the two powers.Trump had lambasted China throughout the campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator his first day in office.He has also questioned U.S. security commitments to allies and undercut long-held bipartisan U.S. foreign policy norms, such as suggesting that Japan develop nuclear weapons, all stances that if he follows through on could upset the regional security balance in Asia.That unpredictability is not an ideal election outcome for China's stability-obsessed Communist Party, especially as it seeks smooth U.S. relations at a time of daunting reform challenges at home, a slowing economy, and a leadership reshuffle of its own that will put a new party elite around President Xi Jinping in late 2017.Beijing tends to prefer incumbent party successors with consistent policy lines. Trump's lack of a governance track record and his unorthodox take on long-held Republican priorities could prove a headache for Chinese officials.Jia Qingguo, the dean of the School of International Relations at China's elite Peking University and a government advisor, called Trump ""a symbol of uncertainty"".""China hopes the United States' future policy would be more certain because in this way, we can prepare and deal with it,"" Jia said.""DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD""
Certainly, a Trump White House presents China with a range of new opportunities. Decades of Hillary Clinton's criticism of China's human rights record and her insistence on U.S. interests in the South China Sea have made her a well-known, and not well-liked figure among Beijing's ruling elite.Chinese experts say some in Beijing believe Trump will prove a pragmatic businessman, willing to deal with China.
""Any type of protectionist policy pursued will be a double-edged sword,"" said Ruan Zongze, a former Chinese diplomat now with the China Institute of International Studies, a think-tank affiliated with the Foreign Ministry. ""I think he will be very careful about this,""Moreover, Trump's criticism of U.S. allies, including Japan, for free-riding on U.S. security guarantees, has offered China the tantalizing prospect of an American retrenchment from Asia.""From a long-term perspective, this gives China more space to prove itself and it takes off some of the pressure on China,"" said Wang Yiwei, Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University.But a U.S. pullback in the region would raise other questions for Beijing, such as the uncomfortable prospect of a potential Japanese military expansion.While Trump has vowed to build-up the U.S. military, in particular the Navy, he has said little publicly about his approach to Beijing's increasingly assertive role in the South China Sea. ""Trump's  foreign policy approach does seem to be somewhat inchoate and therefore much will depend on who he appoints and who is willing to serve,"" said Dean Cheng, a China expert at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.
""WHO IS THE REAL DONALD TRUMP?""
The U.S. and Chinese business community alike has been unsettled at the prospect of a Trump presidency.Gloria Liu, partner at law firm DLA Piper, which specializes in Chinese mergers and acquisitions, said: ""The US has been the No. 1 destination for outbound Chinese investments. It's hard to see Chinese firms making the US their first choice. At a minimum, there will be a period of wait and see.""U.S. business groups have grown more pessimistic about Chinese restrictions on market barriers and state subsidized efforts to replace foreign technology with home-grown products. 
But they also worry that Trump's China tariff pledges will undermine the economic interdependence that helps the two countries weather serious security differences.Executives are holding their breath.""Everybody is going to be asking who is the real Donald Trump and how much of this campaign rhetoric is going to find itself into reality,"" said Randal Phillips, who heads Mintz Group's office in Beijing.A Beijing-based state energy executive involved in overseas investment said the market was ""very worried"" by Trump's victory and selling for ""risk aversion"".""Trump increases the unpredictability in U.S. policies over regulatory approvals, the likelihood of tighter scrutiny on Chinese investment ... and also over oil and gas exports,"" said the executive, who asked not to be named. James Zimmerman, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China and a prominent Clinton backer, said ""talking tough is a lot easier than thinking tough and making tough decisions, which is what presidents actually have to do"".""Isolating or penalizing China will not serve America's interests,"" he said in a statement.Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidency, state TV reported on Wednesday, telling him the two biggest economies in the world shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity.""I place great importance on the China-U.S. relationship, and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,"" Xi told Trump by phone.
