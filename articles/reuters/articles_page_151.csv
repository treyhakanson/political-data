WASHINGTON Former Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders said Sunday he would have preferred to see Hillary Clinton select someone like Senator Elizabeth Warren for the vice presidential spot over Senator Tim Kaine.""I have known Tim Kaine for a number of years...Tim is a very, very smart guy. He is very nice guy,"" Sanders said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
""He is more conservative than I am. Would I have preferred to see somebody like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton? Yes, I would have.""

By John Whitesides and Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON/TAMPA, Fla.

WASHINGTON/TAMPA, Fla. Hillary Clinton named U.S. Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate on Friday, opting for an experienced governing partner who will help her present the Democratic ticket as a steady alternative to the unpredictable campaign of Republican presidential rival Donald Trump.The selection of Kaine, a self-described ""boring"" Virginian with a reputation for low-key competence, could appeal to independents and moderates, but it quickly angered liberal groups that object to his advocacy for an Asian free-trade pact.The Spanish-speaking former Virginia governor and Richmond mayor fit Clinton's long-stated criteria that the vice presidential choice be a capable and reliable partner who is ready to take over the presidency if necessary.Clinton made the announcement via Twitter and a text message to supporters after the first day of a two-day campaign swing in Florida. She called Kaine to tell him about 40 minutes before the announcement, and called President Barack Obama shortly after Kaine.""I'm thrilled to tell you this first: I've chosen Sen. Tim Kaine as my running mate. Welcome him to my team,"" she said in her text message.Kaine, 58, edged out two other finalists - Cory Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, according to a Democratic source familiar with the discussions.Clinton also bypassed candidates who would have generated more excitement among liberal and Hispanic activists, including progressive favorite U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and two Hispanic members of Obama's Cabinet, Julian Castro and Thomas Perez.The former secretary of state will be formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election at next week's Democratic convention in Philadelphia. She leads Trump in many opinion polls.Clinton's choice of a running mate could give her campaign momentum heading into the convention, as the fight for the White House begins a more than three-month push to the finish.            Clinton, 68, acknowledged in an interview earlier this week that even Kaine admits he is boring, and said she did not mind.""I love that about him,"" she told Charlie Rose of CBS News and PBS. ""He's never lost an election. He was a world-class mayor, governor and senator and is one of the most highly respected senators I know.""A campaign official said Clinton was impressed with Kaine's down-to-earth style when she campaigned with him in Virginia last week. Afterwards, Kaine went back to her house in Washington, D.C., for a 90-minute evening meeting.Two days later, Kaine and his wife, Anne, joined Clinton in New York for lunch, along with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea and Chelsea's husband. Kaine was the only vice presidential candidate to have a private family lunch during the vetting process, the official said.
""GLAD TO SEE THEM""
Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, who led the search, offered her advice. ""It needs to be someone who whenever they walk into a room you are glad to see them and want to have them as part of any conversation,"" the campaign official quoted Podesta telling her.Kaine's first appearance with Clinton will be on Saturday at an event in Miami, a campaign aide said.""Just got off the phone with Hillary. I'm honored to be her running mate. Can't wait to hit the trail tomorrow in Miami,"" Kaine said on Twitter.Liberal groups, which had pressured Clinton not to pick Kaine because of his support for fast-track authority for the White House to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, were dismayed by the choice.
Critics of the Asia free-trade deal, including Trump and Clinton's Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders, say it would be unfair to U.S. workers and kill jobs. Clinton praised the deal when she was secretary of state, but has since distanced herself from it.""Republicans will run hard against Democrats on trade this year. Unfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue,"" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.Hispanic activists also may be annoyed with the pick of Kaine given that Latino candidates were again passed over, though some Latino advocacy groups praised the choice.""She has chosen a running mate that has a track record of advocating and fighting for the issues that affect the Latino community and our nation: immigration, healthcare, women's rights and the environment,"" said Ben Monterroso, executive director of Mi Familia Vota. Top Republicans were quick to criticize Clinton's choice.The Trump campaign called Kaine ""an ethically challenged insider"" and called Clinton and Kaine a ""Status Quo"" ticket. ""If you think Crooked Hillary and Corrupt Kaine are going to change anything in Washington, it's just the opposite,"" campaign aide Jason Miller said in a statement.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus condemned the pick, saying Clinton spent the past week pandering to Sanders and grassroots Democrats, and now ""has chosen someone who holds positions that she's spent the entire primary trying to get to the left of.""
But Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has been critical of Trump, said on Twitter that he was trying to count the ways he hated Tim Kaine. ""Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend,"" Flake said. Kaine could help Clinton in Virginia, a heavily contested swing state, and choosing Kaine will not cost Democrats a seat in the Senate, where Republicans now hold a majority. Virginia's Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton friend and ally, will name a replacement for Kaine if he and Clinton win the White House.Some Democrats who know Kaine well dismissed fears that he lacks the toughness to stand up to Republican attacks, given how deftly Trump chewed up ""low-energy"" Jeb Bush and ""little Marco"" Rubio in the Republican primaries.    ""It's not the Donald Trump sledgehammer. But he's not a shrinking violet,"" said Luke Albee, a former chief of staff to Democrat Mark Warner, the senior U.S. senator from Virginia.    Albee, who has watched Kaine up close over the years, added, ""I wouldn't mistake a thoughtful and genial disposition for an inability to really forcefully articulate differences.""Kaine has good relations with senators from the opposing party, according to senior Senate Republican congressional aides. One aide speculated Kaine would be effective in reaching out to congressional Republicans if he becomes vice president, a role that Vice President Joe Biden has played for Obama.Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, has been a leading voice calling for a formal authorization of war against the Islamic State militant group. He played an important role in securing congressional review of the 2015 international deal on Iran's nuclear program, although he eventually backed it.He has a track-record of backing liberal causes such as ending across-the-board automatic budget cuts and providing a pathway to citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants.       Kaine, a Catholic who became fluent in Spanish speaker while serving as a missionary in Honduras, has expressed personal opposition to abortion, but has a public record in support of abortion rights.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pulled nearly even with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for the first time since May, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken over the course of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week.The July 18-22 national online poll found that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 38 percent supported Trump. Given the poll's credibility interval of about 4 percentage points, Trump and Clinton should be considered to be about even in the race.MORE ELECTION 2016 COVERAGE:
Commentary: Can Roger Ailes help Trump win like he helped Nixon in 1968?Sanders says would prefer Elizabeth Warren over Kaine as vice presidential pickObama's half-brother says he will vote for TrumpJust before Republicans opened the convention on Monday, Trump had trailed Clinton by nearly 10 percentage points in the poll.
The New York businessman-turned-politician formally accepted the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election during a convention at which the party at times struggled to show unity.The week started with a dustup between convention leaders and delegates who wanted to change the party's rules to derail Trump's nomination. Later in the week, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who dropped out of the nomination race in May, refused to endorse Trump in a prime-time speech.Yet, on the final night of the convention, Republicans gave Trump a standing ovation as he pledged to take back a country that he said is plagued by crime, terrorism and ineffective leadership.
Party conventions are partly meant to introduce the candidate to the country, and nominees tend to get a boost in opinion polls afterward. In 2012, then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney rose by about 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos poll after his party's convention.Clinton, who is expected to be formally nominated by her party at its convention in Philadelphia next week, has led Trump most of the year in the poll.
The last time Trump drew about even with Clinton was in mid-May, after his last two rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out of the race and party leaders started to get behind his campaign.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in English in all 50 states with 1,036 likely voters.

By Alex Dobuzinskis
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES Dr. Linda Liau works with the precision of a master, peering into a patient's head with magnifying loupes as she removes a brain tumor.When Liau was called into an emergency room as a surgeon more than 20 years ago to help treat a car crash victim, another member of the medical team assumed she was a nurse.Even today, the 49-year-old neurosurgeon sometimes gets a surprised reaction from new patients who were expecting a man. Such an assumption is common in career fields dominated by men.Neurosurgery, welding, venture capitalism, construction, film directing and the electrical trade - these are six jobs where U.S. women have made inroads but are still vastly outnumbered.And one position, U.S. president, has never been filled by a woman. With presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton seeking to become the first to break that barrier, several women in career fields made up mostly of men told Reuters that they saw her candidacy as significant.""I think ultimately the goal would be to be gender-blind completely, so the fact that we're even talking about having a female president as a novelty is, in a way, sad,"" Liau said.On a construction site, Joundi White, 31, has often been reminded of her gender. Early in her career, the reminders were pet names such as ""sweetheart"" and ""honey."" Now, she can rarely shake the sense that she is outnumbered.""I eat lunch alone,"" White said. ""I don't have people to relate to at work. ""Don't get me wrong, I identify more with the guys, but to them, ultimately, I'm just a girl.""Wearing a hard hat, White passes under heavy steel beams, walking along the commuter train tracks she is helping build in her working-class neighborhood in southern Los Angeles. 
Welder Darlene Thompson, 45, is also no stranger to the construction site, or to the hostility that she says women often encounter in the field. These days, she teaches others as an instructor at Los Angeles Trade Technical College. In a heavy coat and blue gloves, she looks from under her helmet at the white-hot flame of a welding torch. It was a fight to learn these skills. More than a decade ago, when she began receiving job training as a welfare recipient, Thompson had to argue for the chance to study welding. Public assistance administrators wanted to push her toward cosmetology or culinary arts, she said. Thompson did not say how she would cast her ballot in November but said she would not vote for Clinton just because the candidate is a woman.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's slogan has resonated with her.
""When they talk about 'Let's make America great again,'"" Thompson said, ""what I think of is the companies in Detroit, the automotive industry going back to Detroit and giving back jobs.""A well-paid job as an electrician has opened up opportunities for Hannah Cooper, 28. For one thing, she was able to buy a house in the expensive Los Angeles real estate market.Sometimes, she will encounter someone on a construction site who knows her mother, Kelly Cooper, who also was an electrician. ""Everyone remembers her because there's only a few women,"" Cooper said.Kelly Cooper began as an apprentice in 1975.""You have to have thick skin to be anyone in the trade,""she said. ""To be a woman in the trade, you have to have a particularly thick skin."" 
She is now director of construction for the Los Angeles Department of General Services.Eva Ho, 44, is a woman working in the technology field, which is unusual enough. But she is also a venture capitalist, which is rarer still.""In some ways the V.C. career has really been an old boys club, and it's been dominated by white men for the last three or four decades,"" Ho said. A graduate of Harvard and Cornell, Ho said she was drawn to work in technology because of its ability to drive social change. But she came late to it, never having used a computer until college.For the Burtons, who work together as filmmakers through their company Five Sisters Productions, their career had its seeds in their childhood as the daughters of a writer and a former professional musician. Both parents were feminists who thought their five daughters could do anything, said Ursula Burton, a director, producer and actor. Now the possibility of a female president could help create more opportunities for women, she said. ""Having a woman president opens up the presidency for girls,"" Burton said, ""and it will shift the perception for boys of what girls can do.""

By Marton Dunai
| BUDAPEST

BUDAPEST Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Saturday said Donald Trump had proposed security policies that Europe should take to heart to solve a security crisis he blames on uncontrolled immigration.Speaking at a summer university in Baile Tusnad, Romania, the Hungarian leader tied increased security threats to increased migration and cited Trump's proposals at the Republican National Convention to combat terrorism.Orban is one of Europe's most outspoken politicians and has in the past upset fellow members of the European Union over policy.Most recently he has taken a tough stance on Europe's  migrant crisis, objecting to EU resettlement plans and calling for a razor wire fence to be built along his country's southern border.Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president on Thursday with a speech that outlined an increased intelligence effort, an end to a ""failed policy of nation-building and regime change"" and a total suspension of immigration from states ""compromised by terrorism.""He wants a wall to be built along the U.S. border with Mexico.Orban sought to buttress his own security proposals with Trump's points.""I am not a Donald Trump campaigner,"" he said in the televised speech. ""I never thought I would ever entertain the thought that, of the open options, he (Trump) would be better for Europe and for Hungary.
""But I listened to the candidate and I must tell you he made three proposals to combat terrorism. And as a European I could have hardly articulated better what Europe needs.""Orban has accused the EU of weakness in the face of a what he sees as a fundamental threat from more than a million migrants who arrived on the continent last year, with hundreds of thousands following them this year.For the most part, the migrants are fleeing the war in Syria.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called Orban ""Viktator"" - a pun on Viktor and dictator - as a way of putting down the Hungarian's views.
But Orban also has supporters. Slovak premier Robert Fico, joined Orban's court challenge of the EU's mandatory migrant resettlement quotas.EXPORTING DEMOCRACY
Tapping into Trump's proposals to create ""the best intelligence-gathering organisation in the world,"" Orban said that Europe too needs to create a network of national intelligence agencies that ranks with the world's best.
He then took aim at some of his EU colleagues.""The second thing, said this valiant American presidential candidate, is to abandon the policy of exporting democracy. I could not have said it more precisely.""Orban said Western countries acted recklessly to remove the undemocratic but stable regimes in Libya, Syria and Iraq without guaranteeing stability in the aftermath, exposing Europe to a mass wave of migration.Worse, he said, instead of supporting the regimes that try to control the civil-war-torn countries in North Africa and the Middle East, Europe criticises them for democratic shortfalls.""If we keep prioritising democracy over stability in regions where we are unlikely to succeed with that, we will create instability, not democracy.""

By Eric M. Johnson
| SEATTLE

SEATTLE An Alaska law requiring doctors to notify the parents of girls under the age of 18 seeking an abortion violates the state's constitution and cannot be enforced, the state's top court ruled on Friday.The 4-1 decision marks a long-awaited victory for Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights advocates in Alaska who argued the 2010 law violates the privacy of pregnant teens.It also comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in America in more than two decades.A woman's right to abortion was established in the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, but several states have tried to restrict access to abortion through their own laws. 
In Alaska, Planned Parenthood and doctors argued that the notification law was particularly threatening to vulnerable teens who live in abusive homes.Justice Daniel Winfree, writing for the majority, said that the notification law's ""discriminatory barrier to those minors seeking to exercise their fundamental privacy right to terminate a pregnancy violates Alaska's equal protection guarantee.""Another justice, Dana Fabe, in a concurring opinion, wrote that ""the Alaska Constitution permits a parental notification law, but not one that contains provisions that are among the most restrictive of any state's notification laws.""
The office of Alaska's Attorney General did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Alaska's law required 48-hour advance notice to parents before a physician may terminate a minor's pregnancy, though it allowed a minor to seek a judge's permission to bypass the notice process and granted an exception for medical emergencies.
The law took effect in 2010 after a Superior Court ruled that the state had an interest in promoting communication between a pregnant girl and her family.Christine Charbonneau, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, said in a statement that ""We all want teens to be safe - and the sad truth is that some teens live in dangerous homes and can't go to their parents.""

By James Oliphant
| RICHMOND, Va.

RICHMOND, Va. Democrat Hillary Clinton's pick of Tim Kaine as her vice presidential running mate could hamper her efforts to reach out to African-American voters because of Kaine's past embrace of crime-fighting strategies that have driven up the U.S. prison population and are unpopular in the black community.The now-defunct Project Exile that Kaine backed was so unusual it was championed by Republicans and Democrats alike and by both the top U.S. gun lobby group and gun-control advocates. But the federal program launched in 1997 in Richmond, Virginia, was also criticized at the time as a racially biased initiative that condemned young black men to lengthy prison terms.Clinton has come under fire herself from black activists for her past support for tough-on-crime policies of the 1990s now blamed for a surge in U.S. prison population and heightened tensions between law enforcement and black communities.One of her fundraisers got disrupted earlier this year by activists who asked her to ""apologize for mass incarceration."" Clinton named Kaine as her running mate late on Friday, making what is considered a safe choice for her battle against Republican presidential rival Donald Trump.As Richmond mayor from 1998 to 2001, Kaine, 58, was a vocal supporter of Project Exile, crediting it with reducing the city's murder rate.Its goal was to literally live up to its name by making illegal gun possession a federal, not a state, crime, which allowed prosecutors to send convicted felons, most of them black, to a distant federal penitentiary for at least five years.Sam Sinyangwe, co-founder of Campaign Zero, a group focused on curtailing police violence, said Kaine's choice could exacerbate Clinton's problems rallying support of African-Americans, particularly younger people.
""To select somebody like (Kaine) is not a sign of good leadership potential in a president,"" Sinyangwe said.Nicole Lee, a civil-rights lawyer and activist in Washington, D.C. who is African-American, also expressed concern.""Project Exile broke black families,"" she said. ""This is not a benign thing to be for. These measures were not used against white kids in the suburbs with guns, they were used against black kids in the cities.""DRAMATIC TIMES

To defeat Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election, Clinton needs high turnout among blacks and other minority voters to offset Trump's popularity among white voters.During the 1990s, she supported tough-on-crime initiatives backed by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, but now vows to ""end the era of mass incarceration.""Her campaign is trying to walk a political tightrope after the killings of two black men by police and the shooting deaths of police officers in Texas and Louisiana. She has offered support for the Black Lives Matter movement, while also strongly condemning the killings of police officers.Officials who were in Richmond during Kaine's mayoral tenure believe the community, ravaged by the crack-cocaine epidemic and an escalating murder rate, had to take dramatic steps. Amy Dudley, a spokeswoman in Kaine's Senate office, said the senator stood by the program, believing that it reduced gun violence.
Jerry Oliver, the police chief at the time and an African-American, said the program focused on black communities out of necessity. ""We had to be where the problems were,"" he said. The National Rifle Association, the nation's biggest gun lobby, was an early proponent of Project Exile as was the gun-control advocacy group Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. As Richmond's first white mayor in more than a decade, Kaine was widely credited for helping to bridge racial divisions in the city, but Project Exile drew fire from defense lawyers and community advocates who argued that the program unfairly targeted African-Americans.Kevin Ring, vice president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington advocacy group lobbying against federal sentencing minimums, said that Kaine, like Clinton, will have to demonstrate to black voters that he has ""evolved"" on the issue. ""There are some that will be bothered. There will be questions,"" Ring said.Kaine supports legislation that would roll back some mandatory minimum federal sentences and give judges more discretion, although his office says he still supports firm sentences for illegal gun possession. Kaine's backing of Project Exile also makes him odd bedfellows with Trump, who has made law and order a central theme of his candidacy. Trump has called for the program's revival and his campaign website said it was ""tremendous."" (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Emily Flitter; Editing by Caren Bohan and Tomasz Janowski)"

By Marty Graham
| SAN DIEGO

SAN DIEGO A U.S. judge on Friday tentatively rejected Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's bid to dismiss a lawsuit by Trump University students who said they were defrauded through its real-estate seminars.U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego told a hearing he would take under consideration arguments on both sides in the case and issue a written ruling in the coming weeks. The 2013 lawsuit, one of three over the defunct Trump University venture, was filed on behalf of students who paid up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing ""secrets"" from his ""hand-picked"" instructors.  The plaintiffs have sought class-action status.The cases against Trump University have regularly cropped up during the presidential campaign. Trump was roundly criticized in May when he accused Curiel, who is of Mexican descent, of being biased against him because of the candidate's pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Curiel, who was born in Indiana, is presiding over two of the cases, with one set for trial in late November. A separate lawsuit by New York's attorney general is pending in that state.
Trump's lawyers say Curiel should toss the 2013 California lawsuit on the grounds that the New York real estate mogul, though personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on other executives to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased their seminars.""By 2007, his involvement was fairly minimal. He was not the person running this company. He founded it, he established it and he went off and let other people run it. It's like any other celebrity endorsement,"" Trump attorney Daniel Petrocelli said during the hearing.
Trump's lawyers claim references in marketing materials to ""secrets,"" ""hand-picked"" instructors or ""university"" were mere sales ""puffery."" According to the defense, there is no evidence Trump intended to defraud students.Lawyers for the students say the wealthy developer conducted the marketing for Trump University more than anyone else, starring in and approving promotional materials.They claim Trump University instructors were high-pressure sales people, not ""professors and adjunct professors"" as Trump touted, and that New York authorities told Trump back in 2005 to stop calling his unaccredited venture a university. 
""Somehow, belligerence trumps substance,"" plaintiff's attorney Jason Forge said. ""If we say it loud enough, forcefully enough, it becomes true. Well, it doesn't.""Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, plaintiffs' court papers say.

By Duff Wilson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law a measure that pledges greater efforts to protect drug-dependent newborns and assist their parents.The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act also stresses drug treatment and overdose prevention to help stanch the nation's heroin and opioid drug epidemic.Obama said in a statement that 78 Americans die from opioid overdose every day, and noted that the legislation included only modest steps to address the epidemic.""I am deeply disappointed that Republicans failed to provide any real resources for those seeking addiction treatment to get the care that they need,"" Obama said. ""In fact, they blocked efforts by Democrats to include $920 million in treatment funding.""The bill was passed nearly unanimously by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.Efforts to enforce provisions to protect newborns and help their parents come in response to a Reuters investigation last year titled ""Helpless & Hooked.""The new law requires that the federal government and every state follow a 2003 law that was routinely ignored. That law called on states to require hospitals and social services to report, track and assist drug-dependent newborns and their families.
Reuters found that no more than nine states were following that requirement. Most children born to addicted mothers, including many mothers who were taking prescribed methadone, were not being reported by hospitals as required by law. Often, that was because medical workers feared involving child protective services, as the existing law requires. When cases were reported to social services, Reuters found, efforts to protect the child and help the parents often were limited.The failures came at a cost. Reuters found more than 110 babies since 2010 died under preventable circumstances after being sent home to families ill-equipped to care for them. Experts said far more children have likely died but gone uncounted.The new law promises a non-punitive approach that includes ""safe care plans"" aimed at keeping newborns at home with their parents, who will receive additional help.
""This is a step forward for vulnerable babies who, due to an opioid dependency, will begin their lives facing enormous challenges,"" said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, the ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on children and families. ""Reuters' initial reporting shined a light on a darkness that had enveloped far too many lives. There is much more work to do but this is a genuine step forward.""Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which initiated the measure, said it will track state actions.""These reforms are an important part of our broader efforts to combat the nation's opioid epidemic and provide these vulnerable families a better chance at a brighter future,"" Kline said in a statement.In 2013, the latest year with nationwide hospital reporting, 27,315 babies were diagnosed with newborn drug withdrawal syndrome, a five-fold increase from a decade earlier.
Reuters found that one drug-dependent baby was born on average every 19 minutes in the United States. Some suffer shaking, crying and feeding problems as they battle withdrawal.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the broader addiction law was ""no more than a half measure"" without more funding. Wyden has co-sponsored a measure setting aside money for substance abuse treatment for parents in danger of losing their children. It passed the House but stalled in the Senate.Jim Greenwood, a former Pennsylvania congressman who championed the 2003 law, said the deaths Reuters revealed represent ""a national disgrace and glaring failure at the federal, state and local level to implement Plans of Safe Care for infants."" Greenwood, now president of a Washington, D.C.-based biotechnology group, applauded the new measure ""to improve the health and safety of these babies and their families.""Stephen Patrick, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University and leading researcher on the condition, said the new law is ""good news"" but added: ""Wish there was funding that came with it.""

By Rodrigo Campos
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump has said a lot of things that, were he a sitting U.S. president instead of a candidate for the job, could be expected to roil financial markets.If investors were taking the Republican presidential nominee at his word, they would be selling shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), and cashing out of Mexican equities - all targets of Trump threats of boycotts, barrier walls or import taxes. Investors betting on a Trump presidency would be buying shares of U.S. companies that dealt exclusively with domestic customers and suppliers.Yet the Trump trade is not much in evidence on Wall Street, where some market strategists and investors told Reuters they find it difficult to position their portfolios for his possible presidency, in part because many of his proposals are contradictory or lack specific implementation details.MORE BUSINESS COVERAGE:Ex-Goldman banker Gordon Dyal beefs up M&A boutiqueAmazon makes its debut in the student loan business More pain for U.S. crudeShould Trump win the Nov. 8 election, some investors said, it is not clear how the New York businessman could push through policies that clash with mainstream Republican party views on free trade and low taxes.""The investment community in particular is having trouble figuring out what (Trump) is about,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.
""They are not taking individual items as seriously as they would with other candidates,"" he said.Traders said they will be watching Trump's speech at the Republican convention on Thursday night for signs of how he would address business and tax issues, though they expect scant detail.The Trump campaign did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment on how investment strategists viewed his policies. 
BREAKING UP BANKS
U.S. stock indexes have rallied to new highs as Trump received the nomination of his party on a platform that includes a proposal to reinstate the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that would require a breakup of the largest U.S. banks.A Trump presidency ""would not be good for markets at all,"" because of the uncertainty among investors about his true priorities, said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.Zemsky, however, said he has not so far been selling securities because of Trump. ""It's hard to react to things that are said because of the lack of specificity, and the probability of him being elected is still low so changing your portfolio because of him is not likely to be profitable,"" he said.To be sure, Trump has supporters on Wall Street. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, has backed Trump and said he would be good for the economy because he would cut back on business-limiting regulations, such as those governing bank investments and labor policies. He also thinks Trump would bring in tax reform.
Although never elected to public office, Trump defeated 16 Republican rivals to win the nomination. He trails Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 7 percentage points, narrowing the gap from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.If Trump's stated proposals were carried out, that could leave the economy significantly weaker because they would result in large federal budget deficits and an anti-global stance that could hurt trade, according to a June analysis by Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.Zandi forecast the loss of 3.5 million jobs during a Trump administration alongside a drop in stock prices and real estate value.Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, build a wall between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal immigrants, and raise a 35 percent tariff on products made in Mexico by Ford and United Technologies Corp's (UTX.N) Carrier Corp.Yet there has been no selloff of Mexican stocks, which are up 10 percent so far in 2016. That is the best gauge of investment reaction to Trump, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.""For the most part,"" Ablin said, ""that suggests to me the investment community has not considered a Trump presidency a probable scenario at this point.""
