By Warren Strobel and Matt Spetalnick
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON When Hillary Clinton attended her first major White House meeting on Russia in February 2009, the new secretary of state insisted that she wanted to play a leading role in President Barack Obama's effort to ""reset"" U.S. relations with Moscow.But while Clinton became implementer-in-chief for one of Obama's signature first-term initiatives, she was consistently more skeptical than most of his top aides about how far Russian leader Vladimir Putin was prepared to go in turning the page, according to current and former U.S. officials.That stance is indicative of how she would go about dealing with Moscow if she is elected U.S. president on Nov. 8, aides to both Clinton and Obama told Reuters.With U.S. relations with Moscow already plumbing post-Cold War lows, the aides and veteran Russia watchers said she would likely take a harder line than Obama or Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has praised Putin as a strong leader.Dealing with Putin, who is flexing his geopolitical muscle from Ukraine to Syria to cyberspace, will be among Clinton's biggest foreign policy challenges -- one made more daunting by the personal bad blood between them.Jake Sullivan, a former top State Department aide and now senior Clinton campaign advisor, said Clinton could consider the shipping of lethal arms to Ukraine government forces and the creation of no-fly or safe zones in Syria. Obama has rejected both ideas.While such moves could further stoke tensions and might even face resistance from some U.S. allies, Sullivan said in an interview with Reuters that Clinton could manage ties with Russia effectively because Putin would ""respect her as U.S. president, her strength, her clarity, her predictability.""According to current and former Clinton advisers, she could consider other policy moves such as stiffer sanctions against Russia over Ukraine and doing more to wean Russia's neighbors off reliance on Moscow's energy supplies.Russia is watching warily.""She is not perceived by many people as the Kremlin's preferred candidate,"" said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry.""Many here believe that she would be tougher on Russia than Obama,"" he said. Clinton's first fence-mending effort in March 2009 was not so much a show of strength than of diplomatic clumsiness. She handed Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov a red button that was supposed to have the word ""reset"" on it. Instead, it was labeled with the Russian word meaning ""overcharged.""Clinton's distrust of Putin deepened, mirrored by his growing list of grievances against her.By the time she prepared to leave the State Department in early 2013, former officials said, she wrote at least two confidential memos to Obama urging a more hard-nosed approach. At the time, many in the president's inner circle were not convinced the reset had run its course, they said.
Since Clinton's departure, Putin has reasserted Russia on the world stage, seizing Ukraine's Crimea region and intervening militarily in Syria's civil war. U.S. officials have linked the hacking of Democratic Party computers to the Russian government - which the Kremlin denies.""NOT AS IF SHE WENT GRUMPILY""
Like most national security policies under Obama, the attempt to ""reset"" U.S.-Russian relations was managed from the White House by the president himself, along with aides from his 2008 campaign, including Russia specialist Michael McFaul.""No one should pretend that this wasn't an Obama-driven policy,"" said Philip Gordon, Clinton's top Europe adviser at the State Department. ""But it's also not as if she went grumpily to the table and was told by the president 'you're doing it' ... She thought it had logic.""McFaul, who later became ambassador to Russia, said in an interview that from the first White House meeting on Russia in early 2009 Clinton was skeptical of the prospects for transforming U.S.-Russian relations in a way that ""some of us aspired to back then."" Two other officials backed up his account. 
The first fruits of the reset were promising.Putin had - temporarily, it turned out - stepped down as   president, with the younger, reform-minded Dmitry Medvedev in his place.Obama and Medvedev signed a new strategic nuclear arms control pact, cooperated to sanction Iran for its nuclear program and agreed to let U.S. troops and equipment transit Russia to support a American military ""surge"" in Afghanistan. But after little more than two years, the ""reset"" ran out of steam. By mid-2011, it was clear that Putin was returning to the presidency.A DECADE OF BROADSIDES
Clinton first met Putin at his residence outside Moscow in March 2010. She persuaded him to back tougher U.N. sanctions on Iran, according to two people with knowledge of the session.
In front of the TV cameras, however, Putin railed against U.S. trade and economic policies as Clinton watched.Clinton and Putin have been exchanging broadsides for nearly a decade.Putin, a former KGB agent, ""doesn't have a soul,"" Clinton quipped on the eve of the 2008 New Hampshire presidential primary, riffing off of President George W. Bush's comment seven years earlier that he had looked into Putin's eyes and seen his soul.The Russian leader retorted: ""At a minimum, a head of state should have a head.""A U.S. official who was involved in Russia policymaking said Clinton sometimes chose her words poorly, inflaming Russian resentment over its perceived post-Cold War humiliation, a nationalist strain that Putin has long used to his advantage. ""She played into that,"" said the official, who requested anonymity. The most serious rift of Clinton's tenure occurred in late 2011, as crowds filled the streets of Russian cities protesting parliamentary elections marred by allegations of voting fraud.Clinton, in a statement approved by the White House, called the election ""neither free nor fair."" Putin, who was preparing to retake the presidency, accused her of trying to foment a new Russian revolution. A steady slide in contacts between Clinton and the Russian leadership and in overall relations followed.""Secretary Clinton's views on Russia were always a little harder-edged than President Obama's,"" said John Beyrle, Obama's first ambassador to Moscow. That partly reflected a ""splitting up of responsibilities,"" he said. Obama cooperated with Medvedev; Clinton grappled with Lavrov and Putin.Some Russia watchers say Clinton's record was mixed.""The reset was the right approach,"" said Thomas Graham, former Russia adviser under Bush's Republican administration. But he faulted Clinton and Obama's team for not doing more to ""actively reach out to Putin and open lines of communication."" (Additional reporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow.

By James Oliphant
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK With national security again a major U.S. election issue after bombings in New York and New Jersey, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sought to burnish their foreign-policy credentials on Monday by meeting world leaders at the United Nations.For Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, it was a return to a role she knows well after she served as President Barack Obama's secretary of state for four years.Trump, the Republican nominee, is a newcomer to the global stage who is hurriedly trying to play catch-up. In rapid succession, Clinton met briefly with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.Trump also met Sisi minutes after the Egyptian leader spoke with Clinton in the same Manhattan hotel.The meetings came on a day that started with Clinton suggesting Trump's harsh rhetoric toward Muslims aids the Islamic State militant group's recruiting efforts. Trump pushed back, arguing the United States was less safe as a result of Obama and Clinton's policies.
Security questions arose in each of Monday's bilateral sessions, which took place as world leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly, with Clinton and Abe discussing concerns over North Korea and maritime issues involving China. Clinton and Trump both spoke with Sisi about working more closely with Egypt to combat the Islamic State threat. Trump's campaign released a statement saying that Trump ""highlighted how Egypt and the U.S. share a common enemy and the importance of working together in defeating radical Islamic terrorism."" 
With Clinton, Sisi also discussed his goal of moving Egypt toward ""a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law and respects human rights and liberties."" Clinton and Poroshenko addressed Russian incursions into Ukrainian territory. Clinton started the session by saying Ukraine faces ""very real problems and threats from Russian aggression"" and that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive."" The session also resonated because of Trump's praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month. Trump called Putin a stronger leader than Obama, rattling both Democrats and Republicans in Washington. 
The evening was not without drama, starting with Clinton's motorcade zooming through packed New York streets at rush hour and then quickly rushing from hotel to hotel.Trump also tried to bolster his foreign policy credentials last month when he went to Mexico to meet President Enrique Pena Nieto, but both sides ended up disagreeing about whether who would pay to build a border wall had been discussed. Clinton called that episode an ""embarrassing international incident.""

By Andy Sullivan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON One in four registered voters in the United States live in areas that will use electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper backup in the November presidential election despite concerns that they are vulnerable to tampering and malfunctions, according to a Reuters analysis.The lack of a paper trail makes it impossible to independently verify that the aging touch-screen systems are accurate, security experts say, in a year when suspected Russian hackers have penetrated political groups and state voting systems and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said the election may be ""rigged."" Election officials insist the machines are reliable, but security experts say they are riddled with bugs and security holes that can result in votes being recorded incorrectly. A Reuters analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Election Assistance Commission and the Verified Voting Foundation watchdog group found that 44 million registered voters, accounting for 25 percent of the total, live in jurisdictions that rely on paperless systems, including millions in contested states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The picture has improved gradually since the 2008 presidential election, when 31 percent of U.S. voters lived in areas that used paperless touch-screen systems. In 2012, 27 percent lived in jurisdictions that used paperless systems. ""Clearly we still have a long way to go to ensure that all Americans have access to a form of voting technology they can trust,"" said Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan computer-science professor who has helped to uncover security flaws on touch-screen systems.(Graphic showing different types of voting systems across the U.S. -- tmsnrt.rs/2cZiKQ5)Most of these machines are nearing the end of their expected life span, making them more vulnerable to problems. And Congress has not authorized money for upgrades since 2002, just after the disputed 2000 presidential recount battle in Florida highlighted flaws in aging punch-card and lever-voting systems.    In some states, a divide has emerged between poorer areas that continue to use paperless touch-screen systems and wealthier areas that have bought new optical scan systems that process paper ballots, which many experts say are a better way to ensure accurate elections.
In Virginia, for example, counties that still use touch-screen systems have a poverty rate of 23 percent, while those that have switched to optical-scan systems have an average poverty rate of 11 percent.""I would have liked to have had the new machines, but the county says we don't have the money,"" said Patsy Burchett, the top election official in rural Lee County, which has been hit hard by the decline of the coal and tobacco industries and is the poorest county in the state. ""These machines are on their last legs,"" she said. QUESTIONABLE RESULTS

U.S. election officials have known about the shortcomings of touch-screen systems since shortly after they were widely adopted in the early 2000s, when researchers showed that vote results could be manipulated with tools as simple as a magnet and a Palm Pilot-style handheld device.The systems have produced questionable results in some elections. In Florida, more than 18,000 iVotronic machines did not record a vote in a 2006 congressional race in which the margin of victory was less than 400 votes. In Fairfax County, Virginia, electronic machines subtracted one vote for every hundred cast for one candidate in a 2003 school-board race. More than 4,400 electronic ballots in Carteret County, North Carolina, were lost and never recovered in the 2004 presidential election.Since 2008, states such as Maryland have traded in their touch-screen machines for optical-scan systems. Others like California and Ohio have added printers to their touch-screen machines which produce a backup paper trail, while Washington and Colorado moved to mail-in ballots. Absentee balloting is also cutting into the use of paperless systems. In 2012, for example, roughly 1 in 10 voters who lived in areas that used paperless systems cast absentee ballots. Election officials say the touch-screen machines that remain in use are more secure now than they were a decade ago whether they are fitted with printers or not, thanks to extensive testing and better poll-worker training. They say that a hacking incident is unlikely because the machines are not connected to the Internet. ""Voters should have confidence in whatever systems are being used in their jurisdiction because election officials have taken the necessary steps to secure these systems and ensure the integrity of the process,"" said Matthew Masterson, a commissioner with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.
Although there has so far been no confirmed major incident of U.S. voting machines being hacked, security experts say that those aiming to manipulate votes could spread a virus through memory cards, with no Internet connection needed. The best way to stop that is to switch to paper-based systems, they say.With 55 percent of all U.S. registered voters living in areas that use systems that are no longer in production, according to the Reuters analysis, election officials must rely on a dwindling supply of spare parts.Virginia Beach, Virginia, for example, pulled 32 of its 820 Accuvote TSX touch-screen machines in a 2014 election after residents complained that the machines were registering votes for candidates they didn't support. The city has since purchased a new optical-scan system.Lacking fresh federal funds, some states have opted to upgrade on their own. Louisiana aims to switch to an iPad-based system by 2019, while Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, are designing systems from scratch.Others see no reason to switch. In Georgia, Secretary of State Brian Kemp said he hasn't asked the state legislature for money to replace its fleet of paperless AccuVote TS touch-screen machines.""It's working just fine and all these so-called experts that are making these accusations about our system haven't seen it,"" he said.

By David Brunnstrom
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday and stressed it was important for the United States to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal that she opposes, Japanese officials said.Abe and Clinton met for about 15 minutes at Abe's hotel in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, the officials said. The meeting was held at Clinton's request, they said.The two stressed the importance of strengthening the U.S.-Japan security relationship and both outlined their known positions on the 12-nation TPP, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The pact has been agreed, but not ratified by the United States or Japan.Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, has opposed the deal, which is unpopular with labor unions and environmental groups, although she championed it while serving as secretary of state.In a speech to U.S. business leaders in New York on Monday, Abe described TPP as a ""pillar"" of the U.S. rebalance of policy emphasis to Asia, which comes in response to China's rise.
""Through the TPP, the U.S. can make clear its commitment to playing a leadership role in the growing Asia-Pacific,"" he said.""Japan and the U.S. must each obtain domestic approval of the TPP as soon as possible,"" Abe said. ""Success or failure will sway the direction of the global free trade system, and the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific.""Abe said he would pursue TPP approval at an upcoming session of Japan's parliament.
""Japan will spare no effort, and we count on the U.S. to do the same,"" he said.On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama engaged Ohio Governor John Kasich, a high-profile political foe, to help press Republicans to approve the TPP before he leaves office in four months.The unusual move is a sign of how the White House intends to make a final full-court push to convince Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress to approve the deal in a ""lame duck"" session after the election.
The TPP has been pilloried by both Republican and Democratic candidates.Republicans traditionally have backed free trade deals, but their presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has blamed them for U.S. job losses and threatened to tear them up should he win.Abe had no meeting with Trump, who has accused Tokyo of not  pulling its weight in its security alliance with Washington. The Japanese officials said Trump had not requested a meeting. (Reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

NEW YORK U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang agreed on Monday to step up cooperation in the United Nations Security Council and in law-enforcement channels after North Korea's fifth nuclear test, the White House said.China and the United States are also targeting the finances of Liaoning Hongxiang Industrial, a Chinese conglomerate headed by a Communist Party cadre, that the Obama administration thinks has a role in assisting North Korea's nuclear program, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.U.N. diplomats say the two countries have started discussions on a possible U.N. sanctions resolution in response to the nuclear test earlier this month, but Beijing has not said directly whether it will support tougher steps against North Korea.Obama met Li on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly session in New York.""Both leaders condemned North Korea's September 9 nuclear test and resolved to strengthen coordination in achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, including by invigorating cooperation in the United Nations Security Council and in law enforcement channels on North Korea,"" a White House statement said.China is isolated North Korea's most important diplomatic backer and its biggest trading partner.It has been angered by Pyongyang's repeated nuclear and missile tests and signed on to increasingly tough U.N. sanctions, but it has said it believes such steps are not the ultimate answer and called for a return to talks with North Korea.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart last week China opposes ""unhelpful"" unilateral sanctions on North Korea but will work within the United Nations to formulate a response.Washington has pressed Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea. The United States has said it is willing to negotiate with the North if the country commits to get rid of its nuclear weapons, which Pyongyang has refused to do.
HONGXIANG PROBE
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) is preparing as early as this week to announce legal action against Chinese firms suspected of providing financial assistance to Pyongyang, the Journal reported, citing officials familiar with the matter.It said DoJ prosecutors visited Beijing twice last month to make their Chinese counterparts aware of alleged criminal activities being committed by Liaoning Hongxiang Industrial. A social media post last week from the police in Liaoning, the northeastern border province of China, said they were investigating the firm's alleged long-term involvement in ""serious economic crimes"" and that relevant suspects were cooperating.A report by Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul and C4ADS in Washington says it identified more than $500 million in trade from January 2011 to September 2015 between the North and the Liaoning Hongxiang Group, which states on its website that it trades heavily with the North.
The figure includes more than $360 million in imports from North Korea by one group company, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co., an industrial machinery and equipment wholesaler.""While no judgment is being made on the final use of these funds, trade at this volume is of particular note. By one estimate, this amount would have been almost enough to both fund North Korea's uranium enrichment facilities, and to design, make and test its nuclear weapons,"" the report said.Certain assets related to the company, its founder and top executive Ma Xiaohong, and some of her relatives and associates, have been frozen by Chinese authorities in recent weeks, according to government and corporate filings cited by the Journal.The Asan report said its trading of goods that could qualify as potential military and nuclear dual-use products under U.S. export restrictions were of particular concern.The companies identified have had dealings with sanctioned North Korean entities, the report said.
Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, Seoul National University, said this case was symbolic and could have real practical impact.""This was the U.S. taking China into consideration and working with China. More such cases may follow if the U.S. or South Korea have firm evidence ... Chinese companies that have capacity for producing or securing goods for North Korea may be worried now,"" he said.China's Foreign Ministry said relevant departments were investigating Liaoning Hongxiang Group and were following the provisions of U.N. resolution 2270, which imposed tighter sanctions on North Korea in March in response to its fourth nuclear test in January and the launch of a long-range missile a month later.Representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice and Hongxiang Industrial were unavailable for comment.The Liaoning Hongxiang Group is also heavily involved in North Korea-related shipping, with Ma and other people associated with the group owning and operating a combined fleet of 10 ships that regularly sail between the North and China.Ma, who served on Liaoning's People's Congress before resigning at the weekend, is described by Chinese media as the most successful businessperson in Dandong involved in cross-border trade with North Korea.Government records say Ma's investment in Hongxiang was frozen on Sept. 2.

By Nichola Groom and Valerie Volcovici
| LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTONThe 27 states challenging Obama's Clean Power Plan in court say the lower emissions levels it would impose are an undue burden. But most are likely to hit them anyway.Already, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma and South Dakota appear to be meeting the CPP's early targets. And changes in the power market, along with policies favoring clean generation, are propelling most of the rest toward timely compliance, according to researchers, power producers and officials, as well as government filings reviewed by Reuters.""We are seeing reductions earlier than we ever expected,"" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy said in an interview. ""It's a great sign that the market has already shifted and people are invested in the newer technologies, even while we are in litigation.""States engaged in the legal battle that is set for an appellate court hearing later this month say their concerns go beyond whether they can meet the mandate. The states, most of them led by Republican governors, say they object to what they view as federal overreach by Obama and the Democrats and want to maintain flexibility to make energy decisions at the state level that reflect changing market conditions.Cynthia Coffman, attorney general of Colorado, said her state's likely ability to comply with the CPP's mandate ""truly is not the issue.""""We don't have anything against clean air,"" Coffman said. ""That really doesn't factor into my decision to say the federal government has gone beyond its legal authority.""Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said that he sees the Clean Power Plan as a form of federal ""coercion and commandeering"" of energy policy and that the state should have ""sovereignty to make decisions for its own markets.""The Obama administration finalized the Clean Power Plan in 2015 as a central part of meeting U.S. obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement.In February, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the rule pending resolution of the states' litigation. Later this month, a panel of the D.C. Circuit Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case.The CPP sets carbon-reduction goals for each state, but allows states to decide how to meet them.
During the early years of implementation, the goals are guidelines intended to put states on track to meet the final deadline of 2030. If a state fails to submit a plan to the EPA by interim deadlines, the agency can impose its own plan on that state's power producers. Failure to comply by 2030 could open a state up to administrative penalties and lawsuits.To be sure, some states fighting the mandate would have to drastically change course to meet it. West Virginia, which is leading the legal challenge with Texas, still relies largely on carbon-spewing, coal-fired power. And Wisconsin, North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming have large gaps between their current emissions and the plan's mandates.But, in a reflection of how rapidly the power market is shifting, the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration earlier this year reduced its forecast for 2030 power plant carbon emissions by nearly 11 percent, without factoring in reductions that may be generated by the Clean Power Plan.The projection for the nation as a whole would be nearly two-thirds of the CPP's target by 2030, even if the law never takes effect.A 2015 analysis by consulting firm M.J. Bradley & Associates for the Environmental Defense Fund found that 21 of the 27 states suing to block the Clean Power Plan are on track to meet its 2024 targets with existing plants and planned investments.
Eighteen states are on track to hit the 2030 targets with no changes to current plans, according to the Bradley analysis, which was filed with the court as part of an amicus brief from the Environmental Defense Fund in support of the government.And the outlook has improved for some states since the Bradley forecast. It didn't expect Arkansas, for example, to meet the 2024 target. But in 2015, after shifting significant energy generation from coal to natural gas, the state reported power plant emissions for the year that were below the 2030 requirement.Some of the states contesting the rules say they object to strict timelines.""The CPP is very dramatic in the speed at which it would require things to happen,"" said Chris Nelson, chairman of the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission. ""If you let the market play out, those things take care of themselves.""Texas also has protested the CPP's timetable, saying it would require the construction of transmission lines that could raise costs for consumers. But the state already has moved heavily into wind and solar in recent years, and is nearing its 2030 goals.
John Hall, Texas director for EDF and a former environmental regulator for the state, said Texas could profit from the rule, noting the state ranks at the top of the list of wind energy producers and is making big moves into solar.""The CPP would enable Texas to make money by exporting wind and solar electricity,"" he said.States that export coal or gas-fired power, on the other hand, are concerned about their ability to keep doing so.""It is very important that we don't get caught in the fray of an EPA energy policy that dictates what we do as an exporting state,"" said Stuart Spencer, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality Associate Director.Whatever happens in court, energy policy will remain a highly charged political issue. Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed to the administration's attempts to curb carbon emissions.""When I ran for office, I promised I would do everything in my power to protect coal miners' jobs,"" said West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in a statement to Reuters. ""I have followed through on that promise.""

7	7	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN11P1EZ	After bomb blasts, Clinton, Trump trade charges on national security	"


By James Oliphant
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA Democrat Hillary Clinton on Monday accused Republican Donald Trump of aiding Islamic State recruitment, while Trump said she had helped weaken national security as bomb blasts in New York and New Jersey resonated on the U.S. presidential trail.Both candidates for the Nov. 8 election tried to use the weekend attacks to flex their credentials to protect America as world leaders gathered in security-heightened New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly.Clinton said Trump's rhetoric against what he calls ""radical Islamic terrorism"" was helping Islamic State recruit more fighters. ""We know that a lot of the rhetoric we've heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular ISIS, because they are looking to make this into a war against Islam rather than a war against jihadists,"" she told reporters in White Plains, New York. ISIS is an acronym used for Islamic State.Trump fired back by saying Clinton bore some responsibility for the violence by not persuading President Barack Obama to leave a residual force of U.S. troops in Iraq when she was his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.Obama and the Iraqi government failed to reach agreement at the end of 2011 on extending a U.S.-Iraqi status of forces agreement, and most American troops were withdrawn.Trump has sought to tie Clinton to the decisions of the Obama administration.""Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monster,"" Trump told a large crowd in Fort Myers, Florida.The campaigns weighed in after the bomb incidents and a stabbing attack at a mall in central Minnesota.In the most serious incident, a bomb went off in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, injuring 29 people. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found nearby. Earlier that day, a pipe bomb went off in Seaside Park, New Jersey.
On Monday, an Afghanistan-born American suspected in some of the incidents was arrested in nearby Linden, New Jersey, after a gunbattle with police. Authorities had said earlier they wanted to question Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, about the Chelsea and Seaside Park bombings.  The incidents, just days after the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, put the United States' most populous city on edge.Trump, who has in the past talked of the need for a resumption of harsh interrogation tactics like waterboarding for terrorism suspects, said authorities need to ""get information"" from the bombing suspect ""before it comes no longer timely,"" but that instead he would probably be coddled.""Now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he'll probably even have room service knowing the way our country is,"" he said.
'COMMANDER IN CHIEF TEST'
At a speech in Philadelphia on Monday, Clinton called for vigilance.""This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world,"" she said.Trump seized on a government report that said 858 immigrants from countries with which the United States has national security concerns who were pegged for deportation were mistakenly granted citizenship. He said the report showed the need for tighter control over who gets into the United States.""Immigration security is national security,"" Trump said in Fort Myers.
Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University who worked on the National Security Council under Republican President George W. Bush, said Clinton was trying to argue Trump did not pass the commander in chief test.""When bad news happens, she wants to be able to say, this is why you need a steady hand on the tiller,"" Feaver said.The renewed focus on terrorism came as Clinton and Trump prepared for their first debate next Monday at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, east of the city.With world leaders gathered in New York for the U.N. conclave, Clinton was expected to meet leaders of Japan, Egypt and Ukraine later on Monday, while Trump was expected to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.A U.S.-led coalition has been fighting Islamic State mainly through air strikes in Syria and Iraq.Trump, who has based much of his campaign message on arguing that the United States is no longer safe and that he alone can protect the nation, told Fox News on Monday morning that he expected more attacks. ""I think this is something that maybe will ... happen more and more all over the country,"" he said.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate will vote as soon as Wednesday on a joint resolution seeking to block a $1.15 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia over concerns about the conflict in Yemen, sponsors of the measure said on Monday.Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Democratic Senators Chris Murphy and Al Franken introduced the legislation on Sept. 8. Backers of the joint resolution say it would block the sale of Abrams tanks and other equipment if it were passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives and signed by President Barack Obama.However, any effort to stop the sale would face stiff opposition from the White House, which has already approved the sale, as well as in Congress.The measure's backers said that, even if it does not pass, a positive vote or a strong vote would send a strong message about continued U.S. support for Saudi Arabia.
Paul and Murphy told a meeting at the Center for the National Interest in Washington on Monday that they have deep concern about the Saudi conflict in Yemen, and think the United States should rethink its automatic support for the Riyadh government.""I think holding back the arms may give them a chance to show that they can do better,"" Paul said.
Murphy said supporting Saudi action in Yemen hurts U.S. security.
""If we are helping to radicalize Yemenis against us, we are participating in the slaughter of civilians, and we are allowing extremist groups that have plans and plots against the United States to grow stronger, how can that be in our security interest?"" Murphy asked. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by James Dalgleish)"	['Franken', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]
