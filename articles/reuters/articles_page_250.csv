WASHINGTON Former U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin vowed on Sunday to help unseat Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, because of the his refusal to endorse presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Palin, the former Alaska governor and Trump supporter, endorsed conservative businessman Paul Nehlen, who is challenging Ryan, the House speaker, for his congressional seat in the Wisconsin Republican nominating contest on Aug. 9.""I will do whatever I can for Paul Nehlen,"" Palin said in an interview with CNN. ""This man is a hardworking guy, so in touch with the people.""Though Ryan is heavily favored to win the primary race against Nehlen, Palin predicted an upset in a race she said would shock Washington's political class.Palin's comments underscore the deep divisions within the party over Trump, who effectively locked up his party's nomination for president last week when his two remaining rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out of the race.
Palin said she believed Ryan would get ""Cantored,"" comparing him to former Eric Cantor, the former No. 2 Republican in the House who was defeated in a 2014 primary by conservative Dave Brat, now a Virginia congressman.Ryan said last week he was not ready to support Trump yet, saying that the New York real estate mogul needed to do more to unify the Republican party.""Paul Ryan and his ilk, their problem is that they become so disconnected from the people they are elected to represent, as evidenced by Paul Ryan's refusal to support the GOP front runner, that we just said, 'He's our man,'"" Palin said.
A poll in March by Marquette University Law School showed Ryan with more than an 80 percent approval rating among Wisconsin Republicans.Seen as an intellectual leader of the party's conservative values, many inside the party believe he may mount his own White House run in the next presidential cycle.
Nehlen, like Trump, wants to secure the southern border with Mexico and withdraw from global trade deals. He told Reuters in April that Cantor's defeat in 2014 ""reinforced in my mind"" that he could defeat Ryan.Asked if she would be willing to be vetted as a potential vice presidential candidate, Palin said she recognizes many voters might not want her on the ticket and that she ""wouldn't want to be a burden"" to Trump's candidacy.Palin, who is popular with the Tea Party wing of the Republican party, was tapped in 2008 to be the running mate for  former Republican presidential nominee John McCain.

By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Paul Ryan and Donald Trump, the top Republicans in the United States, plan to meet next week to try to unite their party, with both men focused on the Nov. 8 presidential election, but the Wisconsin congressman also perhaps looking further ahead.Speaker of the House of Representatives Ryan has invited Trump, this year's likely Republican presidential nominee, to meet on Thursday with Ryan and other congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, Ryan's office said in a statement on Friday.A key part of the conversation is sure to be Trump's combative, in-your-face campaign persona and Republican leaders' requests for him to tone it down, but political analysts said Ryan will have other considerations in mind, as well.One issue is likely to be his own future, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.Ryan, 46, lost his 2012 campaign for vice president as Mitt Romney's running mate. Ryan probably has serious doubts that Trump, like Romney, can win this year, Sabato said.If so, Ryan will want to find a balance between accepting Trump, 69, as the nominee and keeping some distance from him, just in case the real estate mogul's campaign ends in disaster.""Suppose Trump loses overwhelmingly. Would you want to have been siding with the captain of the Titanic, or maybe seen as someone who was begging the captain to watch out for icebergs?"" Sabato said, adding that a Trump defeat could push the party in a different direction in 2020, maybe toward Ryan as the nominee.
WALKING A TIGHTROPE
As chairman of the Republican Party convention in Cleveland in July, Ryan's political tightrope will be especially perilous.One of his objectives will be to provide political cover for his 246 House Republicans so they can choose to embrace or run away from Trump, depending on their home districts' politics, with the goal of preserving control of the House, analysts said.
Ryan dropped a bombshell on Thursday when he said he was not ready to endorse Trump until he shows he can unify the party, still reeling from a bitter primary campaign that left many establishment Republicans stunned at Trump's victory.One moderate Pennsylvania congressman, Representative Charlie Dent, said he thought most of his fellow House Republicans would be comfortable with what Ryan said, because they were ""conflicted"" themselves over whether to support Trump.Some Republican lawmakers worry that Trump is not conservative enough; others are more bothered by Trump's ""divisive, incendiary remarks and lack of substance,"" said Dent, who put himself in the latter category.However, a conservative Republican congressman, Raul Labrador of Idaho, told CNN that Ryan ""needs to reconsider what he's doing"" concerning Trump.
""A lot of people that are voting for Donald Trump are totally disaffected with what we're doing in Washington D.C., and he (Ryan) almost kind of slapped them in the face when he said what he did,"" said Labrador, who endorsed Ted Cruz but says he will vote for Trump now that Cruz is out of the race. As speaker, Ryan has struggled with his deeply divided colleagues over budget issues, funding the battle against the Zika virus, rescuing Puerto Rico from a debt crisis, and helping Flint, Michigan, deal with their contaminated water system.Ryan is ""trying to jawbone Trump into adjusting his positions"" to line up better with the party establishment, said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar and political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.The ""unprecedented"" move by a congressional leader to distance himself from his party's expected nominee, Ornstein said, showed Ryan trying to mold a ""less confrontational and divisive approach to minorities and a less isolationist and combative approach to our allies.""In a swipe at Trump on Friday, President Barack Obama warned that occupying the Oval Office ""is not a reality show.""

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama said in a commencement speech on Saturday that U.S. race relations have improved over the last three decades, but that significant work still needs to be done.""I tell you this not to lull you into complacency, but to spur you into action because there's still so much work to do,"" Obama told about 2,300 Howard University graduates in Washington, acknowledging that racism and inequality still persist. ""We cannot sleepwalk through life,"" he said.The United States has faced a number of racial controversies in recent years, including the 2014 shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, that sparked sometimes violent protests.The United States has a racial gap in economic opportunities, Obama said, noting that the overall U.S. employment rate is around 5 percent, but it is near 9 percent for African-Americans.Obama, the son of a white mother and African father, told the graduates to embrace their racial identity.""Be confident in your blackness,"" Obama said, adding ""there is no one way to be black ... There's no straightjacket, there's no constraints, there's no litmus test for authenticity.""
He added that ""my election did not create a post-racial society,"" but was one example of how attitudes have changed.Obama also urged the crowd not to try to prod colleges and universities into disinviting controversial speakers - something that has taken place regularly at campuses throughout the United States.Howard University is one of about 100 historically black colleges and universities in the United States.Obama argued that the United States and the world has progressed dramatically since 1983 when he graduated from college.
""America is by almost every measure better than it was"" in 1983, Obama said, noting that U.S. poverty rate is down, the number of people with college degrees is up and the number of women in the workforce have risen.Obama said today's college graduates are better positioned than any other to address the country's tough outstanding problems.""You need a strategy,"" Obama said, adding passion and anger are not enough to effect political change and encouraging them to embrace compromise. ""Not just hashtags but votes.""
He noted the low voter turnout among young people in the 2014 congressional elections. He told the graduates they needed to vote ""every time ... not just when you're inspired.""But Obama noted an area that has not improved in recent decades - the U.S. prison population - currently at 2.2 million, it is up more than fourfold from 500,000 in 1983.African-American men are six times more likely than white men to be incarcerated, Obama said, and urged the graduates to lobby the U.S. Congress to pass a pending criminal justice reform measure.Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, praised Obama's remarks on Twitter, writing ""even conservatives would applaud it.""

By Brendan O'Brien

Alabama's Supreme Court Chief Justice was suspended on Friday  for ordering state probate judges not to grant marriage licenses to gay couples, despite contrary rulings by a federal court and the U.S. Supreme Court.Chief Justice Roy Moore, an outspoken opponent of same-sex unions, faces possible removal from the bench after the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission charged him with violating the state's judicial ethics laws, according to news website AL.com. The legality of gay marriage had been at the center of a national debate until the Supreme Court ruled in June that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry, handing a historic triumph to the American gay rights movement.  Despite the decision and a federal court ruling that made gay marriage legal in Alabama, Moore in January issued an administrative order to state probate judges that they should not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to court documents. 
""Chief Justice Moore flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority,"" the complaint said. ""Moore knowingly ordered (probate judges) to commit violations ... knowingly subjecting them to potential prosecution and removal from office.""Moore said in a statement that the commission had no authority over administrative orders or the court's ability to prohibit probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses.   ""We intend to fight this agenda vigorously and expect to prevail,"" he said.  Moore wrote in his order that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was at odds with a decision in March 2015 by the Alabama Supreme Court that instructed probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
The conflicting opinions had resulted in ""confusion and uncertainty,"" Moore said, with many probate judges issuing marriage licenses to gay couples while others refused to do so. [uL1N14R283]The Human Rights Campaign, the biggest U.S. gay rights organization, hailed the suspension. ""Roy Moore is an embarrassment to the state of Alabama,"" Eva Walton Kendrick, the group's Alabama state manager, said in a statement.
Moore, a Republican, has been a hero of conservative causes before. In 2003, he was removed from office after a federal judge ruled he was placing himself above the law by refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument.He won the chief justice job back in 2012, vowing not to do anything to create further friction with the federal courts.

By David Schwartz
| PHOENIX

PHOENIX Arizona's governor signed into law on Friday a bitterly contested proposal that will restore a federal health insurance program for children from low-income families, making it the last of its 49 counterparts to join the program.Arizona opted out of the federal Children's Health Insurance Program in 2010 over cost concerns as it grappled with a budget crunch. The program aims to help working families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid health care coverage for the poor, but who cannot afford private health insurance.To qualify for KidsCare, as it's known in Arizona, a family of four must earn between $33,000 and $49,000 annually. It is estimated to serve about 30,000 children in Arizona.
Arizona's Republican governor, Doug Ducey, signed the legislation over fierce objections from the top two lawmakers in his own party a matter of hours after it cleared the Republican-led legislature.The debate over the program was among the most rancorous of the legislative session and focused on both costs and the fact that the measure was tacked on to a virtually unrelated school voucher bill, prompting concerns that the law would face a legal challenge.
Backers said the program is desperately needed to close a gap in affordable health insurance options and to ensure that children are able to grow up healthy. Even though the state is no longer required under the program to contribute funds in exchange for federal dollars, as was the case in 2010, opponents argued that Arizona citizens are still indirectly financing the program by paying for the program through federal taxes.
Arizona's House of Representatives approved the measure on Thursday following heated debate. The law could take effect as early as August. (Reporting by David Schwartz in Phoenix, Arizona; Editing by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle)"

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday a long-delayed rule requiring the financial industry to identify the real owners of companies will help fight corruption and tax evasion and boost the economy.His administration on Friday issued the Customer Due Diligence rule in the works since 2012 and proposed legislation meant to stop prevent criminals from using shell companies to evade taxes, launder money, and finance terror. ""These actions are going to make a difference,"" Obama told reporters. He said they would help the administration to do a better job of tracking financial flows and making sure companies are ""paying the taxes they owe rather than using shell corporations and offshore accounts to avoid doing the things that ordinary Americans are doing every day.""Obama also called on Congress to pass legislation that requires all companies formed in the United States to report information to the financial crimes enforcement network at the Treasury Department.  
""That's going to help law enforcement better investigate and prevent financial crimes,"" Obama told reporters.Obama also urged Congress to raise the federal minimum wage, pass new trade agreements, and simplify the tax code. 
""Only Congress can fully close the loopholes"" that wealthy individuals or corporations can take advantage of, Obama said.He singled out Senator Rand Paul, a Republican and libertarian, who in years past has single-handedly blocked tax treaties or treaty updates between the United States and Spain, Japan, Britain, and other countries. Paul has been ""a little quirky on this issue,"" Obama said, and urged him ""to stop blocking the implementation of tax treaties."" 
Paul's office did not immediately comment. (Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Jeff Mason and Susan Heavey; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

By Anjali Athavaley
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has a higher probability than her likely Republican rival Donald Trump of becoming the next U.S. president, but the gap between the pair narrowed this week, according to the online political stock market PredictIt. Clinton's probability on Friday was 61 percent, down from 65 percent seven days ago, according to the site, which allows users to wager small amounts of money on ""yes"" or ""no"" predictions of future events. The probability that Trump will win the Nov. 8 election was 40 percent, up from 34 percent.Trump's sweeping victory in this week's Indiana primary prompted his remaining Republicans rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich to drop out of the race, cementing the businessman's status as the party's presumptive nominee. 
He is now testing out themes to use against Clinton to persuade disgruntled Republicans to get behind his campaign. On Friday, he criticized her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state.PredictIt is jointly run by Washington political consultancy Aristotle and Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. All of its users are registered U.S. voters.        
As with polls, predictions markets like PredictIt do not always accurately forecast outcome. Ninety days ago, its users gave Trump a 20 percent probability of winning the presidency, illustrating how the celebrity businessman's momentum was underestimated. Clinton is in a fight with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination and holds a clear lead in delegates.

WASHINGTON Donald Trump will testify after the Nov. 8 presidential election in a class-action lawsuit that accuses him and his now-defunct Trump University of defrauding people who paid up to $35,000 for real estate seminars, media reports said on Friday, citing his attorney.Court documents showed a federal judge ordered the trial to start in San Diego on Nov. 28. This raised the possibility that Trump could take the stand as president-elect but also ensured that he will not have to testify in the case while he campaigns.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee plans to attend much of the trial and would take the witness stand, Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli was quoted as saying by the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times.Petrocelli did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit claim the school lured ""student-victims"" into its doors, only to defraud them once their checks were cashed.Another Trump lawyer, Alan Garten, last year called the allegations ""totally lacking in any merit"" and said that Trump would prevail in the end ""whether it be by motion or at trial.""
Trump also faces another lawsuit in Manhattan over Trump University brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, which Garten has said is ""politically motivated."" Schneiderman is a Democrat.  
That fraud lawsuit, filed in 2013, seeks $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs. (Reporting by Eric Walsh; Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Would Donald Trump really consider not paying portions of the U.S. debt? The prospect riled economists on Friday as stories in the New York Times and the conservative website The Blaze cast fresh scrutiny on comments Trump made a day earlier.Responding to a question about the national debt, the likely Republican presidential nominee said in an interview on CNBC on Thursday he would ""borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal."" When asked if that meant he had taken a page from his own playbook as a businessman and try to get U.S. creditors to accept less than the full value of the bonds they hold, he said ""No,"" but added: ""I could see long-term renegotiations where we borrow long-term at very low rates.""The reaction to his words on Friday offered the first-time political candidate a taste of how delicate the prospect of discussing economic and fiscal policy can be. It also highlighted a danger for Trump as his campaign moves from a crowded, personality-fueled contest for the Republican nomination to a general election competition where the media and members of the public expect more policy details from the candidates.""Such remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent,"" the New York Times wrote in a story saying Trump's plan implied he would ""negotiate a partial repayment"" of U.S. debt.
""It's beyond ludicrous and irresponsible unless you're, say, an emerging market country,"" wrote the U.S. debt analyst David Ader, the head of rates strategy at CRT Capital, in a note to clients early Friday morning. A senior campaign adviser said Trump had not meant to suggest he would demur on any U.S. debt payments.""Mr. Trump was clear in saying that he was not going to renegotiate U.S. debt, despite being asked multiple times, and that he would not default on U.S. debt, despite being asked multiple times,"" said the adviser, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
""All he said is that he believes that long term low interest Treasuries would be a better deal for the U.S. taxpayer.""Still, four Trump companies have been through bankruptcies in which his creditors were forced to accept far less than the more than $4 billion he owed them, and in the CNBC interview he spoke of loving to ""play with"" debt.""The United States is nowhere near debt distress,"" said Charles Seville, an analyst at Fitch Ratings Inc. who focuses on government debt.
Seville said if the U.S. government were to choose not to repay creditors, it would ""undermine faith in the United States's ability to borrow at low rates which is the underpinning of its high credit rating,"" adding, ""there's no quick way of reducing the debt burden. It's something that would be a product of fiscal consolidation or faster growth."" Moreover, given that U.S. Treasuries are viewed as the safest-of-safe securities globally, underpinning the dollar's status as the world's preferred reserve currency, any damage to that reputation would likely unleash far-flung ructions in financial markets worldwide.The U.S. government regularly issues Treasury bills, notes and bonds maturing in a range of between four weeks and 30 years. Currently, interest rates on U.S. government debt are near historically low levels, meaning the government is able to borrow cheaply. The Treasury Department has been gradually moving more of its obligations into longer-term debt to take advantage of the low rates.

By Heide Brandes
| OKLAHOMA CITY

OKLAHOMA CITY Oklahoma's legislature has passed a bill aimed at reducing the state's bulging population of feral hogs, blamed for spreading disease and wiping out crops, that would let people kill them without a hunting license.A study by an agricultural research organization found that the animals are running wild in all of Oklahoma's 77 counties and could number as high as 1.6 million, which would be one of the highest feral hog populations of any state.The measure, passed on Thursday by the Republican-led legislature, would permit hunters to kill hogs without a hunting permit on their property or on someone else's property with the landowner's permission. It also would allow use of night-vision equipment to hunt them.Republican Governor Mary Fallin's office has not said whether she will sign it into law.""This legislation gives Oklahomans more options to combat the rapidly growing feral hog population,"" said Republican state Representative Sean Robert, a bill co-sponsor.
The most effective method of eradicating the wild hogs currently is aerial shooting from helicopters, state officials said.""Feral hogs wreak havoc on Oklahoma's farms, ranches and ecosystems, and cost farmers, ranchers and landowners,"" said Tom Buchanan, president of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, an agricultural industry group that supports the legislation.Bill opponents said it could prompt some people to bring even more feral hogs into Oklahoma to be shot by hunters.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said damage caused by feral swine across the United States could top $2 billion.""If you are a farmer, they can clean out your crops overnight,"" Dale Nolte, the inspection service's program manager, said in an interview. ""We have farmers tell us they have given up on planting high-dollar crops because of the feral hog problem.""
Texas, Oklahoma and California have the highest numbers of feral swine in the country, Nolte said. The inspection service has operations to remove them in 38 states, Nolte added.""The problem is that feral hogs are so prolific that we have to trap 70 percent of the pig population every year just to maintain the population level we have right now,"" said Kevin Grant, Oklahoma Wildlife Services state director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.""Out in the wild, feral hogs are an ecological nightmare. There is very little that is beneficial to native wildlife that come from feral swine,"" Grant said. (Reporting by Heide Brandes; Writing by Jon Herskovitz and Will Dunham)"
