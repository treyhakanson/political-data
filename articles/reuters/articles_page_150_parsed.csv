CHICAGO A prominent Illinois Republican has resigned from the state legislature, citing multiple incidents of fake Facebook and Twitter accounts set up in his name in recent weeks. ""After some cyber security issues arose, I began to re-evaluate my continued public service,"" Representative Ron Sandack, House Republican floor leader, said in a resignation letter dated Sunday and provided on Monday by the Republican Caucus.Sandack, known as an adamant defender of Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's initiatives on the floor of the Democratic-dominated House, was up for re-election in November against Democrat Greg Hose.His resignation comes as both major U.S. political parties are increasingly bedeviled by hacking, including Friday's leak of emails that have embarrassed Democrats as they gather for the party's convention in Philadelphia this week.
Sandack had been battling since July 4 to remove multiple fake Facebook and Twitter accounts in his name, he told Capitol Fax, a respected political blog based in Springfield, the state capital.It is not clear what, if anything, the fake accounts posted in his name.
Sandack, who was an active user of social media, has shut down his Facebook and Twitter accounts and has filed a police report regarding the fake ones, Capitol Fax reported.A spokeswoman for Jim Durkin, leader of the House Republicans, did not respond to a question on who would replace Sandack as Republican candidate for his seat. Rauner did not respond to reporters' questions about Sandack following an event on Monday morning. 
Sandack is a Chicago lawyer and former mayor of Downers Grove, Illinois. He was appointed in 2010 to the Illinois Senate to fill in for a senator who resigned, and went on to be elected as representative for his suburban Chicago district.In his resignation notice he also said he was no longer willing to miss so many family events.

By Dustin Volz and Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election.The FBI said it was investigating a cyber intrusion at the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which has led to discord as  the party's convention in Philadelphia opens on Monday to nominate former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton as its candidate.Although the hacking of the DNC was known to officials and cyber security experts a month ago, the timing of the release of the contents of communications within the party is what is causing concern for U.S. authorities.A U.S. official involved in the investigation said that the classified information collected on the hack so far ""indicated beyond a reasonable doubt that it originated in Russia."" The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the timing of the release of emails ""has all the hallmarks of a classic intelligence operation intended to damage a perceived adversary.""The official said, however, that it may be impossible to prove definitively that Russian President Vladimir Putin's government directed the attack.The emails, released by activist group WikiLeaks at the weekend, appeared to show favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race for the nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The committee is supposed to be neutral and the disclosure forced chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida, to resign.The U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee has been briefed and will seek information on any potential connection to Russia or any other state, said Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the panel.
""That foreign actors may be trying to influence our election - let alone a powerful adversary like Russia - should concern all Americans of any party."" Schiff said in a statement.On Sunday, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN that the campaign had been told by ""experts"" that the emails were released by suspected Russian hackers to help Republican Party nominee Donald Trump.The businessman's campaign dismissed the allegation as absurd.Trump has often praised Putin, calling him a ""strong leader."" Trump is a critic of NATO and last week he  told The New York Times that he might not back countries in the alliance if they were attacked by Russia, unless he was sure they had made sufficient contributions to the group. 
Russia has long been considered among the most elite U.S. adversaries in cyberspace, though its actions are generally viewed as efforts at covert intelligence gathering.""Usually, the Russians are not ham-handed,"" said Jim Lewis, a cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said Russia was believed to have hacked Democratic and Republican campaigns in 2008, but that it did not leak material.""It would be a bold move to try and shape the election, but we can't rule it out,"" Lewis said.CrowdStrike, a cyber firm that helped clean up the breach, said last month it had identified two hacking groups that infiltrated the DNC and that both were believed to be working on behalf of two competing arms of the Russian government.
Its findings were later supported by similar conclusions reached by FireEye's (FEYE.O) Mandiant unit and Fidelis, two other U.S.-based cyber companies.  Experts said that forensic analysis of the breach also links the same hackers to attacks at the White House, the State Department, the German Bundestag and private companies.The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to say when its probe of the hack began. ""A compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,"" it said in a statement.WikiLeaks released more than 19,000 DNC emails on Saturday. On Twitter it rejected as speculation claims made that Russia was the source of the cache. The group also said that there would be more leaks related to the U.S. election.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he could not speak to the veracity of private sector conclusions pointing to Russia as the culprit in the DNC hack, but that he was confident the FBI would thoroughly investigate the matter.

By Nate Raymond

A Florida man pleaded guilty on Monday to working with another man to illegally funnel $80,000 in foreign contributions to U.S. President Barack Obama's joint fundraising committee in 2012 so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event.William Argeros, 57, pleaded guilty in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, to charges that he knowingly and willfully made foreign contributions and donations and made a false  declaration to a federal grand jury, prosecutors said.U.S. law prohibits contributions from foreign nationals to candidates or fundraising committees in federal elections.A lawyer for Argeros did not respond to a request for comment. The Tampa, Florida, resident is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 9.The proceedings came a month after an earlier guilty plea in the case by Bilal Shehu, a New Jersey limousine driver to whom prosecutors said Argeros facilitated the transferring of $80,000 from a foreign source.
Prosecutors said Shehu, a Paramus, New Jersey resident, then provided the money to Obama's joint fundraising committee so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event on Oct. 8, 2012, in San Francisco.In announcing both guilty pleas, prosecutors have not specifically identified the foreign source of the money or the foreign national.
But the cases came after a Republican congressman in 2013 called for investigations into the purchases by Shehu's family of two $40,000 tickets for a San Francisco fundraiser, one of which was used by now-Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama.At the October 2012 event, Rama, the Albanian Socialist Party leader, was photographed with Obama.U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California at the time contended the photo was then used for ""deceitful"" purposes by Rama to imply a relationship with Obama during Albania's own election, which brought him into leadership.
Prosecutors have said that the foreign national in the case was denied entry to the campaign event but was allowed to be photographed with Obama.Prosecutors said no one on the joint election committee has been accused of any wrongdoing and that it had cooperated fully in the investigation.

NAIROBI President Barack Obama's half-brother, Malik Obama, says he will vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump in the U.S. election in November because he likes the candidate and he is unhappy with his brother's leadership.Malik, who is in his 50s, told Reuters by phone from Obama's ancestral home of Kogelo in western Kenya that he supports Trump's policies, especially his focus on security.""He appeals to me and also I think that he is down to earth and he speaks from the heart and he is not trying to be politically correct. He's just straight-forward,"" he said.MORE ELECTION COVERAGE* Divisions plague Democrats as they open convention to anoint Clinton* Wider Image: Women workers on the Clinton campaign * Kaine makes campaign-trail debutMalik, a U.S. citizen, has lived in Washington since 1985 where he worked with various firms before becoming an independent financial consultant.
Trump's stance against Muslims coming in to the United States was understandable even to Muslims like himself, Malik said.""I'm a Muslim, of course, but you can't have people going around just shooting people and killing people just in the name of Islam,"" he said.He criticized President Obama's record in the White House saying he had not done much for the American people and his extended family despite the high expectations that accompanied his election in 2008, both in the United States and Kenya.
The two men appear to have drifted apart but were previously close. Malik has visited the president in the Oval office and was also best man at Barack's wedding.Obama's election created much excitement in Kenya especially in Kogelo village where their father was born before going to study at the University of Hawaii.
Obama visited Nairobi, in the first ever trip by a sitting U.S. president to the East African nation last July, and promised to visit more often when he leaves office.Malik defended his right to criticize his brother, citing freedom of expression.""To each his own. I speak my mind and I'm not going to be put in a box just because my brother is the President of the United States,"" Malik said. (Editing by Angus MacSwan)"	['Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]

By John Whitesides
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA The head of the Democratic Party resigned on Sunday amid a furor over embarrassing leaked emails, hoping to head off a growing rebellion by Bernie Sanders supporters on the eve of the convention to nominate Hillary Clinton for the White House.Lingering bitterness from the heated primary campaign between Clinton and Sanders erupted after more than 19,000 Democratic National Committee emails, leaked on Friday, confirmed Sanders' frequent charge that the party played favorites in the race.In a statement, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the best way for the party to accomplish its goal of putting Clinton in the White House was for her to step aside after the convention. Sanders had demanded earlier in the day that Wasserman Schultz resign.The furor was a blow to a party keen on projecting stability in contrast to the volatility of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who was formally nominated at a raucous convention in Cleveland last week.It also overshadowed preparations in Philadelphia for Clinton's coronation as the nominee to face Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. She will be the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. The four-day Democratic convention will open on Monday. In some good news for Clinton, The New York Times reported that businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will endorse her in a prime-time speech on Monday, saying she will be the best choice for moderate voters in 2016.The cache of emails leaked on Friday by the WikiLeaks website disclosed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine Sanders' insurgent presidential campaign, including raising questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist.Sanders said Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative from Florida, had made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. ""The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race,"" he said.'RUSSIAN CONNECTION?'
The Clinton camp questioned whether Russians may have had a hand in the hack attack on the party's emails and were interested in helping Trump, who has exchanged words of praise with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""What's disturbing to us is that experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these emails and other experts are now saying that Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of helping Donald Trump,"" Clinton campaign chairman Robby Mook said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the Clinton camp was trying to distract from its party discord ahead of the convention.""What's in those emails show that it was a clearly rigged system, that Bernie Sanders ... never had a chance,""Manafort said on ABC. Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state, and Sanders, 74, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat, waged a bruising months-long battle for the nomination. Branding himself a democratic socialist, Sanders galvanized young and liberal voters with his calls to rein in Wall Street and eradicate income inequality.   But Sanders repeatedly voiced frustration with a DNC and party establishment he felt was stacked against him, and the resentment from Sanders and his supporters threatened to disrupt the convention.
""I'm not shocked but I'm disappointed,"" Sanders said of the emails earlier on Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""The emails showed DNC officials pondering various ways to undercut Sanders. Brad Marshall, the DNC's chief financial officer, apologized on Facebook on Saturday for an email in which he discussed how some voters in upcoming nominating contests in Kentucky and West Virginia would reject an atheist.""He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage,"" Marshall wrote in a May 5 email to three top DNC officials. No names were mentioned, but Sanders was the only Jewish candidate.""I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.""Clinton told CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in an interview that aired on Sunday that she had not read any of the emails but it was ""wrong and unacceptable"" to bring religion into the political process.
SANDERS SUPPORTERS ANGRY
The emails angered many Sanders supporters who were already dismayed by Clinton's choice on Friday of low-key U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her vice presidential running mate. Kaine, 58, who could appeal to independents and moderates, has never been aligned with party liberals.Sanders, who has endorsed Clinton and will speak on her behalf to the convention on Monday, said he would have preferred she pick U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the party's liberal wing, as her No. 2.""I have known Tim Kaine for a number of years. ... Tim is a very, very smart guy. He is a very nice guy,"" Sanders said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""He is more conservative than I am. Would I have preferred to see somebody like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton? Yes, I would have,"" he said. Carrying pitchforks meant to portray Clinton as the devil, hundreds of Sanders supporters took to the streets of Philadelphia earlier on Sunday to say they felt betrayed by the DNC.""It just validated everything we thought, everything we believed to be true, that this was completely rigged right from the beginning, and that you know it was really about what they were doing everything to set it up so she would win,"" Sanders supporter Gwen Sperling said.DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election, the DNC said on Twitter.

By Amanda Becker and John Whitesides
| MIAMI/WASHINGTON

MIAMI/WASHINGTON Democrat Tim Kaine made his first appearance on the campaign trail as Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate on Saturday, touting an optimistic view of America and leaping to attack Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's record.Joining Clinton at a rally in the battleground state of Florida, the bilingual Kaine peppered Spanish-language phrases into a speech focused on introducing himself to voters unfamiliar with the low-key U.S. senator from Virginia.Kaine criticized Trump's recent suggestion he might not honor U.S. security commitments to NATO in Europe, and the real estate mogul's history of casino bankruptcies and founding the failed Trump University.""When Donald Trump says he has your back, you better watch out,"" Kaine said, with Clinton sitting at his side nodding. ""He leaves a trail of broken promises and wrecked lives wherever he goes. We can't afford to let him do the same thing to our country.""In contrast, he said, Clinton ""doesn't insult people, she listens to them. What a novel concept."" He said they shared a common creed: ""Do all the good you can.""Clinton unveiled her choice of Kaine late on Friday, grabbing the political spotlight from Trump, who accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday night after a chaotic four-day convention.The former secretary of state will formally be nominated as her party's presidential candidate in the Nov. 8 election at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, which opens on Monday.In choosing the soft-spoken Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and Virginia governor with a long establishment resume, Clinton opted for a steady and experienced hand who she hopes will offer a clear alternative to Trump's volatile campaign and his Republican vice presidential choice Mike Pence.""Senator Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not. He is qualified to step into this job and lead on day one,"" Clinton told the Miami crowd.Trump was unimpressed, saying on Twitter he had watched the joint appearance and ""ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!""
In his speech, Kaine said he was an optimist and described his childhood in Kansas City helping his father in his metal-working shop and his Catholic mission to Honduras, where he helped teenagers with carpentry and welding and they taught him Spanish.FAITH, FAMILY AND WORK
He said in Honduras he learned the values ""Fe, familia, y trabajo"" -- faith, family, and work.Kaine became emotional when he recalled the 2007 shooting deaths of 32 people at Virginia Tech University during his stint as governor, calling it the worst day of his life. He promised to take on the National Rifle Association and fight for ""common sense"" gun control.
Judith Sweeney, 58, from West Park, Florida, said she knew little about Kaine before attending the speech but was impressed by his resume and liked his civil rights work and school reform efforts. ""Wonderful, very experienced, an innovator,"" she said.Peter Daou, a former adviser to Clinton who now owns a media company, said Kaine's speech would turn around some of the doubters about the choice.""The combination of his tone, his demeanor, his life story -it just said a lot about her capacity to choose the right person and not listen to pressure from the outside,"" he said.Clinton is hoping Kaine will help her appeal to independents and moderates, but some supporters of Clinton's Democratic primary rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, were dismayed by the choice because of Kaine's past advocacy for an Asian free-trade pact.But in a nod to party liberals, the Clinton campaign said Kaine will not support the final version of the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership, which is pending in the Senate. A spokeswoman for Kaine confirmed his opposition to the pact.
The decision drew cheers from liberal groups and labor leaders.""We're glad to see the Clinton-Kaine ticket taking steps to campaign on big, bold, populist ideas that voters want to hear from Democrats,"" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progessive Change Campaign Committee.Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said Kaine's decision to join Clinton in opposing the trade pact ""sets an irretrievable, progressive path forward for America.""In picking Kaine, Clinton passed over liberal candidates who would have generated more grassroots enthusiasm like U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Hispanic Cabinet members Julian Castro and Thomas Perez.Clinton tried to reassure party liberals, offering an extended list of Kaine's efforts on behalf of low-income workers, education and civil rights, and for expanded gun control laws and immigration reform.""He fights for the people he represents, and he delivers real results,"" Clinton said, applying one of her favorite self-descriptions to him. ""When I say he's a progressive who likes to get things done, I mean it.""Sanders supporters lost their bid to eliminate or reduce the influence of superdelegates, party leaders who are not bound to any candidate, during a meeting of the convention rules committee in Philadelphia. Sanders had complained about the superdelegates, which overwhelmingly backed Clinton.But enough committee members backed the effort to let them take the fight to the convention floor during next week's convention, participants said.
