LONDON Donald Trump told Britons on Sunday he supported Brexit, repeating just days before the vote on June 23 that he thinks the UK would be better off outside the European Union.As the campaign to decide Britain's EU membership restarted after a three-day hiatus following the killing of lawmaker Jo Cox, Trump, the presumptive Republican U.S. presidential candidate, said in a newspaper interview he was backing an ""out"" vote. ""I would personally be more inclined to leave, for a lot of reasons like having a lot less bureaucracy,"" he told the Sunday Times. ""But I am not a British citizen. This is just my opinion.""The billionaire businessman also told the newspaper that he would seek to have good relationships internationally if he were elected president in November, including with David Cameron. The British Prime Minister has in the past called Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States ""divisive, stupid and wrong"". 
Trump said in May that Britain would be better off outside the EU because of high levels of migration.The latest opinion polls showed the 'Remain' camp recovering some momentum, although the overall picture remains one of an evenly split electorate.
Trump, whose mother was Scottish, is due to be in Britain the day after the referendum, when he visits two golf courses he owns in Scotland.
Trump also said that if he became president he would try to improve the trade deals the U.S. has with China, and work more closely with Russia and that could include co-operating with Russia in the fight against Islamic State.  (Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)"	['Trump']	[]

By Richard Cowan and Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrats pushing for gun curbs after the latest mass shooting in the United States are co-opting a Republican mantra to build public support and defang opposition: it's time to get tough on national security.Shoring up national security has long been a pillar of Republican orthodoxy, as has staunch opposition to gun control.But the massacre of 49 people in Orlando, Florida, last Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, by a gunman who pledged loyalty to Islamist militants may be leaving Republicans on shakier ground.With national security driving the debate, Democrats see a more powerful argument than simply advocating the need to curb gun violence in a country of 320 million that has more than 310 million weapons.Although the Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed to have had no help from extremist Islamist groups in targeting a gay nightclub, he had been investigated by U.S. authorities for possible links to terrorism and subsequently cleared.That prompted Democrats to clamor for legislation to expand background checks and prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns. Votes on four measures were scheduled Monday in the U.S. Senate, two sponsored by Democrats and two by Republicans. Many Republicans, and some Democrats, oppose strict gun curbs partly on constitutional grounds.""Every senator is now going to have to say, whether they're for terrorists getting guns or against terrorists getting guns,"" Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer told reporters on Thursday.""The terrorists that we need to fear are not on the streets of Aleppo, or Mosul or Fallujah. They're on the streets of the United States and they will have guns unless we pass tough laws,"" added Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat.President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson all took the tack this week that gun measures were a safeguard against terrorism.
Republicans have long criticized Obama for not being tough enough on national security and doing more in the fight against Islamic State.The Orlando massacre and the San Bernardino, California shooting in December by a couple inspired by Islamic State  captured the attention of the American public in a way previous mass shootings have not, said Tom Diaz, a former member of the National Rifle Association gun rights lobby who now backs gun control.""They've changed the dynamic of this whole issue,"" said Diaz, an author and expert on terrorism and the gun industry.That shift in sentiment has heartened the families of the 20 elementary school children and six staff members killed in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012, who championed the last big, and ultimately unsuccessful push, on gun control.About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014.
REPUBLICANS AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS
Diaz believes Republicans must look as if they care about keeping guns out of the hands of so-called homegrown extremists, while balancing issues of due process and the Constitution's Second Amendment right to bear arms that form the backbone of the NRA's opposition to gun control.Republicans say new laws won't necessarily keep weapons out of the hands of people intent on doing harm, and are keen to avoid twinning the two issues. ""This is not a gun control issue,"" U.S. Senator Ted Cruz  said on Thursday. ""This is a terrorism issue.""
Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said Democrats ""must be careful about overplaying their hand with rhetoric that could sound like government overreach to Americans who believe in the Second Amendment.""Even if the current efforts fail, the new push on national security may prove Democrats' best shot at eventually luring Republican support on an issue that has floundered for decades.""This is a chance for the Democrats to talk in tough terms about safety and security and also to link that to the gun issue,"" said Robert Spitzer, political science professor at State University of New York at Cortland.Some notable Republicans appeared willing this week to engage in the debate on gun control. The party's presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, vowed to meet with the NRA to talk about ways to bar people on certain government watch lists from buying guns.The top Republican in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said he was open to suggestions from experts on how to prevent terrorism suspects from acquiring firearms and called the Orlando shooting a ""calculated act of terror.""But it was unclear whether Trump or McConnell would throw their weight behind any measures acceptable to Democrats.Democratic U.S. Representative Jim Himes said he did not hold out great hope that the gun legislation would advance.""The reason you won't see a compromise anytime soon is because Congress actually acting in the wake of Orlando would be a tacit admission on the other side that guns had something to do with what happened in Orlando as opposed to ISIS,"" he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump chipped away at Hillary Clinton's lead in the presidential race this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, as the candidates clashed over how to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. That's down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a ""proven history of terrorism"" against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States.He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party's general opposition to gun control.
While Trump's comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters.Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump's idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014.  
Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called ""radical jihadist terrorism,"" while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons.As usual after a major attack, ""terrorism"" jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues.
The poll's five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clinton's support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trump's 32.3 percent.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The political horserace poll included 1,133 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll's accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points.

By James Odato
| ALBANY, N.Y.

ALBANY, N.Y. Fantasy sports moved a step closer to being legal in New York on Saturday when lawmakers approved the daily and season-long games, clearing a path for FanDuel, DraftKings and others to offer them to millions of players in the state.The multibillion-dollar industry, where players draft fantasy teams for sports including football, basketball and baseball, has drawn increased scrutiny since last year with the attorneys general of several U.S. states, including New York, Illinois and Nevada, questioning the legality of the games.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had held off on pursuing litigation against the fantasy companies for what he claimed were illegal gambling operations, and the companies have suspended their ""games of skill"" while the proposed legislation was in train.New York's Senate passed the measure 45-17 early Saturday morning, sending the legislation that regulates and taxes the operators of fantasy sports games to Governor Andrew Cuomo.It is unclear whether Cuomo will sign the legislation, which the Assembly passed on Friday. Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game where players draft teams in live games played in just one evening or over a weekend, has boomed over the past decade.State Assembly Gaming Committee Chairman J. Gary Pretlow predicted Cuomo would endorse the bill, partly because many young New York voters play the fantasy games and because it would generate tax revenues.
""It's a good thing for New Yorkers because there are more than three and half million participants, most of them millennials,"" Pretlow said.DraftKings, which has dominated the industry along with FanDuel, praised the legislation as providing what it called a ""sensible framework for regulating our games"". In a statement on Saturday, the company said it would resume operations soon with new rules that provide ""fairness and transparency at the core"" of all its contests, assuming the governor signs the legislation.FanDuel pointed out that New York was the seventh state to pass a fantasy sports bill this year, following Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Virginia.
""It speaks to the popularity of our game"" said Nigel Eccles, the company's CEO and co-founder.The New York legislation calls for a 15 percent annual state tax on gross revenues of all sports fantasy contests with an entry fee. Another 0.5 percent will be assessed each year on the companies with a maximum of $50,000.State Senator John Bonacic, who sponsored the bill, estimates annual state revenues will be about $5.5 million, adding that the measure is ""going to make a lot of New Yorkers very happy"".
The legislation survived heavy opposition from casino companies operating in New York.Opponents said it would weaken New York's current gaming operations, including the horse racing industry which has been propped up by state government, by giving gamblers more options.After intense lobbying from the fantasy gaming industry, which retained former pro quarterbacks Jim Kelly and Vinny Testaverde to promote the games, lawmakers beat a June 30 deadline to set regulations.Schneiderman said in a statement on Saturday that he would enforce the law as amended, but his office would still pursue claims that DraftKings and FanDuel had engaged in false advertising and consumer fraud.FanDuel and DraftKings are in early-stage talks to merge, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.

By Terry Wade and Ernest Scheyder
| HOUSTON

HOUSTON A Republican-led congressional committee sought on Friday to assert oversight over inquiries that about 20 states are making into Exxon Mobil and climate change, reiterating demands to know more about state attorneys general's consultations with environmental groups.In a letter, some 17 members of Congress and ranking members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee said they have broad jurisdiction that allows them to review investigations carried out by states. The committee was pushing back against state officials who have said they are not subject to federal oversight.The standoff is the latest in a high-stakes battle between the world's largest publicly traded oil company and a coalition of state attorneys general who have said they would go after Exxon in a bid to force congressional action to tackle climate change.About 20 state officials jointly said in March they would participate in inquiries into whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of climate change.
Prior to that March announcement, some state officials met with a range of prominent environmental and investment groups that oppose fossil fuels.The House committee has complained the inquiries risk stifling free speech and scientific inquiry, and that state officials were coordinating with special interest groups.The House committee demanded for the second time since May that state officials hand over all records of communications between their offices and outside groups.
""Congress has a responsibility to investigate whether such investigations are having a chilling effect on the free flow of scientific inquiry and debate regarding climate change,"" the letter said.""People should be troubled by any attempt by members of Congress to silence or undercut basic investigatory authority by a state attorney general's office,"" said Cyndi Roy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. ""Our office will not be intimidated by oil industry-backed members of the U.S. House of Representatives.""
Exxon, for its part, has said it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years and communicated this to investors.  On Wednesday, Exxon asked a federal court to throw out a subpoena that would force it to hand over decades of documents on climate change to Healey's office.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Former President George W. Bush had every intention of sticking to his self-imposed exile from politics, but found that the phone kept ringing with appeals from Republican U.S. Senate candidates for help, friends say.As a result, Bush has embarked on a rescue mission to try to preserve the Republicans' narrow Senate majority in a year in which many party figures fear presumptive nominee Donald Trump will drag them down to defeat in the Nov. 8 elections.Republicans control 54 seats in the 100-member Senate.""I think that this is a one-off, temporary thing that where he can be helpful he will be,"" said Dana Perino, who was Bush's White House press secretary.Condoleezza Rice, who was Bush's secretary of state and is now a political science professor at Stanford University, is also raising money for Republican candidates, but on Friday ruled out speculation that she might be drafted as Trump's vice presidential running mate.""Dr. Rice has repeatedly said in past cycles as well as this one, she's not interested in being vice president. She's happy at Stanford and plans to stay,"" said Rice chief of staff Georgia Godfrey.
Friends say Bush was initially reluctant to get involved, feeling his time in the limelight had passed. They said he was surprised at the appeals he was receiving to get back into politics more than seven years after his eight-year White House run ended.So far Bush has headlined fund-raising events for Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. He plans to help senators Rob Portman of Ohio, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Roy Blunt of Missouri.Bush is no fan of Trump, but to a certain extent, he is doing Trump a favor in spite of the continuing antagonism toward the Bush family from the bellicose New York businessman.
Typically, the party's nominee is the chief fund-raiser in election years, but Trump's fund-raising effort has lagged.Meanwhile, Trump continues to take swipes at the Bush family, particularly at Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who was defeated by Trump in the Republican presidential primary race.On Wednesday in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump complained about Jeb's decision not to honor a pledge made last year to support the Republican presidential nominee whoever it is.
""He signed the pledge but he hasn't endorsed me,"" Trump said.Like his brother, Jeb Bush is helping raise money for Republican congressional candidates.""The Bush family has a deep love for the party and cares about the future and in light of Trump's capacity to damage the brand, I think this is part and parcel of doing what they can to preserve the party,"" said Jeb Bush's spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell.

CARLSBAD CAVERNS NATIONAL PARK, N.M. U.S. President Barack Obama and his family escaped the blistering heat of the Chihuahuan Desert on Friday when they went through a maze of ancient caverns where the only sound was the drip-dripping from stalactites.The subterranean adventure was the first stop on a working vacation during which Obama will spend some time with his teenaged daughters while making the case for more spending on conservation and curbing climate change.It was just like any other family holiday, except the entourage of Secret Service agents, aides and press who follow Obama wherever he goes had to descend the 754 feet (230 m) on elevators in eight shifts.""How cool is this?"" he said to the press in the dark, damp alien landscape of the ""Big Room,"" the best known of the labyrinth of limestone caves that actor Will Rogers once called the ""Grand Canyon with a roof on it."" The president is helping celebrate the centennial of the National Park Service while highlighting his plan to reduce climate-changing carbon emissions, which he sees as part of the legacy of his time in office.The White House has said the changing climate evidenced by  droughts, increased flooding and wildfires and stronger storms has put national parks at risk.
The Obamas were due to fly west later on Friday to the Sierra Nevada mountains and Yosemite, the country's oldest national park and one of its most popular landmarks.Visits to national parks have surged due in part to lower gasoline prices.Still, roads, sewer systems and visitor centers in national parks are aging, and the government is grappling with a $11.5 billion backlog of maintenance projects.
At Carlsbad, elevators broke down in 2015, though they seemed in good shape for the Obamas' descent.During his time in office, which will end on Jan. 20, 2017, Obama has added 20 sites to the national park system, protecting more than 265 million acres of public land and water and historic sites with new parks, monuments and restrictions for development, more than any other president.Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said national park visits in 2016 were on pace to beat last year's record of 307 million. Tourists contributed an estimated $300 billion to the economy, supporting about 2 million jobs, she told reporters.
She wants Congress to remember those numbers as it considers investments in public lands.Republicans have slammed Obama for adding sites at a time when the government does not have enough funding to look after existing ones.""To me, there is little point in conserving lands or allowing the federal government to acquire even more land if we are not going to take proper care of them,"" Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said last year.

By Richard Cowan and Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Some Republican senators tried on Friday to craft a compromise bill to impose limited gun restrictions in the face of pressure from Democrats and public rage over the Orlando mass shooting, the deadliest in modern U.S. history.A gunman killed 49 people at the Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub last Sunday, sparking a scramble over competing gun measures in the U.S. Senate.While past gun-control measures have failed to clear Congress, the massacre, coupled with public pressure and a suggestion by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he can work with gun rights lobbyists to bring about change, may be changing the picture.Republicans over the years have blocked gun control measures saying they step on Americans' right to bear arms as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. During a week-long Senate debate, Democrats generally have criticized proposed Republican measures as being ineffective.Republicans and Democrats have offered four separate proposals to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales for people on terrorism ""watch lists."" But they seem destined to fail because of partisan politics and a requirement that any proposal muster 60 of the 100 votes in the U.S. Senate.MAINE SENATOR LEADING EFFORT
Republican Susan Collins of Maine, leading the new effort, is considering a more tailored approach. It would prevent the sale of guns to terrorism suspects whose names appear on either the government's ""no-fly"" list, which bans them from boarding planes, or a so-called ""selectee"" list that requires additional screening at airports, her office said in an emailed statement.These lists are much shorter than a broad terrorism watch list kept by the FBI. 
Collins' measure also includes a five-year ""look-back"" provision that would notify the government if someone who had been on the ""no-fly"" or ""selectee"" list in the last five years, but was dropped, purchases a gun. ""That would allow the FBI to put the individual under surveillance or take other appropriate action it deems necessary,"" Collins' office said.The gun control issue is deeply divisive and there have been no major restrictions passed since 1994, when Congress imposed a ban on semi-automatic assault weapons. That expired after 10 years.About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014.    Vice President Joe Biden weighed in on the debate, urging a public groundswell in support of banning the type of weapons that have been used in mass shootings. ""Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership,"" Biden said on Friday.Both the gunman in the Orlando attack, Omar Mateen, and the married couple who carried out a December mass shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, were thought to have been inspired by militant Islamist groups abroad.
PROPOSALS NEXT WEEK
Collins' proposal likely would be offered in the Republican-led Senate sometime next week, provided the four other gun-control proposals fail to pass on Monday. Collins is working on the legislation with Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire; she has also been talking to Democrats.A senior Democratic aide said that Democrats have concerns that under Collins' bill, some people credibly suspected of involvement in terrorism would not be covered by the weapons ban.
Collins told reporters on Thursday that barring everyone on terrorism watch lists from weapons purchases carried with it the risk of affecting people who have been swept onto the lists without good cause.U.S. authorities maintain several watch lists - the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains three and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence runs one database. People are placed on such lists based on the threat level they are believed to pose.""What we're trying to do is not deny constitutional rights to a large group of individuals"" who find themselves on watch lists despite the fact that there might not be credible evidence of potential criminal intentions, Collins said.At least one Senate Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, has been involved in the talks, her spokeswoman said. ""I think she (Collins) is sincerely committed to finding a way to work this out,"" said U.S. Senator Chris Murphy who, along with fellow Democrats, set the U.S. Capitol abuzz by talking on the Senate floor for nearly 15 straight hours this week to demand that Congress act on gun control.Murphy said it was too early to say whether any Democrats would get on board with her approach.On Friday, the largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group in the United States, the Human Rights Campaign, said it would push for curtailing access to assault-style rifles, expanding background checks for firearms buyers and limiting the ability of suspected terrorists to purchase guns.

By Timothy Gardner and Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama and the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Friday discussed ways to support Iraqis in their fight against Islamic State militants and the importance of a political transition in war-torn Syria, the White House said.Obama met with Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval office for about an hour. The deputy crown prince is visiting the United States to repair frayed relations and to promote a plan, known as Vision 2030, to slash the kingdom's dependence on oil exports.""The President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia's contributions to the campaign against ISIL,"" the White House said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. The two talked about steps to support Iraqis ""including increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs,"" the White House said. U.S. officials have expressed unease about the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which according to the United Nations and human rights groups has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties.
Saudi Arabia is worried about closer relations between the United States and Iran, Riyadh's arch enemy, after a 2015 nuclear deal.  Obama welcomed Saudi Arabia's commitment to a political settlement of the Yemen conflict and support by the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the kingdom is a member, to address humanitarian needs and rebuild the country, the White House said. 
On Syria, Obama and the prince talked about the importance of supporting a political transition away from President Bashar al-Assad, the White House said. The United States is working with international partners on what it calls a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the United Nations, but so far there has been little progress. Over 50 diplomats at the U.S. State Department signed a memo, leaked on Thursday, that was critical of the Obama administration's Syria policy and called for targeted military strikes against Assad's government. Asked about the memo, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, also in Washington, told reporters the kingdom had been arguing for a ""more robust intervention"" including airstrikes, a no-fly zone, and a no-drive zone, from the beginning of the five-year civil war. 
Obama does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, White House spokeswoman Jen Friedman said. Both Washington and Riyadh are anticipating the release of classified pages of a U.S. report into the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that some U.S. lawmakers have alleged link Saudi government officials to the attacks. Jubeir said investigations show that the allegations ""are not correct and they don't hold.""

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-beverages-sodatax-bloomberg-idUSKCN0Z3275	Bloomberg looks West after bankrolling Philadelphia soda tax win	"


By Luc Cohen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK After successfully funding a campaign to pass a soda tax in Philadelphia, billionaire Michael Bloomberg is preparing to fund similar efforts in several other cities, giving new momentum to  measures seeking to limit soft drink consumption.The former New York City mayor contributed the bulk of the money for the pro-soda tax side in Philadelphia, providing around $1.6 million. Now the prominent public health crusader will support measures in San Francisco and Oakland, California this year, Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg, said in a conference call on Friday.Bloomberg may also support soda tax drives in Seattle and Multnomah County in Oregon, which includes Portland, in 2017, Wolfson said. The billionaire's planned backing raises the stakes for the powerful beverage industry, which has lobbied hard to defeat many of the 43 municipal and state-level attempts to implement a soda tax that have failed since 2008. Before this week, Berkeley, California was the only U.S. city with a soda tax. But the success in Philadelphia, the country's fifth-largest city with a diverse population of 1.6 million, could mark a turning point as Americans become more aware of health campaigners' message that sugary soft drinks contribute to obesity and diabetes.  
""If Berkeley was a tremor, Philadelphia is an earthquake, and we expect there will be more earthquakes going forward,"" Wolfson said. As New York's mayor, Bloomberg led efforts to pass a state-level soda tax, prevent residents from buying sodas with food stamps, and limit the size of sugary beverages. His efforts prompted public outcry against what were dubbed ""nanny state"" initiatives, and all three measures were ultimately defeated.Philadelphia's Mayor Jim Kenney took a different approach, emphasizing the revenue benefits of the tax over the health angle. The city council approved the measure in a 13-4 vote on Thursday after activists raised a total of around $2 million, according to Kevin Feeley, who led the pro-tax campaign. 
Feeley and Wolfson both said the soda industry outspent the pro-tax campaign. A spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association (ABA), which represents Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo and funded a local group opposing the tax, said the group did not yet have a final tally for how much it spent.The spokeswoman added that the group would ""oppose all discriminatory tax proposals."" The group has said the tax's passage in Philadelphia was the result of unique local political conditions and unlikely to have a ripple effect in other cities.  
The ABA said on Thursday it would sue Philadelphia to stop the tax, and Wolfson did not rule out the possibility that Bloomberg would contribute to aid the city's defense. Wolfson declined to specify an amount that Bloomberg was willing to spend on the San Francisco and Oakland efforts, but noted that he was ""not in a position to match soda dollar for dollar."" Bloomberg's contributions are meant to help ""level the playing field,"" he said.(Story corrects first name of Howard Wolfson in paragraph two previously said Michael.)
