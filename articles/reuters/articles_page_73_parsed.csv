WASHINGTON Donald Trump on Monday suffered another political setback when U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan distanced himself from the Republican presidential candidate's troubled campaign.Ryan, according to someone familiar with a conference call held by the speaker and House Republican lawmakers, will not campaign with Trump in the run-up to the Nov. 8 elections and will not defend the Republican Party nominee.
The source did not say whether Ryan intended to withdraw his support for Trump. But a spokeswoman added that the Wisconsin congressman will focus on maintaining a Republican majority in the House.

By Emily Stephenson and Roberta Rampton
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump plunged into a deep crisis on Friday after a bombshell 2005 recording came to light in which he boasted in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with an unidentified married woman and groping women, saying ""when you're a star, they let you do it.""A stream of Republican leaders denounced the remarks, first published by the Washington Post, which threaten Trump's already shaky standing with women voters just a month ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican elected official, said he was ""sickened"" by the comments and said Trump would no longer attend a campaign event in Wisconsin with him on Saturday.""I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,"" Ryan said in a statement.Reince Preibus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: ""No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the comments were ""repugnant"" and that Trump ""needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere.""U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who has been one of Clinton's fiercest critics, said he had retracted his endorsement of Trump, telling CNN he would not be able to look his 15-year-old daughter in the eye if he voted for Trump.Utah's Republican Governor Gary Herbert said on Twitter he would also no longer vote for Trump. ""Tonight, millions of Republicans are facing a moment of truth,"" Herbert said.Republican lawmaker Mike Coffman from Colorado told CBS that Trump should ""step aside"" and said ""his defeat at this point seems almost certain.""Trump was expected to release a video statement late on Friday.Earlier, in a brief written statement, Trump shrugged off the leaked tape as ""locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.""In the recorded conversation, Trump was wearing a microphone and chatting on a bus with Billy Bush, then host of NBC's ""Access Hollywood"" ahead of a segment they were about to tape.""I did try and fuck her. She was married,"" Trump said. ""I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there.""
Trump talked about his attraction to beautiful women. ""I just start kissing them,"" he said.""And when you're a star they let you do it,"" he said.""Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.""Trump, who has brought up former President Bill Clinton's infidelities as a criticism of Hillary Clinton, calling her a ""total enabler,"" responded to the audio.""Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended,"" Trump said.""Access Hollywood"" confirmed the video in its own report, saying it discovered the comments in its library.
Billy Bush said in a statement to Variety he was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" of his comments.Other prominent Republicans also condemned the comments but stopped short of withdrawing their support for their candidate, including Arizona Senator John McCain and Texas Senator Ted Cruz.NEW GROUND
Trump, known for his unconventional and controversial speaking style, has made a series of gaffes in his campaign, but the ""graphic nature"" of the clip will hurt his standing among women, independents, and wavering Republicans, said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.""We've never seen something like this Trump clip in a modern presidential campaign,"" Yepsen said, calling the incident ""sad for the American political system"" and for Trump's supporters.Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said ""this feels like it is quickly becoming a political 'game over'"" for Trump.
""Unless voters don't care about these issues or believe that this is simply political dirty tricks by releasing the videos now, Trump is going to have to pull a rabbit out of his hat in order to turn things around,"" Bonjean said.Still, Trump's past controversial comments have failed to shake his core supporters, said David Axelrod, a former political adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama.""Appalling as the (Trump) tape is, I'm reminded of all the times we have said, THIS time he's REALLY done,"" Axelrod said on Twitter.The revelation comes right before Sunday's town hall-style debate, seen as critical as Trump tries to rebound from a dip in some opinion polls after a rocky performance in the first debate.Clinton, who slammed Trump's comments as ""horrific,"" was also hit by a leak on Friday. Wikileaks published what appeared to be excerpts of her paid speeches to corporations, the transcripts of which the campaign has refused to release.The excerpts were likely to provide Trump some fodder for attacking Clinton in the debate. In them, she voices support for open trade and borders and discusses taking different positions in public and in private.However, Yepsen said the excerpts would likely be eclipsed by Trump's clip. ""The two things aren't comparable,"" he said.The U.S. government formally accused Russia on Friday of hacking Democratic Party organizations ahead of the presidential election.Wikileaks has declined to name its sources.A spokesman for the Clinton campaign declined to confirm whether the Wikileaks emails were authentic and noted that other hacked documents have been faked.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett denied on Monday an allegation by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he, like Trump, had taken ""a massive deduction"" that allowed him to avoid federal income taxes.Buffett said he paid about $1.85 million in income tax in 2015, and that returns for previous years were similar in respect to contributions, deductions and tax rates.Buffett said he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, but had ""no problem"" releasing his tax information.Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing ongoing audits by the IRS.""I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13,"" Buffett said in a statement, adding that ""being a slow starter, I owed only $7 in tax that year.""Buffett, ranked the world's third-richest person by Forbes magazine, said he had copies of all 72 of his returns ""and none uses a carryforward.""
Responding to an Oct. 1 New York Times story, Trump acknowledged during the presidential-candidates' debate on Sunday that he had used investment losses to avoid paying taxes.Trump repeatedly said he was only taking advantage of tax provisions used by wealthy people who support Clinton. ""I absolutely used it, and so did Warren Buffett ..."", he said.The Times reported that Trump's declared loss of $916 million in 1995 was so large that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years.
Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said his 2015 tax return showed adjusted gross income of $11,563,931.""My deductions totaled $5,477,694, of which allowable charitable contributions were $3,469,179. All but $36,037 of the remainder was for state income taxes,"" he said.
""The total charitable contributions I made during the year were $2,858,057,970, of which more than $2.85 billion were not taken as deductions and never will be. Tax law properly limits charitable deductions,"" Buffett said.Buffett said he had no problem releasing his tax information while under audit. ""Neither would Mr Trump - at least he would have no legal problem.""  (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr)"	['Forbes', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Warren']	[]
5	5	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKCN12A1VK	As of last week, Clinton's White House chances 95 percent: Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation	"


By Maurice Tamman
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Even before Sunday night's vicious presidential debate, Republican Donald Trump was losing ground in many of the states he needs to win to capture the presidency, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation Project analysis released on Monday.The project estimates that if the election had been held at the end of last week, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had at least a 95 percent chance of winning enough states to reach the minimum 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the next president, based on polling between Sept. 30 and Oct. 7._________________________STATES OF THE NATIONWhat would it take for Donald Trump to turn the map red?_________________________Those odds had steadily grown from about 60 percent on Sept. 15 to almost 90 percent on Sept 30. In the last four weeks, her estimated margin of victory has grown from about 14 votes to 118, according to the project.The polling did not capture reaction to Trump's performance in Sunday's debate or the release on Friday of his 11-year-old sexually aggressive comments about women.The results, however, mirrored other estimates of her chances of winning the campaign.
Statistical analysis outfit FiveThirtyEight, for example, put Clinton's chance of victory in the election at about 55 percent three weeks ago. Currently, they estimate the odds of a Clinton win at 82 percent. In the same period, the New York Times' estimates of the odds of a Clinton victory have also increased, from about 70 percent to 84 percent.Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Florida are now leaning toward the Democratic candidate, according to the Reuters/Ipsos project, an online survey of about 15,000 people every week. Arizona and Iowa are in the too-close-to-call category after being considered likely Trump states.More broadly, the state-by-state results show how Trump's support is sliding. In the last week, he has lost ground in at least 21 states, including in seven of the 18 states where he is leading, while improving his position in 19 states.Meanwhile, Clinton lost ground in 12 states, including in three of the 23 states where she is leading, and improved her standing in 30 sates.Based on these results, Trump's best hope for a victory would require a precipitous drop in the number of Democratic voters going to the polls on Nov. 8 from expected levels, combined with a similarly large increase in Republican turnout.
 LOCKER-ROOM TALK
Trump's crude comments about groping women and aggressively pursuing a married woman, captured on an open microphone, have sent his campaign into turmoil. The recording, first reported by The Washington Post, was made in 2005, in advance of a cameo appearance on a soap opera.Over the weekend, numerous Republican elected officials and candidates responded by calling for Trump to step aside.
Trump responded to his waning support among some Republicans by calling them hypocrites. During Sunday's debate he apologized but said the comments were just ""locker-room talk.""He also attacked Bill Clinton's treatment of women and said Hillary Clinton should be in jail for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Trump said that, if elected, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her.A nearly yearlong FBI investigation into the emails concluded earlier this year that no charges should be filed, although FBI Director James Comey said Clinton had been careless in her handling of sensitive material. The sexually explicit comments controversy followed published reports suggesting the Republican Party leadership was having an internal debate about shifting resources away from the presidential race and into U.S. House and Senate races.The Republicans currently control both branches of Congress. Many experts think control of the Senate could shift to the Democrats, although few are predicting the Republicans will lose control of the U.S. House of Representatives.Even before the weekend, the Trump campaign had struggled through two weeks of negative news coverage that began with the campaign's first presidential debate on Sept. 26, which Reuters/Ipsos polling suggested Clinton had won.Shortly after the first debate, the New York businessman also attacked - in tweets that began in the early hours of the morning - a former Miss Universe whom Clinton had referred to during the debate as an example of Trump degrading women.Also during that period, a New York Times report detailed how Trump lost nearly $1 billion in 1995, a loss that could be used to avoid paying federal taxes for up to 18 years, depending on his annual income.Clinton has had her share of woes as well, including the release of hacked emails last week of comments she appeared to have made to banks and big business. In the 2014 comments, she pushes for open trade and open borders, and takes a conciliatory approach to Wall Street, both positions she later backed away from."	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By James Oliphant
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump may have done just enough in Sunday's presidential debate to keep his leaky presidential campaign afloat - and that may have put Republicans considering abandoning him in an even tougher position.Had Trump imploded, the flow of lawmakers and party luminaries who deserted him at the weekend over lewd comments he made about women on a videotape likely would have become a torrent, increasing demands for him to drop out of the race.But that didn't happen. Now, Republicans who have seen their party torn apart by Trump's candidacy are once again faced with a familiar dilemma: Publicly abandon a badly wounded candidate who is endangering closely contested congressional races or stand behind him in the dimming hope that he can still win them the White House.The Manhattan real-estate mogul delivered a feistier and more disciplined performance than at the first debate, hammering his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton on her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and again raising decades-old accusations of sexual misconduct against her husband Bill Clinton.

That likely endeared him to the rowdy supporters who have packed arenas across the country for more than a year while perhaps doing little to reel in the more moderate voters in swing states that his campaign will need to defeat Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.""His no-holds barred approach to Hillary tonight is what conservatives have wanted to see out of a candidate since Bill Clinton was in office,"" said Craig Robinson, former political director of the Iowa Republican Party. ""The Republican base and talk radio will love this performance.""But the party is still hitched to a deeply flawed candidate who has especially struggled with women, college-educated, and suburban voters. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed close to 20 percent of Americans were still undecided on which candidate to support. Sixty percent of those were women.A poll taken by CNN immediately following the debate showed Republicans have reason to be anxious. Viewers said Clinton had beaten Trump in the encounter, 57 percent to 34 percent.
The furor over the 2005 videotape, in which Trump bragged about groping and trying to seduce women, led dozens of lawmakers to denounce him, including Arizona Senator John McCain. Their condemnation plunged the party into its worst crisis since the resignation of President Richard Nixon, a Republican, in 1974.The House Republican Conference, a body comprised of the almost 250 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, was set to meet on Monday to discuss the foundering Trump campaign, a House leadership aide said. House Speaker Paul Ryan pointedly disinvited Trump for a joint appearance in Wisconsin that had been scheduled for Saturday following publication of the tape.All but six of the 40 Republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive in the election have condemned Trump's comments in the video, although only three members of that group have called for him to drop out. 
RED MEAT FOR THE BASE
Since the release of the video, the party's governing body, the Republican National Committee, has offered no guidance to local party officials on how to handle questions about it.""There hasn't been one email or one phone call or anything as to what the guidance is from the RNC going forward,"" said an RNC official who asked to remain unidentified.The tape intensified talk in Republican circles about diverting funds from Trump to prop up House and Senate candidates who might find themselves in newfound jeopardy because of the backlash.
""It's well past time to cut all ties with Trump and focus on preserving the Republican Congress and down ballot offices. Immediately,"" said John Weaver, a veteran Republican strategist.Republican officials have another worry: that Trump's unpopularity may lead many Republican voters to stay at home on Election Day.Against this backdrop of panic and condemnation, Trump on Sunday sought to rally the party's base with a fresh barrage of provocative attacks on Clinton that will give the media something other than the tape to talk about.He offered a blistering critique of her handling of foreign policy while the country's chief diplomat and brought his rally cry for her to be jailed to the debate stage. He also carried out a threat to make an issue of her husband's sexual history.In doing so, Trump may have stopped the bleeding, but he did nothing to stop the worrying.

By Steve Holland

ST. LOUIS Republican Donald Trump publicly broke with his running mate, Mike Pence, on how to deal with the civil war in Syria in comments during Sunday's U.S. presidential debate that exposed further tensions within their campaign.""He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree,"" Trump said in response to a question from a moderator about comments by Pence that the United States should be ready to use force against Syrian military targets under the command of President Bashar al-Assad.""I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS,"" the Republican presidential nominee said in his debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, referring to Islamic State, the insurgent group fighting Assad's forces.Pence in his debate last week with Clinton's vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, appeared to break ranks with Trump, when he denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin for his interference in Syria's civil war and support for Assad.""The small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States,"" Pence said. 
Russian warplanes have been striking Islamic State positions in Syria in support of Assad's government.Clinton has criticized Trump, who has praised Putin, as being too cozy with the Russian leader.After the debate on Sunday, Pence tweeted: Congrats to my running mate @realDonaldTrump on a big debate win!"" adding he was ""proud to stand with you.""
Trump's campaign is in crisis just a month before the Nov. 8 election after a flood of Republicans withdrew their support for the brash New York businessman and former reality TV star over a newly uncovered 2005 videotape in which he made sexually aggressive comments about women.In an unusual move, Pence issued a statement on Saturday critical of Trump's words on the tape, saying on Twitter that he ""cannot defend them.""
""As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump,"" the Indiana governor said.Before the debate on Sunday, however, a source close to Pence dismissed talk among some political analysts that he might bolt the ticket in the uproar over Trump's comments.""Absolutely not,"" the source told Reuters.

By Caroline Valetkevitch and Rodrigo Campos
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Wall Street stock index futures were little changed throughout Sunday's highly contentious presidential debate, indicating that markets continue to view that Democrat Hillary Clinton holds an edge in the Nov. 8 election against her Republican rival, Donald Trump.The 90-minute debate got off to a chilly start when Clinton and Trump greeted each other without the traditional handshake. It quickly turned into an acrimonious discussion of a 2005 video that emerged on Friday in which Trump was heard using vulgar language and talking about groping women without consent. Investors said there was not enough in terms of policy substance in Sunday's debate to change the market's perception of the direction of the race.""I don't think it changed people's opinions in the investing community that Clinton is more likely to win, as she was before the debate, certainly after Friday,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.In a video released on Friday, Trump is heard talking on an open microphone in 2005 about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. ""There is still time to go and more things that could happen, but financial advisors are probably starting to feel they need to think about a Clinton win in terms of an investment thesis for 2017,"" Meckler said.
He said such a thesis would likely include government intervention in healthcare, particularly medicine prices, and little support for coal as an energy source.S&P e-mini futures remained in a tight range throughout the debate, slightly higher than at the close on Friday.""The market declared tonight's debate a draw and has no more clue after debate than before, at least not in watching the S&P futures. Once again the debate was great theater, but did not give the market any insight,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
""Despite the night's civil ending, it was hard to glean much information, as a good part of the debate was simply a name-calling fest.""Strategists in a recent Reuters equity poll mostly viewed an election victory on Nov. 8 by Clinton as more positive for the stock market through the end of the year, largely because her positions -unlike her opponent's- are well known.          Steven Englander, global head of G10 currency strategy at CitiFX in New York, said: ""Both Trump and Clinton supporters expected that emerging market currencies and U.S. equities would go down and the VIX .VIX would go up if Trump were to win and vice versa if Clinton wins,"" he added.Trump has been critical of a U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada as well as other trade deals, and has promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it.
The Mexican peso rose as much as 2 percent on Sunday and was last trading up 1.3 percent versus the greenback. S&P 500 e-minis ESc1, which were up 6 points shortly after opening three hours before the debate began, were up 5.25 points, or 0.24 percent.""It's a positive reaction (in stocks), and it's very consistent with what the market has been discounting, which is that Clinton will win and that's good news,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York, before the debate.""It's also saying the House of Representatives will stay in the hands of the Republicans,"" he added.U.S. stocks briefly gained ground following a perceived win by Clinton in the first presidential debate last month.
