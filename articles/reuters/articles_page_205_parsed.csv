By Chris Kahn

Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 11 points in the U.S. presidential race, showing little change after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.  The online poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, shows 46 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 34.8 percent back Trump. Another 19.2 percent support neither candidate. Their parties hold conventions in July ahead of a Nov. 8 election.Clinton's lead was nearly the same a week ago, before she had amassed enough convention delegates to win the nomination and before Trump drew criticism from leaders of both parties for questioning the impartiality of a Mexican-American judge.Trump, 69, enjoyed a bigger boost after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in May. Having trailed Clinton, 68, for most of the year, Trump briefly erased a double-digit gap and pulled about even with the former secretary of state.
Clinton this week defeated party rival Bernie Sanders, 74, in four of six nominating contests, most notably California and New Jersey, and won the endorsements of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other party leaders.Trump this week sparred with party leaders and struggled with questions about his now-defunct Trump University. A lawsuit accuses Trump and the for-profit school of defrauding thousands of people, including many who paid as much as $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate strategies. 
A wealthy businessman who asserts the lawsuit is politically motivated, Trump said presiding U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was biased against him because of Trump's plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Trump later added that Muslim judges could be biased against him also because of his pledge to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.Trump's comments drew sharp criticism from Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump later said he would no longer talk about the judge.
Friday's results had 1,276 respondents and a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.2 percentage points.(Reuters/Ipsos polling results: polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/LIKELY:1/type/smallest/dates/20160401-20160610/collapsed/true/spotlight/1) (Reporting by Chris Kahn; Editing by Howard Goller)"	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'McConnell', 'Warren']	[]

By Daniel Wiessner

A U.S. appeals court on Friday dismissed a bid by construction trade groups to block controversial Obama administration rules designed to speed up union elections, saying the National Labor Relations Board had broad authority to implement them.The Texas-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected claims by Associated Builders and Contractors Inc and a Texas chapter that the so-called ""quickie"" election rules violated employers' free speech rights and would lead to union harassment of workers. ""The board ... conducted an exhaustive and lengthy review of the issues, evidence and testimony, responded to contrary arguments, and offered factual and legal support for its final conclusions,"" Circuit Judge Edith Brown Clement wrote. The 5th Circuit is considered to be one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country and is a popular venue for legal challenges to Obama administration initiatives.The decision affirmed a 2015 ruling by a federal judge in Austin, Texas. The state's chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business was also a plaintiff but was not involved in the appeal. 
The rules, which took effect in April 2015, have shortened the period between a union filing a petition to represent workers and an election, from the previous median of 38 days to as little as two weeks. Under the rules, employers cannot bring legal challenges to the way union campaigns are conducted until after an election and are required to share workers' names and contact details with unions once they file election petitions.The NLRB said the changes were necessary because a small number of companies were intentionally dragging out the election process, sometimes for months, to coerce workers to vote against unions. 
Associated Builders and Contractors in its lawsuit said there was no evidence that was common, but the 5th Circuit on Friday said it was not the court's role ""to weigh the evidence pro and con.""NLRB spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek declined to comment. ABC did not immediately return a request for comment.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business-backed groups last year made similar claims in a separate lawsuit challenging the new rules in federal court in Washington, D.C. A judge dismissed the case, and the groups did not appeal. President Barack Obama in March 2015 vetoed a measure from Republicans in Congress that would have stopped the rules from taking effect.The case is Associated Builders and Contractors Inc v. National Labor Relations Board, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 15-50497. (Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Cynthia Osterman)"	['Obama']	[]

By Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's promise to gut U.S. environmental regulations and revive the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline if elected president is a nightmare for green groups, but it may be a dream come true for their fund-raisers.The country's biggest environmental groups say the Republican White House hopeful's pro-drilling and anti-global warming positions have sparked a record wave of donations and volunteer recruitment that could revitalize U.S. green advocacy.Trump has said he would revive the coal industry, pull the United States out of a global climate pact and expand oil drilling. ""We couldn't have asked for a more powerful motivator than Donald Trump,"" Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said.Brune said a spring email blast about the New York businessman to the San Francisco-based group's members yielded $25,000 in donations, more than twice as much as projected, along with 15,000 new volunteers.The club's Political Committee, which works directly on projects to engage voters during the election, has raised more than $62,000 this year, compared with just $22,000 at this point in the 2012 election, according to the filings with the Federal Election Commission.    
The Washington-based League of Conservation Voters has also gotten a boost. Officials said its annual fund-raising dinner this week pulled in a record haul, which they would not disclose, after the group also used Trump as a focal point of its donor outreach.""It's been a long time since there has been someone that our movement has so universally wanted to stop,"" said spokesman David Willett. The league's Voters Action Fund, meanwhile, has raised more than $610,000 in donations so far this year for election-related work, more than triple what it pulled in during the same period of 2012, and more than double that of 2008, according to federal filings.
Trump has long signaled his belief that global warming is a hoax. Last month he outlined plans to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by the Obama administration, scrap the Paris Climate Accord, and revive the Keystone XL - moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement.A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.NextGen Climate, a San Francisco-based environmental advocacy organization founded by billionaire activist Tom Steyer, has called Trump's agenda ""frightening."" But its efforts were also getting some traction from the candidate's rhetoric. 
The group, which has featured Trump in its TV ads to drive voter turnout, said it had seen a 127 percent increase in clicks on its social media postings that mention the candidate compared with those that do not.""There is no question that voters are very engaged when it comes to fighting back against Trump,"" said NextGen spokeswoman Suzanne Henkels.Ben Avery, associate fund-raising director of the Sierra Club's Northwest chapter, said he was happy about the increase in donor support this year but was vexed by the reason behind it.""Bad news is good news for fund-raising,"" he said.

By Nick Carey and Emily Stephenson

As the White House race took off last summer, food giant Mondelez International found itself in an unusual position: Republican candidate Donald Trump began delivering broadsides against one of its iconic products, Oreo cookies.""Nabisco is closing a factory in Chicago, and they're moving to Mexico. No more Oreos. I don't like Oreos anymore,"" Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire on Aug. 14, reacting to reports that Mondelez was shutting down some production lines at its Nabisco subsidiary in Chicago while boosting output in Mexico.Trump's statement that Mondelez was closing a Chicago factory was erroneous, as the company quickly pointed out, but that didn't stop him from repeating it.It's unusual for a top presidential candidate, especially a representative of the business-friendly Republican Party, to attack major U.S. corporations by name. But over the course of his unconventional campaign, Trump has aimed his fire at a range of companies, mostly for shifting jobs abroad (Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Corp unit Carrier Corp) but also for building products in foreign markets (Apple) and for what he said were violations of antitrust laws (Amazon). Trump has threatened the companies with boycotts, tariffs, taxes and other punishments. The Trump campaign declined to comment for this story. Some of the companies saw their share prices dip in the wake of Trump's criticism while others experienced a small boost.But all of them were presented with a dilemma that's familiar to the presumptive nominee's many vanquished Republican rivals: Should they engage with a possible future president known for holding a grudge, possibly inviting more wrath, or should they lie low and risk allowing Trump to define them and to push policies they deem harmful?Most have sought to stay out of the fray even as Trump has kept up the drumbeat of criticism.""I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States Many companies - like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier - are moving production to Mexico,"" Trump said this week. This was ""bad for all Americans,"" he said.   It was the first time Trump included GM in his roster of corporate wrongdoers, though the Trump campaign later removed GM from the statement and declined to say why. GM declined comment.     
MONDELEZ TREADS CAREFULLY
Mondelez, previously known as Kraft Foods, took a different tack.After Trump vowed to boycott Oreos, Mondelez fielded numerous media inquiries and contacted reporters when the company deemed press coverage of his remarks off base, said Laurie Guzzinati, who oversees governmental affairs in North America for Mondelez.The company didn't engage in any Trump-bashing, though Guzzinati said Trump's comments were ""grounded in inaccuracies."" She said she told reporters that Mondelez would continue to make Oreos in three locations in the United States, countering the impression Trump may have left that Oreos would no longer be made in the United States.
Mondelez's response tracks closely what crisis management experts recommend for Trump-targeted companies.  Hilary Rosen, a managing director for Washington, D.C., communications firm SKD Knickerbocker, said her firm was representing corporate clients who have been singled out by Trump, though she declined to name them. Rosen's advice to clients, she said, is ""don't depend on educating Donald Trump on the truth. People have tried and failed.""Rosen, a Democrat, recommends instead that companies make their case to the journalists who cover Trump, so ""Donald Trump does not define you.""None of the companies targeted by Trump acknowledged hiring outside consultants to deal with his criticism. Many declined to comment for this story. 
AVOIDING THE MUD         
""You're not going to win in a one-on-one confrontation with Donald Trump. You're just going to get mired in the mud,"" said Juda Engelmayer, senior vice president for crisis management at 5W Public Relations in New York. Those who have been willing to engage, including Ford Chairman Bill Ford, have avoided getting too personal.Trump has railed against Ford for manufacturing vehicles in Mexico, threatening a tariff of up to 40 percent on ""every car, bumper and part"" entering the United States from Mexico. Ford, the great-grandson of the automaker's founder Henry Ford, called Trump's critique ""distorted"" and said the company instead should be ""held up as a real success story."" ""We didn't take the (government) bailout,"" during the 2007-2009 recession, Ford told reporters at a conference in Detroit on May 23, contrasting his company with GM and Chrysler. ""We paid back our debts. We pulled ourselves up by our boot straps. We are investing in America."" Crisis management experts said companies targeted by Trump need to be thinking more about the policy implications of his presidency. That means, for example, shoring up support in the U.S. Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has said he wants to renegotiate.   A trade lobbyist who asked not to be named because he has worked with one of the companies Trump has called out said Trump's attacks do not particularly hurt companies' reputations in Washington, because policymakers understand presidential campaigns are the ""political silly season.""But, he said, they can impact broader efforts on trade and other policies. ""I think what this suggests,"" he said, ""is that there needs to be a concentrated effort by the business community to talk about the benefits of trade.""

By Phil Stewart
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama has approved giving the U.S. military greater ability to accompany and enable Afghan forces battling a resilient Taliban insurgency, in a move to assist them more proactively on the battlefield, a U.S. official told Reuters. The senior U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the decision would also allow greater use of U.S. air power, particularly close air support.However, the official cautioned: ""This is not a blanket order to target the Taliban.""Obama's decision again redefines America's support role in  Afghanistan's grinding conflict, more than a year after international forces wrapped up their combat mission and shifted the burden to Afghan troops.It also comes ahead of Obama's eagerly anticipated decision on whether to forge ahead with a scheduled reduction in the numbers of U.S. troops from about 9,800 currently to 5,500 by the start of 2017.A group of retired generals and senior diplomats urged Obama last week to forgo those plans, warning they could undermine the fight against the Afghan Taliban, whose leader was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan last month.Under the new policy, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, will be able to decide when it is appropriate for American troops to accompany conventional Afghan forces into the field - something they have so far only been doing with Afghan special forces, the official said.The expanded powers are only meant to be employed ""in those select instances in which their engagement can enable strategic effects on the battlefield,"" the official said.
That means that U.S. forces should not be expected to accompany Afghan soldiers on day-to-day missions.""This added flexibility ... is fully supported by the Afghan government and will help the Afghans at an important moment for the country,"" the official said.AIDING AFGHAN OFFENSIVE

The decision is a departure from current U.S. rules of engagement in Afghanistan, which impose limits on U.S. forces' ability to strike at insurgents.For example, the U.S. military was previously allowed to take action against the Taliban ""in extremis"" - moments when their assistance was needed to prevent a significant Afghan military setback.That definition, however, left the U.S. military postured to assist them in more defensive instances. The new policy would allow U.S. forces to accompany Afghans at key moments in their  offensive campaign against the Taliban.""The U.S. forces will more proactively support Afghan conventional forces,"" the official said.
The Taliban control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since they were ousted by a U.S.-backed intervention in late 2001, and U.S. officials have acknowledged the uneven performance of Afghan security forces.Large portions of Afghanistan, including the provincial capital of northern Kunduz and multiple districts of southern Helmand province, have fallen, at times briefly, to the Taliban over the past year-and-a-half. Many other districts and provinces are also under varying degrees of Taliban control.The new authorities that Obama has given the U.S. military could give it greater leeway in addressing the shortcomings of Afghan security forces.Still, experts warn that its hard to predict when Afghanistan will be able to stand on its own against the Taliban, not to mention the country's enormous economic difficulties and fractious political system.The U.S government's top watchdog on Afghanistan told Reuters that the United States had wasted billions of dollars in reconstruction aid to Afghanistan over the past decade, and now a renewed Taliban insurgency was threatening the gains that had been made.

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren will keep up her assault on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday in a strongly worded speech labeling Trump a racist and accusing the Republican Party of fostering his intolerance.""Donald Trump chose racism as his weapon, but his aim is exactly the same as the rest of the Republicans,"" Warren will say in remarks to be delivered at a Washington meeting of the American Constitution Society, a liberal group.Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, is a favorite among liberals as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton, who this week became the presumptive Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election.Trump has drawn strong criticism, including from some Republican leaders, for his attacks on Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against his now defunct real estate training school.
The Republican candidate has accused Curiel, an American  born in Indiana, of having an inherent bias against him because of his heritage and Trump's campaign pledges on curbing illegal immigration, such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.""Judge Curiel is one of countless American patriots who has spent decades quietly serving his country, sometimes at great risk to his own life,"" Warren will say. ""Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself.""    
Thursday's remarks will be just the latest in a war of words between Trump and Warren.Trump has dubbed Warren ""goofy,"" and often taunts her on the campaign trail, while Warren has branded Trump a ""loser"" and last month tweeted that his ""record is embarrassing.""
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Warren will soon endorse Clinton, after months of remaining neutral in the Democratic primary battle between Clinton and her challenger from the left, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Warren has considered the idea of serving as Clinton's running mate although she sees obstacles to that choice, sources said.

MEXICO CITY Mexico has increased dialogue with American companies to make the case for bilateral economic ties, a senior official said on Thursday, in an effort to counter anti-Mexican rhetoric in the U.S. presidential campaign.Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said Mexico is ""killing"" U.S. trade, threatening to build a border wall to keep out migrants, block remittances sent home by Mexicans, and raise tariffs against Mexico to protect U.S. jobs.While generally at pains to avoid addressing Trump directly, Mexican government officials have warned that his proposals could do serious damage to both nations' economies.Paulo Carreno, Mexico's new deputy foreign minister responsible for North America, was appointed in April to lead a drive to bolster his country's standing in the United States.Since then, Mexico's diplomatic network in the United States has stepped up efforts to reach out to business leaders, as well as politicians and academics, Carreno said, keen to stress that his government took no side in the presidential contest.
Of the companies Mexico had met, the majority agreed with a model of bilateral economic cooperation based on free trade that did not involve a border wall, or protective tariffs, he said.""They understand the benefit of greater commercial integration, and they live from it in a way,"" said Carreno. ""They agree that the model we have today is the better one, though of course that's not to say it can't be improved.""
U.S.-Mexico trade is worth some $500 billion every year and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says roughly 6 million American jobs depend on it. In addition, an estimated 35 million people in the United States are Mexican or of Mexican background.Mexican business leaders say U.S. companies are crucial allies in their battle to counter Trump's arguments.
Carreno did not detail which companies Mexico was meeting, though senior officials have said previously that those with major operations south of the border are key interlocutors.They include firms like General Electric as well as carmakers General Motors and Ford. Both carmakers have been attacked by Trump in the campaign for investing in Mexico.   (Reporting by Dave Graham and Ana Isabel Martinez; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"	['Trump']	[]

By Amanda Becker and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clinton's White House bid on Thursday and called for Democrats to unite behind her after a protracted battle with Bernie Sanders for the party nomination.U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also backed Clinton on Thursday, telling MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was ""a genuine threat to the country.""Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said it ""means the world"" to her that Obama had her back in a bruising campaign for the Nov. 8 election. Clinton also said she had the ""highest regard"" for Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, and was ""really pleased to have her good ideas and support.""Vice President Joe Biden also waded into the campaign on Thursday. ""Whoever the next president is, and God willing in my view it will be Secretary Clinton,"" Biden said in a speech at the American Constitution Society in Washington.The Obama endorsement increases pressure on Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, to bow out of the race and lend his support to Clinton so that the party can focus on defeating Trump.""It is absolutely a joy and an honor that President Obama and I over the years have gone from fierce competitors to true friends,"" Clinton told Reuters in an interview.After an unexpectedly tough battle against Sanders' challenge from the left, former first lady Clinton made history when she reached the number of delegates needed to win the party nomination this week. That made her the first woman to lead a major U.S. party as its White House candidate.Obama, who enjoys rising approval ratings as he nears the end of eight years in office, will appear with Clinton on the campaign trail next week in Wisconsin.The two were opponents in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary race, which Obama won, but they buried their rivalry and she served as his secretary of state for four years. Clinton is the 2016 candidate who the White House believes will best safeguard Obama's legacy.""I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,"" Obama said of Clinton in a video. ""I'm with her. I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there and campaign for Hillary."" Trump assailed the endorsement on Twitter: ""He wants four more years of Obama--but nobody else does!"" 
Clinton's campaign tweeted a brash response: ""Delete your account.""Sanders, who galvanized young voters with his calls for more social equality and measures to rein in Wall Street, has been reluctant to concede the race, despite concerns among leading Democrats that continuing party divisions could hamper Clinton's efforts to beat Trump.TOWARD THE EXIT 
Obama and other senior Democrats are seeking a delicate balance of rallying the party behind Clinton, while not alienating Sanders and his supporters.In what appeared to be an attempt to gently ease Sanders toward giving up his campaign, Obama met the democratic socialist for about an hour in the White House, laughing warmly as they walked into the Oval Office.
Although Sanders told reporters afterward that he still planned to compete in the final nominating contest in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday, he said he would work with Clinton to defeat Trump. Sanders was then welcomed on Capitol Hill by Senator Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate. Reid said the lawmaker from Vermont was in a ""good place"" with his Democratic colleagues. He suggested that Sanders was close to acknowledging defeat by Clinton.""I didn't hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she is the nominee, I think he's accepted that,"" Reid told reporters.In the endorsement video, Obama recalled the party unity that followed his prolonged primary battle against Clinton in 2008.""Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders may have been rivals during this primary, but they're both patriots who love this country and they share a vision for an America that we all believe in,"" Obama said.Warren told MSNBC she was endorsing Clinton because ""a female fighter in the lead is exactly what this country needs.""
Warren's populist credentials will boost Clinton's ability to court Sanders voters as she prepares to battle Trump. Warren was the only female Democratic U.S. senator who did not endorse Clinton during the primary race.Clinton told Reuters she and Warren had similar views about issues such as economic policy and protecting the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Warren pushed to start. Trump said in an interview with Reuters last month that he would try to dismantle the Dodd-Frank law.In the interview with Reuters, Clinton said her overall economic package, including plans to rein in Wall Street and cut taxes for the middle class, would come during the first 100 days of her presidency if she defeats Trump.Clinton previously said a plan to generate jobs by investing in transportation and other infrastructure spending and immigration reform would be among other early priorities.""One of the things that President Obama said yesterday is he thought his job was to remind the American people what a really serious job this is, the tough choices, the hard decisions, the high stakes in choosing a president and commander in chief,"" Clinton said.""And I know how important it is to get off to a really good start in the White House,"" she said.    Trump, a wealthy real estate developer who became the party's presumptive nominee last month after seeing off a large group of rivals, is well behind Clinton's campaign in terms of fundraising and policy infrastructure.On Thursday, his top donors were holding their first official meeting in New York. Trump also met with industry leaders in New York at an event organized by oil billionaire Harold Hamm.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Following months of internal wrangling, the U.S. House of Representatives, on Thursday passed legislation creating a federal control board to help Puerto Rico cope with crippling debt that is wreaking havoc throughout the island's economy.By a vote of 297-127, the House approved the bill, sending it to the Senate for consideration.Some leading Democratic senators have voiced concerns about provisions, including one that potentially could reduce the minimum wage for young Puerto Ricans.But given the overwhelming support in the House and a looming July 1 deadline for Puerto Rico to make a $1.9 billion debt payment, senators may be hesitant to delay or tinker very much with the bill.Following the House vote, the White House in a statement urged the Senate to act promptly ""so the president can sign the bill into law ahead of the critical July 1st debt payment deadline.""The legislation was bolstered by rare bipartisan cooperation between the White House and the House's Republicans and Democrats over the past six months.House Speaker Paul Ryan urged Congress to act quickly on the ""Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act"" (PROMESA), warning lawmakers of a ""deepening crisis"" on the island.
""Now the island is shutting down,"" Ryan said, with ""closed schools; hospitals are beginning to close, that's today. Tomorrow there could be policemen without cars, there could be blackouts at hospitals.""Nevertheless, some lawmakers feared that allowing Puerto Rico to restructure its $70 billion debt in a way that changes the seniority of the creditors - for instance by making them all equal or subordinated to pensioners - would set a bad precedent for other U.S. states with debt problems.Puerto Rico does not enjoy Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, unlike the 50 U.S. states.The territory, which has a 45 percent poverty rate amid high unemployment, is also plagued by a growing migration of residents to the U.S. mainland.
Puerto Rico's debt problems come as its government and healthcare industry struggle to contain the spread of the Zika virus, which is blamed for severe birth defects and other neurological diseases. On Tuesday, Aeromed, the island's only active air ambulance company, announced it was suspending its services, blaming the large government debt.    The oversight board would be tasked with working with investors on restructuring the U.S. territory's $70 billion debt.Before passage, the House approved an amendment giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets.
Representative Raul Grijalva, like many Democrats, criticized major elements of the bill but argued it was the best possible in the Republican-controlled Congress.""The oversight board is too powerful and is yet another infringement on the sovereignty of the people of Puerto Rico and they are right to find it offensive,"" Grijalva said.  Despite its support for the overall bill, the White House noted that minimum wage and other labor provisions ""further exacerbate the economic disparities between Puerto Rico and the mainland United States"" and ""do nothing to address the (debt) crisis.""Supporters praised PROMESA for not using taxpayer funds to help the island reschedule its debt. Failure to pass it, they warned, could put Congress in the difficult position of ultimately overseeing a massive bailout of Puerto Rico.But lawmakers have been buffeted by an opposition lobbying campaign by some hedge funds, which fear losing part of their investments from oversight board decisions.
