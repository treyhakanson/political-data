By Amy Tennery
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK One would expect voters from the heavily Democratic Brooklyn neighborhood of Cobble Hill to pick presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 general election. Just don't expect them to advertise it.Like lawns and windowsills in liberal pockets across the country, much of the neighborhood is bereft of pro-Clinton signage in the final weeks before the election. It's a stark contrast to the 2012 and 2008 campaigns, when President Barack Obama whipped up a frenzy of support from Democrats and his signature ""Hope"" and ""Forward"" signs were ubiquitous. The scarcity of lawn and window signs is an indication of the Democratic nominee's struggle to generate enthusiasm among left-leaning voters, a challenge that's borne out in polling data, and could potentially haunt her if voters fail to turn out on election day.Clinton leads Republican challenger Donald Trump by four percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Friday. But Americans of all political stripes have been more critical of Clinton than they were of Obama when he was running for his second term four years ago, according to the daily tracking poll. Among Democrats, 78 percent say they have a favorable view of Clinton, lower than the 89 percent favorability rating Obama had at this point in the race in 2012. Clinton's favorability drops to 28 percent among independents versus Obama's 47 percent.Nancy Kimmel Viola, a 63-year-old social worker who lives about a mile away from Clinton's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, keeps a ""Bernie 2016"" sticker taped to the front door of her Carroll Gardens home, a vestige of her support for the unsuccessful bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders. While she plans to vote for Clinton, she confesses that her ""heart's not in it.""""I have to vote for her."" Viola said. ""Having Trump in there is too scary.""
In Denver, residents in the Democratic stronghold of Park Hill posted many yard signs over a local zoning issue, but few for the presidential race.""Most of us around here will vote Democratic, we always do, but we're not overly enthusiastic for Clinton,"" said resident Pablo Marron. ""But we are united in our opposition to Trump.""'HOLD YOUR NOSE' 
In the heavily Democratic Denver suburb of Northglenn, banners for local office-seekers littered a major roadway, but there were no accompanying Clinton signs. In the affluent liberal Washington DC suburb of Chevy Chase, Maryland, signs for the Democratic nominee appeared only roughly once every 10 blocks.
The lack of enthusiasm isn't just hitting the Clinton campaign. Americans from both major parties say they are generally less interested in voting this year than they were in 2012, according to the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, which compared results gathered during the first 20 days of September with the same period of 2012.The Clinton campaign did not respond to emailed requests for comment.Clinton's online store displayed roughly a dozen different signs and banners for sale, ranging from an 11-inch by 17-inch sign, sold at $10 for a pack of two, to a four-foot by six-foot ""Hillary for America"" banner, which retailed for $100.Sales data was not immediately available and a request for comment from the store went unanswered.
For some, there is a ""hold your nose quality"" to this election, said Matthew Dallek, associate professor at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.""The lack of signage"" in liberal enclaves may indicate, Dallek said, ""that there just isn't this sort of enthusiasm that existed for Obama.""But there are some blocks that buck the trend.On a street in Gowanus, Brooklyn, no fewer than four homes bore pro-Clinton signage, including a life-size cutout of the Democratic nominee, which rests in the windowsill of retired lawyer Chris Morrison's home. The beaming cardboard Clinton prompts many passersby to take pictures, said Morrison, a staunch Clinton supporter.""You don't see as much signage this time around. In this neighborhood I don't get so concerned (because everyone is) more or less on the same page,"" said Morrison, 66.""I worry when I go to some other places.""

By Lesley Wroughton
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK John Kerry had heard enough.After last week's bombing of a U.N. aid convoy in Syria dealt a death blow to a ceasefire deal in which he had invested all his diplomatic capital with Russia, the U.S. Secretary of State tossed aside a page of notes and looked at Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov across the horseshoe-shaped table in the U.N. Security Council.""I listened to my colleague from Russia, and I sort of felt a little bit like they're sort of in a parallel universe here,"" said a visibly angry Kerry, effectively calling Lavrov a liar for blaming the United States for spoiling the ceasefire.The moment in some ways captured the former politician's time as the top U.S. diplomat, which will end with a new administration in January.Not for the first time, Kerry had invested months of intensive diplomacy and tireless traveling on an issue only to end up feeling let down or deceived by negotiating partners. On Syria, Kerry has wanted greater U.S. involvement than President Barack Obama was willing to support.In an interview on Friday with Reuters, Kerry said Lavrov's ""blatant obfuscation of reality ... took my breath away.""The attempted Syria ceasefire was his most ambitious effort to fix what some argue was the biggest foreign policy misstep of Obama's administration, which began with the failure in 2013 to follow through on a ""red line"" threat against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over the use of chemical weapons.Kerry hammered out the truce two weeks ago, but was left pleading in vain with Russia last week to halt renewed air strikes on the besieged city of Aleppo. James Dobbins, a former U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, noted Kerry's ""tireless, ceaseless engagement"" even when pursuing administration policies he didn't always agree with.""Kerry to his credit has stayed in the game even when he had a weak hand,"" said Dobbins, a career diplomat who worked alongside Kerry in 2013 to hammer out a deal with President Hamid Karzai to keep U.S. forces in Afghanistan. ""The situation in Syria is too serious and too consequential to simply back off and leave it to others."" From Kerry's perspective, it is better to fail than not to have tried.
""The weakest hand of all would be to have another round of migrants going into Europe, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin do whatever he wants by dropping bombs and the United States doing nothing but pretending we're sending some support to people,"" Kerry told Reuters.""That is the weakest hand, and it is far stronger to stand up and find a way to leverage getting to the table and getting some kind of an understanding,"" he added.TAKING RISKS
In his nearly four years as America's top diplomat, Kerry has racked up more miles than any other secretary of state, sometimes appearing to rush in without a clear strategy.""It is clear that Kerry is prepared to take greater risks with his own personal reputation than others might have ... because they did not want to be identified with failure,"" said Dobbins.    But some critics say Kerry stayed in the game too long in negotiating with Russia, which they argue manipulated his quest for a deal over Syria to strengthen its position.
The Syrian conflict, with its shifting geopolitical forces, complex new alliances and new threats such as the rise of Islamic State, has tested Kerry like no other issue.After Obama declined to carry out threatened attacks on Assad's forces over chemical weapons, Kerry perceived an opening to work with Lavrov on an agreement to get Syria to turn over its chemical arsenal, he told Reuters.That deal struck in 2013 was considered a success, but the war has since deteriorated and grown more complex following Russia's military intervention backing Assad last year.Now the continuing ceasefire push by Kerry strikes some as hopeless gesturing.""Kerry's plan is to do more of the same despite the repeated failure of U.S. attempts to strike a deal with Russia,"" said Mutasem Alsyofi of the Syrian Civil Society Declaration Initiative, who met Kerry in New York last week.
OVERREACHING?
It's not the first time Kerry's been accused of overreaching. At the start of his term in 2013, Kerry vigorously pursued a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians. Even as others warned of failure, an undaunted Kerry spent months shuttling between Jerusalem and Ramallah.However, U.S. ally Israel's announcement of 700 new housing units for Jewish settlements in territory the Palestinians claim for a future state finally caused the talks to collapse, although Israel blamed the Palestinians move to apply to join 15 international conventions and treaties.Kerry's biggest accomplishments came in 2015 with the Iran nuclear deal and the U.N. climate change agreement. In both instances, he had Obama's leadership and full support for the very visible U.S. role, though both deals have been vilified domestically in the polarized American political environment.Last week's failure of a second Syrian ceasefire agreement brokered by Kerry unleashed a fresh round of stinging criticism of the administration's Syria policy.Republican Senator John McCain called Kerry ""intrepid but delusional"" for placing too much faith in the prospect of cooperation with Russia.Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who lost to George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, is not running for office again and has often remarked that he has nothing to lose.""In this business of diplomacy, you have to test things sometimes,"" he told Reuters. ""It is a mistake to delude yourself. It is also a mistake to avoid putting something to test where there is a reasonable chance something may be able to happen.""Hours after the tense exchange at the U.N. Security Council, Lavrov and Kerry met again. The Russian diplomat had brought a new proposal for putting the ceasefire back on track. Kerry looked at the sheet of paper, folded it tightly and stuffed it into his top pocket.

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A technician hired by Hillary Clinton to run the private email system she used while U.S. secretary of state told investigators he tried to pass on colleagues' concerns that the system might not comply with records laws, FBI interview summaries show. Bryan Pagliano, the technician Clinton hired when she joined the State Department in 2009, told federal investigators he relayed the concerns to Cheryl Mills, then Clinton's chief of staff.Mills, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, has previously testified under oath she could not recall anyone alerting her to potential problems with Clinton's email arrangement.The episode had not been disclosed until the Federal Bureau of Investigation released on Friday night nearly 200 pages of additional records from its year-long investigation into the handling of classified government documents by Clinton and her staff via an unauthorized email server in the basement of her New York home.Clinton has said the decision to use a private email system was a mistake, but the controversy has dogged her campaign as the Democratic candidate for the presidency and raised public doubts about her trustworthiness, public opinion polls show. Republicans have criticized her for putting national security at risk.The FBI closed the year-long investigation in July, recommending no charges, although FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her staff had been ""extremely careless"" in handling classified government secrets.
Pagliano has declined to answer questions by Republican lawmakers about his work on Clinton's server, but spoke to federal investigators after securing a form of immunity from prosecution.He told investigators two colleagues from the technology office approached him with concerns during Clinton's first year after learning about the email system. One said it could lead to a ""federal records retention issue,"" Pagliano told investigators, and urged him to raise the concern with Clinton's ""inner circle.""A colleague also warned Pagliano ""he wouldn't be surprised"" if classified information was being sent through Clinton's unsecure system, Pagliano told the FBI.The newly released interview summaries from the FBI investigation show government employees undercutting other aspects of the public accounts given by Clinton and senior State officials.
A State Department employee, whose name was redacted, told investigators they believed senior department officials interfered with the screening of Clinton's emails for public release last year in a way that helped Clinton. The employee, who worked on the screening process, said there was pressure to obscure the fact they were finding classified information in the messages. John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement the department ""strongly disputes"" the claim of interference. Clinton repeatedly said last year she never sent or received classified information, but now says she did not do so knowingly since the release of the FBI findings.The employee also said the Defense Department told the State Department last year it had found about 1,000 emails between Clinton and David Petraeus in its records from his time as the director of the United States Central Command.
The State Department has said that Clinton did not include any of her emails with Petraeus when her lawyers screened and returned what they said were all her work emails in 2014. A single conversation of about 10 emails later emerged last year after the Defense Department provided it.Spokesmen for Clinton have declined to discuss the omission, and did not respond to questions about the new interview summaries.Kirby, the department spokesman, said he could not ""speculate"" whether the Defense Department had found more than just a single conversation between Clinton and Petraeus. ""We can only speak to the records in our possession,"" he said. (Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by John Whitesides and Mary Milliken)"	['Allen', 'Clinton']	[]

By John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The New York Times endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for the White House on Saturday, saying she was more qualified than Republican presidential rival Donald Trump to handle the challenges facing the United States.The newspaper described Clinton as ""one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation"" and said she had displayed a command of policy and diplomatic nuance while building a reputation for grit and bipartisan cooperation.""A lifetime's commitment to solving problems in the real world qualifies Hillary Clinton for this job, and the country should put her to work,"" the Times said of the former secretary of state and U.S. senator from New York.Clinton will face off against Trump on Monday night in the first of three presidential debates, with opinion polls showing her once sizable lead over the New York businessman narrowing amid continued public doubts about her trustworthiness.The Times said Clinton's mistakes had distorted perceptions of her character, but praised her work restoring U.S. credibility in foreign affairs as secretary of state and on behalf of children, women and families throughout her career.
""Mrs. Clinton has shown herself to be a realist who believes America cannot simply withdraw behind oceans and walls, but must engage confidently in the world to protect its interests and be true to its values,"" the newspaper said.It said Clinton's decision to use a private email server for government work as secretary of state deserved the scrutiny it has received in the campaign, but considered alongside the real challenges facing the United States it ""looks like a matter for the help desk.""Viewed against those challenges, Trump ""shrinks to his true small-screen, reality-show proportions,"" the Times said, promising another editorial on Monday explaining ""why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history.""
The endorsement from the Times editorial board is no surprise. The last Republican the Times backed for the White House was President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. But several newspapers with more conservative editorial boards, including the Dallas Morning News and Cincinnati Enquirer, also have recently endorsed Clinton.The Times said Clinton's best argument for the White House was her ability to rise to the challenges facing the country.
""The 2016 campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middle-class Americans"" facing the burdens of recession, technological change, foreign competition and war, it said.""Over 40 years in public life, Hillary Clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems. Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena,"" the newspaper said.

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Ohio's practice of rescinding voter registrations from people who fail to cast ballots is illegal, a court ruled on Friday, the latest legal decision affecting voting rights ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati reversed an earlier ruling by a federal judge in June and could lead to the reinstatement of thousands of voters in the politically crucial swing state of Ohio.""We don't believe that any voters should be removed from the rolls simply because they haven't voted in a few elections,"" said Mike Brickner, senior policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought a lawsuit against the practice along with other advocates.Voting rights cases have become pivotal battlegrounds in the lead-up to the hotly contested presidential vote between Democratic party candidate Hillary Clinton and her Republican counterpart Donald Trump. The ACLU and others have challenged laws in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina over voting rights issues. On Friday Texas asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate a law requiring authorized identification to be presented before a citizen may vote.
At issue in the Ohio case is a policy of purging voters who  fail to cast ballots over a six-year period and do not respond to a letter from the state asking if they have moved.        A Reuters analysis showed that at least 144,000 voters had been removed from Ohio's rolls since the last presidential election.
In their lawsuit, the ACLU and other plaintiffs argued that the process violates federal voting rights law, which prohibits removing voters from the rolls simply because they have been inactive.In June, a federal judge disagreed, ruling that an exception in the law protected Ohio's practice. But the appellate court said on Friday that because the removal process was triggered solely by someone's failure to vote, it was not legal.The appeals court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge George C. Smith to consider possible remedies, including reinstating all voters removed under the process.
Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, said the state would appeal if Smith orders all of the purged voters to be reinstated, arguing that would open the state to potential fraud by people impersonating voters who have died or moved away.""This ruling overturns 20 years of Ohio law and practice, which has been carried out by the last four Secretaries of State, both Democrat and Republican,"" Husted said.

By Hilary Russ
| NEWARK, N.J.

NEWARK, N.J. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's office turned a regional transportation agency into a ""goodie bag"" from which to dole out favors and funds to Democrats who might endorse the Republican during his 2013 re-election campaign, according to prosecutors' star witness in the so-called Bridgegate trial on Friday.David Wildstein, a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who pleaded guilty and is testifying for the prosecution, described how requests from state officials went first to a top Christie aide for approval - for everything from patronage jobs at the agency to tours of the World Trade Center site, which the Port Authority owns.The aide, Christie's then-deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly, and William Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority, are on trial for wire fraud and civil rights deprivation.Kelly and Baroni are accused of arranging in September 2013 to close traffic lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge in order to cause gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as retribution after the municipality's Democratic mayor did not endorse Christie's successful re-election bid.The scandal helped torpedo Christie's bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
At the start of the trial, federal prosecutors claimed for the first time that Christie knew his two close associates were involved in the shutdown.Christie has denied any knowledge of the plot.Wildstein said the ""goodie bag"" scheme allowed Christie's office to take credit for items given by the Port Authority, a bi-state agency run jointly with New York.
""That was the system that was established. All use of Port Authority resources had to be approved by the governor's office,"" Wildstein, 55, testified. ""The governor's office was always to be the deliverer of good news.""In one case, Wildstein had the 100 flags flown over the World Trade Center site on the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11  attacks shipped to the governor's office after the ceremony to be distributed to local officials as it saw fit.The office considered whether officials were willing to endorse Christie when deciding how to hand out the flags, surplus equipment, and even local grant money, he said.
Baroni, whom Wildstein described as ""one of the closest friends I've ever had,"" hired Wildstein to be the ""bad cop"" in pushing Christie's agenda at the authority, Wildstein said.""If it was good for Christie then it was good for us,"" Wildstein said.Wildstein's testimony continues on Monday.

By Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The United States was relegated to the sidelines of the Syrian war on Friday as an all-out assault by Syrian government and Russian forces on opposition-held Aleppo threatened to unleash a new refugee wave and drive U.S.-backed rebels into the ranks of al Qaeda's Syrian branch, U.S. officials and experts said.Moscow's direct participation in the offensive left fading hope for U.S.-Russian peace efforts, raising the likelihood that U.S. President Barack Obama's successor will inherit a worsening conflict.Entering its sixth year, the Syrian civil war already has left some 250,000 people dead, uprooted more than 11 million and provided a base for Islamic State to launch and inspire attacks in the West.""For the next president on Day One, this becomes the problem from hell,"" said Frederic Hof, a former Obama adviser on Syria who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank. ""It's a problem that's going to persist in one way or another throughout the first term of the next president and probably beyond.""A U.S. official suggested White House plans to keep Syrian chaos under control as Obama leaves office have been upended.""It was hoped that they could turn over a simmering mess to the next president,"" said a U.S. official. ""But what happened was that the simmering mess blew up and now they are going to have to figure out what to do.""U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Russian aircraft, long-range artillery and special forces advisers were directly participating with Syrian government forces in the drive to conquer eastern Aleppo, the largest urban stronghold of the U.S.-backed moderate opposition.Shiite militiamen from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan also were involved in the assault on the devastated enclave, where an estimated 250,000 civilians were suffering the most intense airstrikes of the war, they said.""The Russians are actively participating in the current offensive in Aleppo,"" said one U.S. official. ""It appears to be a no-holds barred attempt to crush the opposition."" Russian aircraft were flying sorties at the same rate - about 40 per day - as they were before Washington and Moscow negotiated a failed ceasefire between the Syria government and opposition forces in February, the officials said.
Some U.S. intelligence officials believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is taking advantage of Obama's refusal to intervene militarily in Syria and his lame duck status to seize as much territory as possible before the new U.S. president takes office.These officials argue that Russia has not sincerely engaged in peace-making efforts and that Putin aims to weaken the opposition as rapidly as possible, a goal in which he is gradually succeeding.Damascus announced the offensive on Thursday as Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov failed to salvage a ceasefire that collapsed on Monday. The ceasefire was supposed to lead to U.S.-Russian cooperation on airstrikes against Islamic State and al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, formerly known as the Nusra Front.OBAMA'S OPTIONS

What course Obama will now take remained unclear.""There doesn't seem to be a Plan B right now,"" Hof said.Obama has sought to restrict U.S. involvement in Syria, repeatedly rejecting proposals by advisers for actions such as establishing a no-fly zone or arming the moderate opposition fighting to topple President Bashar Assad.""One of the things that haunts me the most was our failure to ask ourselves about the consequences of inaction,"" said one former senior official involved in Syria policy. ""We were always focused on the consequences of action ... But we should have also considered how doing nothing for several years might have an impact on U.S. credibility and the conflict more broadly.""Obama has limited the U.S. role to supporting groups fighting Islamic State in northeastern Syria. He has pursued  talks with Russia, which intervened on Assad's behalf in September 2015, on a peace accord between U.S.-backed moderate rebels and Damascus.
Obama, however, no longer can count on securing a ceasefire that will keep a lid on the crisis until his successor is sworn-in on Jan. 20, experts said.Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute think tank said he doubted that Obama would adopt a more robust policy.""Given the posture the Obama administration has developed with regards to how it faces the war in Syria, I don't see it shifting the strategy,"" he said. ""That would be the most extraordinary foreign policy shift in the last eight years.""Obama, however, faces the prospect of a deepening humanitarian disaster, officials and experts said.The fall of Aleppo could unleash a new wave of migrants fleeing toward Europe, which has been struggling since last year to accommodate more than 1 million refugees.Moreover, U.S.-backed rebels, dismayed over what they saw as Obama's abandonment of Aleppo, could begin joining al Qaeda's Syrian branch. It is widely regarded as the most effective opposition group and has vehemently rejected a negotiated settlement with Assad, U.S. officials and experts said.Lister, who maintains contacts with rebels inside Syria, said opposition leaders are growing disillusioned with U.S. efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution with Assad's main military backer.""Things are deteriorating so quickly now. The U.S. is losing leverage on the ground every week,"" he said.      (Additional reporting by Phil Stewart and David Rohde. Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"	['Stewart', 'Obama']	[]
