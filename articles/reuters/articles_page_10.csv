By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers passed bills on Tuesday renewing sanctions on Iran for 10 years and imposing new sanctions on Syria, underscoring their determination to play a strong role in Middle East policy no matter who occupies the White House.The House of Representatives voted 419 to one for a 10-year reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, a law first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran's energy industry and deter Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons.The House also passed by voice vote a bill that would sanction the government of Syria, and supporters including Russia and Iran, for war crimes and crimes against humanity.The Iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. It must still be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama in order to become law.The Obama administration and other world powers reached an agreement last year in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
But lawmakers said they wanted the ISA to stay in effect to send a strong message that the United States will respond to provocations by Iran and give any U.S. president the ability to quickly reinstate sanctions if Tehran violated the nuclear agreement.""Even after a hard-fought election here at home and power changing hands, American leadership on the global stage won't falter,"" said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a bill sponsor.Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the bill's lead sponsor, called the ISA ""a critical tool.""
""Its expiration would compound the damage done by the president's dangerous nuclear deal and send a message that the United States will no longer oppose the destructive role of Iran in the Middle East,"" said Royce.The vote took place one week after Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Congressional Republicans unanimously opposed the nuclear deal, along with about two dozen Democrats, and Trump has also strongly criticized it.Lawmakers from both parties said they hoped bipartisan support for a tough line against Iran would continue under the new president.
There was no immediate word from Senate leaders on when the ISA and the Syria measure might be taken up in that chamber.Many Senate Democrats favor a ""clean"" renewal of the ISA, like the one that passed in the House. But other lawmakers have pushed to add new sanctions such as some specifically targeting Iran's ballistic missile tests. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Tom Brown)"

By Emily Stephenson and Steve Holland
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump shuffled his transition team again on Tuesday, jettisoning a national security expert and lobbyists from his inner circle as he closed in on naming two loyal Wall Street backers to key economic positions.Trump, a Republican outsider who won a surprise election victory last week, also cleared a paperwork snag that had temporarily stalled his transition after he put his Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of the process.""Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,"" Trump said on Twitter after taking his family to dinner at 21 Club, a Manhattan restaurant, his motorcade slipping away from reporters gathered at his apartment building.""I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!"" Trump said.At the top of his list for senior economic positions are  campaign finance chair and Wall Street veteran Steve Mnuchin as treasury secretary, and long-time backer and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary, according to Trump ally and activist investor Carl Icahn.However, a well-known Republican moderate was pushed out of transition planning. Mike Rogers, a former U.S. representative from Michigan who had been mentioned as a possible pick for CIA director, suddenly left the transition team.Rogers had worked with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who on Friday was abruptly replaced by Pence as head of the transition team.That overhaul had put the brakes on transition talks with the White House. Pence needed to sign a memorandum of understanding, which the White House received on Tuesday evening.The Trump team still needs to provide more paperwork before detailed agency-by-agency briefings can take place, a White House spokeswoman said. The team will need to provide a code of conduct and certify that its transition team members do not have conflicts of interest.""HUGE IMPLICATIONS""
Additional changes are likely. Pence and Rick Dearborn, the executive director of the transition team, are ""removing any lobbyists,"" a transition aide said. ""This is to ensure President-elect Trump's commitment to ban lobbyist involvement is being upheld at all levels of the transition,"" the aide said.
Trump, who had pilloried opponents for being beholden to industry interests during his campaign, came under fire from his frequent sparring partner, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, for including lobbyists on his transition team.""Based on public reports, your transition team and your potential cabinet include over twenty Wall Street elites, industry insiders, and lobbyists making decisions that could have huge implications for their clients or employers,"" Warren wrote in a letter.Trump has fewer than 70 days until his Jan. 20 inauguration  to settle on Cabinet members and other senior appointees. He will eventually need to fill roughly 4,000 open positions.Wall Street is closely watching who Trump picks for treasury chief because Republicans have majorities in both chambers of Congress, giving Trump a clearer shot at tax and financial regulatory reforms.Mnuchin declined to comment to reporters at Trump Tower about Cabinet picks, but said the team was ""making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan.""A parade of advisers had been seen going in and out of Trump's building on Tuesday, including U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, touted as a possible secretary of defense or attorney general.U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, also dropped by for a meeting, telling reporters he was ""looking forward to fighting hard to actually accomplish and deliver the promises we made"" during the election.
Bloomberg later reported that Trump was considering nominating Cruz as attorney general.NATIONAL SECURITY HARDLINERS?
Rogers was pushed off the team in part because Trump's advisers believed he did not pursue Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton aggressively enough when he headed the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, a source familiar with the decision said.Rogers led an investigation into the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks by militants on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya. The probe dismissed many of the conspiracy theories that had been circulated by critics of Clinton, who was then secretary of state.Trump's team viewed the investigation as a whitewash, according to one source familiar with the operation.Some current U.S. intelligence officials worried that Rogers' departure would mean Trump was leaning toward more confrontational hardliners to lead his foreign policy team.
Two national security officials said Trump's operation had been slow to get up to speed and had not yet engaged deeply with security and intelligence agency personnel who were ready to start helping them.Loyalists such as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton were being considered for secretary of state, according to sources close to Trump.Giuliani, New York's mayor at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by Islamist al Qaeda militants, is known as a hardliner on national security matters. Bolton is also a foreign policy hawk who said last year the United States should bomb Iran to halt its nuclear program.Retired Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, a leading candidate for Trump's national security adviser, has called for the United States to pull back from protecting long-time allies such as South Korea and Japan.Trump has filled two positions so far. His choice of Republican Party insider Reince Priebus to be White House chief of staff was heralded by Republican leaders as an indication he wanted to work with Congress. Republicans maintained their majority in both the Senate and House in the election, but a number of Republicans in Congress opposed Trump's candidacy.However, Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon as chief strategist was criticized by Democrats, civil rights organizations and some Republicans.They denounced the former Breitbart News chief, whose website is a forum for the ""alt-right,"" a loose grouping of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Neither Priebus nor Bannon need Senate confirmation for their posts, but Cabinet posts do, and some of Trump's possible picks could face a difficult time winning approval. Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN he could not vote to confirm Bolton unless he repudiated his support for the Iraq war and bombing of Iran. Paul, who also ran for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, said he was concerned by Giuliani's work on behalf of foreign governments.One loyalist who will not be playing a role in Trump's Cabinet is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who advised Trump after dropping his own presidential bid earlier this year.""His life has not prepared him to be a Cabinet secretary,"" said Armstrong Williams, Carson's business manager.

By Mica Rosenberg and Julia Edwards Ainsley
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON An architect of anti-immigration efforts who says he is advising President-elect Donald Trump said the new administration could push ahead rapidly on construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall without seeking immediate congressional approval.Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped write tough immigration laws in Arizona and elsewhere, said in an interview that Trump's policy advisers had also discussed drafting a proposal for his consideration to reinstate a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries.Kobach, who media reports say is a key member of Trump's transition team, said he had participated in regular conference calls with about a dozen Trump immigration advisers for the past two to three months.Trump's transition team did not respond to requests for confirmation of Kobach's role. The president-elect has not committed to following any specific recommendations from advisory groups.Trump, who scored an upset victory last week over Democrat Hillary Clinton, made building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border a central issue of his campaign and has pledged to step up immigration enforcement against the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants. He has also said he supports ""extreme vetting"" of Muslims entering the United States as a national security measure.
Kobach told Reuters last Friday that the immigration group had discussed drafting executive orders for the president-elect's review ""so that Trump and the Department of Homeland Security hit the ground running.""To implement Trump's call for ""extreme vetting"" of some Muslim immigrants, Kobach said the immigration policy group could recommend the reinstatement of a national registry of immigrants and visitors who enter the United States on visas from countries where extremist organizations are active.
Kobach helped design the program, known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, while serving in Republican President George W. Bush's Department of Justice after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants.Under NSEERS, people from countries deemed ""higher risk"" were required to undergo interrogations and fingerprinting on entering the United States. Some non-citizen male U.S. residents over the age of 16 from countries with active militant threats were required to register in person at government offices and periodically check in.NSEERS was abandoned in 2011 after it was deemed redundant by the Department of Homeland Security and criticized by civil rights groups for unfairly targeting immigrants from Muslim- majority nations.Kobach said the immigration advisers were also looking at how the Homeland Security Department could move rapidly on border wall construction without approval from Congress by reappropriating existing funds in the current budget. He acknowledged ""that future fiscal years will require additional appropriations.""
Congress, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, could object to redirecting DHS funds designated for other purposes. HELPED DRAFT TOUGH ARIZONA LAW

Kobach has worked with allies across the United States on drafting laws and pursuing legal actions to crack down on illegal immigration.In 2010, he helped draft an Arizona law that required state and local officials to check the immigration status of individuals stopped by police. Parts of the law, which was fiercely opposed by Hispanic and civil rights groups, were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011.Kobach was also the architect of a 2013 Kansas law requiring voters to provide proof-of-citizenship documents, such as birth certificates or U.S. passports, when registering for the first time. A U.S. appeals court blocked that law after challenges from civil rights groups.Kobach said in the interview he believed that illegal immigrants in some cases should be deported before a conviction if they have been charged with a violent crime. Trump said in an interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that aired on Sunday that once he took office, he would remove immigrants with criminal records who are in the country illegally.Kobach said the immigration group had also discussed ways of overturning President Barack Obama's 2012 executive action that has granted temporary deportation relief and work permits to more than 700,000 undocumented people or ""dreamers"" who came to the United States as children of illegal immigrants.

By Will Dunham
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON After winning a primary election that effectively clinched the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump paused to laud a boyish-looking 35-year-old who ultimately proved to be an indispensable figure on the path to the White House.""Honestly, Jared is a very successful real estate person. But I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate,"" Trump said of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, standing to his right during a victory speech after the Indiana party primary election in May. ""But he's very good at politics.""Kushner, the slender, clean-cut New Jersey real estate scion who married Trump's daughter Ivanka in 2009, helped guide the Republican Trump to victory last week over Democrat Hillary Clinton and is poised to remain an influential adviser during his presidency.Kushner emerged as an important voice early in Trump's campaign, launched in June 2015. He was involved in almost every aspect of Trump's campaign, offering advice on key personnel decisions, strategy, speeches, fundraising and other areas.Late in the campaign, he began laying the groundwork for a possible Trump-run television network, in the event his father-in-law lost, according to a person familiar with the matter.Kushner spearheads his family's real estate development company, Kushner Companies, and is the publisher of the New York Observer weekly newspaper, which he acquired at age 25.While a federal anti-nepotism law prohibits a president from hiring family members to serve in his administration, Kushner is set to remain a key insider and trusted confidant.Reince Priebus, appointed Trump's White House chief of staff on Sunday, told NBC's ""Today"" show on Monday that Kushner ""obviously"" will be very involved in decision-making. Kushner serves on Trump's transition executive committee.FOLLOWING FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS

Kushner is a Harvard graduate with a New York University law degree and a master's in business administration. Like Trump, Kushner followed in the footsteps of a real estate powerhouse father.His father, Charles Kushner, is a real estate developer, philanthropist and major Democratic donor whose reputation was left in tatters after a lurid criminal case. He was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making unlawful campaign donations.During the case, he admitted to smearing his brother-in-law, who had cooperated with prosecutors, by hiring a prostitute to have sex with him in a motel room, then sending a secretly recorded video of the encounter to the man's wife, Charles Kushner's own sister.In an unusual twist, the man who prosecuted Charles Kushner was Chris Christie, now the governor of New Jersey, who also has served as an adviser to Trump.Kushner is an Orthodox Jew whose wife, Ivanka, converted to Judaism before they married. The family keeps kosher, observes the Sabbath and attends an upscale synagogue on New York's Upper East Side.
ANTI-SEMITISM CONTROVERSY
Steve Bannon, former head of the right-wing Breitbart News website, took a leadership post in the campaign in August after it became clear that Trump, his children and Kushner trusted his advice and analysis, a source said at the time.Breitbart News is closely associated with the ""alt-right"" movement, a loose online group of white supremacists, anti-Semites and others opposed to multiculturalism.Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, named Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor on Sunday.
Dana Schwartz, a Jewish reporter for Kushner's newspaper, in July criticized Trump for his Twitter post accusing Clinton of corruption using a Star of David image and a background of $100 bills. Schwartz then wrote an open letter to Kushner after being deluged with anti-Semitic tweets.Schwartz asked Kushner, ""how do you allow this? Because, Mr. Kushner, you are allowing this. ... When you stand silent and smiling in the background, his Jewish son-in-law, you're giving his most hateful supporters tacit approval.""Kushner responded by writing in the Observer, ""In my opinion, accusations like 'racist' and 'anti-Semite' are being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless.""He went on to write that his grandmother and grandfather survived the Nazi Holocaust while other relatives did not.""I know the difference between actual, dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points,"" Kushner wrote.Kushner became a major player in real estate in his mid-20s, after his father's conviction. At 26, he orchestrated what was the most-expensive single-building purchase in U.S. history in 2006 with the $1.8 billion acquisition of a 41-story skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.Kushner told The Real Deal trade magazine afterward, ""In New York, you have to act quickly, or else you get left in the dust.""

By Bill Trott
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON White supremacists and neo-Nazis have rarely, if ever, in recent history been so enthusiastic about a presidential appointment as Donald Trump's choice of Steve Bannon to be his chief White House strategist.Before he took over as chief executive of Trump's campaign in August and led it to victory last week, Bannon headed Breitbart News, a website and voice for the alt-right movement, a loose right-wing confederation that includes hardcore nationalists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.Five days after Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump rewarded Bannon, 62, a former Goldman Sachs banker and a Navy veteran, by appointing him senior counselor and chief strategist - jobs not subject to U.S. Senate confirmation. Democrats, rights activists and minority groups were outraged and said Trump, himself accused of racism and misogyny during the campaign, had just flung open the White House doors to hatemongers. Many urged him to reconsider.""Bringing Steve Bannon into the White House is an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign,"" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Monday.""There must be no sugar-coating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump administration,"" Pelosi said.The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) also denounced Bannon.NAZI, KKK SUPPORT
Bannon, who grew up in a Democratic family, has a reputation of trying to tear down a Republican Party establishment that he deemed too soft and too entrenched.
As a senior adviser to the Republican Trump, Bannon will be expected by far-right groups to champion their views and make sure that Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, keeps such campaign promises as building a wall on the southern U.S. border, cracking down on Muslims entering the country and restricting the influx of Syrian war refugees.""Perhaps 'The Donald' is for real,"" Rocky Suhayda, chairman of the American Nazi Party, told CNN.David Duke, a longtime leader of Ku Klux Klan movements, and Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who runs the National Policy Institute, were among the leading alt-right figures to praise Bannon's appointment.In remarks published in the New York Times on Tuesday, Bannon ascribed his interest in populism and American nationalism to a desire to curb what he views as the corrosive effects of globalization. He rejected what he called the ""ethno-nationalist"" tendencies of some in the movement.""It's not that some people on the margins, as in any movement, aren't bad guys - racists, anti-Semites. But that's irrelevant,"" he told the Times.
Political commentator Armstrong Willliams, a close associate of former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said Bannon was ""one of the finest and most honorable people I've ever met"" and not bigoted in any way. The Trump campaign had been struggling to manage Trump's unconventional candidacy when Bannon took over. He stayed behind the scenes and devised the strategy for the final days of the campaign that kept Trump on message and enabled him to upset Clinton in crucial states such as Michigan.It was Bannon and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, who invited three women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault to attend a presidential debate in hopes of unnerving Hillary Clinton. Bannon, looking typically unkempt with mussed hair and stubbly chin, grinned from the back of the room as Trump and the women held their pre-debate news conference.""Bannon is a legitimately sinister figure,"" Ben Shapiro, who had been editor-in-chief of Breitbart under Bannon, wrote in August on the dailywire.com conservative news website which he founded. ""He is a vindictive, nasty figure ... He will attempt to ruin anyone who impedes his unending ambition and he will use anyone bigger than he is - for example, Donald Trump - to get where he wants to go,"" Shapiro wrote.
ANTI-SEMITISM ACCUSATIONS
While Bannon was at Breitbart, it had stories with headlines such as ""Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy,"" ""Political correctness protects Muslim rape culture"" and ""Hoist it high and proud: The Confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage."" The site's pro-Trump agenda featured speculative stories questioning Hillary Clinton's health and accusing her close aide Huma Abedin of being a Saudi spy.Bannon was charged with domestic violence and battery in 1996 after his then-wife, Mary Louise Piccard, said he grabbed her by the throat and arm during an argument. The case was dropped when she did not appear in court. In 2007 Piccard said in court documents Bannon did not like the school the girls attended because it had too many ""whiny brat"" Jewish students.Bannon had a varied and profitable career before joining Breitbart. He earned degrees from Virginia Tech, Georgetown University and Harvard Business School and served four years in the Navy. It was his Navy experience, he said, that led him to shed his family's Democratic allegiance and become an admirer of Republican Ronald Reagan.He was at Goldman Sachs before starting his own investment firm, which specialized in media. Through negotiating a studio sale, he obtained a stake in the royalties for the popular television show ""Seinfeld,"" a money-making powerhouse in syndication.He was an executive producer of the feature movies ""Titus"" and ""The Indian Runner"" before producing, directing or writing conservative-oriented documentaries such as ""Clinton Cash"" about the Clinton Foundation, ""Generation Zero"" about the global economic crisis of 2008-2009 and ""The Undefeated"" on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

WASHINGTON An International Criminal Court investigation of possible war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan is not ""warranted or appropriate,"" the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday after prosecutors in The Hague found initial grounds for such a probe.State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the United States was not a party to the Rome Statute that created the International Criminal Court in The Hague and had not consented to ICC jurisdiction. She also said Washington had a robust justice system able to deal with such complaints.""The United States is deeply committed to complying with the law of war,"" Trudeau told reporters at a news briefing. ""We do not believe that an ICC examination or investigation with respect to actions of U.S. personnel in relation to the situation in Afghanistan is warranted or appropriate.""Her comments came a day after prosecutors at the International Criminal Court said in a report that there was a ""reasonable basis to believe"" that U.S. forces had tortured at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan and another 27 at CIA detention facilities elsewhere in 2003 and 2004.The prosecutors' office, headed by Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, said it would decide imminently whether to pursue a  full investigation. The results could lead to charges being brought against individuals and the issuing of arrest warrants.
The United States occupied Afghanistan in 2001 as it went after al Qaeda leaders behind the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Crimes also may have been committed at U.S. Central Intelligence Agency facilities in Poland, Lithuania and Romania, where some people captured in Afghanistan were taken, prosecutors said.The U.S. Justice Department between 2009 and 2012 investigated CIA mistreatment of detainees, including a full criminal investigation into two deaths in U.S. custody, but ultimately decided against prosecuting anyone.
Some U.S. military personnel have been prosecuted for murder and other crimes in Afghanistan. The ICC was established in 1998 to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Trudeau noted the United States has ""engaged with the ICC and we've supported ICC investigations and prosecution of cases that we believe advance our values in accordance with U.S. law.""
But she said the U.S. military was held to ""the highest possible standards"" and the United States had systems of accountability capable of dealing with war crimes allegations.""We do an extraordinary job of investigating ... credible allegations, holding ourselves accountable, holding our personnel accountable and closing investigations in a manner that serves justice,"" she said.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the U.S. Congress, says he talks to Donald Trump often, but the president-elect has tapped a little-known lawmaker from western New York to be his eyes and ears among congressional Republicans.In the latest example of how much Trump values personal loyalty, the billionaire businessman has effectively designated Representative Chris Collins to be the White House transition team's congressional liaison. Collins, 66, has been in Congress less than four years. He has no House leadership role. He chairs no committees. He was previously county executive for Erie County, New York.But Collins was the first lawmaker on Capitol Hill to endorse Trump's presidential bid. He co-chaired Trump's U.S. House Leadership Committee during the campaign.Collins said Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, announced the news about his role to fellow Republicans at a Tuesday caucus meeting. Ryan's office had no immediate comment.
Collins said he suggested the role to Trump the day after the Nov. 8 elections. ""I said I'm going to stay in Congress. But I think I can be a bit of a liaison, if you will, of members, kind of making sure the administration knows exactly what's going on,"" he told reporters.Trump later mentioned the idea to Ryan, who asked Collins to do the job, according to Collins.Collins seconded Ryan's renomination to the speakership on Tuesday, calling the gesture ""a sign of Trump's support for Mr. Ryan"".
Analysts called the move unusual. ""A new president generally relies on the leadership,"" said Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. ""But it's not a role with a great deal of power and it's not the same as being a conduit once Trump is president and working on policy.""  Collins' official role is to serve as a conduit to the transition team for lawmakers who want to convey concerns or ideas for legislation and staffing.
An aide said Collins has not participated in legislative discussions between House and Senate Republican leaders and the Trump team.Ryan told reporters on Tuesday that he and Trump are ""on the same page, we're working hand in glove."" But the two have not always seen eye to eye. Ryan was slow to endorse Trump for president and once described his comments about a judge of Mexican heritage as ""the textbook definition of racism"". Trump has slammed Ryan as ""a very weak and ineffective leader."" (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and David Gregorio)"

ATHENS Riot police fired teargas on Tuesday at protesters demonstrating just a few kilometers (miles) from the presidential mansion where Greek leaders were hosting a state banquet for visiting U.S. President Barack Obama.About 7,000 people, among them many hooded protesters and members of the Communist-affiliated group PAME, marched through the streets of central Athens holding banners reading ""Unwanted!"" The police clashed with the protesters after they tried to  break through cordon lines to reach the parliament building and the U.S. embassy. Some demonstrators threw two petrol bombs at police before dispersing into nearby streets close to Athens's main Syntagma Square. 
In a separate protest in the northern city of Thessaloniki, protesters burned a U.S. flag. The visit comes only two days before the anniversary of a bloody 1973 student revolt that helped topple the 1967-1974 military junta which was backed by the U.S. government.
