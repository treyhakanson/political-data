By Steve Holland
| TURNBERRY, Scotland

TURNBERRY, Scotland Donald Trump flew all night from New York to Scotland to talk about his renovated Turnberry golf course and, given the chance to open up on the topic, he was rhapsodic.At a news conference, the Republican's opening ode to Turnberry was what greeted American cable TV viewers as they woke to the news that Britain had voted to part ways with the European Union.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee talked plenty about the ""Brexit"" vote. But since his event was to mark the reopening of a resort where the Open Championship has been staged four times, he first reviewed the improvements at holes 9, 10 and 11, the sprinkler system, the lighthouse, the resort hotel, and he name-checked golf legends Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus and Nick Price.""This hole is an example,"" said Trump, standing on the 9th tee. ""From approximately this area, you would hit over there ... Now you're hitting out over the ocean. And just to the right of the lighthouse, you have a green, and a lot of people think this will be the greatest par 3 anywhere in the world. And then 10 becomes a par 5,"" he said.
Trump quickly dispensed with a protester who emerged from the audience to hold up a package of red golf balls emblazoned with Nazi swastikas.""Get him out of here,"" Trump said, a refrain that he frequently uses when protesters are escorted by security from his rallies back home.More appreciated by Trump were the two bagpipers in kilts who accompanied him. Everyone at his event knew he was about to arrive because they could hear the skirling of the pipes before he appeared from behind a grassy hill.
""We're just waiting on Donald Trump. His arrival is imminent. We can see the bagpipers,"" said one TV broadcaster.Having never held public office, Trump does not have a list of political victories to tout on the campaign trail. With his business skills, Trump says, he can work to improve America's rundown roads and bridges and negotiate better deals on issues as diverse as trade and Iran's nuclear program.Trump delights in talking about his projects. His makeover of Washington's Old Post Office into a luxury Trump hotel, for example, is way ahead of schedule.
He is less enthusiastic about raising money for his campaign and the Republican National Committee. ""I don't like doing it,"" he said.But true to his nature, Trump averred he was good at it.""You know, I sit with 20 people, and we talk, and they all hand you checks, bing, bing, bing,"" he said.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Friday pledged to build support in the U.S. House of Representatives for legislation keeping firearms from people on terrorism watch lists, despite repeated gun control failures this week in Congress.The ""Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act"" was introduced by nine House members representing diverse states stretching from Hawaii to Delaware, including some who have led the gun control fight for years.""If you can't get on a plane because of the danger that may pose, there is no reason you should be able to purchase a dangerous weapon,"" said Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, in a refrain that has ricocheted through the U.S. Capitol since the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando.The legislation, identical to a bill by Senator Susan Collins of Maine that was debated on the Senate floor on Thursday, would halt sales of weapons to people on a ""no-fly"" list barring them from boarding airplanes, or a ""Selectee"" list in which they are subjected to special airport screenings.
Over the past two weeks, the Senate failed to advance this or several other proposals placing new constraints on gun sales, as the U.S. mourned the deaths of 49 people killed at an Orlando nightclub with 53 others injured.Curbelo said he met with House Speaker Paul Ryan's top aide to inform him of the bill. The lawmaker left that meeting with no assurances it would advance, but simply ""no objection from the speaker's office"" to the legislation being introduced, Curbelo said.
He added that the bill's sponsors now must build support ""amongst our colleagues"" in a House that has a concentration of conservative Republicans opposed to most gun control ideas.Many Republicans have argued that travelers can mistakenly be placed on terrorism watch lists and denying them the ability to buy weapons would stomp on their constitutional rights.
""We cannot let that argument stop, into perpetuity, our ability to advance wise legislation in this matter,"" countered    Republican Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia.Rigell, a co-sponsor of the bill, introduced himself to reporters at a press conference as a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, which lobbies against gun controls,  and an owner of 10 firearms, including an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that is similar to the weapon used by Omar Mateen, the Orlando shooter.

By Tom Bergin
| LONDON

LONDON New York real estate developer Donald Trump says he has ""unlimited"" personal wealth to fund his White House run, but a Reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to Election Day.Trump this week dismissed concerns about his campaign finances after electoral filings showed he raised just $3 million in individual contributions in May and had a war chest of only $1 million at the end of the month. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, raised $26 million and ended May with a war chest of $42 million. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee who says he is worth about $10 billion, said in a statement on Tuesday that ""if need be, there could be unlimited 'cash on hand' as I would put up my own money."" Trump had cash and other liquid investments - money in funds, equities and cash - worth $60 million to $180 million in May, according to his filings with the Office of Government Ethics. The form does not require candidates to give precise values for their assets, only ranges.If President Barack Obama's spending in his successful re-election bid in 2012 election is any guide, then Trump is a few hundred million dollars short. Obama spent almost $600 million between June and November 2012, according to Federal Election Commission filings.Trump's campaign declined to comment for this story but referred to his earlier statement, in which he said his White House bid costs less than a traditional one because it is ""leaner and more efficient."" If Trump did decide to self-finance his campaign, he could, in theory, tap the hundreds of millions dollars of revenue he says is generated annually by his businesses.But it's not clear how much of this revenue he could use. Business owners can take money out of a business only after deducting operating costs and taxes. Even then, much of an entrepreneur's corporate earnings are often used to invest in building their businesses and maintaining their property assets. Trump's liquid assets stood at $80 million to $230 million in July last year, according to an earlier electoral filing. Using the midpoint of the ranges, Trump's liquid assets have fallen $35 million in the past year. The drop shows his campaign spending so far has already been funded in part by dipping into savings, rather than solely from his income.""There is a real question about how much he has in terms of liquid assets,"" said Norman Ornstein, a political scholar and expert in political finance at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, citing the regulatory filings, which do not give a precise picture of Trump's wealth.""It's quite possible that he doesn't have anywhere near what he suggests he has and what he does have is tied up in real estate, and selling that is no easy task,"" he said. 
As a result, a more likely scenario would be Trump trying to borrow the funds, which could be probably done more quickly than trying to sell one of his buildings, he added. Jan Baran, a former general counsel with the Republican National Committee, said Trump may not need as much money as people think.""He's breaking the mold on everything ... he has proven that spending large sums of money does not guarantee success,"" Baran said, referring to how Trump defeated well-funded Republican rivals such as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the early nominating contests, or primaries.If Trump does not use his own money, he can seek donations, the traditional fund-raising route. Individual donors can contribute $2,700 each to his general election campaign.Trump has also signed a joint fundraising agreement with the  Republican National Committee. The RNC currently has $20 million in cash, money that will be used to help elect Trump and Republican lawmakers across the country. Trump could also benefit if external groups like Super PACs raise money to campaign on his behalf. However, Trump has not yet blessed a Super PAC.
THE GROUND GAME
Trump has spent around $63 million so far in his presidential bid, including $46 million in loans he made to his campaign, FERC data shows. Typically, television advertising and creating infrastructure at a state and local level to mobilize voters are the most expensive aspects of a U.S. presidential campaign. TV networks charge high fees for prime time slots and many ground troops needed to bring out the voters must be paid. So far Trump has not needed to spend much on television advertising - his fiery rhetoric on illegal immigrants and what he says are the security risks posed by refugees from the Middle East have guaranteed him blanket media coverage. Daniel Weiner, a campaign finance expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice said you can get only so far with free media in an election.
""TV advertising has been decreasing in importance for a long time, but the get-out-the vote stuff is crucial, particularly in an election that people perceive as being more about motivating their core voters, as opposed to winning over swing voters. And what we call 'the ground game' is quite expensive,"" he said.Trump has said he plans to outsource some of that ground game to the RNC, for example relying on their field staff in battleground states to help get out the vote.BANKING ON BUILDINGS 
Trump has significant real estate holdings, which he says have low debt on them. With Election Day on Nov. 8 now just four months away, some real estate experts say selling them to generate cash would be a challenge.But several bankers say Trump could conceivably borrow hundreds of millions against them, despite his history of business bankruptcies and litigation with lenders.Exactly how much he could borrow, how easily and at what interest rates depends on how much Trump owns of the buildings that he cites as his own and how much debt he has.""You have years of prosperity and you have all of these alternative lenders and you have banks that are hungry for loans,"" said one veteran banking executive, who was not permitted to speak on the record.""If Trump needs to borrow tens of millions of dollars, he probably can, the executive said. ""If it is hundreds of millions, that's another matter."" (Additional reporting by David Henry and Grant Smith in New York, Ginger Gibson in Washington; Editing by Ross Colvin)"

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND The city of Cleveland and the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday settled a federal lawsuit over free speech limits outside the Republican National Convention next month, setting the stage for lively demonstrations during Donald Trump's big moment.The city had been seeking a restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the Quicken Loans Arena, site of the convention, where free speech and mobility would be limited. That prompted an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of three protest groups that argued the so-called event zone was too large and the security regulations too strict.Details of the new event zone and protest rules were not immediately available.""Today, counsel advised me that the case is settled and that they will execute a settlement agreement expeditiously,"" U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster said in a statement.
Another judge on Thursday had struck down Cleveland's plan for placing limits on protests, issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of the ACLU and referring the case to Polster for mediation.Trump is expected to become the Republican Party's official nominee for president at the July 18-21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside.
Trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations with some resulting in clashes between the candidate's supporters and opponents.The plaintiffs in the Cleveland lawsuit are Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the wealthy businessman's campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization.
Citizens for Trump anticipates 104 cars and trucks, 100 motorcycles, four horses and at least 5,000 people to participate in its event, while Organize Ohio expects 3,000 to 5,000 marchers, the ACLU said. (Reporting by Kim Palmer; Editing by Daniel Trotta and Bill Trott)"

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Friday  they would advance legislation next year to chop individual and corporate U.S. tax rates.The tax plan, unveiled by House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol, is the sixth and final plank of a conservative policy agenda being rolled out in an effort to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign for the party's presidential nominee.Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican, said the proposal would provide a clear direction for U.S. economic leadership and was needed amid global uncertainty that was exemplified by the British vote to leave the European Union.""For all of these moments of possible uncertainty that are happening around the globe, having strong, powerful, confident, American economic leadership is in need, and this does that,"" he said.Washington has been unable to summon the political will to reform the loophole-riddled tax code for nearly three decades. Overhauling the code has long been a goal of Ryan, a self-described policy wonk. He was considered the Republican Party's leading voice on taxes and budgets before he ascended to the job of speaker last year.
But the labor powerhouse AFL-CIO scorned the Republican blueprint as similar to a tax-cutting proposal made last year by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who Ryan recently endorsed.Ryan and Trump ""have striking resemblance - both tax plans benefit the wealthy & corps a lot,"" the AFL-CIO said on Twitter. Trump's ideas about taxes have appeared contradictory at times. He said in May he is open to raising taxes on the rich, backing off prior proposals to reduce taxes on all Americans and corporations by slashing rates even more deeply than Ryan and House Republicans would.
Democrats, including presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, have pressed for increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans for years.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the Republican plan as ""massive tax giveaways to millionaires and billionaires on the backs of hard-working American families.""The plan would consolidate the current seven tax brackets for individuals to three, and lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, higher than the 25 percent that Ryan proposed when he chaired the House Budget Committee. 
Ryan said the goal was to make things so simple the average American could do their taxes on a postcard.The plan would lead to a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on small business income. It would also lower the top U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world, to 20 percent, as well as shift to a ""territorial"" style tax system aimed at exempting the earnings of American companies abroad from U.S. taxation.The blueprint also calls for overhauling the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, an idea that animates many conservatives who have called for its abolition.

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration on Friday rolled out a series of education and work training initiatives focused on helping convicted criminals avoid returning to prison, part of President Barack Obama's legacy-shaping effort to overhaul the U.S. criminal justice system as he prepares to leave office.The measures include a program that will link 67 colleges and universities with 141 correctional facilities to provide education and training to about 12,000 inmates. The program will offer federal Pell grants to prisoners, with an emphasis on inmates set to be released within five years of starting classes.""The bottom line is that our communities are less safe when the stigma of incarceration prevents Americans from truly ever shedding their prison jumpsuit,"" White House senior adviser  Valerie Jarrett said on a call with reporters.""When people leave prisons and can't turn their lives around, they too often end up back behind bars,"" she said.Other programs unveiled on Friday will offer $31 million in grants for organizations to offer occupational training and apprenticeship opportunities for young adults and more than $5 million to organizations that help inmates prepare for employment.
Obama's top cabinet members for justice, education, labor and housing praised the reentry initiatives as common-sense reforms that should have been in place long ago.""All the little things that people take for granted generate tremendous obstacles for people who are coming out of the criminal justice system,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a panel hosted by the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank. Obtaining photo identification or being considered for job opportunities were two examples.
""In order to compete, you have to be allowed in the arena,"" she added.Hiring people with a criminal history ""is not an act of charity, it is an act of enlightened self-interest,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said, commending Maryland's largest private employer, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, for employing so many people with criminal backgrounds.Despite bipartisan support for reform of mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, legislation addressing the issue has stalled in Congress.
Jarrett said the White House remains hopeful that criminal justice reform will be approved by lawmakers.""We would like to see those bills move forward as quickly as possible,"" she said. ""We are going to do everything we can to work with members on both sides of the aisle to make sure it comes to fruition."" (Editing by Leslie Adler and David Gregorio)"

By Steve Holland
| GLASGOW, Scotland

GLASGOW, Scotland Most U.S. presidential candidates go abroad to sharpen their foreign policy credentials. Donald Trump arrives in Scotland on Friday to reopen a golf resort.The presumptive Republican nominee, 70, visits his family's ancestral homeland to showcase his far-flung business empire. His mother was born on Scotland's Isle of Lewis.With a throng of reporters watching, he will make a dramatic arrival by helicopter at his seaside Trump Turnberry resort. He has scheduled a news conference on the 9th hole at noon (7 a.m. ET/1100 GMT).His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, will allow him to comment on the outcome of Britain's vote on Thursday on whether to remain in the European Union.""I don't think opening a golf resort gets you many foreign policy chops,"" said Saul Anuzis, former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""But since he's there right in the middle of the EU vote, it may end up being a PR bonanza for him.""The risk is that the real-estate tycoon, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, will make a foreign policy misstep at a time when Republican leaders are urging a more serious demeanor.
Trump has said he would be inclined to leave the EU. He has exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has called the New Yorker's anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. There are no plans for the two to meet.'SCOTLAND HAS ALREADY BEEN WON'
His trip has baffled Republican officials who say he should concentrate on strengthening his campaign and taking the fight to the presumptive Democratic nominee, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is 68.
Trump defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination but has faced one controversy after another, the latest over his firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention.""His campaign has got all kinds of growing pains and it doesn't make sense that he would spend any kind of time going out of the country,"" said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. Turnberry is a storied course where the Open Championship has been staged four times. Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotland's West Coast 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow.
He has portrayed his determination to build up courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen and overcome local opposition as an example of the type of leadership skills that Americans would get if he wins the White House on Nov. 8.""Well, Scotland has already been won - and so will the United States,"" Trump wrote in a column for The Press and Journal newspaper in Aberdeen.An Aberdeen family opposed to his development there has threatened to raise a Mexican flag as a reminder of his proposal to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally.The last Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, in 2012 made a gaffe-filled campaign trip to London, Jerusalem and Poland.
