By Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and four other U.S. senators on Thursday called on President Barack Obama to order a comprehensive environmental review of a pipeline project that has stirred widespread opposition from Native Americans and environmental activists.After a federal appeals court on Sunday night denied a request to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the senators asked Obama to direct the Army Corps of Engineers to complete a full environmental impact statement, including stronger tribal consultation, for a contested part of the route.""The project's current permits should be suspended and all construction stopped until a complete environmental and cultural review has been completed for the entire project,"" said the letter by Sanders and Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein, Ed Markey, Patrick Leahy and Benjamin Cardin.Also on Thursday, the governments of 19 cities, including St. Louis and Minneapolis, passed ordinances to support the Standing Rock tribe in opposition of the pipeline.In recent weeks, protests against the Dakota Access pipeline led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota have drawn international attention, prompting the U.S. government to temporarily block construction on federal land. Tribal leaders say the pipeline will desecrate land and pollute water, especially around the planned crossing through Lake Oahe, a sacred site. Opposition to the pipeline has drawn support from 200 Native American tribes.
On Tuesday, anti-pipeline activists in four states, in solidarity with the Dakota pipeline protesters, closed pipeline valves to halt the flow of crude through arteries transporting 15 percent of U.S. oil consumption.A day earlier, actress Shailene Woodley was arrested in North Dakota while protesting the pipeline, an incident that was live streamed on Facebook.On Thursday, Amy Goodman, a journalist from the independent TV and radio program Democracy Now!, said she would turn herself over to authorities in North Dakota on Monday morning, in response to a criminal complaint was filed against her on Sept. 8 for trespassing.
Goodman had filmed the crackdown on protesters by authorities last month.""I was doing my job as a journalist, covering a violent attack on Native American protesters,"" she said.When fully connected, the 1,100-mile (1,770 km) pipeline would be the first to carry crude directly to the U.S. Gulf from the Bakken shale, a vast oil formation in North Dakota, Montana and parts of Canada.
The $3.7 billion project is being built by the Dakota Access subsidiary of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, which has vowed to complete construction.""There must be a serious consideration of the full potential climate impacts of this pipeline prior to the Army Corps of Engineers approving any permits or easements for the Dakota Access pipeline,"" the senators said. Experts say that the full environmental review requested by the senators could take several months.

By Joseph Ax
| PRINCETON, N.J.

PRINCETON, N.J. A citizen's complaint against New Jersey Governor Chris Christie related to the ""Bridgegate"" lane-closure scandal can move forward, a judge ruled on Thursday, referring the case to state prosecutors to consider possible criminal charges.Roy McGeady, the presiding judge for Bergen County municipal courts, found probable cause for the criminal complaint filed last month by Bill Brennan, an activist and retired firefighter, a court official confirmed.The complaint of official misconduct accused Christie of knowing about a plot to close down lanes at the George Washington Bridge as an act of political payback. The governor has repeatedly denied any prior knowledge of the closures, which created massive traffic jams in northern New Jersey.The ruling ratchets up the political pressure on Christie, who became a major supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after dropping his own White House bid and now heads his White House transition team.The controversy surrounding the scandal, which has resulted in criminal charges against two of Christie's associates, helped scuttle his bid for the Republican presidential nomination and has eroded the governor's approval ratings in New Jersey.The misconduct case now moves to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, which will decide whether enough evidence exists to support a criminal charge. ""The office has no comment at this time,"" spokeswoman Maureen Parenta said in an email.Brennan filed the complaint in municipal court in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where Christie allies were accused of deliberately causing a massive traffic jam in September 2013 by closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in order to punish the town's mayor. The bridge is a major link to New York City.
The two Christie associates - his former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey executive Bill Baroni - have been on trial in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, for their alleged roles in the scandal.Brennan's complaint was based on testimony from David Wildstein, another Port Authority executive who pleaded guilty in the case and has been cooperating with prosecutors, that Christie was aware of the lane closures at the time.A Christie spokesman, Brian Murray, said the governor would appeal the ruling immediately.
""This is a dishonorable complaint filed by a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,"" Murray said. ""The simple fact is the governor had no knowledge of the lane realignments either before they happened or while they were happening. This matter has already been thoroughly investigated by three separate independent investigations.""Brennan has filed numerous complaints, as well as lawsuits, against various officials in New Jersey over the years.Federal prosecutors have accused Kelly, Baroni and Wildstein of orchestrating the lane closures to send a message to Fort Lee Mayor Michael Sokolich after the Democrat refused to endorse Christie's 2013 gubernatorial re-election campaign.At the time, Christie was already eyeing a White House run, and his advisers believed a show of bipartisan support would help enhance his national standing.
Christie, 54, was among the 17 Republicans who originally vied for the Republican presidential nomination, but he dropped out of the race in February after failing to gain traction in the early voting. He became one of eventual nominee Trump's staunchest supporters.As head of the New York businessman's transition team, he would work to smooth the handover from Democratic President Barack Obama to Trump should Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.U.S. prosecutors are nearing the end of their case against Kelly and Baroni after four weeks of testimony. Lawyers for the two defendants have argued that virtually the entire Christie administration was aware of the scheme and have portrayed Kelly and Baroni as scapegoats.Both were expected to take the witness stand in their defense.

MOSCOW The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the Obama administration of destroying relations with Moscow in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election next month, saying on Thursday that it hoped the next occupants of the White House would be better.In comments that underline how deeply a hacking scandal and differences over Syria and Ukraine have damaged U.S.-Russia relations, Maria Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman, told a news conference Washington was playing a dangerous game.""We see with regret how Washington continues to destroy our bilateral relations,"" said Zakharova. ""The level of Russophobic propaganda coming from the very top is now starting to go off the scale.""Calling White House accusations Russia was behind a hacking campaign against Democratic Party organizations ""a lie,"" she accused the Obama administration of trying to make U.S. voters perceive Russia as the enemy.
""We have the growing feeling that the outgoing U.S. administration is applying scorched earth tactics to our bilateral relations,"" she said, saying such an approach was dangerous and could affect international stability.Zakharova also warned Washington to think twice before taking any retaliatory action over the hacking scandal, suggesting the Obama administration was gearing up to use the scandal as a pretext to launch its own cyber attacks on Russia. 
Detailing Russian concerns over what it believes is a NATO build-up along its borders, she accused U.S. officials at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank of trying to block funds for Russia-related projects. ""Of course, we understand that all these steps are being made to serve America's internal pre-election set-up,"" said Zakharova.
""(But) nobody should be under illusions that it's possible to put pressure on Russia, neither today's U.S. authorities or the people who replace them. We want to hope strongly that the new people will be smarter than the old lot."" (Additional reporting by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Alexander Winning)"

MOSCOW A foreign policy adviser to U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump has accused Washington of contributing to an atmosphere of mutual contempt with Moscow by disregarding Russia's interests.Carter Page, a former investment banker whose views on Russia have caused controversy in the past, made the comments in an opinion piece for Russia's state-controlled Sputnik news agency that was published on Thursday.""From Syria to Ukraine to world energy policy, Russia remains an essential piece in the puzzle for solving many of Washington's most pressing geostrategic challenges,"" Page wrote in the article.
The U.S. government had shown a ""complete disregard for Russia's interests"", Page said, saying this had fueled a sharp deterioration in bilateral relations.Trump, the Republican nominee for next month's U.S. election, named Page as being among five foreign policy advisers in March. Both Trump and Page are known for their more conciliatory stance toward Russia, in contrast to the views of many prominent Republicans.
In a speech in Moscow in July, Page criticized Western countries for what he said was their ""hypocritical focus on democratization"" in the post-Soviet world.

By Roberta Rampton and Emily Flitter
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Two women accused Donald Trump of inappropriate touching in a story published on Wednesday by the New York Times, claims his spokesman called ""fiction"" but which may further damage the Republican presidential nominee's chances of winning the White House just four weeks before the Nov. 8 election.The report was followed by a stream of similar allegations from other women, putting more pressure on the Trump campaign as it lags in national opinion polls and struggles to contain a crisis caused by the candidate's comments about groping women without their consent which surfaced on Friday.One of the women, Jessica Leeds, appeared on camera on the New York Times' website to recount how Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight to New York in or around 1980. (nyti.ms/2dx8k5R)The second woman, Rachel Crooks, described how Trump ""kissed me directly on the mouth"" in 2005 outside the elevator in Trump Tower in Manhattan, where she was a receptionist at a real estate firm.Trump's campaign denied there was any truth to the New York Times accounts. It made public a letter to the newspaper from Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer representing Trump, demanding it retract the story, calling it ""libelous,"" and threatening legal action if it did not comply.""This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,"" the Trump campaign's senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement.Reuters could not independently verify the incidents. Leeds and Crooks did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.""We stand by the story, which falls clearly into the realm of public service journalism,"" a New York Times spokeswoman said.The report comes just two days after a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed one in five Republicans thought Trump's comments about groping women disqualified him from the presidency, and put him 8 points behind Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton among likely voters.MORE ACCOUNTS SURFACE

Within hours, several other media outlets published similar reports. People magazine published a detailed first-person account from one of its reporters, Natasha Stoynoff. (bit.ly/2dTm90D)Stoynoff said Trump pinned her against a wall at his Florida estate in 2005 and kissed her as she struggled to get away. ""I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat,"" Stoynoff said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the People story late on Wednesday. The article included a denial from a Trump spokeswoman who called the story a ""politically motivated fictional pile-on.""Around the same time, the Palm Beach Post reported a claim by Mindy McGillivray, 36, a woman in South Florida, that Trump had grabbed her bottom 13 years ago while she was working at his Mar a Lago estate as a photographer's assistant.""There is no truth to this whatsoever,"" Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Post. McGillivray could not be reached for comment.
CHASTISED BY SOME REPUBLICANS 
The reports come on the heels of a 2005 video that surfaced on Friday that showed Trump bragging about groping women, kissing them without permission, and trying to seduce a married woman. ""I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait,"" Trump is heard saying on the tape.Trump said during the second presidential debate on Sunday that he had not actually done the things he had boasted about, and apologized for his remarks, which he called private ""locker room talk.""The bombshell video has jeopardized Trump's chances of winning on Election Day, and put Republican control of the U.S. Congress in danger.
He was chastised by Republican leaders, and some called on him to drop out of the presidential race. On Wednesday, Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after Ryan said he was no longer going to campaign for or defend Trump.Trump complained to thousands of supporters jammed into a livestock arena in Ocala, Florida, that Ryan and others had not congratulated him on his debate performance on Sunday, and the crowd booed in sympathy.""There is a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on,"" Trump said.Former Republican House Speaker John Boehner said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he would vote for Trump in spite of being ""disgusted"" by his comments, because he wanted to see conservative justices named to the Supreme Court.The interview was taped before the New York Times story was published, but Boehner said he thought it was likely that more negative stories would emerge in the last month of the campaign.""What more could be said in this election cycle than has already been said?"" Boehner asked. ""It couldn't be any worse, could it?""A spokeswoman for Clinton said Wednesday's report was ""disturbing.""""These reports suggest that he lied on the debate stage and that the disgusting behavior he bragged about in the tape is more than just words,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign.

By Alex Dobuzinskis

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's support has sharply fallen in Utah where a poll on Wednesday showed him tied with Democrat Hillary Clinton in a state that has voted Republican in presidential races for decades.    The survey of 500 people from Salt Lake City-based Y2 Analytics also showed a surge for Evan McMullin, an ex-CIA officer running as an independent.    Trump and Clinton were both at 26 percent while McMullin, a member of the Mormon faith that dominates in Utah, trailed just behind at 22 percent.The telephone poll of likely voters was conducted on Monday and Tuesday, after a video featuring comments from Trump about groping women surfaced last week. The survey underscored the level of disaffection some conservatives have shown for Trump, who has found himself at odds with much of the Republican Party establishment.
The last time a Republican presidential nominee lost in Utah was in the landslide national election victory of President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, in 1964.""There's limits to partisanship even in Utah of all places,"" Scott Riding, managing partner of Y2 Analytics, said.The poll results indicate severe erosion in Trump's popularity in Utah even as Clinton's support has grown slightly. A Salt Lake Tribune poll in September put support for Trump at 34 percent, compared with 25 percent for Clinton.
A number of prominent Utah Republicans, including Governor Gary Herbert and U.S. Senator Mike Lee, pulled their support for Trump or called on him to quit the race. McMullin, a former CIA counter-terrorism specialist and investment banker whose campaign is based in Utah, is less well known nationally than the other minor candidates, Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson.Johnson ranked fourth in the Y2 Analytics poll with support from 14 percent of likely voters, roughly in line with his previous level of support in Utah.
McMullin, who is running as a conservative independent, is on the ballot in a dozen states including Utah, with plans to expand his reach before the Nov. 8 election, according to his campaign spokesman Rick Wilson. The vast majority of participants in the poll were familiar with the video tape of Trump's vulgar comments about women during a 2005 recording and a third of them said it lowered their opinion of the New York businessman.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points.

By James Oliphant and Katya Golubkova
| WASHINGTON/MOSCOW

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Wednesday his country was not involved in an effort to influence the U.S. presidential election even as WikiLeaks released another trove of internal documents from Hillary Clinton's campaign.Last week, the U.S. government formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to ""interfere with the U.S. election process.""Clinton's campaign, which has charged the Kremlin is trying to help Republican Donald Trump win the White House on Nov. 8, took its allegations a step further on Tuesday when John Podesta, chairman of the Democratic nominee's campaign, accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia.At events in Florida, Trump said he had nothing to do with Putin or Russia.""I promise you, I don't have any business deals with Russia,"" Trump said at a rally in Lakeland.In Moscow, Putin said nothing in the hacking scandal is in Russia's interests and accused all sides in the U.S. presidential campaign of misusing rhetoric about Russia for their own purposes. ""They started this hysteria, saying this (hacking) is in Russia's interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia's interests,"" Putin told a business forum.Putin said his government would work with whoever won the U.S. election, ""if, of course, the new U.S. leader wishes to work with our country."" WikiLeaks, the organization started by Julian Assange that publishes leaked information on the internet, this week released thousands of emails from Podesta's email account and has not said how it obtained them. Last week, it posted excerpts from Clinton's private speeches to banking and financial firms. The Clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the messages. The leaks, coming as the election campaign reaches the final stretch, have the potential to embarrass the Clinton camp. In recent days, however, Trump's own campaign has been in deeper trouble over the emergence of a 2005 video in which Trump bragged about groping women. Many Republican elected officials have turned their back on him and Clinton's lead in national opinion polls has increased.
Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday, deepening a fracture in the Republican Party. Clinton, a former secretary of state, has repeatedly accused Trump of having overly friendly ties with Putin and Russia. She has noted that Trump's foreign policies have tended to align with Russian's interests, whether it has been questioning NATO's role in defending Eastern Europe, failing to recognize Russia's intrusion into Ukraine, and supporting Russia's actions in Syria. Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously run for office, has shifted his policies on a wide range of issues, from taxes to the minimum wage to immigration during his White House campaign but his statements on Russia have been consistent. His friendly stance toward Moscow departs from the views of many prominent Republicans. During a presidential debate on Sunday, Trump publicly disagreed with his own vice presidential choice, Mike Pence, who had called for a more hawkish approach toward Russia.    
""I DON'T KNOW PUTIN""
At that debate, Trump questioned whether Russia was behind the hacks, as the U.S. government has asserted. And on Wednesday, during a rally in Ocala, Florida, Trump echoed those remarks.""Have you ever noticed, anything that goes wrong they blame Russia?"" Trump told the crowd. ""They always blame Russia and then they says Donald Trump is friends . . . I don't know Putin, folks. What the hell do I have to do with Putin?""Trump has said that as president he would seek warmer relations with Russia and that it would be in the United States' best interests to seek Russia's help to defeat Islamic State. ""Trump is the most pro-Russian presidential candidate ever,"" said Max Boot, a senior fellow for national security studies at the Council of Foreign Relations. ""Putin no doubt sees a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reorient U.S. foreign policy in his direction by electing Trump.""A Russian ultra-nationalist ally of Putin who is known for his fiery rhetoric said Trump was the only person able to de-escalate dangerous tensions between Moscow and Washington, and predicted nuclear war if Clinton were elected.     
""Relations between Russia and the United States can't get any worse. The only way they can get worse is if a war starts,"" Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant veteran lawmaker, told Reuters.           Clinton campaign chairman Podesta said on Tuesday the FBI was investigating a ""criminal hack"" of his emails, and he tied the Trump campaign to the leaks by suggesting that a former Trump adviser, Roger Stone, had advance warning of the hacks. The Trump campaign has not responded to the allegation about Stone, but Trump has denied any coordination with the Russian government to embarrass Clinton. He has, however, made clear he supports WikiLeaks' efforts. ""I love WikiLeaks,"" he said at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. The United States has an ongoing criminal investigation into Assange's publishing of classified material. Clinton has been a fierce critic of Assange, who remains at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he sought refuge in 2012 to avoid possible extradition to Sweden. Last week, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security said the government was confident the hacks of Democratic political groups and campaign officials originated from high levels of the Russian government.The White House on Tuesday promised a ""proportional"" response to Russia over the hacks. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told CNN the United States has offered no proof of his government's involvement, and suggested Moscow was unconcerned about possible reprisals.""If they decided to do something, let them do it,"" Lavrov said.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump has fallen further behind Hillary Clinton and now trails her by 8 points among likely voters, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, with 1 in 5 Republicans saying his vulgar comments about groping women disqualify him from the presidency. The national tracking poll was launched after Sunday night's second presidential debate, where Trump was pressed to explain his comments in a 2005 videotape about grabbing women's genitalia. He described the remarks, which first surfaced on Friday, as ""locker room"" banter and apologized to Americans. The poll released on Tuesday showed Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had increased her lead over Trump, the Republican nominee, to 8 percentage points on Monday from 5 points last week. When asked to pick between the two major-party candidates, 45 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton while 37 percent supported Trump. Another 18 percent said they would not support either candidate. Trump was under pressure during Sunday's debate to restore confidence in his struggling campaign after dozens of lawmakers repudiated him over the weekend. He hammered Clinton's handling of classified information while serving as secretary of state and referred to her as ""the devil."" At one point, he said he would jail Clinton if he were president.Among those who said they watched at least portions of the debate, 53 percent said Clinton won while 32 percent said Trump won. The results fell along partisan lines, however: 82 percent of Democrats felt Clinton won, while 68 percent of Republicans felt that Trump won.Among likely voters who watched the debate, 48 percent said they supported Clinton while 38 percent supported Trump.
'LOCKER ROOM TALK'    
In the 2005 Access Hollywood video Trump boasted about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. ""When you're a star they let you do it,"" he is heard saying.Some 61 percent of those polled said that ""lots of men"" occasionally engage in similar conversations, and 46 percent, a plurality, said it was unfair to judge someone on conversations ""that they did not intend for anyone else to hear.""
Most of those polled said they believe Trump is a sexist, but they were split on whether his comments disqualify him from being president. Some 42 percent of American adults, including 19 percent of registered Republicans, said Trump's comments disqualified him, while 43 percent said they did not. Among Republicans, 58 percent said they want Trump to remain atop their party's ticket, and 68 percent said the Republican leadership should stand by him. The video doesn't appear to have worsened Trump's standing among women, who mostly had a low opinion of him already, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling over the past 12 months.When asked to pick between the two candidates, about 44 percent of women chose Clinton while 29 percent selected Trump - roughly the same proportion as measured in polls conducted before the weekend.         
Trump, however, appears to be shedding support among evangelicals, who are usually a wellspring of support for Republican presidential candidates. Monday's poll showed that Trump had only a 1-point edge over Clinton among people who identified as evangelicals. That's down from a 12-point advantage for Trump in July.The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The poll of 2,386 American adults included 1,839 people who watched the debates, 1,605 people who were considered likely voters due to their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote in the election. Among the likely voters, the poll counted 798 Democrats and 586 Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire group, 3 points for likely voters and the debate watchers, 4 points for Democrats and 5 points for Republicans.    National opinion polls have measured support for the candidates in different ways this year, yet most agree that Clinton is leading and that her advantage has strengthened as the general election approaches.RealClearPolitics, which tracks most major opinion polls, shows Clinton ahead of Trump by an average of 7 percentage points, and that her lead has grown since the middle of September.

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign looked for ways to avoid damaging its relationship with the White House as she considered how to publicly announce her position on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, according to emails published this week by WikiLeaks.Clinton aides weighed having the Democratic candidate say she opposed the pipeline in a closed-door union meeting, leaking it to news media outlets or including it without fanfare in a policy fact sheet, the emails show.Clinton eventually announced that she opposed the pipeline on Sept. 22, 2015, at a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, early in the contest to win the Democratic presidential nomination. President Barack Obama, also a Democrat, announced that he too opposed the project on Nov. 6, 2015.The WikiLeaks group released its latest batch of apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta on Wednesday, just weeks before the Nov. 8 presidential election in which Clinton is facing Republican Donald Trump.Whether Clinton would oppose TransCanada Corp's pipeline to bring Canadian crude tar sands oil to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico was a major issue in her Democratic primary race against chief rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who opposed the project.Clinton was walking a fine line on supporting or opposing the pipeline. The Keystone XL controversy put at odds labor unions, which thought the project would spur job creation, and environmentalists, who advocated moving away from tar sands-derived oil to cleaner forms of energy.Clinton's decision was further complicated by the fact that the pipeline approval process began when she was Obama's secretary of state from 2009-2013. She said repeatedly that she would wait to announce her position until after the State Department had repeated its review of the project, in deference to her former boss. Privately, aides were figuring out the best way to announce her opposition to the project.
""We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the President in public,"" speechwriter Dan Schwerin wrote on Aug. 7, 2015, in one of the apparently hacked emails.Schwerin was responding to a suggestion by Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook that they could use the Keystone announcement to draw news media attention away from Clinton's use of a private email system while she headed the State Department.The Clinton campaign has declined to verify the authenticity of the Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks. Podesta told reporters on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had notified him it was investigating the ""criminal"" hack of his emails as part of a broader probe.The White House last week formally accused Russia of hacking Democratic Party organizations in an effort to influence the presidential election, a charge Russia has denied. As a result, Clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails.
There was no evidence to indicate that the Keystone emails - which provided insight into the campaign's struggle to announce Clinton's position on a major Democratic issue that could put her at odds with the White House - were not genuine.Clinton's campaign considered having the former secretary of state address the Keystone issue in a private meeting with a building trades union, then immediately roll out a fact sheet on her infrastructure proposals and publish an opinion article on the topic, the leaked emails show.But Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon thought it might be easier to forgo including Keystone in the policy rollout, skip the opinion piece and have Clinton state her opposition in the union meeting.
""I think we could seem consistent with our past statements about not wanting to get ahead of POTUS on Keystone if her position merely leaked out of the meeting,"" Fallon wrote in a Sept. 8, 2015, email, using an acronym for the president. ""That would seem like a private comment that she didn't intend to become public.""""Perhaps we could just issue an infrastructure fact sheet"" without mention of Keystone, ""and rely on the (Clinton) Keystone (position) to leak, either organically or with an assist from us,"" Fallon added.After Clinton warned at a New Hampshire campaign event on Sept. 17, 2015, that she could not ""wait too much longer"" and was ""putting the White House on notice"" that she would soon tell voters her position, Podesta checked in with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.""Trying to calibrate whether we are threading the needle ok with you guys after Valerie getting her nose out of joint on Keystone,"" Podesta wrote in a Sept. 20, 2015, email, in an apparent reference to Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama.Podesta said that Clinton's ""comments on being frustrated with the delay"" were not a ""frontal attack"" on the president.

9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-florida-registration-idUSKCN12C1Y2	Judge gives Florida voters more time to register after hurricane	"


By Joseph Ax

Florida residents were given six extra days to register to vote in the Nov. 8 election by a U.S. judge on Wednesday following the disruption triggered by powerful Hurricane Matthew in the state last week.U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee extended the registration deadline to Oct. 18 after the Florida Democratic Party sued to seek more time. The original deadline to register had been Tuesday, before Walker ordered a one-day reprieve to allow for a hearing on Wednesday.Florida Democrats had argued that voters were forced to decide between their safety and their right to vote when Republican Governor Rick Scott ordered evacuations along a stretch of the state's Atlantic coast as Matthew approached. ""No right is more precious than having a voice in our democracy,"" Walker wrote in a three-page court ruling on the lawsuit.Florida is a battleground state in the Nov. 8 presidential election pitting Democrat Hillary Clinton against Republican Donald Trump, with opinion polls showing a close race there. It is the largest of the hotly contested states whose populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and thus play a decisive role.The powerful hurricane, which killed around 1,000 people in Haiti as it churned through the Caribbean, is blamed for at least 30 deaths in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. North Carolina now faces flooding from swollen rivers. 
 In its complaint, the Florida Democratic Party alleged that the state's refusal to extend the voter registration deadline would have a ""decidedly partisan effect,"" noting that populations that lean Democratic, including minorities and younger voters, register in greater numbers just before the deadline. It also noted that areas affected by Matthew have substantial populations of black and Latino voters who would be disproportionately likely to register to vote at the last minute.In past presidential years, up to 20 percent of all new registrations in Florida were filed during the week before the deadline, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, which helped bring the lawsuit.
""While we wish it had not taken a lawsuit to get the Scott administration to do the right thing, today's ruling is a major victory for all Floridians and for the democratic process in the Sunshine State,"" the state Democratic Party said in a statement.The judge earlier ruled that Florida law did not give Scott authority to extend voter registration and that he was not a proper party to the case.Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Scott appointee also named in the lawsuit, was empowered to do so, Walker noted.
""The State will follow the court's decision and discuss with the Legislature possible amendments to current law,"" Scott's office said in a statement earlier in the week. South Carolina extended its registration deadline due to Matthew from Oct. 7 to Oct. 11, while Georgia declined to do so. North Carolina will not extend the regular deadline to register to vote, which ends on Friday, although allowances will be made for delayed mail delivery of registration forms, state officials said on Wednesday. However, those who miss the deadline can still register and vote on the same day during the statewide early voting period from Oct. 20 through Nov. 5.
