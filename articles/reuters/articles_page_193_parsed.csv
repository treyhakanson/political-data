WASHINGTON The FBI planned a 11:00 a.m. news conference Monday near the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, to provide updates on the investigation into last week's shooting, the bureau said.Before the news conference, authorities planned to release transcripts of communications between police and gunman Omar Mateen during last Sunday's the three-hour siege at the club, the FBI said in a statement.
During that time, the gunman paused to call emergency 911 dispatchers and post internet messages professing support for Islamist militant groups, authorities have said.

By Ayesha Rascoe and Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama made a plug on Monday for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal to a group of 2,400 investors looking at locating business in the United States, saying the deal would help boost the global economy.Trade has become a hot-button issue in the Nov. 8 presidential election campaign, with presumptive candidates from both parties voicing objections to the 12-nation TPP deal that Obama wants the U.S. Congress to sign off on before his time in office ends on Jan. 20.Both the Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns have tapped into populist skepticism about the benefit of trade deals on jobs and wages, particularly in the manufacturing sector.Obama tried to dispel the economic gloom-and-doom coming from the campaign trail, extolling the recovery of the United States from recession.""I don't mind being America's pitch man,"" Obama said in a speech at the SelectUSA Summit. ""In seven months or so, I'll be on the job market, and I'm glad I'm going to be here. I'm going to get on LinkedIn and see what comes up,"" he quipped.
Obama argued that while there are legitimate concerns about boosting wages and improving working conditions, ultimately  global trade can help connect people from around the world and reduce poverty.""This is not just about jobs and trade, it's not just about hard cold cash,"" he said. ""It's also about building relationships across borders. When your companies come together you help bring countries and cultures together.""  American business lobby groups have been pushing the White House and congressional leaders to finish their work to ratify the TPP before the next administration takes office.
Obama's top economic adviser sidestepped a question on a conference call about the timeline.""We're continuing to work with congressional leaders to find the right opportunity, the right window of opportunity, to get TPP passed this year,"" Jeff Zients, the director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.
On Monday, Obama announced a $70 million matching grant to a Los Angeles ""manufacturing hub,"" a group of businesses and researchers piloting sensors and other technology to help factories cut costs and energy use.It is the ninth of 15 planned hubs that the White House hopes will boost manufacturing across the country.On Friday, Obama will continue his pitch for business, speaking about technology and the economy on a panel with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg at another summit at Stanford University aimed at boosting entrepreneurs in developing countries.

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A leading U.S. promoter of Latino boxing, All Star Boxing Inc, will give free television advertising space to Hispanic civic group Mi Familia Vota, which openly criticizes Donald Trump's anti-immigration stance, in an effort to encourage Latino Americans to vote in November's presidential election.The partnership will put the name and website of the group on signs in boxing ring corners and on T-shirts worn by the athletes on Spanish language network Telemundo's Boxeo Telemundo program, starting at the end of June, officials at both organizations told Reuters.The partnership will be announced on Tuesday.""Desperate times call for desperate measures,"" said Ruben De Jesus, the director of operations at Florida-based All Star Boxing, referring to this year's presidential election.He said he decided to contact Mi Familia Vota with the offer of free advertising after hearing ""just the whole rhetoric with regards to the Hispanic community"" in the current election. He did not mention any candidate by name. ""Our platform is not to tell our Latino citizens who to vote for, but it's important that this year especially we engage,"" he told Reuters in an interview, adding the free advertising space could reach as many as 5 million people.
Ben Monterroso, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, was blunter about the partnership's aim.""I think Mr. Donald Trump lives in another world,"" he said. ""In my experience working with the community, a big majority of the people that I talk to, they definitely don't like what Donald Trump has done.""Trump, the Republican who will likely face Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election, launched his candidacy last year by calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration from Mexico, a country he said was sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States. The wealthy New York businessman has also repeatedly vowed to build a wall along the border and force the Mexican government to pay for it if elected.
More recently Trump angered Latinos by criticizing a federal judge overseeing a fraud trial against Trump University, calling the Indiana-born man a Mexican and, later, saying his Mexican heritage meant he couldn't do his job properly.Trump has rejected accusations that his comments are racist and has said he is well-liked by Hispanics. A spokeswoman for Trump was not immediately available to comment.The partnership between All Star Boxing and Mi Familia Vota will begin on June 24 and run for four events this summer, then another four events after a brief hiatus, comprising 128 boxers in total, De Jesus said. 
Half the shows will take place in Florida and half in Mexico.The fighters will also hold local events in Florida to boost voter engagement in the critical swing state, De Jesus said. That could include visits to political events around Tampa and Orlando, such as helping to register voters.""The boxers are coming out of their corners to fight for the community,"" Monterroso said.Boxeo Telemundo, with an over 25-year history, calls itself the most-watched Spanish-language boxing show in the United States. The show attracts an average 550,000 viewers weekly, especially among men 18 to 49, De Jesus said.Mi Familia Vota is a non-profit, non-partisan group that works to register Latino voters and get Latinos involved in U.S. political life.

By Matt Spetalnick
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Vice President Joe Biden on Monday will denounce Republican Donald Trump's call for a halt to Muslim immigration as an appeal to intolerance and defend the U.S. fight against Islamic State at a time of dissent within the Obama administration over Syria policy.Biden will deliver a wide-ranging rebuke to Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, in a speech to the Center for New American Security think tank, according to excerpts released by the White House.Biden, who has joined President Barack Obama in endorsing presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, plans to wade deeper into the campaign a week after Trump sparked criticism for his comments on American Muslims after a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.In a speech last Monday on national security, Trump stood by his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and proposed a suspension of immigration from countries with ""a proven history of terrorism.""     
Biden, in his remarks, will say: ""Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance - like proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States or slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism - calls into question America's status as the greatest democracy in the history of the world.""  Although not naming Trump, the vice president will say: ""Alienating 1.5 billion Muslims - the vast, vast majority of whom, at home and abroad, are peace-loving - will only make the problem worse.""Biden will also apparently chide Trump for having spoken admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Embracing Putin at a time of renewed Russian aggression"" could call into question the U.S. commitment to Europe's security,"" he will say.
Referring to Trump's vow to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico if elected, Biden will assert: ""If we build walls and disrespect our closest neighbors,"" it will reignite anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America.Biden's defense of Obama's strategy against Islamic State militants appears intended, at least in part, to push back against a recently leaked internal State Department memo critical of the president's response to Syria's civil war.
The document, signed by 51 diplomats and reflecting long-standing frustration among Obama's aides, calls for urgently broadening an approach, now focused on attacking Islamic State, to unleash air strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. U.S. officials made clear Obama would not be swayed.""The use of force should be precise and proportional,"" Biden will say. ""There must be a clear mission that advances U.S. interests. Whenever possible, we should act alongside allies and partners."" (Reporting by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Trump', 'Obama']	['gay']

By Robert Iafolla
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to review a lower court decision that invalidated part of a former U.S. labor board official's tenure, in a case that could curb the next president's power to staff top positions in his or her administration.The justices will hear an appeal of a 2015 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit saying that once President Barack Obama nominated Lafe Solomon in 2011 to be general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Solomon should not have continued to fill the position on a temporary or ""acting"" basis pending Senate confirmation.The appeals court said a 1998 federal law bars anyone from serving in an acting role while they are the nominee unless they were previously the ""first assistant"" to that post.The Supreme Court's ruling in the case could decide if the White House can temporarily fill high-level administration positions with nominees waiting for confirmation, which could take on added importance if the next president faces protracted nomination battles in the Senate.
The case will give the Supreme Court a second chance to weigh in on executive branch authority related to filling positions at the NLRB. In 2014, the court in NLRB v. Noel Canning ruled that three 2013 appointments Obama made to the board while Congress was in recess were invalid.Although Obama withdrew Solomon's stalled nomination in 2013, about six current high-level officials are serving on an acting basis while they await a Senate vote, including officials at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, the NLRB said in its petition for review.
Former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush also tapped officials to permanently fill the posts that they were manning in a temporary capacity, the NLRB said.Clinton, Bush and Obama all relied on an interpretation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act that viewed the restriction on first assistants as only applying to people who automatically become acting officers under a chain of command, rather than those nominated by the president, the NLRB said.
But the D.C. Circuit, as well as the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2016 ruling, have disagreed.The case is NLRB v. SW General Inc, No. 15-1251, in the U.S. Supreme Court. (Reporting by Robert Iafolla, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi)"	['Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

""If the bullets were going in the other direction aimed at this guy, who was just open target practice, you would have had a situation that was always horrible, but nothing like the carnage that we all as a people suffered this weekend,"" Trump said on Wednesday at a rally in Atlanta.National Rifle Association President Wayne LaPierre on Sunday appeared critical of the idea of having clubgoers armed. ""I don't think you should have firearms where people are drinking,"" LaPierre said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" 
An off-duty Orlando police officer was working security at the club when the shooting occurred, authorities have said.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON If the U.S. Supreme Court in the coming days decides a high-profile immigration case in favor of the Obama administration, the ruling could have an unexpected beneficiary: Republican presidential contender Donald Trump.  The Obama administration is asking the high court to revive its 2014 proposal to protect up to 4 million people from deportation, a plan that was blocked by lower courts. The court could rule that a president has broad authority to interpret and enforce federal immigration law. Such a ruling would allow Obama to implement his signature executive action on immigration, aimed at the parents of U.S. citizens' children, before he leaves office. It could also help Trump, who has put forth his own sweeping and controversial plans on immigration ahead of the Nov. 8 election.""To the extent the court has language about the president's wide authority in immigration law generally, that would certainly strengthen Trump's hand."" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell Law School.The Supreme Court's ruling will come at a key phase in the presidential election cycle, with candidates Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton trading jabs over immigration policy following the mass shooting in a Orlando nightclub in which a gunman killed 49 people. Trump has proposed curbing immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, blocking the entry of Muslims and deporting the estimated 11 million people in the United States who entered the country illegally.  If he wins the race for the White House, Trump might need to invoke his own executive authority - as happened with Obama - if the U.S. Congress does not approve his proposals, which have sparked outrage at home and abroad.The current case is unlikely to provide any support for Trump's  proposal to bar Muslims, which legal experts say would face other legal hurdles because it targets people on the basis of religion.
But legal experts say it could help Trump if he seeks to block entry from certain countries under a provision of immigration law that gives the president the power to suspend entry of noncitizens whose entry ""would be detrimental to the interests of the United States."" That provision has previously only been used block entry of small groups of people, such as officials linked with foreign governments hostile to the United States. Applying it to entire countries could prompt a similar lawsuit to the one filed against Obama.Clinton could also seize on an Obama victory in the case, but her own immigration proposals are more modest. She has said that absent action by Congress to reform the system entirely, she would keep Obama's program in place and seek to expand on it.
Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress passes laws and the executive branch enforces them. In the immigration context, Congress has traditionally given the president considerable leeway to interpret how to implement the laws.NARROWER GROUNDS
The high court, evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, could decide the case on narrower grounds than the broad question of executive power. 
It could avoid touching on immigration law at all by finding that the states challenging Obama's proposal did not have legal standing to sue. The court could also split 4-4, which would leave in place the lower court decision blocking the plan but without setting any legal precedent.    U.S. presidents generally have discretion to enforce immigration law, but the plan's challengers said Obama exceeded the limits of his authority by setting up a program that would allow millions to gain temporary legal status and work permits. Critics say his plan was unlawful in part because it effectively granted relief from deportation to a much bigger class of people than had ever benefited from any similar programs in the past. Texas and 25 other states who filed suit said it was an unconstitutional abuse of power.Obama's lawyers told the Supreme Court that Obama was acting within the government's exercise of prosecutorial discretion to decide who to deport.

7	7	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-idUSKCN0Z50GC	Immigration, abortion, race rulings due at Supreme Court	"

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court is heading into its home stretch, with major rulings due by the end of the month on President Barack Obama's unilateral immigration plan, racial preferences in university admissions and a restrictive Texas abortion law.Producing decisive rulings has been complicated by the fact that the court has been down one justice since conservative Antonin Scalia died in February, leaving it evenly split with four conservatives and four liberals.The justices also are set to rule on whether to overturn Republican former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell's 2014 corruption conviction, one of the 13 cases yet to be decided.The court appeared divided along ideological lines when it heard arguments on April 18 over whether Democrat Obama exceeded his constitutional powers in bypassing the Republican-led Congress with a 2014 plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits.Twenty-six states led by Republican-governed Texas brought the lawsuit. A 4-4 ruling, which appeared to be one possibility after the arguments, would deal Obama a huge defeat because it would affirm a lower-court ruling invalidating the plan.
Split rulings do not set nationwide legal precedents, but a 4-4 decision would effectively kill Obama's immigration plan.The court also seemed split along ideological lines during March 2 arguments in a challenge to a Texas abortion law brought by abortion providers backed by the Obama administration.
A 4-4 ruling would deliver a victory to Texas because it would affirm a lower-court ruling upholding the law. Because such a ruling would set no nationwide precedent, it might not serve as a legal blueprint for other conservative, Republican-dominated states to enact similar laws.The question before the justices is whether the law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a woman's constitutional right to abortion as established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.
There cannot be a 4-4 ruling in a challenge by a white woman, enlisted by a conservative legal activist, to a University of Texas student admissions policy giving preferences to racial minorities in a program aimed at fostering campus racial diversity. Only seven justices heard that case.Liberal Elena Kagan, the Obama administration's solicitor general when it supported the university in earlier litigation, recused herself. That means four conservatives and three liberals will decide the case. Conservative justices expressed reservations about the affirmative action admissions policy during Dec. 9 arguments.

By Emily Stephenson

Republican Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States should consider more racial profiling, in response to a question about whether he supported greater law enforcement scrutiny of Muslim Americans after the Orlando mass shooting.""I think profiling is something that we're going to have to start thinking about as a country,"" Trump told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""You look at Israel and you look at others, and they do it and they do it successfully. And you know, I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense,"" he said when asked if he supported increased profiling of Muslims in America.Trump made similar comments last December about profiling, the targeting of specific demographic groups for extra scrutiny, after a Muslim American and his wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California.Last week, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, sparked criticism from many in his party for his comments on American Muslims after the Orlando attack on Sunday, in which a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub. In a speech on national security on Monday, Trump stood by his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and proposed a suspension of immigration from countries with ""a proven history of terrorism."" 
He also said the Muslim community had to ""cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad."" Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has said the comments show Trump is unfit to be president.The Florida gunman, Omar Mateen, was born in the United States to Afghan parents. During a three-hour siege at the club, he expressed support for Islamic State, but officials believe he was ""self-radicalized.""
In his interview on Sunday, Trump said there were ""red flags"" around Mateen, who had been investigated twice by the FBI but ultimately cleared. Trump also reiterated his support for more scrutiny of mosques, saying that could resemble a controversial New York City surveillance program that has been shut down. ""If you go to France right now, they're doing it in France. In fact, in some instances they're closing down mosques,"" he said.
Police in France closed some mosques shortly after gunmen aligned with Islamic State militants killed 130 people in Paris in a series of attacks on Nov. 13.House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan endorsed Trump but has said a Muslim ban is not in U.S. interests. In excerpts of an NBC interview released on Friday, Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, said Republicans weighing whether to vote for Trump should follow their ""conscience.""Trump brushed off the criticism on Sunday and said he would put up his own money for his campaign if needed. ""It would be nice if the Republicans stuck together,"" Trump said in an ABC interview. ""I can win, one way or another.""

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-guns-idUSKCN0Z50FO	Supreme Court may take action on state assault weapon bans	"

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court may weigh in this week on gun control, an issue smoldering again following the June 12 Orlando massacre, with the justices due to decide whether to hear a challenge by gun rights advocates to assault weapon bans in two states.The Connecticut and New York laws prohibit semiautomatic weapons like the one used by the gunman who fatally shot 49 people at a gay night club in Orlando in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.The Supreme Court will announce as soon as Monday whether it will hear the challenge brought by gun rights groups and individual firearms owners asserting that the laws violate the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guarantee of the right to bear arms.The court has not decided a major gun case since 2010. If they take up the matter, the justices would hear arguments in their next term, which begins in October. A decision not to hear the challenge would leave in place lower-court rulings upholding the laws.
The court's action in another recent appeal indicated it may be disinclined to take up the matter. The justices in December opted not to hear a challenge to a Highland Park, Illinois ordinance banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines.A national assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Congressional Republicans, backed by the influential National Rifle Association gun rights lobby, beat back efforts to restore it. Some states and municipalities have enacted their own bans.In their petition asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, those challenging the Connecticut law said the type of weapons banned by the state are used in self-defense, hunting and recreational shooting.
Connecticut said its law targets firearms disproportionately used in gun crime, ""particularly the most heinous forms of gun violence."" It said people in Connecticut still can legally own more than 1,000 types of handguns, rifles and shotguns.There is a longstanding legal debate over the scope of Second Amendment rights.
In the 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller case, the Supreme Court held for the first time that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individual's right to bear arms, but the ruling applied only to firearms kept in the home for self-defense. That ruling did not involve a state law, applying only to federal regulations.Two years later, in the case McDonald v. City of Chicago, the court held that the Heller ruling covered individual gun rights in states. (Editing by Will Dunham)"	['Heller']	['gay']
