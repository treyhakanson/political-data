By Steve Holland
| MIAMI

MIAMI Donald Trump was in the middle of creating another nickname for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton - ""Hillary Rotten Clinton!"" - when he suddenly thought of his mild-mannered vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence.""You think Mike Pence would say this?"" he smiled to the audience in Roanoke, Virginia. ""What a high-quality person.""On their first campaign swing together this week, Trump and Pence are giving voters an initial look at their odd-couple pairing as they prepare to battle against Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, the Virginia governor, in the Nov. 8 presidential election.Their public routine is a work in progress, but it's clear that they've learned from their first joint appearance, a sometimes awkward interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes.""In that session, Trump frequently talked over Pence and Pence went out of his way to wave off his differences with Trump on policies like his past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump wants to renegotiate.They now have a system: When they campaign together, Pence introduces Trump enthusiastically as the modern-day equivalent of 1980s Republican President Ronald Reagan and speaks of himself as the son of a combat veteran and the father of a U.S. Marine. Then he steps aside.The Trump-Pence union was a political marriage of necessity. The combustible, free-wheeling Trump needed the staid, staunchly conservative Pence, the governor of Indiana, to give him some credibility with establishment Republicans and a boost in the Midwest.The risks for Pence seem minimal and the upsides are huge. He opted out of the 2016 Republican presidential sweepstakes in the fallout over his fight over a religious freedom law in Indiana that critics said was anti-gay, and he faced a potentially difficult re-election race for governor.With his experience as a former member of Congress, he could serve as a conduit to lawmakers in a Trump administration, something that could be important for a presidential candidate who has never held elective office.
In the two weeks since he was named Trump's running mate, Pence has become a lightning rod for criticism from Democrats who portray him as holding extreme right-wing views.Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, described Pence as ""an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families.""WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE OFF
Pence seems to be still getting accustomed to Trump's worldview. While introducing Trump in Roanoke on Monday, he hewed closely to the establishment Republican position in criticizing Clinton for not doing more to ensure that a contingent of U.S. troops was left in Iraq after a U.S.-Iraqi agreement expired.
""Remember, it was Hillary Clinton who squandered the gains that were made at the close of our presence in Iraq, the failure in judgment that sent ISIS on the loose,"" Pence said in Roanoke, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group.That was at odds with Trump's view that the American invasion of Iraq was wrong. ""I didn't want to go to Iraq,"" Trump said moments after Pence spoke.Still, Pence's loyalty to Trump seems absolute. In his speech introducing Trump at their appearance before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday, Pence tried to show what Trump is like behind all the bluster.
""I know this man's heart,"" Pence said. ""I know the way he speaks, when the cameras are off.""Trump chose Pence over former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the two other finalists.Although Republican elites have been divided over Trump's presidential bid, many approve his choice in a No. 2.""Mike Pence is a good man. He will add value to the ticket,"" tweeted Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and one of Trump's former rivals for the nomination.Gingrich said via email that Pence is proving to be ""a good balance for Trump's powerful personality."" Trump himself jokingly brought up the vetting process that led him to Pence, describing a candidate who was squeaky clean compared to others whose background checks turned up ""many pages"" of materials.""With Mike, they came back with like nothing. He's the most perfect human being, this guy. I love him. Where is he? I love him,"" Trump said. (Editing by Leslie Adler)"

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama said it was possible that Russia  would try to influence the U.S. presidential election, after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts have attributed to Russian hackers.""Anything is possible,"" Obama told NBC News in an interview broadcast on Tuesday when asked if the Russians would try to influence the Nov. 8 election.Obama said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the leak on Friday of more than 19,000 DNC emails, which showed the committee had favored Hillary Clinton over  Senator Bernie Sanders for the party's presidential nomination.""I know that experts have attributed this to the Russians,"" Obama said.""What we do know is that the Russians hack our systems, not just government systems but private systems,"" he said.
The email leak forced Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida to resign as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.Clinton, who received the Democratic nomination on Tuesday at the party's convention in Philadelphia, will face Republican Donald Trump in the election.
""What the motives were in terms of the leaks, all that, I can't say directly. What I do know is that Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin,"" Obama  said.Trump has often praised Putin, calling him a ""strong leader."" The New York businessman also told the New York Times last week that with him in the White House, NATO might not automatically defend the Baltic states that were once part of the Russian-led Soviet Union.
""I think that Trump has gotten pretty favorable coverage back in Russia,"" Obama said. (Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Eric Walsh)"

By Bernie Woodall

United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said on Tuesday that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has assured him she would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement if she is elected president.Williams' comments come as Clinton is under pressure on international trade deals from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and supporters of her former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders.Clinton has previously said she wanted to rework NAFTA. Her campaign on Tuesday declined to comment on the meeting with Williams.Williams said he met with Clinton one-on-one prior to the union's endorsement of her in May, when Sanders was still in the race to be the Democratic party's nominee. The UAW has more than 400,000 members. ""She's committed to me that not only would (she) dig into NAFTA but she made every indication that she would sit down and try to redo NAFTA,"" Williams told reporters during a telephone press conference from Philadelphia, where he is attending the Democratic National Convention.
Williams said Clinton ""recognizes that NAFTA was not the success that it was supposed to be,"" when her husband, Bill Clinton, pushed for it as president two decades ago.Stephen Miller, senior policy adviser to the Trump campaign, said Hillary Clinton ""will never renegotiate Bill Clinton's NAFTA.""The Trump campaign adviser said, ""You can be certain when she was personally getting paid millions and millions by Wall Street and big banks to deliver secret speeches she wasn't breathing a word against globalist trade pacts."" 
NAFTA, which eliminated most tariffs on trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada, was promoted as a way to support economic growth by eliminating barriers to trade. Opponents say it has robbed Americans of jobs because it makes it easy for U.S. companies to move operations to Mexico where wages are much lower.  Williams said he hopes that an updated treaty would help foster stronger worker unions in Mexico, where many auto manufacturers have factories.
""She told us all that,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in an interview, referring to Clinton's assurances to labor unions that she would rework NAFTA.The AFL-CIO, a federation of unions which includes the UAW,  stayed neutral during the Democratic primary but endorsed Clinton in June once it was clear she would become the party's nominee. The UAW endorsed Clinton in May.Williams said that support among UAW members for a Trump presidency has fallen to about 19 percent from 28 percent last year, before Trump said that new automotive industry jobs could be placed in states without strong union support at lower wages than those earned by UAW members.

NEW YORK Democrats beat Republicans in U.S. television ratings, according to Nielsen data released on Tuesday for the first night of the Democratic National Convention.An estimated 26 million people watched Monday evening  between 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Eastern time, when first lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders were among the key speakers, Nielsen said. The data represents people watching across seven broadcast and cable TV networks. The total is about three million more TV eyes than for the first night of the Republican convention last week when White House contender Donald Trump's wife Melania was the keynote speaker.
All in all, some 23 million Americans watched the first night of the Republican convention last week - in line with the audience for the 2012 gathering. Trump's big acceptance speech on Thursday night last week, however, failed to deliver the record audiences many TV executives had been expecting.
In 2012, the Democratic convention generally drew more nightly TV viewers than the Republican gathering, when Mitt Romney was running for the White House.

By Julia Edwards and Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration announced a broad expansion on Tuesday of a program to let people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras enter the United States as refugees, and said Costa Rica agreed to temporarily shelter some of those with no other recourse.Under the plan, Costa Rica will host up to 200 applicants at a time deemed too vulnerable to remain in their homelands while the U.S. Department of Homeland Security evaluates them for possible resettlement, which could take up to six months.The United States will also expand a program for child refugees and allow some people to apply for refugee status in their home countries.The steps, after months of criticism of President Barack Obama's handling of the crisis, are modest in comparison to plans announced by Secretary of State John Kerry in January to open several refugee processing centers in the region.""Our current efforts to date have been insufficient to address the number of people who may have legitimate refugee claims,"" Amy Pope, deputy homeland security adviser at Obama's National Security Council, told a telephone briefing for reporters.Many details, including how the program would be financed or how many people might be eligible, were unavailable.Advocates said they were pleased the administration was  moving to provide the migrants, especially children, with an alternative to staying home with their lives at risk or relying on smugglers for the dangerous journey through Mexico.
""It's really the way the program should have been established from the start, but even belatedly we're happy to see that this is the direction that they're taking it,"" said Bill Frelick, director of the refugee rights program at Human Rights Watch.Since October, nearly 80,000 children and families from the three countries have been apprehended at the U.S. border with Mexico. The crisis has fueled heated debate on the campaign trail over whether to welcome migrants fleeing violence or build a wall to keep them out, a centerpiece of Republican Donald Trump's run for president.Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, called the plan an abuse of the law. ""Today's expansion of the Obama Administration's policy is simply a continuation of the government-sanctioned border surge,"" he said in a statement.The program also met resistance in the region. Guatemalan government officials rejected the description of those seeking to leave the country as refugees.
FAMILY REUNIFICATION
The administration also will expand its Central American Minors program, which allows those under 21 with a parent in the United States legally to seek refugee status. The program will now allow siblings, care givers or another parent to do so.Only 267 minors have entered the United States since the program began in December 2014. Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said 2,880 applicants have been approved and are awaiting resettlement.
The New York Times reported in January that the United States planned to admit up to 9,000 Central American refugees.Costa Rican Minister of the Presidency Sergio Alfaro told a news conference in San Jose the government reserved the ""explicit right"" to ask for more information if there were doubts about those granted the six-month humanitarian visas.Carlos Maldonado of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said the UNHCR and International Organization for Migration would handle costs incurred as applicants were processed in Costa Rica. If approved, they would most likely head to the United States, but could go to Canada, Sweden, Argentina, Brazil, Chile or Uruguay.Convincing countries to host a center has been difficult amid concern slow processing would lead to a backlog of people with nowhere to go, U.S. sources said. Nearly 8,000 Cubans migrating to the United States were stuck in Costa Rica recently when neighboring Nicaragua closed its border.Costa Rica's location is also a challenge. Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans seeking to move to the United States must travel south, across Nicaragua, to get there.

By Andrew Osborn and Dmitry Solovyov
| MOSCOW

MOSCOW The Kremlin dismissed as absurd on Tuesday allegations it was behind the hacking of U.S. Democratic Party emails, saying unidentified individuals were trying to cynically exploit fear of Russia for electoral purposes.It responded after cyber security experts and U.S. officials said there was evidence Russia had engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.The emails, released by activist group WikiLeaks at the weekend, appeared to show favouritism within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for Hillary Clinton and prompted the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.President Vladimir Putin has tried to avoid giving the impression he favours any U.S. candidate, but has hailed Republican Party nominee Donald Trump as being ""very talented"".Russian state TV, which hews closely to the Kremlin's world view, has left little doubt however that Moscow would prefer Trump. It casts Clinton, whom Putin accused of stirring up protests against him in her role as U.S. Secretary of State in 2011, as a warmonger.
""We are again seeing these maniacal attempts to exploit the Russian theme in the U.S. election campaign,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the leaked emails. ""This is not breaking new ground, this is an old trick which is being played again. This is not good for our bilateral relations, but we understand that we simply have to get through this unpleasant period.""
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier on Tuesday he had raised the hacking issue at a meeting in Laos with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. ""I don't want to use four-letter words,"" was Lavrov's only  response to reporters when asked whether Russia was responsible for the email hack.Earlier this month, Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, visited Moscow, where he gave a lecture complaining that Western governments had often had a hypocritical focus on democratisation in the post-Soviet world.
Analysts say the Kremlin would welcome a Trump win because the billionaire U.S. businessman has repeatedly praised Putin, spoken of wanting to get along with Russia, and has said he would consider an alliance with Moscow against Islamic State. Trump's suggestion he might abandon NATO's pledge to automatically defend all alliance members is also likely to have gone down well in Moscow, where the military alliance is cast as an outdated Cold War relic.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump posted a two-point lead over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, the first time he has been ahead since early May.Trump's gains came as he accepted his party's nomination to the Nov. 8 ballot at the four-day Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, and as Clinton's nomination in Philadelphia this week was marred by party divisions and the resignation of a top party official.MORE FROM REUTERS: Musk sees 'modest' capital raise for Tesla's next strategic turnClinton makes history with Democratic nomination for presidentBreakingviews: Hillary Clinton's one percent dilemma gets more awkward
The July 22-26 poll found that 39 percent of likely voters supported Trump, 37 percent supported Clinton and 24 percent would vote for neither. The poll had a credibility interval of 4 percentage points, meaning that the two candidates should be considered about even in support.Clinton held a three-point lead on Friday, which was also within the credibility interval.Clinton has solidly led Trump in the poll throughout most of the 2016 presidential race. The only times that Trump has matched her level of support were when the Republican Party appeared to be roughly aligned with his campaign.In early May, Trump briefly pulled even with Clinton after his remaining rivals for the party nomination dropped out of the running. He held a 0.3 percentage point lead over Clinton on May 9, the last time he was nominally ahead.
Trump fell back in the poll as he feuded with party bosses over comments he made about Hispanics, Muslims and immigrants, but he rebounded this month as his candidacy took the national spotlight at the Cleveland convention.The Democratic party is hoping for a similar boost during its convention this week in Philadelphia, but the confab had a rough start: the Wikileaks website released emails on Friday that enraged many voters who had supported Clinton's rival for the nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, showing that party officials had looked for ways to undermine his candidacy.The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, announced her resignation afterward.
On Monday, some speakers at the Democratic convention were booed by Sanders supporters, and hundreds of protesters took to the streets to protest Clinton's candidacy.Presidential candidates usually get a boost in popularity following their party conventions.In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney jumped by 5 percentage points to pull about even with President Barack Obama after the Republican convention. After the Democrats held their convention, Obama then rose by a few percentage points and again pulled ahead.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with about 962 likely voters.

By Toni Clarke

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration opened the door on Tuesday to a change in its blood donor deferral recommendations, which currently prohibit donations from gay men for a year following their last sexual encounter in order to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.In December the FDA overturned a 30-year ban on all blood donations from men who have sex with men, saying the change was based on science showing an indefinite ban was not necessary to prevent transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus.The FDA is now signaling it may go further.Gay rights advocates say the latest update did not go far enough and that the agency's recommendations should move closer to individual risk assessments, which could, for example, look at whether an individual has been in a monogamous relationship. Their criticism intensified in the wake of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June, which saw many gay men unable to donate blood even as blood banks put out calls for donors.In a notice posted to the Federal Register, the FDA said it was establishing a public docket for comment about its current recommendations and that interested people should submit comments, backed by scientific evidence, supporting alternative potential policies to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. 
Such suggestions ""could include the feasibility of moving from the existing time-based deferrals related to risk behaviors to alternate deferral options, such as the use of individual risk assessments.""The agency said it would take the comments into account ""as it continues to reevaluate and update blood donor deferral policies as new scientific information becomes available.""
The FDA's action comes after 115 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, led by Democrat Mike Quigley, vice chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, wrote to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf calling on him to end the current policy, saying it discriminated against men who have sex with men. A similar letter was signed by 22 senators.In a statement on Tuesday, Quigley said he was ""encouraged"" by the FDA's announcement.""The tragedy at Pulse nightclub in Orlando highlighted the discrimination gay and bisexual men face when attempting to donate blood to those in need,"" he said.
""Moving towards an individual risk assessment would provide for a fair, equitable, nondiscriminatory blood donation policy, one based in science that allows all healthy Americans to safely donate blood."" (Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

CHARLOTTE, N.C. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sought to turn a scandal involving the Veterans Administration to his political advantage on Tuesday, pledging to war veterans that he would clean up a mess he blamed on Washington politicians.""Our debt to you is eternal,"" Trump told a gathering of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Yet our politicians have totally failed you.""The 2014 VA scandal revolved around long wait times for patients and other negligent activities. Trump spoke shortly after the crowd heard from Bob McDonald, President Barack Obama's secretary of Veterans Affairs.The scandal fits in with Trump's effort to portray himself as a political outsider dedicated to fixing the problems left by Washington special interests.
""The VA scandals that have occurred are widespread and totally inexcusable,"" he said.Trump is on his first campaign swing with his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, after they were nominated last week at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
They made two stops in North Carolina, a state that could be crucial to their chances in the Nov. 8 election.The New York real estate developer pledged to set up a White House hot line for a ranking official to keep track of reform efforts in the VA to ensure they are carried out.
If a problem cannot get solved, he said, ""I will pick up the phone personally and get it completed and get it taken care of."" (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

| BUDAPEST

BUDAPEST Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Tuesday said the migration and foreign policy plans of U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump were ""vital"" for Hungary, whereas those of rival Democrat Hillary Clinton were ""deadly"". The outspoken conservative leader Orban is the first European head of state to express a clear preference for either of the two candidates, who will face each other in elections in November 2016.Orban has in the past upset fellow members of the European Union over policy, most recently with his tough stance on Europe's migrant crisis, objecting to EU resettlement plans and having a fence built along Hungary's southern border. Orban said the U.S. Democrats supported migration as well as what he described as ""democracy export"", while Hungary - like Trump - opposed both, ""making it clear where Hungary's interests lie.""
""The Democrats' foreign policy is bad for Europe, and deadly for Hungary,"" he said. ""The migration and foreign policy advocated by the Republican candidate, Mr Trump, is good for Europe and vital for Hungary.""Orban had on Saturday called Trump's security policies ""valiant."" His remarks came after Trump raised ire for telling the New York Times last week that he would tie any U.S. military help to NATO allies to conditions in the event of a Russian attack.Clinton's campaign struggles to contain the political fallout from a leak of thousands of emails in a hacker attack that they said were designed to help Trump. Experts and U.S. officials say the attack came from Russia.
Both Moscow and the Trump campaign have said those claims were ""absurd"".Orban's government has unnerved some partners with its close ties to Russia. It secured large business deals with Moscow, such as the construction of a big new nuclear power plant, and criticized the European Union's embargo on Russia.
""Hungary's foreign policy has borne an eerie resemblance to Russian diplomatic interests in recent years, and indeed has been little short of an extended arm of the Russian government in foreign policy matters,"" Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko said.""I don't think Putin is behind the budding relationship between Trump and Orban but both are interested in improving Russian ties so theirs is an alliance of interests.""
