BERLIN Germany's Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Sunday that talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a free trade deal being negotiated by the United States and the European Union, had essentially failed.""The negotiations with the USA have de facto failed because we Europeans did not want to subject ourselves to American demands,"" he said, according to a written transcript from German broadcaster ZDF of an interview due to be broadcast on Sunday.""Things are not moving on that front,"" said Gabriel, who is also Germany's vice chancellor.
The U.S. and the EU have been negotiating the TTIP for three years and both sides had sought to conclude talks in 2016 but they have differences over various issues, including agriculture.

Democrat Hillary Clinton on Saturday received her first national security briefing since accepting her party's nomination for the presidency last month.Clinton, a former secretary of state, attended the meeting alone, according to a pool report.The meeting was held at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in White Plains, New York, not far from the Chappaqua, New York, residence she shares with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. It lasted a little over two hours.
Clinton's Republican rival, New York businessman Donald Trump, recently received his first briefing, as well.The two are vying for the White House in the Nov. 8 general election, which has grown increasingly contentious as they have traded barbs about racism and minority voters.

By Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton called on Friday for voters to reject the ""bigotry"" of Donald Trump's White House campaign, releasing a television ad criticizing his efforts to appeal to black voters and saying she was reaching out to people from all parties who are troubled by his candidacy.The ad shows video of Trump's controversial pitch to black voters, in which the Republican candidate urges them to support him by asking, ""What do you have to lose?"" It also shows headlines about a racial discrimination lawsuit the New York real estate mogul faced in the 1970s.Clinton's presidential campaign said the ad, released a day after she gave a speech accusing Trump of fueling America's ""radical fringe,"" would air in the hotly contested states of Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.Polls give Clinton a wide margin over Trump among Hispanic voters, but he is on a pitch to reduce her advantage by stressing he would create jobs for all.Trump pressed on with trying to broaden his appeal to minority voters on Friday, as he met with Hispanic business leaders at his signature hotel in Las Vegas.""We've been doing very, very well with the Latinos. We've been doing amazing, far, far greater ... than anyone understands. They want to see jobs come in, we're going to bring jobs. They want to see things happen,"" Trump said.He said the country's GDP growth rate of 1.1 percent in the second quarter was not a good sign for the U.S. economy. ""The country has some very, very serious problems,"" he said.Clinton, meanwhile, followed up on Thursday's tough speech by saying that Trump's temperament and divisiveness made him unfit for the White House.
""I am reaching out to everyone, Republicans, Democrats, independents, everyone who is as troubled as I am by the bigotry and divisiveness of Donald Trump's campaign,"" she told MSNBC, adding she was asking ""fair-minded Americans to repudiate this kind of divisive demagoguery"" at the Nov. 8 election.Clinton attacks came during a difficult week for her campaign, as the release of new emails from her time as secretary of state revived criticism of her decision to use a private address and server rather than a government one.The emails also stoked scrutiny of her family's charitable foundation, including accusations that major corporate and foreign donors gave money in hopes of securing more access to then-Secretary Clinton. Her campaign says no donors received any special favors.Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told MSNBC Clinton was only talking about Trump and race this week to deflect attention from that controversy.    
Trump countered her rhetoric on Friday by releasing a video showing Clinton in the 1990s discussing a crime bill and referring to ""super-predators,"" or at-risk youth she said needed to be brought under control. The video also shows U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's main opponent in the Democratic primary this year, calling that phrase a ""racist term.""CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS
In targeting what she terms Trump's bigotry, Clinton hopes to remind voters of controversial statements he has made over the course of the campaign. Those include describing some Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, suggesting a judge could not be fair because of his Mexican-American heritage, and proposing a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to combat terrorism.
Trump has tried to sidestep these dust-ups by saying Democrats have failed minorities with their economic policies, leaving them living in poverty and attending failing schools.Jennifer Hochschild, a professor at Harvard University who focuses on race and immigration, said she did not think Trump could fix his relationship with black and Hispanic voters.""General cluelessness about racial dynamics will diminish any possible black support that comes from Trump's emphasis on job creation,"" Hochschild said in an email. ""And Clinton has a lot of deep roots among black politicians.""Trump also has been criticized for vowing to deport millions of people living in the United States illegally. In recent days, he had appeared to hold out the possibility of toning down his hardline stance, although his precise plans on immigration have been harder to pin down.On Thursday, he denied he would loosen his proposed immigration restrictions.

NEW YORK U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads her Republican rival Donald Trump by 5 percentage points among likely voters, down from a peak this month of 12 points, according to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released on Friday.DON'T MISS:Not enough money for a 'real' coffins in VenezuelaCarl Icahn says he didn't sell Herbalife shares Burkini controversy goes on in France
The Aug. 22-25 opinion poll found that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, while 36 percent supported Trump. Some 23 percent would not pick either candidate and answered ""refused,"" ""other"" or ""wouldn't vote.""Clinton, a former secretary of state, has led real estate developer Trump in the poll since Democrats and Republicans ended their national conventions and formally nominated their presidential candidates in July. Her level of support has varied between 41 and 45 percent during that period, and her lead over Trump in the tracking poll peaked this month at 12 percentage points on Tuesday.During the past week, Clinton has been dogged by accusations by Trump, which she has denied, that donations to her family's charitable foundation influenced her actions while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Questions have also surfaced again about her use of a private email server and address rather than a government one during her period at the State Department.
Meanwhile, Trump and Clinton also sparred over who would be a better advocate for African Americans and other minorities, and Trump hinted he could soften his hard-line stance on immigration. In a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that includes candidates from small, alternative parties, Clinton leads the field by a smaller margin. Some 39 percent of likely voters supported Clinton in the four-way poll, compared with 36 percent for Trump, 7 percent for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 3 percent for Green Party nominee Jill Stein.
Both polls were conducted online in English in all 50 states. They included 1,154 likely voters and have a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.The results may differ from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which includes a separate weekly tracking poll that measures support for the major party candidates in every state and Washington D.C.The States of the Nation, released on Wednesday, estimated that if the election were held now Clinton would have a 95 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 108 votes in the Electoral College, the body that decides the election through a count of the candidates' wins in each state.

By Dave McKinney
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner urged lawmakers on Friday to allow voters in 2018 to decide whether to change how political boundaries are drawn after the state's Supreme Court a day earlier declared a petition-driven redistricting initiative for this fall's statewide ballot unconstitutional.Rauner called Illinois' existing political maps, which are drawn by Democrats who control the General Assembly, ""rigged and gerrymandered"" because they have left a majority of legislative races this fall without challengers to incumbent legislators.""Our system of government is broken,"" Rauner told reporters during a stop in Marion, in far southern Illinois. ""Two-thirds of our general elections don't have opponents, and we've got to change the system.""The next opportunity for state legislators to put a constitutional amendment before voters comes in two years, when the first-term governor is expected to be in the midst of a re-election campaign.
""Our system has been run by a broken, powerful political machine in Chicago that looks out for itself, not for the people of Illinois, and certainly not for the people of southern Illinois,"" Rauner said. ""We've got to get the power away from that machine, and we can do it with political reform.""Rauner's comments came less than 24 hours after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to uphold a lower court ruling that would keep in place the once-a-decade, partisan-controlled political mapmaking process that has allowed for Democratic majorities in the state legislature and on the elected Supreme Court.
The amendment, if it was placed on November's ballot and passed by a majority of Illinois voters, would have transferred the power of re-drawing legislative districts to a bipartisan commission. More than 563,000 Illinois voters signed petitions backing the amendment. There were 12 redistricting amendments filed in both chambers during the current legislative session though none won approval in both chambers.
The Illinois Supreme Court ruled the ballot initiative fell outside the scope of permissible ballot initiatives, which may only be used for amendments directed at ""structural and procedural subjects"" in the constitution pertaining to Illinois's legislative branch.In a dissenting opinion, Justice Robert Thomas wrote: ""Today a muzzle has been placed on the people of this State, and their voices supplanted by judicial fiat.""

By Chris Prentice

Maine Governor Paul LePage apologized on Friday for an obscenity-laced voicemail he left for a lawmaker who he believed had called him a racist for remarks he made about drug dealers. The incident followed a town hall meeting on Wednesday during which LePage said he kept a binder with photographs of drug dealers arrested in Maine and more than 90 percent of them were black or Hispanic, the Portland Press Herald reported. The governor's remarks triggered a barrage of criticism from political figures and the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. LePage left the voicemail message for State Representative Drew Gattine after a television reporter said the lawmaker was among several people who had called the governor a racist.According to a recording of the message obtained by the Portland Press Herald, LePage said in the message, ""Mr. Gattine, this is Gov. Paul Richard LePage. I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker. I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I'm a racist.  ""I've spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You ... I need you to, just friggin. I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you."" 
The governor later told local reporters that he wished he could settle the dispute with Gattine by means of an armed duel.Gattine did not respond immediately to calls for comment.     He told the Press Herald that LePage's voicemail was ""uncalled for"" and that he never said the governor was a racist.An editorial in the Press Herald, speaking for the state's voters, said Maine apologized to America for electing, then re-electing a ""governor who is unfit for high office.""
After the voicemail became public, LePage issued a statement apologizing to Maine citizens for calling Gattine ""the worst word [he] could think of"" in the voicemail.The governor defended his choice of language by saying the remarks were ""simply a metaphor"" that harkens back to the 1820s when political opponents ""used to call each other out.""""I meant no physical harm to Gattine,"" LePage said in the statement. 
It is not the first time LePage has found himself the subject of controversy.Earlier this year, he said that drug dealers ""come up here, they sell their heroin and they go home. Incidentally, half the time, they impregnate a young white girl before they leave.""He later said the comment was a ""slip-up"" and that he meant to say that drug traffickers get ""young Maine girls"" pregnant and that most residents of Maine are white.Also in January, LePage told Maine gun owners they should ""load up and get rid of the drug dealers.""

By Jeff Mason
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON When Barack Obama became the first African-American to win the White House in 2008, his victory was a turning point in U.S. race relations that set high expectations for progress to come.Nearly eight years later, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton attacking each other over racial politics, the legacy of Obama's presidency looks decidedly mixed, black leaders said.To some, the tone of the Republican presidential nominee's campaign, as well as a recent series of racially charged shootings involving police, show that the United States has come no closer to overcoming its history of racial strife.Having a black president, two attorneys general and a chief of homeland security did not result in basic fairness for victims of racially charged violence, said Cornel West, an academic and former Obama supporter who has become a high-profile critic of the Democratic president. ""How many policemen who have murdered unarmed innocent black civilians have gone to jail with that kind of black power at the top? Zero,"" West said.Obama could have acted more directly while in office to help blacks, West added, citing persistently high childhood poverty among African-Americans. ""The (economic) recovery has not filtered over into black and working poor communities,"" he said.Others said Obama showed leadership on race while making real achievements on healthcare and the economy that helped Americans of all ethnicities.Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader with close ties to the White House, described Obama as a ""transformative"" president held back by the need to serve varying constituencies and compromise with lawmakers who had different priorities.""He tried to be as balanced and respectful as he could, to the chagrin of many in the black community, who felt that he was leaning over backwards,"" Sharpton said.
Unemployment among African-Americans fell by half under Obama, Sharpton noted, while Obama's remarks on race elevated the issue. In 2012 at the White House, Obama referred to Trayvon Martin, a black youth gunned down by a white Hispanic man, as a boy who would have resembled the son he did not have.""We've never had a president do that,"" Sharpton said.FALSE SENSE OF PROGRESS

Andrew Young, a former Atlanta mayor, congressman, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and adviser to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., said Obama, as a black leader, had to seek compromise more than previous white presidents.""It was easier for (Jimmy) Carter or Lyndon Johnson, even Bill Clinton as southern whites to do things specifically for black people,"" Young said.Backlash from white working class voters had contributed to Trump's rise, Young said.""We really haven't had a complete psychological adjustment to a multi-racial society,"" he said. ""That's what's rallying people behind Trump. They're frustrated by the complexities of this day and age. And (Trump), like others, gives a simple answer and blames it on somebody else.""Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, blasted Trump on Thursday as a divisive candidate who was stoking racist groups. Trump criticized Clinton, saying she had let black Americans down and was falsely labeling Republicans as bigoted.
Clinton supporters were more likely to want to address race relations than Trump supporters, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll of more than 2,800 people found in late March.Obama has said race relations are not as bad as some suggest. Friends say he never expected his presidency to wipe away centuries of racism and slavery's legacy.""To expect to erase all of that legacy of injustice or racism and discrimination in eight years is unrealistic,"" said Valerie Jarrett, a White House adviser and close Obama friend.""Were there people who probably had a false sense of progress based just on an election? Sure,"" she said.The administration wants to advance criminal justice reform legislation before Obama leaves office, aiming for a win on an issue watched closely in the black community. But prospects of passage in Congress during an election year are uncertain. Obama, who has made clear his disdain for Trump and his frustration with Congress, has said he hoped his own voice on race would help improve things for future generations. ""We plant seeds, and somebody else maybe sits under the shade of the tree that we planted,"" Obama said at a news conference in July.

WASHINGTON When President Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, the federal appeals court based in Virginia was known as one of the most conservative benches in the country.Two Obama terms later, Democratic appointees hold a 10-5 majority on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a panel of which issued a groundbreaking ruling this April backing transgender rights.FACTBOX: Cases where Obama judges left a markThe shift to the left on the court, which hears cases from Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina, highlights a widely overlooked aspect of Obama's legacy.His appointments of dozens of judges to the country's influential federal appeals courts have tilted the judiciary in a liberal direction that will influence rulings for years to come and be further entrenched if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins this November's presidential election.MORE FROM REUTERSElection 2016 LIVE: Who is the better president for minority voters?

When seeking to appoint judges, the White House has said it is looking for highly credentialed lawyers reflecting the diversity of U.S. society. Conservative critics say he has picked judges who are willing to circumvent the law in order to reach preferred outcomes.
""There's no question President Obama's nominees have absolutely been part of his effort to transform the country and move it dramatically to the left,"" said Carrie Severino, a conservative legal activist.White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement that Obama's appointees ""all share impeccable qualifications, unquestioned integrity, and a steadfast commitment to equal justice under the law.""The appeals courts are the first stop for any case appealed from the lower U.S. district courts and often have the last word. The next and final destination is the Supreme Court, but it hears fewer than 100 cases a year. The appeals courts handle 35,000 a year according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.Of the 13 appeals courts, nine now have a majority of Democratic appointees, compared with one when Obama took office, according to research carried out by Russell Wheeler, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.In addition to appointing two Supreme Court justices and dozens of district court judges, Obama appointments now make up 55 of the current 168 appeals court judges, according to the judiciary. Obama's current total of 323 district and appeals court appointments, most of them district court judges, is similar to the tallies achieved by other recent two-term presidents.The regional appeals courts are currently more powerful than ever because of the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, which has left the court divided equally between liberals and conservatives. If the ideologically divided court splits 4-4, the appeals court ruling is left intact. Such an outcome occurred four times in the Supreme Court term that recently ended.
Scalia's seat is unlikely to be filled until next year due to political opposition from Republicans in the Senate, which has the job of confirming nominees. COURTS TRANSFORMED
One of the most dramatic transformations has been on the 4th Circuit.In July 2007, 18 months before Obama became president, Republican appointees held a 7-5 majority. Through a mix of seven Obama appointments and retirements, Democratic appointees now hold sway.In April, a three-judge panel featuring two Obama appointees ruled in favor of a transgender student seeking to use a boys' restroom. The two Obama appointees were in the majority, with a Republican appointee dissenting.
Three months later, a three-judge panel featuring two Obama appointees and one judge appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton struck down North Carolina's strict voter identification law on a 3-0 vote, saying the state legislature had enacted it with discriminatory intent.It is one of several recent court rulings pushing back on Republican-led efforts to impose new voting regulations, which Democrats say is intended to deter minorities from voting.Caroline Fredrickson, president of liberal legal group the American Constitution Society, said Republican-appointed judges are generally less likely to rule in favor of broad interpretations of civil rights. The transgender case would ""very likely"" have come out differently with a more conservative panel of judges, she said.The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. is another where the balance of power has been flipped. Often known in legal circles as the second highest court in the land because it hears important cases concerning the federal government, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was dominated by conservatives 6-3 when Obama took office.Obama was able to force through four appointments after a major showdown in the Senate. The court now has a 7-4 split in favor of Democratic appointees.In June, an Obama appointee, Judge Sri Srinivasan, cast the deciding vote as a three-judge panel upheld the Federal Communication Commission's so-called ""net neutrality"" regulation. Srinivasan joined a Clinton appointee in the majority. A judge appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan dissented. The regulation is widely opposed by the telecommunications industry and backed by digital rights advocates.Obama's appointees do sometimes vote in favor of conservative outcomes. Paul Watford, a judge on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has on several occasions reached a different conclusion to his more liberal colleagues. In one recent decision from Aug. 15, he dissented along with conservative judges when the court ruled that a death row inmate should be able to file a new appeal.When announcing three of his nominees to the appeals court in Washington at a White House press conference in June 2013, Obama rejected any notion that they were political pawns, emphasizing their strong credentials.""These are no slouches. These are no hacks,"" he said. (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; editing by Stuart Grudgings.)"	['Schultz', 'Clinton', 'Russell', 'Lawrence', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]

By Timothy Gardner
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration proposed a rule on Friday aimed at attracting thousands of immigrant entrepreneurs to start companies in the United States. The rule, proposed by the Department of Homeland Security, would ease the ability of startup founders to build companies if they have significant funding from U.S. investors.The administration hopes the rule will be completed before President Barack Obama's term ends on Jan. 20.The proposed rule is part of Obama's commitment to ""attracting the world's best and brightest entrepreneurs to start the next great companies here,"" Tom Kalil, a technology policy adviser at the White House, told reporters in a call.
Kalil said immigrants have co-founded as many as one in four high-tech startups across the United States and more than half of all startups in Silicon Valley. Immigration has been a crucial issue in the 2016 presidential campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Republican candidate Donald Trump has vowed to toughen immigration policies, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed creating an office of immigrant affairs to expand Obama's efforts to help immigrants integrate better into the country. 
Under the rule, DHS would issue temporary permission for entrepreneurs to live in the United States if they have at least 15 percent ownership in startup companies formed in the country within the past three years. The companies must have investment of at least $345,000 from qualified U.S. investors. The administration expects about 3,000 immigrants would apply for the temporary permission, known as parole.Max Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal and other companies who was born in Ukraine, said the proposed rule is a ""great, concrete step toward creating more jobs in America and more success stories.""
Many entrepreneurs are educated at prestigious U.S. universities, but find themselves unable to stay in the country  because they lose visa lotteries or can't afford to sponsor themselves through an existing investor visa program.""We lose and will continue to lose talented, skilled, well educated scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs because they are simply not allowed to stay and work after we educated them to very high standards,"" Levchin said. ""It makes very little sense."" (Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by James Dalgleish)"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Gardner', 'Obama']	[]

BERLIN Paul Wolfowitz, a Republican adviser to former U.S. President George W. Bush, plans to vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November presidential election despite his ""serious reservations"", Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday.Wolfowitz, who served as deputy defense secretary under Bush and also as president of the World Bank, said he viewed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a security risk because of his admiration of Russian President Putin and his views on China, the magazine reported.""It's important to make it clear how unacceptable he is,"" the magazine quoted Wolfowitz as saying in an interview.Wolfowitz joins a long list of Republicans who have said they will not vote for Trump.""I wish there was a candidate whom I could support enthusiastically. I will have to vote for Hillary Clinton, although I have serious reservations about her,"" he said.A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed that Clinton would win the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, and have a 95 percent chance of beating Trump if the election were held now.
Wolfowitz rejected a common description of him as a key architect of the 2003 U.S. war against Iraq, saying that if he had truly been the architect many things would have gone differently, the magazine reported.Wolfowitz said the goal had been to free the country, not occupy it, creating tensions with many Iraqis.
He also defended the decision to invade Iraq, saying it was based on intelligence that later turned out to be faulty.""Of course we would have proceeded differently if we had known that Saddam Hussein was not stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, but was only planning to do so,"" he said. ""We would not have invaded.""In an interview with Vanity Fair magazine in May 2003, several months after the invasion, he suggested there were multiple reasons for it, but the Bush administration highlighted Iraq's supposed WMD as the justification for the war as the most politically convenient.
""For bureaucratic reasons, we settled on one issue, weapons of mass destruction, because it was the one reason everyone could agree on,"" he said at the time.(This version of the story has been refiled to correct typo in second paragraph) (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; editing by Ralph Boulton)"	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
