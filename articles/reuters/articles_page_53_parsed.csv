By Jessica Toonkel and Amanda Becker
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON This year's presidential election might be the perfect microcosm of Twitter's woes.        While some of the most memorable moments of the campaign for the White House have played out on the platform, Twitter has been unable to turn the attention and activity into ad dollars or user growth.     Well suited to quick updates on a noisy and unpredictable campaign, Twitter has been the dominant social media platform in 2016 for candidates, pundits and journalists. Republican nominee Donald Trump's frequent tweeting of tirades against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, fellow Republicans and the media have been a mainstay of the campaign, setting off furious online debate. But Twitter Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto acknowledged when the company reported its quarterly earnings Thursday that the election has had ""no noticeable impact"" on Twitter's user growth, which analysts say is essential for boosting revenue.    Campaigns and political organizations told Reuters that Twitter is simply not a great medium for political advertising.It is not as effective as rival Facebook at targeting crucial independent voters, and high-profile Twitter users like Trump and Clinton can use it as a megaphone without buying any advertising. ""We haven't really used Twitter, largely because our core mission is to reach those undecided voters,"" said Alixandria Lapp, executive director of the House Majority PAC, which supports Democratic U.S. House of Representatives candidates.            A flood of hate speech and misinformation, which Twitter has done little to tamp down, can also be a barrier to ad buys, campaign digital strategists said.         
Facebook has emerged as the social media ad platform of choice. It reaches about 94 percent of voters who are registered as independent or are not affiliated with a political party; Twitter only reaches 45 percent of these voters, according to data of mobile users by tracking service Comscore Inc. Vincent Harris, an Austin-based digital strategist who has worked for U.S. Senator Rand Paul and does some work for Trump,     estimated that about 30 percent of his clients' budgets are spent on Facebook, while only 5 percent are spent on Twitter. A recent survey conducted by his company Harris Media found that 81.6 percent of voters said they spent time on Facebook in the last month, while only 28.7 percent spent time on Twitter.""MINUTE-TO-MINUTE""

As Clinton digital strategist Teddy Goff put it, Twitter is the ""place to be for obsessively tracking the minute-to-minute of this election"" but ""Facebook is a much purer platform for message dissemination and talking about the issues voters care about.""Doug Watts, the national executive director of the pro-Trump Committee for American Sovereignty Super PAC, said: ""We use Facebook the most, partially because of the scale, but also when you are talking conservative politics, they have an older audience that fits our target."" Twitter, he said, is ""not really for advertising per se.""The Trump campaign has promoted tweets and placed ad content, said Jessica Ditto, a campaign spokeswoman. But she said it is difficult to use Twitter to collect donations and email addresses because promoted content does not typically get a lot of clicks.The perception is a costly one for Twitter. Elections often provide a big financial boost for advertising platforms such as television and radio stations.     In the 2016 contest, CNN has taken in $100 million more than expected due to intense interest in the election, according to David Folkenflik, National Public Radio's media reporter.
But on Twitter's earnings call on Thursday, CFO Noto said:     ""We really need to have a (presidential) debate on Twitter every day for it to meaningfully improve the quarterly metrics.""Some advertisers have tried to take advantage of Twitter's central role in the election. Earlier this month, Harris used Twitter to promote a digital campaign that was launched by the conservative anti-immigration group Secure America Now.     More common, though, is the way Clinton operatives use Twitter to engage with what Goff described as a ""politically attuned audience.""    The Clinton campaign collects automated donations via its Troll Trump tool, which asks supporters to pledge a small amount to the campaign every time Trump sends a tweet.The feature is now bringing in $1,588 per tweet, at an average of $11,823 per day, the campaign said.       After Trump called Clinton a ""nasty woman"" during a  presidential debate, her female supporters co-opted the term on Twitter, using #NastyWoman to show their support.  Representative Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, tweeted: ""From one #NastyWoman to another, you were an inspiration last night."" Women's health provider Planned Parenthood tweeted this week that ""Early voting shows a surge of #NastyWomen at the polls - and we're just getting started.""

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Two aides in charge of running Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign were taken aback as news broke in March 2015 of Clinton's use of private email for her work as U.S. secretary of state, according to stolen emails published on Thursday by WikiLeaks.The late-night exchange between Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, and John Podesta, the campaign chairman, happened within hours of the New York Times breaking the news that Clinton exclusively used a private email account in a way that may have broken records rules.""Did you have any idea of the depth of this story?"" Podesta wrote to Mook at 10:27 p.m. on the night the Times story appeared online, according to an exchange published by WikiLeaks.A few hours later, at 1:32 a.m., Mook wrote back: ""Nope. We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of."" The exchange took place hours before the Associated Press reported for the first time the following morning that Clinton's email system was run off a private server Clinton kept in the basement of her home in Chappaqua, New York.The exchange appears to show that even Clinton's most senior aides were initially unprepared for the scale of revelations about Clinton's email practices, which would end up dogging her campaign all the way through to the final weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 election. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, remains the front-runner in opinion polls over Republican opponent Donald Trump.Many voters have pointed to the unauthorized email system, which stymied attempts by the public to seek Clinton's emails through open-records laws, as a reason they find Clinton untrustworthy. Trump has repeatedly attacked her over her emails, saying Clinton should be in prison because she sent and received classified government secrets through the server. 
After a yearlong investigation, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said in July that Clinton and her staff were ""extremely careless"" with classified information, but that no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges.The same night of the Mook-Podesta exchange, Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton confidante, wrote to Podesta to express her frustration, according to other emails stolen from Podesta's account and published in daily batches this month by WikiLeaks, a publishing organization that advocates extreme government transparency.""Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago?"" Tanden wrote, criticizing Cheryl Mills, a lawyer working for Clinton and Clinton's former chief of staff at the State Department. ""So crazy.""Podesta replied with a single word: ""Unbelievable.""
""I guess I know the answer,"" Tanden, an outside adviser who does not have a formal role in the campaign, responded. ""They wanted to get away with it."" Podesta also suggests in the exchange that other Clinton aides withheld information about the emails, although it is unclear if he meant from the public or other colleagues.""Speaking of transparency, our friends Kendall, Cheryl and Phillipe sure weren't forthcoming on the facts here,"" Podesta wrote. David Kendall is another lawyer working for Clinton, and Philippe Reines, whose first name Podesta appeared to have misspelled, is a Clinton adviser who handled her news coverage at the State Department.
Tanden did not respond to questions.Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, declined to comment on the exchanges, saying the campaign was not confirming the authenticity of the emails. It has not pointed to any instances of doctored messages. He criticized Trump for supporting WikiLeaks, which Caplin said was ""weaponizing"" the emails he said were hacked by the Russian government.""Every American, regardless of party, should be concerned by this national security issue,"" he said in a statement. Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said this month the accusation his government is behind a spate this year of stolen emails from Democratic Party operatives was ""flattering"" but without proof.Nearly five months after the news of Clinton's private email first broke, Tanden again wrote to Podesta to link the arrangement to unfavorable public polling that week.""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email?"" she wrote. ""And has that person been drawn and quartered?"" (Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Allen', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Andy Sullivan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. voting rights advocates scored a string of courtroom victories this year that rolled back some of the nation's most restrictive voting laws. Now they face another challenge: making sure those rulings are not undermined by officials who oversee elections at the local level.With early voting already under way ahead of the Nov. 8 election, local officials in several states are trying to enforce restrictions that have been suspended or struck down in court, civil rights advocates say. In some cases, the action appears to be the result of bureaucratic confusion. In other cases, they appear to be actively resisting the law.""There are still too many places where voting is going to be difficult and confusing, not easy and straightforward,"" said Leah Aden, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.The foot-dragging by local officials adds another element of uncertainty to what already promises to be a volatile election.The Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that states with a history of racial discrimination don't have to win approval from the U.S. Justice Department when they want to change the way they conduct elections - the first time the Deep South will be free of federal oversight since 1964. That same ruling has also hobbled the Justice Department's ability to dispatch observers to potentially troublesome spots, raising concerns that it will be harder to deal with any problems that unfairly stop voters from casting their ballots. Voters in 14 states will also face new voting restrictions, from scaled-back early voting hours to photo-identification requirements, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. Roughly 10 percent of eligible voters do not have a government-issued photo ID, including a disproportionate share of minority, poor, student and elderly voters.Republican state legislators who have passed laws paving the way for these changes say they are needed to fight voter fraud. Numerous studies of the issue, however, suggest there is scant evidence of voter fraud in past elections. One study by Justin Levitt, a Loyola University law professor who now heads the Justice Department's voting rights section, found only 31 cases of voter impersonation out of more than 1 billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014. 
COURT VICTORIES
Voting rights advocates have managed to roll back some of those restrictions in Texas, North Carolina, North Dakota, Kansas, Ohio and Wisconsin, potentially making it easier for millions of people to vote in states that have the potential to determine the outcome of the election.Not all court challenges have been successful. Civil rights groups in Arizona have failed to defeat a new law that makes it illegal for them to collect absentee ballots by hand, a popular practice in Hispanic and Native American neighborhoods. Republican legislators said the law was needed to combat fraud, though they could cite no examples.""Now if I go help a neighbor of mine and I take his ballot for him I can serve a year in prison. That's really scary,"" said Antonio Valdovinos, who heads La Machine, a Hispanic activist group.
In other states, local officials in some of those states have resisted putting those rulings into effect. After a federal judge ruled that Texas' stringent photo-ID law discriminated against black and Hispanic voters, state officials agreed to allow voters who have trouble getting a drivers' license or other approved ID card to provide other forms of identification, such as a utility bill.But in September, the same judge found the state had not properly told voters about the loosened requirements and ordered the state to rewrite voter education materials. ""ON THE PRECIPICE""

With early voting under way, poll workers in at least seven counties in Texas are still posting misleading signs that tell voters they must provide a photo ID, according to the Texas Civil Rights Project, a coalition of grassroots groups. Officials at the state and the county level say they are in the process of updating posters and educating workers about the new rules, which have been in place since August. In Wisconsin, clerks in many state offices have refused to issue voting cards to people who don't have the documents necessary to get a photo ID, despite a court order requiring them to do so, activists say. A federal judge found earlier this month that the state had not done enough to tell its employees, as well as voters, about the ruling. In some cases state officials have only agreed to comply after months of wrangling.In Kansas, Secretary of State Kris Kobach - a leading proponent of stricter voter identification requirements - refused for months to comply with a May court ruling that ordered him to restore the voting rights of 18,000 residents who had been kept off registration lists because they did not provide proof of U.S. citizenship. He gave in last month, when he was threatened with contempt of court.   ""We think we've won these cases, we get the good legal ruling, but the implementation is where the actual details are,"" said Dale Ho, head of the American Civil Liberties Union's voting rights project.On top of that, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has encouraged his supporters to patrol voting sites to look for possible signs of fraudulent voting, raising fears that his supporters might try to intimidate black, Hispanic and Muslim voters. ""We are on the precipice of the most chaotic election for people of color in 50 years,"" said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of more than 200 national rights groups.

By Andrew Cawthorne
| CARACAS

CARACAS In a curious convergence of events on the same day last week, four Venezuelan provincial courts issued identical rulings, state governors quickly hit Twitter to celebrate, then the election board emailed a short but bombshell statement.Opposition hopes for a referendum to recall President Nicolas Maduro were dashed, on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive. The vote was off.For many in the opposition, that settled a years-old debate about the nature of Venezuela's socialist government, uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship.Their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the South American OPEC member of 30 million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis.""Can anyone in the world now really doubt that Venezuela is living in tyranny?"" said housewife Mabel Pinate, 62, dressed in white among thousands of protesters who took to the streets against Maduro on Wednesday.""We are sick of this. It's time to toughen up and do what we must to save Venezuela,"" added Pinate, whose husband was fired from state oil company PDVSA by Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez and whose two children have gone abroad.After pinning its hopes on a referendum this year - which could have triggered a presidential election and put them in power after 17 years of leftist rule - the enraged opposition Democratic Unity coalition has taken its gloves off.It is holding a symbolic political trial of Maduro in the legislature, organizing daily street protests, and shunning talks with the government that had been announced by the Vatican for this weekend. Recalling tactics that led to a short-lived coup against Chavez in 2002 and a shutdown of the oil industry, the coalition has also called for a general strike on Friday and a march to the Miraflores presidential palace next week. ""We've reached the limit,"" said Henrique Capriles, a usually moderate opposition leader, calling the government ""Satan.""""Does the opposition have anything to negotiate with the government? Nothing. Why does the government want dialogue? Because the water has risen to its neck,"" he said. Some hardliners, most notably veteran activist Maria Corina Machado and jailed protest leader Leopoldo Lopez' wife Lilian Tintori, are calling for Gandhi-style civil disobedience. 
'I FEAR NOBODY'
The government is vowing an iron fist.It says well-known troublemakers, who were behind the 2002 putsch, are again seeking a coup against an elected government, with the help of the United States and compliant foreign media.""I fear nobody and nothing!"" Maduro told red-shirted supporters at one of his daily rallies and TV appearances this week.The ruling Socialist Party's No. 2, Diosdado Cabello said any companies heeding the strike call would be seized by workers and the military. ""We're not going to allow craziness.""
Long proud of its democratic credentials after winning numerous elections under Chavez, the ruling Socialist Party says it is the opposition flouting Venezuela's democracy given that independent institutions shot down the referendum.Officials also argue that the very existence of protests and virulent public criticism of Maduro prove democracy is alive and well in Venezuela.Maduro insists the referendum decision was made by independent judges and electoral officials based on technical criteria, and denies the Socialist Party had any sway over the result. But critics say both the judiciary and electoral council have long been in the government's pocket.The Supreme Court has repeatedly shot down legislation  passed by the opposition-dominated Congress while interpreting the constitution to favor the executive branch and limit the reach of lawmakers.And the elections council has steadily shifted the requirements for requesting the recall vote.Maduro would have faced probable defeat and removal from power if the referendum had gone ahead. 
His challenge now is to contain street protests and respond to deep anger among all Venezuelans at the dreadful state of the economy.Food shortages, long shopping lines and runaway prices have eroded the ruling ""Chavismo"" movement's popularity among the poor and seen Maduro's ratings slide to just over 20 percent. But as unhappy as they are, disaffected former ""Chavistas"" are not yet ready to throw their lot in en masse with coalition leaders they still view with suspicion.""They are all from privileged families. How can they represent me?"" said Orlando Diaz, 47, a mechanic and father of four from a slum in western Caracas who has seen work dry up and income tumble during a nearly three-year recession.""Do I hate Maduro? Yes. He has betrayed the comandante (Chavez), he is a fool. Will I join these people in their crying and marching? No way. Frankly, I don't know where to turn. I don't see a future, I just have to find bread for my family today and tomorrow. That's all I think about.""The opposition's challenge is how to incorporate people like Diaz and his neighbors from the gritty hillside Antimano ""barrio"", into their street push. On Wednesday, they drew hundreds of thousands nationwide, but students and traditional supporters remained at the vanguard.Scores of people on both sides were killed during anti-Maduro protests in 2014 and there was new violence on Wednesday, with dozens of injuries and arrests. A policemen was shot dead in an incident the government blamed on demonstrators. ""A recall referendum in 2016 would have meant the automatic exit from power of 'Chavismo',"" said local pollster Luis Vicente Leon. ""Eschewing democratic codes and values, the government preferred to assume ... the risk of a popular reaction.""The next presidential election is due at the end of 2018 and most Venezuelans assume another candidate will emerge from within ""Chavismo"" instead of Maduro. But given the events of recent days, opposition supporters are beginning to wonder if that election will even take place. (Reporting by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Kieran Murray)"	['Long']	[]

By Joseph Ax
| NEWARK, N.J.

NEWARK, N.J. Closing arguments in New Jersey's ""Bridgegate"" trial were unexpectedly postponed by a day on Thursday because of an unspecified ""legal issue"" that must be resolved, the trial judge said. U.S. prosecutors in Newark had been scheduled to begin summing up the evidence against two former allies of Governor Chris Christie who are accused of orchestrating lane closures at the busy George Washington Bridge to New York City in September 2013 in an act of political retribution.U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton told jurors to return on Friday morning for closing arguments, which are now expected to last into Monday.Prosecutors and defense lawyers, who also left for the day, declined to comment on the nature of the issue.Jurors have heard more than a month of testimony in the trial of Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, operator of the bridge.
Prosecutors say the two conspired with another Port Authority executive, David Wildstein, to create massive gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, to punish the town's mayor for refusing to back Christie's 2013 reelection campaign.The scandal damaged Christie's political standing as he was beginning a campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The governor is a top adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.Christie, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, has said he was unaware of the lane closings at the time.
But testimony at the trial from several witnesses have contradicted Christie's claim.Wildstein, who pleaded guilty and testified for the government, said he and Baroni discussed the plot with Christie as it was unfolding.Baroni and Kelly each took the stand and said they spoke with Christie about the lane closures, though they said they believed that the closures were part of a legitimate traffic study.
Kelly, who cried several times during her testimony, portrayed Christie as a demanding and bullying boss who once flung a water bottle at her in anger.She was the author of an infamous email sent to Wildstein that said, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" a message prosecutors say set the scheme in motion.But Kelly told jurors that she was simply parroting the language Wildstein had used in describing the potential gridlock caused by what she believed was a Port Authority-approved traffic study.

The Arkansas Supreme Court struck down on Thursday one of two proposals in the November election to allow for the use of medical marijuana in the state, saying the proposal did not receive the required number of signatures to be on the ballot.Voters in the Nov. 8 election in Arkansas will still be able to vote on a separate measure that would allow for the regulated use of marijuana for certain medical conditions, where a state commission oversees plant growth and marijuana distribution.The ballot proposal that was struck down was called the ""Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act."" It had a provision for patients to apply for permission from state authorities to grow their own marijuana plants if they lived more than 20 miles (32 kms) away from an authorized dispensary.
Four years ago, voters in socially conservative Arkansas narrowly rejected a proposal allowing for the use of medical marijuana.
Some 24 states and Washington D.C. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use, and a handful of states allow its recreational use.

WASHINGTON Melania Trump will give two or three speeches in the final days of the U.S. presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump said in a television interview, apparently surprising his wife.The couple appeared in a taped ABC interview broadcast on Thursday less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Melania, who has mostly remained off the campaign trail to care for the couple's 10-year-old son, was asked if she was going to campaign for her husband in the homestretch. ""We will see,"" she said. ""My priority is my son Barron and I support [my husband] 100 percent and I'm there for him every time he needs me.""Trump indicated that time is now. ""She is actually going to make two or three speeches,"" he interjected, drawing an ""Oh!"" from his wife.
Melania has stayed largely out of the public eye since the Republican National Convention in July, when she gave a speech that borrowed portions of first lady Michelle Obama's address to the 2008 Democratic convention.""She's amazing when she speaks,"" Trump said of his third wife, a former model from Slovenia. ""She is an amazing public speaker. She's agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it's going to be big speeches, important speeches.""
The New York real estate mogul, who is making his first run for office, is down an average of 5.4 percentage points in national opinion polls against Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, according to Real Clear Politics.Trump has been struggling to attract women voters after a series of damaging revelations and allegations about his treatment of women. Several women have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, in incidents dating back to the early 1980s, according to reports in various news outlets.
Trump has denied the allegations and maintained the women accusing him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. (Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Next month's Senate election in Wisconsin could gain Silicon Valley a key ally in Washington in the high-tech industry's battle against the U.S. government's growing appetite for more access to private data. Democrat Russ Feingold, 63, the only lawmaker to vote against the USA Patriot Act in 2001, leads incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson in the state in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election.Johnson, 61, rode a wave of support from conservative Tea Party activists to victory six years ago, sweeping Feingold out of office. But polls this year have consistently shown Feingold ahead, although recent surveys show a tighter race.Privacy advocates and former Feingold staffers said they expected Feingold, if returned to office, to be sympathetic to the privacy concerns of technology companies and civil liberties groups on issues such as encryption and domestic spying, at a time when many lawmakers are being pressured to confront security threats from Islamic State and other militant groups.The Feingold campaign did not respond to requests for comment.Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and other tech giants have tussled in recent years with government agencies over how much user data the companies should be forced to retain and share with investigators hunting for criminal suspects or national security threats. Those tensions grew after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked secrets about U.S. surveillance practices in 2013. They reached a crescendo earlier this year when the FBI tried to force Apple to unlock an iPhone tied to one of the shooters in a San Bernardino, California, attack that killed 14 people.  
Chief among the goals of many companies and privacy advocates is reforming a foreign intelligence authority used to justify once-secret broad internet surveillance programs exposed by Snowden that will expire in December 2017 unless Congress reauthorizes them.   Should Feingold return to Capitol Hill, former staffers said he would probably seek a seat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he would have privileged access to classified information about government spying.Feingold's campaign has received far more contributions than Johnson's from donors employed by tech companies including Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), a review of U.S. Federal Election Commission records showed. 
VOTED AGAINST PATRIOT ACT
Digital privacy activists have long regarded Feingold as an ally and aggressive overseer of the intelligence community, a reputation he burnished as the sole vote against the USA Patriot Act, which was passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, expanding the government's surveillance capabilities. In a speech from the Senate floor at the time, Feingold raised concerns that one provision would allow the government to ""go on a fishing expedition and collect information on virtually anyone.""Leaks from Snowden in 2013 showed the provision Feingold questioned was later secretly interpreted to conduct bulk surveillance on U.S. phone metadata. That program was curtailed by Congress in 2015.
Feingold ""was a true leader in fighting indiscriminate mass surveillance of innocent Americans,"" U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who also is among congressional skeptics of government spying, said in a statement.Wisconsin typically leans Democratic during high-turnout presidential election years, a problem for Johnson, who won by nearly 5 points in 2010 running as a small-government outsider.""It was pretty clear that 2010 was a wave election and there was nothing that (Feingold) could have done to fend off the challenge from Ron Johnson,"" said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Johnson has attempted to use Feingold's 18-year Senate record to portray him as soft on national security. William Allison, a Johnson campaign spokesman, added that Feingold had been ""willing to completely mislead Wisconsinites about his weak record on national security.""

By Luke Baker
| JERUSALEM

JERUSALEM On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem's Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel's best friend if elected.Wearing ""Make America Great Again"" baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn't care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters.""Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that's what I like,"" David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday.""He's not a saint, but look at his achievements. He's not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he's not going to support the two-state solution,"" he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians.Trump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign.Others at the rally said they liked the fact that Trump was promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and would not berate Israel for building Jewish settlements in occupied territory.
""It's very important that he becomes president,"" said Connie Gordner, 82, who moved to Israel from Jacksonville, Florida, 21 years ago. ""If Hillary Clinton becomes president, we're dead.""The rally was organized by Republicans Overseas Israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 U.S. citizens living in Israel or in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for their own state.Even if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come Nov. 8. Marc Zell, co-chairman of the non-profit group, believes around three-quarters of American-Israelis support the Republican party and its candidate.
In an impassioned speech to the small crowd, David Friedman, Trump's adviser on Israel, heaped criticism on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said Trump was Israel's greatest hope.""Under Trump, the United States will never pressure Israel into accepting a two-state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the Israeli people,"" he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of ""Crooked Hillary"".While the motley crowd was unabashed in its Trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most Jewish Israelis favor Clinton over Trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent.
The critical element is American-Israelis who retain the right to vote in U.S. elections. Some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national-religious outlook. Trump's messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments.On Wednesday, he delivered a minute-long video to the rally, playing up his connections to Judaism through his daughter's marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith.""My administration will stand side-by-side with the Jewish people and Israel's leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish Americans and Israelis but also all Americans and Israelis,"" he said.""Together we will make America and Israel safe again.""
