The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to abortion rights advocates, striking down a Texas law imposing strict regulations on abortion doctors and facilities.Following is a timeline of that challenge.July 2013 - The Republican-led Texas legislature passes and Republican Governor Rick Perry signs the law known as H.B. 2, putting new requirements on abortion providers. State officials say the law is intended to ensure the health and safety of women.September 2013 - Before the law is enforced, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers challenge the measure. They assert that certain provisions, including one related to doctors' ""admitting privileges"" - a type of formal affiliation - at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of an abortion clinic, are aimed at decreasing the abortion availability in the state.October 2013 - A U.S. district judge sides largely with the challengers, blocking the admitting privileges provision.March 2014 - The New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, a regional federal appeals court covering Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, reverses the lower court and permits much of the law to take effect. April 2014 - Whole Woman's Health and other abortion providers bring a new complaint against Texas, citing the effect of the law's implementation and the number of clinics that have closed. The challengers focus on the admitting-privileges requirement and regulations governing clinic facility standards.
August 2014 - A U.S. district court judge declares the admitting privileges and clinic requirements an unconstitutional burden on women's access to abortion.October 2014 - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit intervenes to allow implementation of both new regulations, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocks part of the order so that the mandate that clinics meet hospital-grade standards does not go into effect.June 2015 - After considering the full merits of the challenge, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reverses the district judge's decision, finding the judge should have deferred to the legislature's stated health and safety goals. The appeals court also says most of the lawsuit should have been barred because the legal issues it raises already were addressed in the case filed by Planned Parenthood.
June 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote puts a temporary hold on the 5th Circuit's ruling while the justices consider whether to hear the challengers' appeal. That action blocks the provision regarding hospital-grade standards from taking effect.September 2015 - The abortion providers challenging the Texas restrictions ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeal of the 5th Circuit's ruling.November 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the challenge by abortion providers to the Texas restrictions.
February 2016 - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a supporter of abortion restrictions, dies at age 79, leaving the court shorthanded and evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives.March 2016 - The U.S. Supreme Court hears 85 minutes of oral arguments in the case, known as Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. The court's four liberal justices indicate they believe the law intrudes on a woman's constitutional right to abortion. The four conservative justices express doubts about claims by abortion providers that the law forced numerous clinics to shut down.June 2016 - The U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the Texas law, finding that it places an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy. The court declares that both provisions of the law - ""admitting privileges"" and hospital-grade facilities - are unconstitutional. The ruling marks the firmest endorsement of U.S. abortion rights since the 1992 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey ruling.

By John Whitesides and Lucia Mutikani
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign accused Donald Trump on Sunday of caring more about how Britain's historic vote to leave the European Union would benefit his financial bottom line than how it would impact the U.S. economy.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook acknowledged parallels between the populist anger and anti-establishment fervor that fueled the Brexit vote and Trump's rise to the nomination, but said the Republican candidate's reaction showed he was not fit to occupy the White House.""Hillary Clinton looks at this through the lens of how it's going to affect middle-class families, Donald Trump through the lens of how it will help his bottom line,"" Mook said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Without mentioning Trump by name, Clinton also warned that ""bombastic comments in turbulent times can actually cause more turbulence"" in a speech to a conference of city mayors in Indianapolis on Sunday afternoon.Her campaign released a national television advertisement earlier in the day, which featured the wealthy real estate developer's comments on Friday that the fall of the British currency after the Brexit vote could mean more business for his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, where he was speaking. ""Every president is tested by world events, but Donald Trump thinks about how his golf resort can profit from them,"" said the  30-second video.Besides his currency comments, Trump had praised the Brexit result as an example of people ""taking their country back."" He responded to the advertisement on Sunday by saying Clinton, whose staff had said she supported the United Kingdom remaining in the union, had poor judgment.""Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgment call on BREXIT with big dollar ads,"" ran a message on his Twitter account. ""Disgraceful!""
Paul Manafort, campaign manager for Trump, rejected what he called a ""phony"" charge by Clinton and said Trump was more in sync with the global economic frustration exemplified by the Brexit vote. In contrast, the Clinton ad showed her campaign's ""tone deafness"" by focusing on things the American people did not care about, he said in an NBC interview.In her speech on Sunday, Clinton said the United States and the United Kingdom were different ""economically, politically, demographically,"" but still drew some parallels between the mood of American and British voters.""Just as we have seen, there are many frustrated people in Britain, we know there are frustrated people here at home, too,"" she said. ""I have seen it, I've heard it, I know it.""
BREXIT PARALLELS IN U.S.
Global stock markets nosedived on Friday and economic experts warned of a potential global recession after the shocking British vote to pull out of the European Union. Markets prepared for the possibility of more pain on Monday.Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Brexit vote highlighted global anxieties about economic stagnation and immigration.""The genius of what's happened with the candidacy of Donald Trump is he's given voice to that, just as was given in the UK,"" Corker, who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick for Trump, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program.
He said he thought Trump's appearance at his golf course in Scotland after the Brexit vote ""was one of his best events"" and  his comments about the British currency and what it would mean for his businesses were just ""an anecdotal statement"" about its effects.""He was giving an example, which is obvious, that when the currency fluctuates, as it does, more Americans are going to be able to travel to the UK more cheaply,"" he said.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Brexit vote showed people were tired of being dictated to by ""unelected bureaucrats in Brussels,"" and said there were parallels in the United States.Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who built his White House campaign against Clinton around populist proposals to eradicate income inequality, remove big money from politics and rein in Wall Street, said the Brexit vote encapsulated many of those concerns.""What ordinary people are saying is 'hey, give us an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top,'"" Sanders said on CNN.

ABERDEEN, Scotland U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump played down market turmoil in the wake of Britain's decision to leave the European Union on a visit to his Trump International golf course in Aberdeen on Saturday.Wearing an open-necked shirt, a suit and a white baseball cap with his slogan ""Make America great again"", Trump was asked if he was worried about the volatility in financial markets following Britain's vote to leave the EU on Thursday. ""There's always turmoil no matter where you go, no matter what you do,"" he said.Global stock markets lost about $2 trillion in value on Friday after the vote, while sterling fell to a 31-year low.
Trump, whose mother was Scottish, was greeted by around a dozen protesters at the course waving Mexican flags, rainbow flags for Gay Pride day and signs that read ""Donald stop the hating"" and ""Shame on you for ruining a beautiful landscape.""Trump last year proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States as a response to Islamist attacks in Paris and California, causing a furor in Europe.
In an article in a Scottish newspaper earlier this year, Trump pointed to his determination to overcome local opposition to his golf course projects as an example of the leadership skills that Americans would get if he were to become president.
He also met with News Corporation media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his wife Jerry Hall, giving them a tour of the course in a golf cart. (Reporting by Gerhard Mey and Carlo Allegri; writing by Elisabeth O'Leary. Editing by Jane Merriman)"

TORONTO TransCanada Corp is formally requesting arbitration over U.S. President Barack Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, seeking $15 billion in damages, the company said in legal papers dated Friday. TransCanada submitted a notice for an arbitration claim in January and had then tried to negotiate with the U.S. government to ""reach an amicable settlement,"" the company said in files posted on the pipeline's website.""Unfortunately, the parties were unable to settle the dispute.""TransCanada said it then filed its formal arbitration request under North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provisions, seeking to recover what it says are costs and damages.The Keystone XL was designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico coast.     
Obama rejected the cross-border crude oil pipeline last November, seven years after it was first proposed, saying it would not make a meaningful long-term contribution to the U.S. economy.TransCanada is suing the United States in federal court in a separate legal action, seeking to reverse the pipeline's rejection.
NAFTA, whose arbitration provisions allow companies to challenge governments before international panels, has been a target of recent anti-free-trade sentiments in the United States.The heads of NAFTA members, Canada, the United States and Mexico, are expected to meet in Ottawa for a North American leaders' Summit on June 29.
Canada was supposed to host the meeting early last year but canceled it amid tension between then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline.TransCanada and the U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

By Roberta Rampton
| PALO ALTO, Calif.

PALO ALTO, Calif. U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday tried to limit the fallout from Britain's vote to leave the European Union, which threatens to harm the U.S. economic recovery, derail his trade agenda and  distract U.S. allies from global security issues.   Obama, who had argued passionately against Britain leaving the EU in a trip to the country this year, vowed that Washington would still maintain both its ""special relationship"" with London and close ties to Brussels.          ""While the UK's relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations. That will endure,"" he told an event at Stanford University, referring to close ally Britain. ""The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners,"" Obama said.He spoke to outgoing British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the stunning result of Thursday's referendum, the biggest blow to the European project of greater unity since World War Two.Obama said he was sure Britain's exit would be orderly and vowed that the United States and Britain would ""stay focused on ensuring economic growth and financial stability."" The Brexit result rattled Wall Street and many other financial markets, with global stock markets losing about $2 trillion in value on Friday.    ""I must say we had looked for a different outcome. We would have preferred a different outcome,"" U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, traveling in Ireland, said on Friday.The historic divorce launched by the Brexit vote could sink hopes of a massive U.S.-EU free trade deal before Obama leaves the White House in January.              Negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti-trade sentiment on both continents.    As well as the global economic consequences, Brexit makes it more difficult for Obama and the United States to corral its Western allies into joint action against challenges such as Islamic State, Russia and the rise of China.Britain's exit could present the next U.S. president with a decision on whether to turn to other key European partners like Germany and France, essentially downgrading the United States' special bond with Britain, whose foundation was laid in World War Two.
Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, called on Washington's partners in Europe to keep their eye on foreign policy threats.""We must maintain our trans-Atlantic consensus on how to deal with a resurgent Russia and the growing threat of ISIS,"" he said. ""I urge leaders in London, Brussels and across Europe to not lose sight of these threats and remain coordinated in our response."" THE TRUMP FACTOR
The U.S. presidential election candidates are casting an eye across the Atlantic at the unlikely success of Britain's ""Leave"" campaign, which has similarities with Republican Donald Trump's insurgent bid for the Nov. 8 election.Trump's rise was sustained by a similar brew of anti-establishment and anti-globalization sentiment and concern about immigration that helped the Leave vote. 
""This is a protest vote against globalization and there is one presidential candidate who won the nomination who has put globalization in his crosshairs - and that's Donald Trump,"" Republican strategist John Feehery said.                 Biden, in remarks prepared for a speech at Dublin Castle, took a swipe at Trump without mentioning him by name. He warned against ""politicians and demagogues peddling xenophobia, nationalism, and isolationism.""        Brexit supporter Trump called the result a ""great thing.""     ""People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense. You see it with Europe, all over Europe,"" Trump, 70, said in Turnberry, Scotland where he reopened a golf course. Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said Britain's electoral shock showed that national leaders will be punished if they do not ""first ensure they have protected the safety and legitimate interests of their own people.""""Brexit is a warning for America,"" said Sessions, a Trump supporter who criticized ""radical trade policies that erode the power of the people to control their lives.""           
Obama had warned British voters against Brexit, in an unusually strong intervention into British politics in April.The White House said on Friday that he stands by a comment made then that Britain would move to the back of the queue when it comes to trade deals with the United States if it left the EU.       Obama hopes his former secretary of state Hillary Clinton will win the November election and safeguard his legacy but economic volatility in the United States after Brexit could hurt her chances of beating Trump.In response to Britain's decision to leave, Clinton said the United States must first safeguard against any economic fallout at home at ""this time of uncertainty"" and underscore its commitment to both Britain and Europe.     The U.S. Federal Reserve sought to calm global financial markets by saying it was ready to provide dollar liquidity following the British vote.U.S. financial regulators said the country's financial system is functioning in an ""orderly manner."" The Financial Stability Oversight Council - which includes the heads of the U.S. Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Reserve - ""noted that the U.S. financial system continues to function in an orderly manner, and that the Council will continue to monitor ongoing developments,"" according to a summary released after a phone call among members.After Brexit, the U.S. central bank's ambitions for two rate rises this year now look unlikely. Traders of U.S.-interest rate futures even began to price in a small chance of a Fed rate cut, and now see little chance of any hike until the end of next year.""One can forget about rate hikes in the near term,"" said Thomas Costerg, New York-based economist at Standard Chartered Bank. ""What I'm worried about is that the Brexit vote could be the straw that breaks the back of the U.S. growth picture.""

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton regained a double-digit lead over Republican rival Donald Trump this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.The June 20-24 poll showed that 46.6 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton while 33.3 percent supported Trump. Another 20.1 percent said they would support neither candidate.Trump had enjoyed a brief boost in support following the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, as he doubled down on his pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country, cutting Clinton's lead to nine points. But Trump's rise in popularity appeared to be only temporary, unlike his lasting surge among the Republican field last year after the attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino, California.
Clinton's 13.3 percentage point lead is about the same as she had before the Orlando attack. Trump's slip this week came as he struggled to show that he can keep up with a Clinton campaign apparatus that has dwarfed his in size and funding. Campaign finance disclosures released earlier this week showed Trump started June with a war chest of just $1.3 million, a fraction of Clinton's $42 million. Trump sought to ease concerns among his allies by saying that he could tap his ""unlimited"" personal wealth if needed, and also by bolstering efforts to raise money through fundraising events and online donations.
Meanwhile, Republican leaders including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker continued to express reservations about their new standard bearer, who has angered some in the party with his fiery rhetoric. Ryan and Walker both said over the past week that they felt Republicans should follow their ""conscience"" when deciding to support the party's likely nominee, instead of urging party members to support him.
The poll only captured some of the voter reaction to Britain's decision in Thursday's referendum to exit the European Union, a move that some pundits say suggests Trump's insurgent candidacy has tapped into a broad and powerful anti-globalization wave sweeping Western countries.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online and included interviews with 1,201 likely voters in all 50 states. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.3 percentage points. (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler)"
