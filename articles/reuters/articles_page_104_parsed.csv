By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senator John McCain said on Tuesday he would use his power to block the confirmation of a key cybersecurity official if necessary to prevent any Obama administration move to separate the U.S. Cyber Command from the National Security Agency.""I do not believe rushing to separate the 'dual hat' in the final months of an administration is appropriate, given the very serious challenges we face in cyberspace,"" McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a hearing.""Dual hat"" refers to one individual holding both positions.Current and former U.S. officials told Reuters in August that President Barack Obama's administration was preparing to elevate the stature of the Department of Defense's Cyber Command, including separating it from the NSA. 
Officials argued that the focus of the NSA, a spy agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, is gathering intelligence, often favoring the monitoring of an enemy's cyber activities. Cyber Command's mission is geared more to shutting down cyber attacks - and, if ordered, counter attacking.
McCain said the two agencies must work closely together to protect U.S. national security and he would block any nominee if that person was not nominated both to run the NSA and lead Cyber Command.He also said he wanted the administration to provide his panel with detailed plans of its proposed reorganization.
""This committee does not take well to being stonewalled while their colleagues in the administration leak information to the press,"" McCain said.Admiral Mike Rogers, the current NSA director and head of Cyber Command, told the hearing that he did not think it was in the best U.S. national security interest at this point to separate the two functions.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday will propose allowing families to deduct the cost of childcare expenses from income taxes, his campaign said, a move aimed at bolstering his support among women voters.Trump is to lay out the plan in an evening speech in the Philadelphia suburb of Aston, Pennsylvania, his latest attempt to construct a policy framework that he would use for governing if elected over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8.Trump is to be introduced at the event by his daughter, Ivanka, who has championed the issue of childcare as an influential voice in his campaign. She told reporters on a conference call that she was involved in developing the plan.""I'm very passionate about this,"" she said.Trump's support among women voters has lagged. Overall, he has risen to a more competitive position against Clinton in national opinion polls and in battleground states where the election is likely to be decided.
Polls show the race tightening in the crucial state of Pennsylvania. A Quinnipiac University poll last week said Clinton led 48 percent to 43 percent for Trump there, a reduction from her 10-point lead a month ago.Trump's plan would change the U.S. tax code to let parents deduct from their income taxes childcare expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents, his campaign said.It would be available for individuals earning less than $250,000 a year or under $500,000 for couples filing jointly.
Trump campaign officials did not detail the overall cost of the program. A senior official said it would be part of Trump's plan to overhaul the tax code and would end up not adding to deficit spending in the U.S. budget.Trump would offer childcare spending rebates to lower-income taxpayers through the existing Earned Income Tax Credit. The campaign said this could mean tax rebates as high as $1,200 for eligible families each year.
Trump also would create new Dependent Care Savings Accounts to allow families to set aside money ""to foster their children's development and offset elder care for their parents or adult dependents,"" the campaign said. Individuals could contribute up to $2,000 a year tax free.The New York businessman also is proposing guaranteed six weeks of paid maternity leave. He would accomplish this by amending the existing unemployment insurance that companies are required to carry. The benefit would apply only when employers do not offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the federal unemployment insurance program so that taxes are not raised.

By Steve Holland and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton's bout of pneumonia has shed light on a problem seldom seen by American voters: The long days, little sleep, cross-country travel, bad food and kissing babies add up to a recipe for illness for presidential candidates and aides.Avoiding viruses and other ailments can be next to impossible for people who spend months in the close confines of campaign planes and buses.Brooke Buchanan, former press secretary to 2008 Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain, remembers leaving the campaign trail in Beaufort, South Carolina to visit an emergency room. She had a respiratory ailment and two ear infections.""You have to soldier on during certain things, but there's a point when you become a liability,"" Buchanan said. ""I was back on the road the next day, full of antibiotics.""Supporters of Clinton, who will face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, worried on Monday that the Democratic presidential nominee's medical scare would fuel conspiracy theories about her health. But Republican and Democratic political veterans alike say illnesses are an unwelcome but standard part of life on the campaign trail.Alice Stewart, who was a senior adviser to former presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz during the Republican primary earlier this year, remembers coughing her way through some of his news conferences while she was recording them for the campaign. She called the Cruz plane a ""flying petri dish.""""You just kind of power through it. When you're on the road, you can't drive home,"" Stewart said.In recent weeks, several staff at Clinton's campaign's Brooklyn headquarters have fallen ill and required medical treatment, a campaign aide said.Steven Simpson, a pulmonary specialist at the University of Kansas, said candidates were particularly vulnerable to illness.""The average patient, if you have the luxury of it, takes the week off before you go back to your full duties,"" Simpson said. ""But how do you say that to a presidential candidate?""
OBAMA'S HANDKERCHIEF
President Barack Obama caught a cold in August 2008, shortly before the Democratic Party's convention. A video posted on YouTube shows him sneezing at a rally. ""That's why I've got my handkerchief,"" he said.""Every candidate and campaign aide gets sick, but they just never get to take days off,"" said former Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer. ""You take vitamin C and try to get sleep, but it's a losing battle.""Obama's 2008 opponent, John McCain, traveled at times with a friend who was a doctor, said Steve Schmidt, the Republican candidate's campaign manager.""I think one of the secrets of working in a White House or on a presidential campaign is it's the closest you can ever get to traveling with Elvis (Presley) when it comes to the number of pills that are floating around,"" Schmidt said.
""There was always a big bag of every conceivable type of antibiotic and cold medicine, and you name it - we had it.""Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney developed a respiratory illness days before delivering his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa in 2012.""I was scared to death that he wouldn't really be able to speak,"" said Stuart Stevens, who was Romney's senior adviser. ""Doctors tell you to rest. But there's no time for that.""The grueling schedule led Stevens himself to develop pneumonia right after the 2012 campaign ended.
CANDY BARS AND SAUSAGES
Unhealthy food is another hazard of the campaign trail. Junk food is ubiquitous on campaign planes, and candidates flock to gatherings such as the Iowa State Fair that serve up fried candy bars, sausages and other high-calorie fare.Romney, who also ran for president in 2008, would sometimes pick the cheese off his pizza and the skin off fried chicken to limit the fat content, said former spokesman Ryan Williams.""It's not healthy food, it's campaign food,"" said Williams. ""And most operatives see themselves put on 10 or 20 pounds by the end of the campaign.""Trump is a noted germophobe, and there has been little evidence of him having gotten ill. He is a proud consumer of fast food, once tweeting a photo of himself on his plane with a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken nearby.That was also the chicken of choice for 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole, who managed to avoid getting sick throughout his campaign, said his then-traveling press secretary, Nelson Warfield.""Much of the campaign staff that was half his age were hobbled at some point or another during the campaign, but Dole was resilient,"" he said.Still, Dole had one nasty stumble. He fell off a stage in Chico, California, at campaign rally on Oct. 18, 1996. He got up smiling and soldiered on.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Major technology companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter are urging Congress to support a plan for the U.S. government to cede control of the internet's technical management to the global community, they said in a joint letter dated on Tuesday.The U.S. Commerce Department has primary oversight of the internet's management, largely because it was invented in the United States. Some Republican lawmakers are trying to block the handover to global stakeholders, which include businesses, tech experts and public interest advocates, saying it could stifle online freedom by giving voting rights to authoritarian governments.The years-long plan to transfer oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is scheduled to occur on Oct. 1 unless Congress votes to block the handover. The California-based corporation operates the database for domain names such as .com and .net and their corresponding numeric addresses that allow computers to connect. In the Sept. 13 letter, a copy of which had been reviewed by Reuters before it was sent, the technology companies said it was ""imperative"" that Congress does not delay the transition.
""A global, interoperable and stable Internet is essential for our economic and national security, and we remain committed to completing the nearly twenty year transition to the multi stakeholder model that will best serve U.S. interests,"" the letter said. Other signatories include Amazon, Cloudflare, Yahoo and several technology trade organizations.
Former presidential hopeful Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who leads the opposition against the handover, will hold a congressional hearing on Wednesday to review the transition, which he has criticized as a ""giveaway of our internet freedom.""Tech companies, technical experts and academics have said the transition is overdue and necessary to keep the Internet open and globally oriented, and that the proposal includes safeguards against any potential abuse by any one country.

By Ian Simpson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opened the latest outpost in his real estate empire on Monday, a luxury hotel in a historic building five blocks from the White House that underwent a two-year, $200 million renovation.While staff members at the 263-room Trump International Hotel planned little hoopla for what they described as a ""soft opening,"" about 40 protesters opposed to the New York real estate developer's presidential run gathered outside. The opening came eight weeks before the Nov. 8 election.""It kind of fits his personality that he finds a way to be on Pennsylvania Avenue, one way or another,"" said protester Judy Byron, 70, a Washington artist.The hotel, which includes a $20,000-a-night suite, is less than a mile (km) down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. The hotel is housed in Washington's third-tallest building, the 1899 Old Post Office, built in the Romanesque Revival architectural style.Trump said on Twitter he had stopped by the property ""to thank all of the tremendous men & women for their hard work!""The protesters criticized some of Trump's positions, including a promise to build a wall along the Mexican border to block illegal immigrants. Protest organizer Andrew Castro of Baltimore said: ""We're out here building a wall against racism.""
Dozens of people filtered in and out on Monday afternoon, some to gawk and others pausing for a drink at the hotel's bar.On his way in, Ric Hedlund, who works in port development, said he had been impressed by the renovations of a building that he said was previously ""a dump.""""I'm going in to drink Trump wine,"" said Hedlund, who added he also supported Trump as a candidate.
Trump's daughter Ivanka, who helped negotiate the 60-year lease with the U.S. government and oversaw the building's revamp and design, said the project had come in a year ahead of schedule and under budget.""We have really positioned this hotel to not only be the finest hotel in D.C. but in the country,"" she said in a telephone interview.A grand-opening ceremony is planned for next month.
Trump attended the 2014 groundbreaking for the renovations alongside local Democratic officials before launching his presidential campaign last year.While Trump's name is hard to escape in his native New York, where it adorns structures including the Trump Tower as well as a Bronx golf course, the hotel marks his most visible presence in Washington.His comments describing some Mexican immigrants as criminals prompted celebrity chefs Jose Andres and Geoffrey Zakarian to pull out of the project. Trump has sued them. (Additional reporting by Kouichi Shirayanagi in Washington; Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay and Peter Cooney)"	['Simpson', 'Trump', 'Castro']	[]
6	6	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-rates-idUSKCN11I19H	Trump says Fed keeping rates low because of pressure from Obama	"

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was keeping interest rates low because of political pressure from the Obama administration, questioning the motives of an institution whose work hinges on maintaining its independence.""Well, it's (the interest rate) staying at zero because she's obviously political and she's doing what Obama wants her to do,"" Trump told CNBC in a phone interview, saying Yellen should be ""ashamed"" of what she was doing to the country.The U.S. central bank has raised interest rates just once since cutting them to zero in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has indicated it is preparing for a second hike of 0.25 percentage point, although it has signaled the pace of future rate rises will be slower than in the past.""Any increase at all will be a very, very small increase because they want to keep the market up so Obama goes out and let the new guy ... raise interest rates ... and watch what happens in the stock market,"" Trump said.He did not specify how the Democratic president had put pressure on Yellen.While Yellen has met with Obama, the Fed as an institution is independent when it comes to raising or lowering rates, and both Yellen and other rate-setters have said the Fed has no view on the Nov. 8 election.The Fed's Washington-based board had no comment on Trump's remarks, though regional Federal Reserve bank presidents said during public appearances that politics do not enter into Fed deliberations.Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari responded in a later interview on CNBC by denying that politics influenced Fed policymaking.
""Politics simply does not come up,"" he said. ""We look at the economic data and ... everyone around the table is committed to achieving our dual mandate"" of maximum employment and stable prices, Kashkari said.  Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, asked about political pressure on the Fed at a National Association for Business Economics conference in Atlanta, said, ""I don't see the world that way.""Trump's comments mark a back-and-forth by the candidate over whether he feels low rates are good or bad. He has accused the Fed of keeping rates low at Obama's behest, but at other times has said he felt lower rates were good because higher rates would make the dollar stronger, hurting American exports and manufacturers. As a businessman, he said, ""I love low interest rates,"" but said they hurt many people who were living on their savings.
STEERING CLEAR OF POLITICS
Typically, Fed officials steer clear of politics in their public remarks, and argue that doing so is important for the Fed to maintain the independence it needs to set monetary policy.The moments when the line is publicly breached, such as former Chair Alan Greenspan's endorsement of a Bush administration tax cut, are rare and can provoke a quick backlash. 
Though the members of the Fed's Board of Governor's are appointed by the president with Senate confirmation, their long, 14-year terms and staggered appointment dates are designed to insulate them from the sort of pressure Trump alleges. The chair, considered one of the most powerful positions in setting U.S. economic policy, is picked from the board members for a four-year term. Yellen's would expire in 2018, and Trump has previously said he would consider replacing her.The Fed's marching orders, however, come from Congress, which has set the central bank's mandate.The Fed lowered interest rates to near zero in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and has increased them only once since then - in December - given the sluggish pace of the recovery.Fed members and economists have vigorously debated the issue Trump raised - whether easy-money policies have led to an unsustainable rise in asset prices. But there has been even more concern about weak growth, weak inflation, and the need to keep financial conditions loose to try to ensure businesses keep hiring.

By Alana Wise and Jeff Mason
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton said on Monday she could resume presidential campaigning in a couple of days after a bout of pneumonia that she initially had not believed was ""that big a deal.""Clinton's health scare after she almost collapsed at an event on Sunday, causing her to cancel some campaign trips, revived concerns about a tendency toward secrecy that has dogged her campaign, and underscored perennial worries about the medical fitness of candidates for one of the world's most demanding jobs.""Well, it will be in the next couple of days. ... I just want to get this over and done with and get back on the trail as soon as possible,"" she said in an interview on CNN on Monday night, adding she had ignored doctor's orders to rest. ""I just didn't think it was going to be that big a deal."" Her campaign acknowledged on Monday it may have been too slow disclosing her pneumonia diagnosis after she nearly fainted at a New York memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She was diagnosed with the lung infection on Friday.""I think that in retrospect, we could have handled it better in terms of providing more information more quickly,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon told MSNBC earlier in the day.The health problem was the latest blow for the Democratic presidential nominee at a time when Republican rival Donald Trump has erased most of her lead in national opinion polls and is competitive again in many battleground states where the Nov. 8 election is likely to be decided.Clinton, 68, said she had dealt with similar episodes of dizziness before. ""You know, it is something that has occurred a few times over the course of my life. I'm aware of it and usually can avoid it,"" she told CNN.Asked if she passed out during the incident on Sunday, she said: ""No, I didn't. I felt dizzy and I did lose my balance for a minute. Once I got in. Once I could sit down. Once I could cool off. Once I had some water, I immediately started feeling better.""  Her campaign said her husband, former President Bill Clinton, would campaign on her behalf while she rests.
Both Clinton and Trump, 70, said they intended to release more of their medical details in the coming days, as their campaigns gear up for the November election.'DEEPLY SHOCKED'
Questions about the incident reinforced the perception of Clinton as secretive, a view fueled by the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server while serving as President Barack Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.A federal investigation of that issue said she was ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified emails, but did not recommend criminal charges.Trump said on Monday that health was a campaign issue but he did not attack Clinton over her physical condition. ""I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail,"" he said in an interview with Fox News.
He focused his criticism on comments by Clinton last week in which she dismissed half of his supporters as a ""basket of deplorables"" of racist, homophobic people. Clinton said she regretted the remark.Trump has compared the comment with a much-criticized remark by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney that 47 percent of the electorate was dependent on the government.""I was deeply shocked and alarmed to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear, demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign by the millions,"" Trump told a conference of National Guard members in Baltimore.Trump has himself aroused controversy with comments in which he called some Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists, questioned whether a U.S.-born judge could be fair because of his Mexican heritage and criticized the Muslim parents of an American soldier who died in combat in Iraq.
'SHORT-TERM TURBULENCE'
Clinton's pneumonia disclosure was made public hours after her campaign said she had become ""overheated"" to explain why, her knees buckling and unsteady, she was rushed from the Sept. 11 ceremony.""The short-term turbulence will be more about the handling of this than the substance,"" David Axelrod, a former political adviser to Obama, told Reuters. ""Antibiotics can take care of pneumonia,"" Axelrod tweeted later. ""What's the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems?""Trump had suggested for weeks that Clinton lacked the energy needed to be president. He has raised questions about her stamina, reprising a tactic from the Republican primary campaign when he derided rival Jeb Bush as a ""low-energy"" candidate. Democrats said her attendance at events despite her pneumonia diagnosis proved her toughness.Trump's campaign has issued a short letter from his doctor saying he was in excellent health with ""extraordinary"" strength and stamina. But the letter did not mention what medicine Trump might be taking or other details typically included in such disclosures.In July 2015, Clinton released a two-page letter outlining her medical condition that sought to reassure Americans about her health after she fell and suffered a concussion at home in 2012 near the end of her tenure as secretary of state.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. A former California lawmaker was sentenced to six months in prison and six months in home confinement Monday for laundering a bribe accepted by his brother, also a former legislator.Thomas Calderon, 62, pleaded guilty on June 6 to one count of money laundering in the case. He admitted to depositing $30,000 in an account held by his political consulting company, the Calderon Group, that had been offered as a bribe by an undercover agent to his brother in 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday.""Tom Calderon was all too aware of the bribe payments to his brother and that his brother had agreed to a quid pro quo with the undercover agents,"" United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker said in a press release. ""Tom Calderon facilitated these bribe payments by helping to conceal his brother's corrupt activities from the public.""Calderon's attorney, Shepard Kopp, said the longtime political hand from the blue collar Los Angeles suburb of Montebello was deeply remorseful for his actions.
""If he had it to do all over again he would obviously make a different decision,"" Kopp said. ""But it's important to view Tom and his life and public service as a whole rather than this one episode. He's been trying to better the lives of the people in his community on the east side of Los Angeles for more than 30 years.""He was sentenced Monday by U.S. District Court Judge Christina Snyder to a year and a day in custody - half of it in federal prison - and 100 hours of community service.
Calderon, a Democrat, served in the state assembly from 1998 to 2002, representing Montebello and other suburbs northeast of Los Angeles. 
His brother, Ronald Calderon, 59, also of Montebello, was a Democratic state senator in 2013, when the FBI raided his office as part of the corruption case. The brothers were indicted in the case the following year.

President Barack Obama on Monday urged U.S. insurers offering coverage next year under his national healthcare law to step up their efforts to enroll those who remain uninsured, especially younger and healthier Americans.Several big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, have announced they will pull back from the Obamacare individual insurance market in 2017, citing financial losses due to the costs of covering members who are sicker than expected.Their planned exit has prompted new questions over whether Obamacare can survive over the long-term if insurers cannot create a viable business from the market. Insurance premiums for consumers have jumped each year since Obamacare plans took effect in 2014, and those price increases are expected to grow steeper as fewer insurers participate. Obama, in a letter to all insurers selling health plans next year on the exchanges, noted that the program has helped reduce the percentage of Americans without health insurance to a record low, and acknowledged that it could still be improved to benefit insurers and consumers.
His administration will help find and enroll those who still lack coverage, with a particular focus on enrolling young adults. ""Since the remaining uninsured are disproportionately younger and healthier, signing them up improves the risk pool and consequently the affordability of coverage for all enrollees,"" Obama said in the letter. 
Obama, Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and other top health advisers on Monday met with executives from several leading insurance companies, including Cigna Corp Chief Executive David Cordani and Humana CEO Bruce Broussard, to discuss ways to strengthen the marketplace ahead of its fourth open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1, according to a White House official.        A spokeswoman for industry group America's Health Insurance Plans said the meeting's focus included increasing enrollment. 
""As health plans are preparing for open enrollment, today's meeting was focused on how to build on the continued progress in reducing the uninsured rate and moving forward with policy solutions that will support a stable, affordable market for 2017 and beyond,"" AHIP spokeswoman Clare Krusing said.
