EDINBURGH Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidential election on Wednesday but said many would feel anxious about his victory.""It is normal in any election for those on the losing side to feel disappointment, but today, many in America and across the world, will also feel a real sense of anxiety,"" Sturgeon said in statement.Trump, whose mother was Scottish, owns two golf courses on the west and east coasts of Scotland.
He has made much of his Scottish roots, telling a Scottish newspaper earlier this year that just as he had won over Scotland, where he faced fierce local resistance to some of his development plans, he would win over the United States.Sturgeon has long been vocal on her distaste for Trump and endorsed his opponent Hillary Clinton as recently as Tuesday.
""While this is not the outcome I hoped for, it is the verdict of the American people and we must respect it. I congratulate president-elect Trump on winning the election,"" she said.

MOSCOW Suggestions Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election are absurd and a renewed dialogue is needed between Washington and Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin currently had no plans to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump or incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama.
He said Russia hoped coordination with United States on the Syria crisis would improve under the new U.S. president.

By Sharon Bernstein

They wore pantsuits to their polling places, emulating the preferred dress of their White House candidate. Some wept with emotion and others remembered their female ancestors as they cast their vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton.But rather than witness the shattering of the ultimate glass ceiling, women across America watched an historic breakthrough slip away as Clinton failed to become the first woman elected president of the United States.Republican Donald Trump, who had waged a heated campaign painting the former secretary of state as  ""crooked"" and threatening to put her in jail, swept to surprise victory on an anti-establishment platform.""I was looking forward to having a woman president. I really was. I can't believe people voted for that terrible man,"" said Mariana Mejia, 61, sitting at a subdued party at California Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento.Some women defied their own political tradition to vote for the first woman presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party. Republican Cassandra Pye, a pioneering African-American political consultant who advised former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, said she felt the pull of history as she cast her ballot for Clinton.""I feel like even though I vote in the booth alone, there are always people in there with me,"" Pye said. ""My ancestors, my mother, my aunties - there were a lot of people in the booth with me today.""A polarizing figure with a long history in the public eye, Clinton entered the White House as first lady in 1993, after her husband, Bill Clinton, defeated incumbent George H. W. Bush.
Her ambition immediately clashed with the public's image of a first lady, and Clinton won enemies as swiftly as she earned the adoration of many progressive women.When she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton conceded that ""although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18 million cracks in it,"" referring to the number of votes she had won. 
'A VERY HARD STRUGGLE'
Women who had pinned their hopes on Clinton gave a nod to their political history on Tuesday, forming a long line to leave ""I Voted Today"" stickers on the gravestone of women's suffrage activist Susan B. Anthony. Others, dressed in white like the suffragettes who campaigned for a woman's right to vote and wearing pantsuits like those favored by Clinton, posed for photos at state Capitol buildings and other iconic locations.Several bemoaned the fact that U.S. women won the right to vote in 1920 and nearly a century later the country has yet to elect a woman president.        
""It's been such a hard struggle for women, a very hard struggle,"" said U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, who in 1992 made history along with Senator Dianne Feinstein as the first women elected from California to the U.S. Senate. ""It's a very emotional moment.""Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV star, defied political correctness with comments that angered women, minorities and the disabled. He denied allegations by several women that he groped them after the emergence of a video where he boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women.   At the Sacramento Democratic party gathering, some women lamented his victory and the long, difficult trek for women to win positions of power. ""I thought by the time I hit 61 it would be different for women and minorities,"" said Chris Cage, 61, a former journalist and labor organizer. ""I see a victory for Trump as a vote against both.""

""In the course of the election campaign Donald Trump has found critical words about Europe and Germany. We must adjust to the fact that American foreign policy will get less predictable in the near future,"" he added.

By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress in a momentous election on Tuesday in which Republican Donald Trump won the presidency, empowering the party to reshape Washington.The Republican sweep sets up the United States for two years of ""unified"" government, which would normally mean significant policy change, although Trump's election was anything but normal and he will start his presidency with unusual handicaps. Both Republican leaders on Capitol Hill held Trump at arm's length during the campaign. Trump offended and attacked some congressional Republicans on the stump, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.Early on Wednesday, shortly after Clinton conceded to Trump, Ryan said in a statement: ""We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican,  said in a guarded and similarly timed statement: ""The American people have chosen a new direction for our nation.""The new Congress will not convene until Jan. 3, but the ""lame-duck"" Congress will return next week and Republicans are set to begin the process of picking leaders for both chambers.Ryan's position as speaker could be challenged by Republican conservatives who backed Trump and it remains to be seen if the president-elect himself will try to push Ryan out.""Trump seems magnanimous right now,"" an aide to one of Trump's House supporters said after Trump stressed unity in his victory speech in New York. ""We shall see.""In a huge disappointment to Democrats, Republicans were on a pace to lose only a handful of seats in the House, well below the double-digit losses some predicted.Similarly, Democrats gained only one seat in the Senate, although a few races were still to be determined, including New Hampshire, where incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte was deadlocked with Democrat Maggie Hassan early on Wednesday.
In Illinois, Democratic U.S. Representative Tammy Duckworth defeated Republican Senator Mark Kirk. Democrats needed to pick up a net five seats to win Senate control.PREDICTIONS DEFIED
Republican successes came on the heels of big Republican gains in the 2014 congressional elections and defied predictions the party was in tatters and on the verge of splitting apart because of deep divisions over Trump.Congressional Republicans are sure to flex their muscles on a range of legislation, not the least of which is fulfilling a six-year quest to repeal President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law known as ""Obamacare.""
Republicans also campaigned on an agenda that shunned comprehensive immigration reform and opposed gun control and expanded environmental and financial regulations.In the Senate, McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was expected to remain at his post for at least the next two years.Paul Sracic, who chairs the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said: ""There was all this concern that Trump would damage Republicans down-ticket. Just the opposite happened"" as Trump brought out more Republican voters.Come January, Republicans will have to pivot from trying to block Obama's initiatives - such as his signature health insurance program Obamacare - to governing along with Trump.""Republicans no longer have the luxury of being the opposition party, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University.
""For example, will they actually repeal Obamacare and agree what to implement in its place?"" she added.MCCONNELL'S PAYOFF
McConnell led conservatives' opposition to any Supreme Court nominee named by Obama following last February's death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.His gamble paid off and he will now await a nomination from Trump, likely dooming Obama's choice of federal judge Merrick Garland.Star-power incumbent Republicans, such as Senator John McCain in Arizona and Marco Rubio in Florida, also scored victories. Issues ranging from tax cuts to border security will now take center stage in Washington. Trump's opposition to trade deals with foreign countries puts in serious jeopardy the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by Obama that would cover economies from Japan to Chile.""In terms of trade, I think TPP is dead. The stake went through its heart tonight,"" Sracic said.

BRUSSELS The European Union must take responsibility for dealing with neighbors Russia, Africa and the Middle East, its commissioner for ""neighborhood policy"" said on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president.""Europe must shoulder its own share of international responsibility, especially in its neighborhood,"" Johannes Hahn said on Twitter, although he also said: ""America and Europe have always been strongest when they worked together.""During his campaign, Trump promised radical changes in U.S. policy, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioned the cost of U.S. military and other commitments in Europe.
The EU faces a more aggressive Russia to the east, conflicts in the Middle East to the south and an increased threat from Islamist militants among others.The conservative leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said: ""The message is clear: it is now up to Europe. We must be more self-confident and assume more responsibility. We do not know what to expect from the USA.
""For the political culture in Europe, this is another wake-up call.""

By Jason Szep

 (Editors note: Attention to language in paragraph 30 that may be offensive to some readers)By Jason SzepELLSWORTH, Maine ""He lies,"" huffed Janet Foster.""And he's a dirty old man,"" chimed in her sister Jean as they discussed Donald Trump's flaws a few days before he was elected the new president of the United States.""Well, I am with him,"" their brother Paul, 60, interjected, raising his voice over snacks of cheese, muffins and crackers in the family's living room. ""Hillary Clinton is like a puppet - you know it's all scripted.""The 2016 U.S. election was unprecedented in the way it turned Americans against each other, according to dozens of interviews in rural United States and across some of the most politically charged battleground states. It divided families like the Fosters in rural Ellsworth, Maine, broke up friendships and turned neighbor against neighbor.In a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, 15 percent of respondents said they had stopped talking to a family member or close friend as a result of the election. For Democrats, this shoots up to 23 percent, compared to 10 percent for Republicans. And 12 percent had ended a relationship because of it.There was no comparative polling data from previous elections. But interviews with relationship counselors and voters suggest this election stood out by summoning passions, anger and a divisiveness in ways that will make healing difficult after Clinton's loss to Trump on Tuesday.Sarah Guth, a Democrat in Colorado, says her father - an ardent supporter of Trump - no longer speaks with her after they clashed on Facebook over their political views.""He crossed a line,"" she said.After attending a Trump rally, Guth wrote on Facebook that she saw 10 minorities among thousands of people. ""I'm increasingly convinced that this election is about race,"" she wrote. ""I mean a fear among the white majority that their rule is coming to an end.""Some posters told her ""to go to hell,"" she recalled in an interview. ""And then my dad very publicly attacked me, telling me that I should be ashamed of myself."" The two have not spoken since.Ty Turner-Bond, a 35-year-old black man in North Carolina, says he lost friends because of his support for Trump. Some called him an ""Uncle Tom,"" a slur for African Americans accused of deferring to white people; others threatened violence.    

""PEOPLE ARE TENSE""
In Springfield, a city on Ohio's Mad River, Duke Level, 57, voted for Trump because he wanted ""a wrecking ball"" to hit Washington. The owner of Un Mundo Cafe isn't surprised this election created divisions, and he fears they could get worse.""This is one of those crossroads crisis moments in history,"" he said. Hours earlier, Trump rallied about 5,000 supporters a few miles away in a dirt-floored livestock arena. He blasted Clinton as ""the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency,"" drawing chants of ""lock her up,"" as well as a few of ""string her up.""Down the street, Richard Scott, 51, an African-American supporting Clinton, shook his head when told of those chants. Those words, he said, recalled 20th Century lynchings of black Americans - including in Springfield where a black prisoner was shot and hung from a pole on Main Street in 1904.""It's terrible,"" he said.Weeks ago, he planted a Clinton sign in his yard. His neighbors put up Trump signs. Outside the funeral home he owns, a pro-Clinton sign was defaced with a ""Hillary for Prison"" sticker. ""People are tense,"" said Scott.The election hardened an already-clear racial divide in the former industrial city of 60,000 people - a snapshot of America at about 75 percent white and 18 percent black. Interviews with residents suggested its northern areas, mostly affluent and white, would vote for Trump, while its mostly black, lower-income southern section would largely support Clinton.
""There is a division in this town, economically and racial. And we saw that in this election,"" said Bob Leath, 58, owner of Buckeye PC Repair who voted for Trump to ""clean house"" in Washington. ""If you voted for Clinton, you were most likely either young, lower-income or from the south side of the area.""For some, the tensions reach the bedroom. Sam Nail, a Cincinnati marriage counselor, said he has two couples who cited the election season as a ""stressor"" in their relationship.Much of the anger gets uncorked on social media and will be hard to undo. Some is well publicized. National Review writer David French has written about ""an unending torrent of abuse"" he and his family faced online from white nationalist Trump supporters, including a Tweeted image of his 7-year-old daughter's face in a gas chamber.Others are less well known, like Brenda Thomas' tangles with her older brother on Facebook. She says her brother unleashed a daily stream of Facebook posts on Clinton and President Barack Obama that she found objectionable. She said when her husband, a Republican, tried to reason with him, he was ""unfriended"" on Facebook.""I feel that I have to walk on eggshells with him and it causes problems at family functions,"" said Thomas, 63, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky.  In Charlotte, North Carolina, Karen Wilson, describes this election as ""stressful"" on Facebook. ""I've got family members who are mad at me for deleting entire Facebook threads when I thought they were becoming too negative. I've deleted Facebook friends who I realized I never should have been friends with in the first place,"" said Wilson, 43. Fourteen percent of respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they had blocked a family member or close friend from social media because of the election. For Democrats, this rises to 23 percent compared to 8 percent for Republicans.
    
""FREE SPEECH ATTACK""
The divisions tore into the fabric of some communities. In Provo, Utah, Trump supporter Loy Brunson awoke on an October morning to find his car spray-painted with the words ""AmeriKKKa"" - a reference to ""KKK"" white supremacists - and ""Fuck Trump."" His two Trump yard signs were destroyed.""So I doubled down, got motivated and put up 85 signs in my yard,"" he said. Within days, all but six of those were stolen.""This was more than vandalism,"" he said in an interview. ""This was a free speech attack.""Some blame the divisiveness on campaign rhetoric that inflamed racial, ethnic and class tensions that have long simmered in America. Angry and extremist language moved into the mainstream. George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at University of California, Berkeley, blames Trump's use of language, which he ranks as among the most violent of any candidate in modern times. He specifically notes Trump's suggestion in August that gun rights activists could take matters into their own hands if Clinton defeated him, as well as the New York businessman's comments that she should go to prison.""When you have extremes of that order, you have extremes of anger, extremes of fear,"" Lakoff said.In Mississippi, Chad Scott, an activist in the Clay County Republican Party, fears a post-election split between the party's working-class Trump supporters and business-minded elites - a sentiment echoed in Maine, where Foster, the Ellsworth resident at odds with his sisters, witnessed the election's political vitriol first hand. Foster's van was one of 20 vehicles spray-painted outside a Trump rally on Oct. 15 in the city of Bangor. And across Ellsworth, pro-Trump yard signs were stolen almost as fast as they were planted, Republican officials say. Foster worries about the divisions ahead. ""My sisters will forgive me for my political views,"" he said.  ""But the country is going to be on fire.""
