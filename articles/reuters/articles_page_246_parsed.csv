By Karen Brooks

The Louisiana legislature on Wednesday passed a bill requiring women to wait three days before receiving an abortion, tripling the state's existing waiting time in one of the most stringent regulations of its kind nationally.Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, has said he plans to sign the bill championed by anti-abortion groups. It passed with wide support from the Republican-controlled legislature.The bill requires a woman to wait at least 72 hours after a state-mandated ultrasound for the procedure. The current waiting time is 24 hours, the same as in most states with waiting periods.Only five other states require 72-hour waiting periods: Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah.The measures are among a wave of laws being adopted by states as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion. 
Advocates of extending the Louisiana waiting period say women need more time to consider alternatives and the consequences of ending a pregnancy.""Many of them come to regret their decision later in life,"" Deanna Wallace, legislative director for Louisiana Right to Life, said in a telephone interview. The measure is ""empowering them with additional time to consider all of the options.""Opponents of the legislation see it as the latest attempt to block women's access to abortions.
""Politicians in Louisiana have made it their mission to restrict access to safe and legal health care -- with women in the state left to pay the price,"" Amanda Allen, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement, urging the governor to veto the measure. Louisiana also requires women to make two separate visits to a clinic to obtain an abortion, seen as an additional burden on women forced to take extra time off work and away from families, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive health policy.    
Missouri, South Dakota and Utah have similar policies, while North Carolina and Oklahoma allow women to receive the initial counseling by phone.The Louisiana legislation includes an exception for women living 150 miles or farther from an abortion clinic. They will remain under the current 24-hour waiting requirement.

WASHINGTON Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Wednesday criticized Donald Trump for declining to release his tax returns, saying the only explanation was that the documents contained a ""bombshell"" about the real estate mogul.""It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters,"" Romney said in a Facebook post about Trump, who became the likely Republican nominee when his rivals dropped out last week.""There is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trump's refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them,"" Romney said. ""Given Mr. Trump's equanimity with other flaws in his history, we can only assume it's a bombshell of unusual size.""
Trump has said that he will make public his tax returns on the completion of an audit.

By Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday he was trying to be as constructive as possible as he looked forward to a Thursday meeting with presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump aimed at unifying the fractured party.But Ryan, the most high-profile Republican who has not endorsed Trump, warned that bringing party factions together would take some time after a grueling primary season. This suggested there might not be instant results from his get-together on Thursday with Trump and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.Trump's takeover of the Republican Party has shaken the party's establishment and prompted soul-searching over whether to reluctantly get behind him or cede any role in the Nov. 8 presidential election, when Hillary Clinton is expected to be his Democratic opponent.Trump faces pressure to tone down his rhetoric and clarify his policy positions as a step toward unifying the divided party. Some Republicans were alarmed at his recent talk of raising taxes on the wealthy.But Ryan also faces some pressure to smooth things over after saying last week that he was not yet ready to support Trump, an extraordinary statement that was seen as keeping some distance from the presumptive nominee and leaving open his prospects for running for president in 2020.""What we are trying to do is to be as constructive as possible, to have a real unification,"" Ryan told reporters on Wednesday after a meeting with his fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives.""After a tough primary, that's going to take some effort. We are committed to putting that effort in,"" said Ryan, who said he does not really know Trump.
""I want to be a part of that unifying process so that we are at full strength this fall, so that we can win this election. We cannot afford to lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" Ryan said.Ryan, 46, a conservative congressman since 1999 who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 2012, and Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire real estate developer, are very different Republicans who do not see eye to eye on many things, from immigration to trade.But Ryan said on Wednesday these differences are not at issue, because ""this is a big-tent party. There is plenty of room for different policy disputes in this party.""
One lawmaker at Wednesday's House Republican gathering raised a request for Trump to meet with all Republicans in the House, a source who was in the room said, asking not to be named. Such a meeting is expected to happen sometime before the July 18-21 Republican convention in Cleveland, the source said.On Tuesday night, Ryan spoke by phone for about 16 minutes with a Trump emissary, former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, according to Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams.Some Republicans have been rankled by Trump's policy proposals, including his declaration that NATO is obsolete and his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.But some House lawmakers who back Trump expressed their displeasure with Ryan for withholding his support at a small group meeting with the speaker later on Wednesday, an aide to one of the lawmakers said.
Trump has the potential to appeal to a greater number of Republican voters but must make changes to make party leaders more comfortable with him, Republican officials and lawmakers say. ""I think he has to show what kind of president that he would be,"" Senator Susan Collins said. ""But I believe he can do that, so I am not one who has foreclosed the possibility of eventually supporting him. But I need to see more from him.""After Ryan said last week he was not yet ready to support Trump, the candidate fired back that he was not ready to support Ryan's agenda. But on Wednesday, Trump had warm words for Ryan and said he thought they were doing fine.""We'll see what happens"" at the meeting, Trump told Fox News. ""If we make a deal, that'll be great. If we don't, we'll trudge forward like I've been doing.""

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump's support has surged and he is now running nearly even with Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely U.S. voters, a dramatic turnaround since he became the Republican party's presumptive presidential nominee, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.The results could signal a close fight between the two likely White House rivals as Americans make up their minds ahead of the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. As recently as last week, Clinton led Trump by around 13 points in the poll.In the most recent survey, 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, and 40 percent backed Trump, with 19 percent not decided on either yet, according to the online poll of 1,289 people conducted from Friday to Tuesday. The poll had a credibility interval of about 3 percentage points.

// ]]>

The results reflect a big increase in support for Trump since he knocked out U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich last week to become the last Republican in the White House race.There was no immediate comment from the Clinton or Trump campaigns.

Clinton, who has all but clinched the Democratic nomination over rival Bernie Sanders, has mostly led Trump in the head-to-head poll this year. Trump briefly matched her support a few times in 2016, most recently in mid-March, after U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a favorite of the Republican establishment, dropped out.
Presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but by the Electoral College, which is based on state-by-state results.
Opinions are likely to change over the next six months as American voters become inundated with hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign advertising, highly publicized debates and a pair of party conventions.Trump and Clinton both have much to prove to the American electorate. The Reuters/Ipsos poll found earlier this month that a majority of voters did not trust either candidate with key presidential responsibilities such as managing the U.S. economy, handling the role of U.S. commander in chief, and conducting themselves according to a ""high moral standard.""The candidates' choice of running mates could also be important. Voters surveyed in the poll said they would be more likely to support Clinton if her choice for vice president was a liberal, while Trump would help his chances if he picked someone experienced in politics and someone who is ""consistently"" conservative.
Trump's rise in the polls coincides with his attempt to take over the reins of the Republican Party from leaders who clashed with him during a bruising and blustery primary fight.U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the country's top elected Republican, said he would not immediately endorse Trump, and party elders including former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and the last two presidential nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, said they would not attend the Republican convention in Cleveland in July.

By Richard Cowan and Daniel Bases
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Republicans on a U.S. House of Representatives panel said they were making progress on a Puerto Rico debt relief bill that will take the same basic approach as an earlier failed version, despite cancelling plans to unveil new legislation on Wednesday.The House Natural Resources Committee said more time was needed to refine the bill's language. House Democratic leadership now expects legislation from the committee before the end of the week.Competing forces have fought over the bill and raised concerns that creditor rights and long-established municipal bond market hierarchy would be set aside in a broader plan to fix Puerto Rico's festering debt problems that have resulted in a breakdown in the island's social services.""The new bill itself already protects existing lawful creditor priorities and liens. The integrity of creditor hierarchy will be preserved,"" said Parish Braden, spokesman for the Natural Resources Committee said on Wednesday.HNRC Chairman Rob Bishop told Reuters on Monday the bill is still expected to include the installation of an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealth's credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan.""The introduction (of the bill) is not being delayed due to the underlying foundation of the board,"" Braden said, adding: ""There aren't hang ups. There are a number of refinements to the bill being made to ensure internal consistency among the titles (of the bill).""
 One source familiar with the delay said it was due to a need to refine language related to the minimum wage and land-use issues over the island of Vieques.U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday her party could not support the latest legislative effort but still hopes for an agreement within a few days.""We were disappointed that the bill we saw yesterday wasn't something we could support, and so another few days of back and forth I think will produce something that we can take to the floor,"" Pelosi told reporters.""I'm hoping maybe by Friday, so that we can have something for next week,"" she added.
Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its debt and faces an overall bill of $70 billion it cannot pay. A staggering 45 percent poverty rate and increased migration among its 3.5 million citizens to the U.S. mainland drains economic activity.The ranking Democrat on the HNRC issued a statement that said the families on the island needed relief from cuts to public services but remained hopeful a deal is close at hand.""We are making progress, but we are not there yet. The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, but a bill that doesn't solve the problem, or doesn't pass, won't help anyone,"" Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona said.
Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the island's main fiscal agent.The May 1 default and the nearly $2 billion July 1 debt payments have spurred congressional activity.""(Senator Chuck) Schumer from the Senate is pushing to get something done. But the problem here is that Democrats are going to push for protections for unions and for pensioners and we feel like they should be at the bottom of the heap because that's the way the law states,"" Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana, a Tea Party favorite and member of the HNRC, told Reuters on Wednesday.""I think there's just big divisions on how this goes. But I think the way it was previously set up, it's not going to fly,"" Fleming said.

By Daniel Trotta and Daniel Wiessner

 (This version of the May 10 story has been corrects to update new name of group to ""GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders"" from ""Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders,"" in the sixth paragraph)By Daniel Trotta and Daniel WiessnerThe legal battle over transgender rights between the state of North Carolina and the U.S. government has moved the country closer to settling one of the last frontiers in civil rights law. At issue is whether transgender people deserve the same federal protections that have been extended to groups such as blacks and religious minorities.Backers of the North Carolina law, which requires people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity, say it will protect women and girls from predators. Transgender advocates say that claim is unfounded and ignores a modern understanding of people who identify with a gender other than the one assigned at birth. The next step is likely to be a federal judge's decision on whether to impose an injunction, or temporary ruling, to void the North Carolina law pending a trial. Regardless of how a judge might rule on an injunction, the case stands to add to a growing body of legal decisions that have tended to side in favor of transgender rights but not enough to dissuade states like North Carolina. A handful of U.S. states and cities have attempted to enact measures affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, but North Carolina is the first state to focus on transgender people's use of public bathrooms.   ""This is absolutely a critical moment in terms of the focus and the answers that will come through these cases about the established scope of protections for transgender people,"" said Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders.The North Carolina law is the subject of four lawsuits in federal court, two on each side.
The U.S. Justice Department and an advocacy group, the American Civil Liberties Union, have each sought to strike it down, saying the law violates the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which jolted a divided nation into applying full rights to African-Americans a century after the abolition of slavery.North Carolina's governor and legislature both sued on Monday to protect their law, saying the Justice Department was trying to strike down a ""common sense privacy policy"" meant to protect the state's public employees. State officials also said if the Obama administration wants protections for transgender people, it should appeal to Congress to amend existing laws.GENDER AND LAW

At least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex -- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which covers and employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.The issue before the courts is whether ""sex"" also applies to gender identity. The Obama administration has taken a firm stance that transgender people are protected, a point that Attorney General Loretta Lynch emphasized on Monday.""The entire Obama administration wants you to know that we see you; we stand with you; and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward,"" Lynch told transgender people in remarks at a news conference. Lynch also threatened to withhold federal funding to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina while the legal case proceeds.
North Carolina stands to lose $4.8 billion in funds, mainly educational grants, if it does not back down from the law, according to an analysis by lawyers at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School.Unless North Carolina backs down, any ruling by a trial judge would likely be challenged and end up in a Virginia-based federal appeals court that only weeks ago issued an important ruling in favor of transgender rights.That court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, said a transgender teen from Virginia could sue his high school for being barred from using the boy's bathroom. The court noted that federal education officials have interpreted Title IX to apply to transgender people but did not directly rule on the issue. So far, only one appeals court has explicitly ruled that the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination against transgender people, in a 2005 case brought by a police officer. At least five other appeals courts have suggested that they agreed, some in cases involving other federal discrimination laws.The U.S. Supreme Court could help settle the matter, but experts said it was unlikely to take up any precedent-setting case any time soon.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Democrats defeated a Republican effort to undercut the Iran nuclear agreement on Wednesday by blocking an amendment to a spending bill that would have stopped the Obama administration from buying heavy water from Tehran.The amendment to an energy spending bill offered by Republican Senator Tom Cotton received 57 yes votes and 42 no votes. It had needed 60 yes votes to advance in the 100-member Senate.Cotton withdrew his amendment after the vote and the Senate is expected to vote later on a version of the spending bill without it.
The measure would have barred the use of U.S. government funds to purchase heavy water, which is non-radioactive and used in nuclear reactors and for making nuclear weapons.Under last year's nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and five other world powers, Tehran is responsible for reducing its stock of the substance, which it can sell, dilute or dispose of, under certain conditions. 
President Barack Obama's administration had warned Congress that it strongly opposed any move to prevent the planned purchase of $8.6 million-worth of heavy water from Iran.Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans had also banded together in late April to block the Cotton amendment, and hence the spending bill.
The dust-up had put a crimp in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's plans to pass bipartisan appropriations bills to keep the federal government functioning beyond Sept. 30, the end of the government's fiscal year. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Bill Rigby)"	['Obama', 'Cotton']	[]

By Amanda Becker and Jonathan Allen
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton on Tuesday in West Virginia's primary, winning over voters deeply skeptical about the economy and signaling the difficulty Clinton may have in industrial states in the general election.The loss slows Clinton's march to the nomination, but she is still heavily favored to become the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 election.In a November match-up with Donald Trump, Clinton will need to win over working-class voters in the U.S. Rust Belt, which includes key states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania.Trump, 69, won contests in West Virginia and Nebraska handily on Tuesday. The presumptive Republican nominee is set to meet with party leaders in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, including U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.After Ryan said last week that he was not yet ready to endorse Trump, Trump said on Sunday that he would have to decide whether he still wanted Ryan to preside over the party's July convention.Trump said in a Fox interview on Tuesday night that he would like Ryan to chair the convention as planned. ""He's a very good man, he wants what's good for the party,"" the New York billionaire said.Trump has zeroed in on Clinton's protracted battle with Sanders, a 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont. He has taunted Clinton in recent days by saying she ""can't close the deal"" by beating Sanders, her only rival for the Democratic Party's nomination since Feb. 1.Clinton, 68, has said she will ignore Trump's personal insults, including his repeated use of his new nickname for her, ""Crooked Hillary,"" and instead will criticize his policy pronouncements.
TOP CONCERNS: ECONOMY AND JOBS
Deep concerns about the economy underscored West Virginia's Democratic primary. Roughly six in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the U.S. economy in the next few years. The same proportion cited the economy and jobs was their most important voting issue, according to a preliminary ABC News exit poll.A remark Clinton made at an Ohio town hall in March that the country would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"" at an Ohio town hall in a comment may have hurt her with voters in coal-mining states such as West Virginia.
During Clinton's visit to West Virginia and Ohio last week she repeatedly apologized to displaced coal and steel workers for her comment, which she said had been taken out of context, and discussed her plan to help retrain coal workers for clean energy jobs.To secure the Democratic nomination, a candidate needs 2,383 delegates. Going into West Virginia, Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, had 2,228 delegates, including 523 so-called superdelegates, elite party members who are free to support any candidate. Sanders had 1,454 delegates, including 39 superdelegates. Another 29 delegates will be apportioned based on West Virginia's results.Clinton and Sanders will compete in another primary contest on May 17. Both candidates are also looking ahead to the June 7 contests, the last in the long nominating season, in which nearly 700 delegates are at stake, including 475 in California, where Sanders is now focusing his efforts.Sanders has vowed to take his campaign all the way to the Democrats' July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia, and wants a say in shaping the party's platform. 
Sanders has repeatedly told supporters at packed rallies that most opinion polls indicate he would beat Trump in a general election match-up by a larger margin than polls show Clinton defeating Trump.Trump, shifting into general election mode, has already begun to consider running mates. He told Fox on Tuesday night that he has narrowed his list to five people.He did not rule out picking New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former rival who ended his presidential bid in February. Christie, who endorsed Trump and then campaigned for him, on Monday was named to head Trump's White House transition team.
