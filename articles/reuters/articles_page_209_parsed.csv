NEW YORK New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Wednesday an agreement on a balanced $82.1 billion city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year that boosts reserves and expands a summer youth employment program. The agreement was reached with New York's City Council and comes well ahead of a July 1 deadline. De Blasio, a Democrat, said it was the earliest agreement since 2001 and credited the cooperation between his administration and the City Council.The agreement increases reserves, with an additional $250 million to grow the Retiree Health Benefits Trust Fund to $3.9 billion. It includes $1 billion every year in general reserves, and $500 million in the capital stabilization reserve.The budget highlights de Blasio's social mission. The executive budget, presented in April, dedicated $2 billion to overhauling the city's $7.5 billion public hospital system, which treat around 1.4 million people per year.
City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and other council members hailed the expansion of the city's summer youth work program to 60,000 at a press conference at City Hall. The program places young people aged 14-24 with community organizations for summer employment.
The budget agreement comes at a difficult time for de Blasio who is facing multiple investigations into his campaign finances. On Wednesday the head of New York City's prison guard union and a hedge fund financier were charged with operating a kickback scheme. It marked the first major prosecution to emerge from state and federal corruption probes examining de Blasio's fundraising practices, among other avenues of inquiry.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump kicked off a fierce general election battle, with Democrats accusing Trump of erratic behavior and the Republican threatening to bring up old Clinton scandals.           Clinton, the former secretary of state, made history when she became the first woman to lead a major political party in its quest to capture the U.S. presidency. Big primary election wins on Tuesday in California and elsewhere catapulted her to victory over Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders.If elected on Nov. 8, the 68-year-old former U.S. senator from New York would return the Clinton family to the White House 16 years after her husband, Bill Clinton, completed two terms as president.All signs point toward a negative campaign as Clinton accused Trump of being temperamentally unfit to serve and the New York businessman charged that Clinton had a dark past and a weak record as President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state.Clinton told NBC on Wednesday she would not run a ""campaign of insults,"" but she sought to portray the 69-year-old Trump as not fit for the Oval Office after the real estate developer repeatedly accused a Mexican-American judge of showing bias against him because of his ethnic heritage.The Clinton campaign has pointed to criticism from leaders in Trump's Republican Party to make this case.""I'm going to talk about why he's unqualified to be president based on his own words and his deeds. And I'm going to continue to make the case he is temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief,"" she said in the interview.Trump gave a carefully crafted primary race victory speech on Tuesday laying out his own plan of attack. To keep from straying off message, he used a Teleprompter and avoided his typical stream-of-consciousness delivery.Trump said money given to the Clinton Foundation charity from foreign donors had earned the Clintons millions of dollars and had a corrupting influence when Clinton was secretary of state.""Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund - the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese - all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. It's a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens,"" Trump said.    
He said he would give a speech next week ""discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons."" CLINTON LEADS 
A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed Clinton leading Trump by 10 percentage points nationally, little changed from a week earlier. [nL1N18Y1Z2]Both Clinton and Trump must unite their parties but the Democrat appeared to face the easier path with Sanders, a leftist U.S. senator from Vermont, nearly out of options to challenge her. Trump has an uphill battle. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan described Trump's remarks about the judge as a ""textbook definition of a racist comment,"" but said he would still support him.
Trump said on Wednesday he was ""disappointed and surprised"" by charges of racism from Republicans. ""I had just won more votes than anyone in the history of the party,"" he told Time. ""But you know, they have to say what they have to say. I'm a big boy. They have to say what they have to say.""    Ryan met behind closed doors on Wednesday with House Republicans. An aide said Ryan ""discussed with his members the thinking behind his endorsement (of Trump) and how to move forward"" and reiterated he had confidence Trump would support the House Republican agenda.    ""I'd say the general attitude is, 'Good. Now let's just move on,'"" said U.S. Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Trump supporter. ""The irony here and the frustration was that he's not racist.""Others said Trump needed to stop engaging in petty battles with former rivals and build a fundraising organization. Trump will meet on Thursday in New York with top fundraisers of the Republican National Committee, a party official said.
Hopes flickered among some anti-Trump Republicans that there would be a revolt against him when delegates convene to nominate him formally in Cleveland from July 18 to 21. Representative Morgan Griffith, a Virginia Republican, said that was unlikely but that Trump needed to improve as a candidate.""Don't step into the cow pie,"" Griffith said. ""He can't afford to be stepping into any more controversies like that.""Clinton edged Sanders out in a rough-and-tumble battle that stretched over four months and 50 states. She won support, especially among older voters, with a more pragmatic campaign focused on building on the policies of fellow Democrat Obama.Clinton said she had spoken to Sanders on Tuesday to congratulate him on his campaign.""I am looking forward to working with him to unify the Democratic Party against the threat that Donald Trump poses to our country,"" she told PBS on Wednesday. ""So we are talking. We will be having an opportunity to discuss in greater detail in the days ahead how we can best work together.""    Democratic Party elites are lined up squarely behind Clinton, including most likely Obama, who may endorse her as early as this week. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama would not endorse until after he meets with Sanders on Thursday.Obama and Sanders have spoken three times in the past month, Earnest said. The president's eventual endorsement would put pressure on Sanders to exit graciously and throw his support to Clinton. Sanders is also due to meet with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday said she will deliver an economic agenda address soon to contrast her policy differences with Republican Donald Trump, according to an interview with the Wall Street Journal. In the interview, the presumptive Democratic nominee called her Republican counterpart's statements on the economy ""dangerously incoherent,"" and vowed to propose a tax-cut plan for the middle class.
""It's not hard to see how a Trump presidency could actually lead to a serious global economic crisis,"" she said.

By Hilary Russ

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Wednesday signed into law new measures to expand the sale of bottled wine to certain private stores, a move that could generate millions in state revenues through taxes and licensing fees.Pennsylvania is one of just two U.S. states, along with Utah, with full control over its liquor sale system - owning and operating retail and wholesale operations.""This is truly a historic day for Pennsylvania and the most significant step the commonwealth has taken to reform our liquor system in 80 years,"" Wolf said in a statement.
The new legislation, passed by lawmakers on Tuesday, moves wine sales beyond the state's publicly run system, allowing supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and hotels that already have licenses for carry-out beer to sell up to four bottles of wine to customers. [nL1N18Z1W7]
It also expands direct wine shipments by the case; liquor, wine and beer sales at casinos; and hours of operation at state stores, including on Sundays. The move is expected to increase retail wine sales overall and could add more than $150 million to state coffers.The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is the largest purchaser of wine and spirits in the United States. The state has an 18 percent liquor tax.

By Patricia Zengerle and Megan Cassella
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a closer security relationship between his country and the United States on Wednesday, in an address to the U.S. Congress stressing the importance of warming ties between the two countries.He dedicated much of the speech to the importance of fighting terrorism, thanking Congress for U.S. support after a Pakistan-based military group's rampage in Mumbai killed 166 people in 2008.""The fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels. And the traditional tools of military, intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight,"" Modi told a rare joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives.""We have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it. The need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation,"" Modi said.He leavened the speech to lawmakers, the first such address by an international leader since Pope Francis' in September, with jokes about Congress' bitter partisan divide and yoga. But Modi used it to make serious points about India's neighbor and arch-rival Pakistan and regional concerns about Chinese expansionism.""I commend the members of the U.S. Congress for sending a clear message to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains,"" he said, not mentioning either country by name.    Modi is on the U.S. leg of an international tour. On Tuesday, he met with President Barack Obama at the White House, where the two leaders said India agreed to work toward joining the Paris Agreement on climate change this year and discussed security and cyber security issues.
The visit, two years after Modi became prime minister, capped an improving relationship between New Delhi and the United States. Before he was elected, Modi was barred from even entering the country because of concerns about his handling of 2002 riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.PERSONAL TIES TO OBAMA
Today, he is one of the international leaders most popular in Washington, where Modi's government is seen as a counterbalance to China. He and Obama have a warm personal relationship.
""We are now standing shoulder to shoulder in ways that no one could have imagined a generation ago,"" Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs committee, said at a reception for Modi after the address. In a 45-minute speech interrupted by cheers and at least eight standing ovations, the 65-year-old Indian leader said deeper U.S.-Indian security cooperation should isolate anyone who harbors, supports or sponsors terrorists.Although he did not mention Pakistan, that line was greeted with applause from the lawmakers, many of whom are increasingly frustrated with what they see as Islamabad's failure to crack down on militants behind attacks on American troops in Afghanistan.
Modi also stressed that India is committed to helping rebuild a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.Amid heightened tensions over China's assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea, Modi said a stronger U.S.-India partnership could boost peace and prosperity ""from Asia to Africa and from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific."" He did not mention China.""It can also help ensure security of the sea lanes and commerce and freedom of navigation on seas,"" Modi added.Democrats leaped to their feet when Modi referred to the recent climate change summit. But Republicans in the House chamber remained seated, reflecting the U.S. political divide over the issue.House Speaker Paul Ryan greeted Modi at his office before his speech. After the Indian leader's remarks, he attended lunch with congressional leaders and a reception with members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees.

Two men have filed a lawsuit against Tennessee and its governor saying their constitutional rights as gay individuals are violated by a new law that allows mental health counselors to refuse to treat patients on the basis of ""sincerely held principles.""The law, signed by Republican Governor Bill Haslam in April, has been criticized as discriminatory against the gay community.The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday by Bleu Copas and Caleb Laieski in the Chancery Court for Anderson County, asks the court to void the statute because it violates the Tennessee Constitution and the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens under the law.""LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) persons were the target of the statute. They are singled out for discriminatory treatment. There is no other group which could conceivably be the target of the statute,"" the lawsuit reads in part.A court employee sent Reuters a copy of the complaint on Wednesday via email.
Jennifer Donnals, press secretary for Governor Haslam, said in an emailed statement: ""We are not able to make comments on pending litigation.""The law protects therapists and counselors from legal action when they cite their personal principles in refusing service, despite a provision in the American Counseling Association's code of ethics barring members from such denials of service.
In the lawsuit, Copas says he is a homosexual man and a resident of Anderson County, Tennessee, while Laieski says he is homosexual and describes himself as a national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights activist residing in Alexandria, Virginia.With gay marriage becoming a lost cause for opponents - the Supreme Court ruled in June that same-sex couples have the right to marry - a new battleground has become a quest by conservatives in some states to allow people to refuse services to gay men and women on religious grounds. tinyurl.com/hj29fs9
The Tennessee law is among a number of state statutes passed over the last year or so, prohibiting sanctions against businesses, service providers, professionals or clerics who refuse service, in some cases to same-sex couples or in other cases to individuals, based on profoundly held beliefs.Some states, such as Arkansas and Indiana, enacted fixes to the measures after large companies and rights groups assailed them as discriminatory.

By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A former senior official in the Reagan administration and prominent Republican foreign policy insider told Reuters he provided input for the late-April foreign policy speech by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.""I was asked to contribute material"" for Trump's April 27 speech at the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said Richard Burt.Burt said he is not part of Trump's campaign.""But I am happy to talk to people looking for advice on foreign policy issues,"" said Burt, a managing director of McLarty Associates, a Washington-based consulting firm co-founded by former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff and counselor Thomas ""Mack"" McLarty. Burt said he also would be willing to offer foreign policy advice to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, if she asked for such advice, though he added, ""She's not going to.""Burt is also chairman of Global Zero, an independent group devoted to ridding the world of nuclear weapons. Trump told The New York Times in April that he was not sure it would be ""a bad thing"" for the United States if Japan had nuclear weapons, and has said the same about South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
Burt said the main theme he talked about to Trump was the need for the United States to pursue a ""more realist foreign policy,"" in which the United States would avoid seeking ""regime change"" abroad, and instead make protecting the United States and its interests the main policy goal. Trump, who became the Republican's presumptive nominee last month after the last of his challengers dropped from the party's race, articulated this theme again in a campaign speech late on Tuesday, as he claimed victory in the last Republican nominating contests.Under Reagan, Burt headed the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and then its European and Canadian Affairs bureau and served as U.S. ambassador to Germany from 1985 to 1989.
Some of Burt's contemporaries from the administrations of Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, have publicly denounced Trump's foreign policy views or remained mute.Earlier this year, Trump met with a group of 11 foreign policy advisers, headed by Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Trump's most outspoken supporters. 
Reuters sought comment on the recent activities of Trump's foreign policy team from several of its members and from a campaign spokeswoman. Most declined to comment, and the campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment. One campaign team member, who asked for anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly, said that while the team had held several discussions since Trump's speech, the candidate remains his own most important foreign policy adviser.

NEW YORK Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia has emerged as the online betting favorite to be presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's running mate while Bernie Sanders' chances have slipped, online predictions market PredictIt said.Kaine topped a list of potential vice president candidates with about 20 percent probability, followed by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts with about 17 percent and U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez with about 14 percent.The website, which allows users to wager small amounts of money, said Sanders' chances of joining Clinton's race for the White House were about 10 percent. Big election wins on Tuesday catapulted Clinton to victory over Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, although he has vowed to go on contesting the race.
Bets on Clinton winning the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election were going for 66 cents while bets on Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominees, were traded at just 33 cents.On the Republican side, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama was leading the race to be Trump's running mate at 20 percent, followed by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa at 17 percent, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at 15 percent and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at 9 percent.
The latest opinion poll by Reuters/Ipsos on Tuesday showed Trump trails Clinton by 10 points in the 2016 presidential campaign, showing little change from a week ago.
