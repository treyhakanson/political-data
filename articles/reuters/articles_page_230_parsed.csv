WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday rejected a bipartisan deal reached in the House of Representatives on legislation to address Puerto Rico's debt crisis, calling it a concession to Wall Street.Breaking with the Obama administration, Sanders called on Senate colleagues to instead back an alternative he has proposed to allow the U.S. territory the same access to restructure its debt in bankruptcy court that is afforded to municipalities.Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives last week unveiled a bill, hammered out in talks between lawmakers from both parties, that included a framework for restructuring Puerto Rico's $70 billion in debt and putting the island's financial operations under the control of a federal oversight board.A House vote is expected in the first week of June, ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due on July 1, but any legislation would have to clear the Senate as well.Democratic congressional leaders have acknowledged disagreements with some parts of the bill but said negotiations had led to a workable compromise, and the Obama administration has urged Congress to quickly pass it.""It is critical that Congress pass this as there are very significant bond payments due in July,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said last week. ""Time is of the essence.""
Sanders' rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, has also backed the legislation.But Sanders, who represents Vermont as an independent but who caucuses with Democrats, said Wall Street would benefit at the expense of Puerto Rico's workers.
""This legislation looks out for the needs of Wall Street vulture funds first and foremost. That is unacceptable,"" he wrote in a letter to Senate colleagues on Monday.He cited provisions exempting residents from new overtime protections and allowing minimum wage on the island to dip to $4.25 for a period of up to five years, far lower than the U.S. minimum wage of $7.25. Instead, Sanders said the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury Department could find other solutions, such as providing loans to Puerto Rico's electric authority and water agency, and directly purchasing new bonds issued by the U.S. commonwealth.

By Gary Robertson
| RICHMOND

RICHMOND Virginia Republicans on Monday sued to nullify Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe's order restoring voting rights to 206,000 felons, a move that could affect the November presidential election.The lawsuit in the Virginia Supreme Court asked justices to require the voting registrars not to sign up felons based on McAuliffe's April 22 order and to cancel felons' registrations since the order was issued.Republicans argued that McAuliffe's order was unconstitutional. The lawsuit was headed by leaders of the Republican-controlled state legislature.""The Governor is authorized to restore the voting rights of any convicted felon through an individualized grant of clemency, but he may not issue a blanket restoration of voting rights,"" the lawsuit said.Virginia is considered a key swing state in the 2016 election. The governor's order could tip the balance in favor of the Democratic candidate who wins the party's nomination.
House Speaker William Howell said in a statement that  McAuliffe's order violated 240 years of practice.""Governor McAuliffe's executive order defies the plain text of the Constitution, flouts the separation of powers, and has no precedent in the annals of Virginia history,"" Howell said.
McAuliffe and other Democrats have hailed the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation as being long overdue.Since signing the order, McAuliffe has said that nearly 80 percent of the felons whose rights were restored are nonviolent offenders who have been free for more than a decade.Caucasian felons made up 51.5 percent of the total whose rights were restored, and African-Americans 45.9 percent.
Before McAuliffe's order, felons had to petition the governor individually for restoration of their voting rights. About two dozen states have eased restrictions on felons casting ballots over the past two decades, according to the Sentencing Project, a prison reform advocacy group.

By Ellen Wulfhorst

NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a Supreme Court decision on abortion rights is highly anticipated in the United States, few are as uniquely positioned to assess its impact as reproductive rights attorney Kathryn Kolbert, who argued the last major abortion case before the high court.In that 1992 challenge, the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion survived, but the Supreme Court allowed for such state regulations as waiting periods.The decision was written by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter, who have retired, and Justice Anthony Kennedy.Kennedy is seen as pivotal in the current case which picks up, in a sense, where the earlier case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, left off.This time, the court is deciding if Texas has created an undue burden for women by imposing stiff regulations on abortion clinics and doctors. Critics say the rules are a backdoor means to restrict access to abortion, known as TRAP laws.More than half of Texas' clinics have closed, leaving fewer than 20, advocates say, to serve the state of 27 million people.Hardest hit have been rural, poor women for whom distance and cost have put abortions out of reach, they say.Supporters of the laws say they protect women's health, however. The regulations require clinics to upgrade to hospital standards and doctors performing abortions to have formal agreements to admit patients to local hospitals. Kolbert, who heads the Athena Center for Leadership Studies at New York's Barnard College, talked with the Thomson Reuters Foundation about the Supreme Court and abortion rights.She co-founded the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, which is representing Whole Women's Health, the chain of clinics challenging the Texas regulations.THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION: It seems the issues being addressed in the Texas case come out of the Casey case, that the regulations are an undue burden.KOLBERT: The main issue in the case is how the undue burden standard will be interpreted going forward.The whole question comes down to Justice Kennedy and how he sees that standard, and he frankly is much more in the middle.
Does he come back to what he articulated in Casey, or is he pushed a little bit to the right with the influence of the other justices? For me, the biggest concern is Justice O'Connor, who he clearly listened to, is no longer on the court.TRF: What do you think in essence underlies the abortion issue?KOLBERT: It's an issue that ties together the coalitions on the right, the fundamentalists, the Catholics, the people who basically are business conservatives.It's about power. It's about equality. There's a lot of pushback in America still about giving women the ability to go beyond what they are, their life as a wife and mother, which is the culturally dominant view. TRF: TRAP laws are often hard to explain because they seem so benign.KOLBERT: That's a strategy. Those who are writing these restrictions are looking for things that sound reasonable but in practice are incredibly problematic for women, particularly those who have less political power. So young women and poor women are the first that are going to be affected negatively.
If you look at every restriction that's been introduced since 1973, they are all under the guise of reasonableness.TRF: Texas is the case being tested. Is it safe to say there are similar situations in other states?KOLBERT: All over the country, yes. Frankly, if this is upheld the same statute will be enacted in 25 states within three years. That's what makes it so dangerous.TRF: What are the possibilities of what the Supreme Court could do?KOLBERT: Remember the court has got only eight justices right now, so the option is really one of three.
We win five to three, which means that we have (Justice Elena) Kagan, (Justice Stephen) Breyer, (Justice Sonia) Sotomayor, (Justice Ruth) Ginsberg and Kennedy.... Kennedy wrote Casey, so that's a reasonable assumption.The second possibility is that the court would not make a decision right now and would send the case back for taking of additional evidence ... which is what I think of as looking for an out.They could remand the case for a determination of whether or not there are a sufficient number of clinics within the state to handle the excess capacity of women needing abortions that would happen when you close so many clinics.So we could win, there could be an 'out' or we could lose. If the court divided four-four..., then the lower court decision would be upheld.That would be interpreted as a major win for the anti-abortion groups, and we would see laws like this in every state in the country.TRF: If you had to put your money on any of those three options, which one do you see more likely?KOLBERT: I certainly hope that we can keep Justice Kennedy. If not, then I think they'll send it back for more evidence.TRF: What's it like to argue a case before the Supreme Court? KOLBERT: It's pretty awesome, it's scary. For me though it was all about the women we were representing. It's the doctors and the clinics, the providers who do the hard work, who meet with women facing unintended pregnancies every single day.It was being able to be a spokesperson for them and to explain their plight and explain what they're going through that was the most gratifying part of the job.

By John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cranked up his fight with party leaders on Sunday, backing a challenger to the Democratic National Committee's chairwoman and accusing the party's establishment of trying to anoint Hillary Clinton as the nominee for president.In a series of television interviews, Sanders remained defiant despite what he acknowledged was an uphill fight to overtake front-runner Clinton. Clinton has said she already considers herself the de facto nominee and is increasingly turning her attention to Donald Trump, saying on Sunday that the rhetoric of the presumptive Republican nominee was dangerous.Sanders told ABC's ""This Week"" program that Americans should not have to choose between ""the lesser of two evils"" in the Nov. 8 election.Sanders said that if he won the White House, he would not reappoint U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chairwoman. He also endorsed law professor Tim Canova, who is challenging the Florida congresswoman in the August Democratic primary.""Do I think she is the kind of chair that the Democratic Party needs? No, I don't,"" Sanders told CBS' ""Face the Nation.""""Frankly, what the Democratic Party is about is running around to rich people's homes and raising obscene sums of money from wealthy people. What we need to do is to say to working-class people - we are on your side,"" he said.The defiant tone by Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has worried some Democrats anxious to see Clinton begin to unify the party and turn her attention to an election showdown with Trump.Clinton painted Trump as a risk of the sort voters had not seen before in an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that aired on Sunday.
""I do not want Americans, and, you know, good-thinking Republicans, as well as Democrats and independents, to start to believe that this is a normal candidacy,"" she said. ""It isn't."" Trump has gained ground in opinion polls as Republicans begin to rally around his candidacy. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Sunday showed Trump with a 2-point lead over Clinton, within the margin of error. In early March, Clinton led Trump by 9 points in the same poll.But Sanders has ignored growing Democratic calls to step aside and repeated his vow to stay in the race until the party's July 25-28 nominating convention in Philadelphia despite Clinton's nearly insurmountable lead in pledged convention delegates who will choose the nominee.He said he wanted to do away with superdelegates - party leaders who are free to support any candidate. Their rush to back Clinton even before votes had been cast amounted to ""an anointment process,"" Sanders said.
'LESSER OF TWO EVILS""
He promised to influence the party platform and party rules even if he was not the nominee, but said if Clinton did not move toward his views on reining in Wall Street, reducing income equality and other issues, ""she's going to have her problems.""""I don't want to see the American people voting for the lesser of two evils. I want the American people to be voting for a vision of economic justice, of social justice, of environmental justice, of racial justice,"" he said on ABC.After Sanders' endorsement of her opponent, Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that she would remain neutral in the  Democratic presidential race.
Democratic worries about party unity were exacerbated by last weekend's state party convention in Nevada, where unhappy Sanders supporters disrupted the proceedings in a dispute over rules.That raised fears about possible chaos at the national convention in Philadelphia. But Sanders disputed media reports describing the Nevada incident as violent.""What happened is people were rude, that's not good, they were booing, that's not good, they behaved in some ways that were a little bit boorish, not good, but let's not talk about that as violence,"" he said on ABC.Sanders said he was not encouraging protests at the Philadelphia convention, ""but of course people have the right to peacefully assemble and make their views heard.""    Clinton said in the NBC interview that she would talk to Sanders about his policy demands and take them into account ""when he's ready to talk.""

WASHINGTON U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter called his Japanese counterpart on Saturday to express regrets after an American working at a U.S. military base in Japan was arrested on suspicion of dumping the body of a Japanese woman.The case in Okinawa has sparked a protest from Tokyo and could add to resentment of the large U.S. military presence on the island, where Japanese have long been upset by crimes committed by Americans. It also is likely to stir anti-U.S. sentiment as President Barack Obama visits Japan next week.In his call to Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, Carter ""extended his sincere apologies to the victim's family and friends,"" Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement.""He also expressed his sympathies to the people of Japan,"" the statement said. A 32-year-old American working at the base on Okinawa admitted to abandoning the corpse of a 20-year-old Japanese woman but did not comment about whether he had killed her, an Okinawa police spokesman said earlier this week.
The Pentagon has said the man was a contractor but did not name him.The Pentagon statement said the Defense Department would cooperate with the Japanese government in the investigation and work to prevent similar incidents.
Obama is going to Japan for a Group of Seven summit and also will become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima, a city destroyed by a U.S. atomic bomb 71 years ago in World War Two.Okinawa, the site of a bloody World War Two battle, hosts the bulk of U.S. military forces based in Japan since the war     with U.S. installations taking up about 18 percent of the island.

By Emily Flitter
| LOUISVILLE, Ky.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump assured gun owners on Friday he would protect their constitutional right to bear arms and eliminate gun-free zones if elected, accusing Democrat Hillary Clinton of wanting to weaken gun rights.Trump, who will almost certainly be the Republican presidential nominee, picked up the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, a politically powerful lobbying group which claims more than 4 million members. Trump's remarks at the NRA's national convention in Louisville, Kentucky, were not a surprise, but they could solidify his status among conservatives who see protecting the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment as a top priority. Trump also planned to meet on Monday with U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a source close to the Trump campaign said. The two are expected to consult on foreign policy. The source said Corker remains on Trump's list of potential vice presidential running mates.Clinton, who is close to clinching the Democratic Party's nomination for the Nov. 8 election, has vowed to take on the gun lobby and expand gun control measures to include comprehensive background checks for gun buyers, including at open-air gun shows and online.Trump, who is trying to unite the Republican Party behind him after a brutal primary battle, accused Clinton, a former secretary of state to President Barack Obama, of wanting to end the 2nd Amendment, which says in part that the people's right to keep and bear arms ""shall not be infringed."" 
""Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment, not change it; she wants to abolish it,"" Trump said.Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Maya Harris said Trump is peddling falsehoods and denounced ""Donald Trump's conspiracy theories."" She said Clinton believes there are ""common-sense steps we can take at the federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals"" while protecting the Second Amendment.Trump told the NRA he would eliminate gun-free zones imposed in some areas, noting that the 2015 shooting deaths of four U.S. Marines at an armed forces recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, took place in a gun-free zone.
""The Second Amendment is on the ballot in November,"" he said. ""The only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person you know: Donald Trump.""The NRA's convention took place on the same day that a man brandished a gun at a checkpoint near the White House in Washington and was shot and wounded by a law enforcement officer.The New York billionaire's NRA speech was another step in his drive to make more conservatives comfortable with his candidacy. Earlier this week, he released a list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees who are conservative jurists, a step well-received on the right.
Many conservatives, who had backed other Republican candidates in the 2016 race, worry that Trump is a closet liberal on many issues.But Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said it was time for them to get over their qualms about the 69-year-old candidate.""If your preferred candidate is out of the race, it's time to get over it,"" Cox told the NRA audience. ""Are there valid arguments in favor of some over others? Sure. Will any of it matter if Hillary wins in November? Not one bit.""In another step toward trying to unify the party, Cox has invited members of Congress to a ""small roundtable discussion"" with one of Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., on Wednesday at the Capitol Hill Club near the U.S. Capitol, a copy of the invitation said.

By Emily Stephenson and Grant Smith

Donald Trump raised $1.7 million from donors and loaned his White House campaign $7.5 million in April as he moved closer to becoming the Republican nominee for president, according to documents filed with the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Friday.The New York businessman had loaned his campaign a total of $43.5 million as of the end of April, the filings showed. More recently, he has made moves to build up his fundraising operation with an eye toward the Nov. 8 general election.Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee in early May, when both of his rivals dropped out of the race. Trump self-funded much of his primary run, but he has said he will not rely as heavily on his own money for the general election, when he will face the Democratic nominee.Both people seeking the Democratic nomination have raised more than Trump.Hillary Clinton, the party's front-runner, brought in $26.4 million in April, including funds from a joint fundraising effort with the Democratic Party. 
An outside Super PAC supporting her campaign raised $8.6 million. A Super PAC is a fund-raising group that must operate separate from political campaigns but can raise unlimited sums.U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's rival for the Democratic nomination, raised $26.9 million in April. He has disavowed Super PACs. Trump has criticized them too, though a long-time Republican operative in May joined one Super PAC backing the real estate mogul.In May, Trump hired investor Steven Mnuchin as his national finance chairman and entered a joint fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee that will allow donors to write much bigger checks.
Friday's FEC filings do not reflect these moves, but they show that Trump's fundraising dipped in April, after he brought in about $3 million and loaned himself $11.5 million in March. He also spent less in April, $9.4 million compared with $13.8 million a month earlier, when more states held nominating contests.
Trump spent $2.6 million on advertising in April, less than half the $6.3 million he spent in March. By comparison, Sanders spent $17.3 million and Clinton spent $9.3 million on advertising in April.    Trump's consulting and payroll spending also dropped about 30 percent to a total $1.7 million in April, even as he added experienced political staff. At the end of March, he hired veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort.     Trump ended April with $2.4 million on hand, after starting the month with $2.1 million at the ready.

By Heide Brandes
| OKLAHOMA CITY

OKLAHOMA CITY Republican state lawmakers in Oklahoma have introduced a resolution urging the state's congressional delegation to start an effort to impeach President Barack Obama over a White House recommendation that schools accommodate transgender students.The Obama administration told U.S. public schools last week that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. The recommendation upset Republicans and raised the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority.The Oklahoma resolution, introduced on Thursday night, calls on the state's members of the U.S. House of Representatives to file articles of impeachment against Obama, the U.S. attorney general, the U.S. secretary of education and others over the policy. A vote has not yet been scheduled on the resolution.Legal experts told local media the impeachment call is on shaky ground since the recommendation offered non-binding guidance and did not have the force of law.Lawmakers in the socially conservative state took up another measure on Friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students.
That bill, introduced on Thursday night and referred to a Senate committee on Friday, could force schools into costly construction, which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a $1.3 billion state budget shortfall. State Representative John Bennett, a Republican, said in a statement the White House policy was ""biblically wrong,"" and a violation of state sovereignty.The Oklahoma bill would allow for segregation at school restrooms, athletic changing facilities and showers if a request is made to accommodate religious beliefs.  
It also allows the attorney general to file lawsuits to implement the changes. Impeachment advocates say Obama overstepped his constitutional authority.Troy Stevenson, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an LGBT advocacy group said the measure promoted fear-mongering and was out of place
""In a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth,"" he said in a statement. The measure was introduced just hours after state lawmakers approved a bill that would make abortions a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for doctors who perform them. Governor Mary Fallin, an anti-abortion Republican, vetoed the bill because it would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge, her office said.
