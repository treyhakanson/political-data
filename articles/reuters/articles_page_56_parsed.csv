By Luciana Lopez
| COCONUT CREEK, Fla.

COCONUT CREEK, Fla. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton warned her supporters on Tuesday against complacency as opinion polls show her holding a clear lead over Republican rival Donald Trump with two weeks left until the Nov. 8 election.Clinton told voters in Florida, one of the battleground states where the election will likely be decided, that Democrats could not afford to relax.""I hope you will come out and vote because it's going to be a close election. Pay no attention to the polls. Don't forget, don't get complacent, because we've got to turn people out,"" she told a rally in Coconut Creek, standing in front of a large sign reading: ""Vote Early.""  Trump also campaigned in Florida on Tuesday. He blasted recent spikes in premiums for health insurance under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Trump promised to repeal and replace the healthcare law as soon as he takes office.""This is why we have to drain the swamp and repeal and replace Obamacare immediately, and I'm the only candidate running for president who will do it,"" Trump said.On Monday, the U.S. government said the average premium for insurance plans sold on Healthcare.gov for 2017 rose by 25 percent compared with 2016.But with polls showing Trump trailing Clinton, Trump has asked his campaign to cut back on work identifying candidates for jobs in his future administration and focus instead on bolstering his chances on Nov. 8, according to two people familiar with the campaign's inner workings.
POWELL BACKS CLINTON
An average of national polls on the RealClearPolitics website since mid-October gives Clinton a lead of more than 5 percentage points, as Trump fights off accusations that he groped women and faces heavy criticism for suggesting he might not accept the result of the election if he loses.            Trump denies the accusations of sexual misconduct and says the election is rigged against him, although he has not cited widely accepted evidence to back that up.On Tuesday, Trump told Reuters that Clinton's plan for fixing the Syrian civil war would ""lead to World War Three,"" because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State was a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ""safe zones"" on the ground in Syria to protect noncombatants. Her campaign responded in a statement later on Tuesday noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts had deemed Trump ill-prepared to be commander in chief, and accusing Trump of ""parroting"" Russian President Vladimir Putin and playing on Americans' fears.Colin Powell, who served as Republican President George W. Bush's secretary of state and was chairman of the U.S. military's joint chiefs of staff under his father, Republican President George Bush, said on Tuesday he would vote for Clinton.    
The two candidates have sparred in recent days over the U.S.-backed Iraqi military push to take the northern Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State, which Trump described as a ""total disaster.""""He's declaring defeat before the battle has even started,"" Clinton, who was secretary of state during Obama's first term, said on Tuesday.   She urged supporters to participate in early voting, which began this week in Florida.""Nobody should want to wake up on Nov. 9 and wonder whether there was more you could have done,"" Clinton said.Clinton also appeared on Tuesday at the Univision studio in Doral, Florida, on ""El Gordo y La Flaca"" (""The Fat Man and the Skinny Woman""), a long-running entertainment show aimed at Latinos. The appearance underscored the importance of Latino voters in the battle for Florida's 29 electoral votes.Clinton maintained a commanding lead in the race to secure the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House, according to Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project results released on Saturday.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives plan a vote as soon as mid-November on a 10-year reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Act, congressional aides told Reuters on Tuesday, setting up a potential showdown with the White House and Senate.The Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, which expires on Dec. 31, allows trade, energy, defense and banking industry sanctions over Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile tests. Its fate is one of the major pieces of unfinished business facing lawmakers when they return to Washington on Nov. 14 for the first time after the Nov. 8 elections.U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is expected to introduce the 10-year renewal as soon as Congress gets back, aides said.Congressional aides said a ""clean"" renewal, meaning unchanged from the current legislation, was likely to pass the House. Its fate in the Senate was much less certain, and a White House spokesman would not say whether President Barack Obama would sign it into law.Republicans control majorities in both the House and Senate, and every Republican in Congress opposed the international nuclear deal announced in July 2015, in which Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions.Republicans have since tried repeatedly to pass legislation to clamp down on Iran, accusing Obama of being so eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy that he conceded too much to Tehran in the nuclear talks.Some Senate Republicans want more than a clean renewal of the ISA. They are trying to build support for legislation that would renew it but also do more to punish individual Iranians and businesses over the country's ballistic missile tests and what they see as its support for terrorism.
Some senators have also pushed for a law that would eliminate the president's right to waive sanctions for security reasons.IRANIAN FRUSTRATION
Obama's administration had asked Congress to hold off on renewing the ISA, saying it has enough power to reimpose economic sanctions if Iran violates the nuclear agreement even if it expires.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to say how Obama would respond to the bill if it passed both houses of Congress and reached his desk.""I won't prejudge at this point whether or not the president would sign that bill,"" Earnest told reporters traveling with the president in Los Angeles.""The president and the Treasury Department retain significant sanctions authority that already has been used to impose costs on Iran for their flagrant violation of their international obligations,"" he said. White House opposition to the bill could generate resistance from Democrats in the Senate, making it more difficult for any legislation to garner the 60 votes needed to move ahead.
Because Republicans hold only 54 seats in the 100-member chamber, they would need Democratic support to move any bill.Renewing the sanctions bill could also increase frustrations in Iran. Iranian officials have been complaining for months that remaining U.S. sanctions have frightened away trade partners and robbed it of too many benefits it was promised under the nuclear deal.A House Foreign Affairs Committee aide said addressing the ISA before it expires is a ""top priority"" for Royce.""The Iran Sanctions Act was enacted to curb Tehran's support for terrorism and its very dangerous weapons proliferation. It should remain in place until the regime stops exporting terror and threatening us and our allies with deadly weapons,"" Royce said in a statement sent to Reuters.""That's why I'll be introducing a bipartisan, long-term extension of these important sanctions,"" he said.

By Roberta Rampton
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES The Obama administration is evaluating whether an international agreement reached earlier this month to cut back on greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air conditioners will need approval by the U.S. Senate, the White House said on Tuesday.Nearly 200 countries, including the United States and China, signed on to a deal in Kigali, Rwanda that would reduce the use of factory-made hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it is unclear whether the accord, which is an amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate.
The 1987 Montreal Protocol succeeded in phasing out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), widely used at that time in refrigeration and aerosols.    
""There has been an ongoing analysis of the agreement to determine precisely what role Congress may have to play in ensuring that the United States can keep the commitments that were made in the context of that agreement,"" Earnest told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama at a fundraiser in Los Angeles.Obama believes the agreement would serve the national interest of the United States by helping to curb the impact of climate change and by bolstering U.S. companies that develop alternatives to HFCs, Earnest said.
He noted that any vote on the agreement would likely take place after Obama leaves office in January.""There will be a very strong case to make to the Senate about why they should approve this agreement, if in fact their approval is necessary,"" he said."	['Obama']	[]

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Trailing in opinion polls, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has asked his campaign to cut back on work identifying candidates for key jobs in his would-be administration and focus instead on bolstering his chances on Election Day, according to two people familiar with the campaign's inner workings.After months of bitter battling, Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has a commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency on Nov. 8, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project results released on Saturday, which mirror other national polls. People working on Trump's White House transition, which is led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, have been asked by Trump to narrow down those efforts and refocus on the race, the sources, who asked not to be identified, said Tuesday.They have, as a result, largely set aside efforts to identify candidates for key Cabinet positions, but are continuing work to fill lower-level jobs, such as Securities and Exchange Commission general counsel, that would allow Trump to begin basic work on his agenda if he won on Nov. 8, without worrying about winning political battles first.
Members of the transition team are also avoiding providing Trump with updates on the transition work to allow him and the campaign to focus the core of its efforts on improving his chances of winning the election, the sources said.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The sources did not say when Trump asked his campaign to reduce its transition work. But one of the two sources said that Christie has spent twice as much time helping Trump prepare for the three presidential debates, which occurred between Sept. 26 and Oct. 19, as he had on the transition work.A spokesman for Christie declined to comment.
A third source familiar with the campaign, who also asked not to be named, said a senior Trump official has been contacting Wall Street tycoons and other wealthy Republicans for recommendations on lower-level positions. That source said the Trump team has opened up its hiring search far beyond his core group of supporters and is even willing to consider people who have criticized the brash New York businessman.

By Daniel Wiessner

The Obama administration on Tuesday called on U.S. states to ban agreements prohibiting many workers from moving to their employers' rivals, saying it would lead to a more competitive labor market and faster wage growth. The administration said so-called non-compete agreements interfere with worker mobility and states should consider barring companies from requiring low-wage workers and other employees who are not privy to trade secrets or other special circumstances to sign them.Vice President Joe Biden in a statement said he had heard from a teacher in Nebraska who was barred from taking a summer job selling pet food to earn extra money. Among others, Biden also mentioned a salesman in Connecticut who was laid off and forced to spend his retirement savings because he was prohibited from accepting other sales jobs.""(Workers) can't reach their true potential without freedom to negotiate for a higher wage with a new company, or to find another job after they've been laid off,"" Biden said. 
Nearly every state allows non-compete agreements, and legal battles over their validity are common. Courts in determining whether the agreements are lawful generally focus on the length of time they are in effect, their geographical limits and whether employees had access to trade secrets. The issue drew attention from some lawmakers and advocacy groups in June when the attorney general of Illinois filed a lawsuit claiming non-compete agreements signed by employees of fast-food franchise Jimmy John's were unlawful. The company said it would stop using the agreements in order to settle the case. The Obama administration on Tuesday also urged states to ban non-compete agreements that are not proposed before a job offer or promotion is accepted and said employers should not be able to enforce the agreements when workers are laid off. 
The White House said 20 percent of U.S. workers are bound by non-compete agreements, including 14 percent of those earning less than $40,000 per year. But many businesses have legitimate reasons for requiring workers to sign the agreements, and states should not simply ban them for wide swaths of the work force, Beth Milito, senior legal counsel at the National Federation of Independent Business, said in an interview on Tuesday. 
""There need to be individualized assessments of the agreements that consider the industry and the geographical location,"" she said. (Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Tom Brown)"	['Obama']	[]

By Joseph Menn, Dustin Volz and Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Obama administration officials briefed key congressional staffers last week about a secret court order to Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) that prompted it to search all users' incoming emails for a still undisclosed digital signature, but they remain reluctant to discuss the unusual case with a broader audience.Executive branch officials spoke to staff for members of the Senate and House of Representatives committees overseeing intelligence operations and the judiciary, according to people briefed on the events, which followed Reuters' disclosure of the massive search.[nL2N1C601L]But attempts by other members of Congress and civil society groups to learn more about the Yahoo order are unlikely to meet with success anytime soon, because its details remain a sensitive national security matter, U.S. officials told Reuters. Release of any declassified version of the order is unlikely in the foreseeable future, the officials said.The decision to keep details of the order secret comes amid mounting pressure on the U.S. government to be more transparent about its data-collection activities ahead of a congressional deadline next year to reauthorize some foreign intelligence authorities.On Tuesday, more than 30 advocacy groups will send a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper asking for declassification of the Yahoo order that led to the search of emails last year in pursuit of data matching a specific digital symbol.
""We believe such a massive scan of the emails of millions of people, particularly if it involves the scanning of email content, could violate (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act), the Fourth Amendment, and international human rights law,"" the coalition wrote in an advance draft of the letter that was shared with Reuters. The Center for Democracy & Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Brennan Center, Human Rights Watch and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers are among the signatories.The groups say that Title I of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, under which sources said the order was issued, requires a finding that the target of such a wiretap is probably an agent of a foreign power and that the facility to be tapped is probably going to be used for a transmission. An entire service, such as Yahoo, has never publicly been considered to be a ""facility"" in such a case: instead, the word usually refers to a phone number or an email account.
The groups also pressed Clapper, who has pledged to be more transparent in the wake of controversial spying revelations, to explain how much authority the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has to order technical assistance from technology companies. Reuters reported that Yahoo had installed a special program that was hidden inside a Linux kernel module on its mail servers, where security staffers found it.Representative Justin Amash, who does not sit on one of the relevant committees, recently asked that all of Congress be briefed, given the significance of any change in interpreting foreign intelligence laws. 
""The briefing should involve all members, because all members will within about a year have to vote on a significant part of FISA,"" said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology, which circulated Tuesday's letter among free speech and privacy advocates. ""They should know what occurred so that they can decide whether to outlaw it."" Also last week, Yahoo itself asked Clapper to declassify the secret order or at least describe it, so that the company could respond to news reports and criticism that it did not do more to protect its users' communications. The American Civil Liberties Union meanwhile filed a motion in the surveillance court asking that the Yahoo order and other significant ruling going back a decade be unsealed.

Colin Powell, who served as secretary of state in Republican President George W. Bush's administration, said on Tuesday he would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election, according to Newsday newspaper.Powell, who made the announcement at an event hosted by a Long Island business group in Woodbury, New York, said Republican Donald Trump was ""not qualified"" and had sold Americans a ""bill of goods"" that he could not deliver, Newsday said.""He has insulted America in one way almost every day,"" Powell said of Trump, according to the newspaper.""He has insulted Latino Americans. He has insulted African-Americans. He has insulted women. He has insulted his own party. He has insulted our allies around the world one by one. He has insulted veterans,"" Powell said.He praised Clinton and said he considered the Democratic nominee a ""friend"" whom he had known for 20 years.
""She is smart. She is capable. She was a good secretary of state,"" Powell said, according to Newsday.""She is balanced, she has temperament and no matter what anyone says she has stamina ... I think she is fully qualified to serve as the president of the United States and will serve it with distinction,"" Powell was quoted as saying by Newsday.
In hacked emails leaked in September by a group U.S. intelligence officials suspect is linked to Russia, Powell referred to Trump as ""a national disgrace"" and said Clinton was ""greedy"" and had ""unbridled ambition.""Powell, a former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, also endorsed Democrat Barack Obama in his two successful presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012.

WASHINGTON The United States is troubled by reports that an Iranian-American man may have been sentenced by Iran to 18 years in prison, a State Department spokesman said on Tuesday, a week after an Iranian-American businessman and his father were also jailed by an Iranian court. ""We are troubled by reports that Robin Reza Shahini, a person reported to be a U.S. citizen, may have been convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison,"" spokesman John Kirby told a daily briefing. He called on Tehran to halt ""arbitrary and politically motivated detentions.""California-based Shahini was detained while visiting his mother in Gorgan in July, according to Shahini's friends. Last week, businessman Siamak Namazi and his 80-year-old father Baquer Namazi, a former Iranian provincial governor and former UNICEF official, were sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of cooperating with the United States.Iran does not recognize dual nationality, which prevents Western embassies from visiting such detainees.
Washington secured the release of five U.S. citizens from Iran in January in a prisoner exchange and has said it raises the detention of other Americans held by Tehran during meetings with Iranian officials.Major world powers, including the United States, reached a landmark nuclear deal with Iran in July last year, which lifted some international sanctions against Iran. ""Nobody is turning a blind eye here, but what is behind this, I don't think any of us know with certainty,"" Kirby said, when asked why Iran keeps detaining dual citizens.
""I can't speak to the motivation behind these detentions but if one of the motivations was to secure ransom, it is a false perception. It is wrong.""Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives plan a vote as soon as mid-November on a 10-year reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Act, congressional aides told Reuters.

8	8	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-energy-idUSKCN12P13W	On the ballot: two clashing visions of how America will power its cars, homes	"


By Valerie Volcovici and Devika  Krishna Kumar

Forget the accusations of groping, bigotry and email mismanagement.If the American voter had to choose between Republican nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton based on their energy policies alone, the presidential election would still be a remarkable drama, amounting to the biggest referendum on global climate change since the term was coined.How the country decides on Nov. 8 will have far-reaching implications for the price of electricity and gas at the pump, as well as the future of the U.S. energy industry, which employs about 10 million people.Trump's vision is an America where oil derricks pump furiously again, coal miners get back to work, and the country puts its own economy ahead of foreign nations worried about the effects of fossil fuels on sea levels, droughts, and storms.Clinton sees an America where half a billion solar panels power homes, cars run on electricity, oil use is cut by a third, and the clean energy sector provides a deep well of new jobs supported by government mandates and subsidies. ""At a very basic level, it would be a climate vote,"" said Sarah Emerson, the head of Energy Security Analysis Inc in Boston. ""Do you want fossil fuels, or renewables?""MAKE AMERICA DRILL AGAIN
Trump has said he wants to unleash a U.S. ""energy revolution"" by streamlining environmental regulation, easing infrastructure permitting and pulling the country out of a global pact to combat climate change - moves he says would promote increased oil and gas drilling and revive the dying coal mining industry without compromising air and water quality.The proposals align neatly with both the Republican Party's opposition to government overreach, and Trump's own campaign theme of making ""America Great Again"" by restoring traditional industries, including many that have been hurt by international trade agreements.While the plan has earned him some support within an oil and gas industry naturally opposed to regulation, it has also given rise to skepticism among even his closest allies over whether he can deliver.""Obama hasn't shut down drilling - what has shut down drilling is price,"" Texas oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens, a Trump supporter, told Reuters. ""I don't know what Trump can do to help the industry.""A technology-driven drilling boom has pushed U.S. oil and gas production up 70 percent since President Barack Obama took office in 2008, making America the top producer in the world, but it has also triggered a slump in prices as demand has failed to keep up.
Oil prices are running at four-month highs around $50 a barrel after the OPEC cartel signaled in September it may make its first production cut in eight years, but prices remain less than half their levels from mid-2014. While the price crash has been a boon for consumers and energy-intensive businesses, dozens of energy companies have gone bankrupt, putting blue collar workers in the coal mines, shale fields and oil rigs out of work. Critics have said Trump's plan to revive natural gas drilling would finish off the very coal industry he promises to restore, because the two fuels compete. It would ""seem to defy basic market laws of supply and demand,"" said Jason Bordoff, a former energy adviser to Obama.The coal industry, once a large employer in parts of America, now employs less than 60,000 miners. It has become a symbol of Trump's vow to revive dying industries. Clinton suffered political damage when she said ""we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""Trump's energy plan would also force the United States to make an abrupt turnabout on the environment: He wants to withdraw from the global climate change pact agreed in Paris last year. He has called climate change a hoax and has argued the Paris deal would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage. 
Trump wants to rescind the Clean Power Plan to limit carbon output and downgrade the Environmental Protection Agency to a commission, not a cabinet level agency, and refocus it on its ""core mission: clean air and clean water for all Americans, regardless of race or income.""An oil industry lobbyist in Washington D.C., who asked not to be named, said that even if Trump's policies were unlikely to solve the root problem facing the industry right now - the low price of oil and gas - his ideas were still mainly welcomed.""Regulation is a killer, and if it can be streamlined, it helps,"" he said.Trump's campaign has drawn about $99,000 from employees of the oil and gas industry since July, when he was formally nominated, while Clinton has received about $114,000 from the industry over the same period, according to the latest federal campaign finance disclosures.CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER
Environmental advocates argue that a failure to agree on strong measures like the Paris accord would doom the world to ever-hotter average temperatures, bringing with them deadlier storms, more frequent droughts and rising sea levels as polar ice caps melt.
Clinton says she wants to address that by making America a ""clean energy superpower."" Her plan calls for phasing out fossil fuels, embracing clean energy sources like solar and wind, strengthening environmental protections and leading the world in curbing carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change.""We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs. That's a lot of new economic activity,"" Clinton said in the first presidential debate in September.Solar development is aided by a federal tax credit worth 30 percent of the cost of a system. That credit was set to expire at the end of this year, but received a five-year extension from Congress in late 2015. Even so, the cost of electricity from large-scale solar installations has dropped to a level that is now comparable to natural gas-fired power, even without incentives.Clinton has also signaled increased regulation of fracking to prevent water and air pollution, continued support for the Obama administration's efforts to curb carbon output that would pressure fuels like coal, and a tougher approach to infrastructure permitting.Her approach appears much more likely than Trump's to lift consumer prices for gasoline, heating oil, and electricity, given that increased regulation typically increases costs of production, many analysts said. Still, Clinton will likely face stiff resistance from U.S. Congress - if Republicans retain control of one or both houses. She could follow in Obama's footsteps by relying on executive orders to implement her agenda, but opponents would almost certainly challenge her in the courts.Jay Faison, a North Carolina entrepreneur who calls himself a conservative advocate for clean energy, agrees with the need for more lower-carbon sources of energy, but says Trump's plans to cut regulation could provide a more effective way to get there. They could potentially make it easier to build nuclear power plants and hydro-electric dams, which produce no carbon dioxide, for example.Environmentalists, who have helped mobilize mass protests against energy infrastructure projects during Obama's presidency, hate Trump's proposals. But they are also suspicious of Clinton. She promoted fracking technology to European allies while America's top diplomat to help them reduce their dependence on Russia, according to leaked diplomatic cables, and was slow to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline proposal that would have piped in more oil sands from Alberta to U.S. refineries.""It's a shame that were going to have to spend four or eight years pressuring her at every turn but we will,"" said Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, which advocates a complete halt to fossil fuels development.(This version of the story was refiled to change ""powers"" to ""power"" in the headline) (Additional reporting by Nichola Groom, Richard Valdmanis and Jessica Resnick-Ault, editing by Ross Colvin)"	['Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Ross']	[]
9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12N0N1	Clinton slams Trump for comments on offensive against Islamic State	"


By Luciana Lopez and Steve Holland
| MANCHESTER, N.H./ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla.

MANCHESTER, N.H./ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton slammed rival Donald Trump on Monday for saying that the week-old effort to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from the control of Islamic State was going badly.""He's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started,"" Clinton said at a campaign event in New Hampshire. ""He's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief.""In a tweet on Sunday, Trump, the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, said the ""attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb.""Iraqi and Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, have mounted a huge assault on the area surrounding the city, the last stronghold of Islamic State forces in Iraq. They have  retaken about 80 Islamic State-held villages and towns since the offensive was launched on Oct. 16, but have yet to move on the city itself.Trump reiterated his position during a rally on Monday in St. Augustine, Florida, where he also urged supporters to vote early and declared his campaign was winning the election.""So now we're bogged down in Mosul. The enemy is much tougher than they thought. They've had a lot of time to get ready,"" Trump said. ""It's a horrible, horrible situation that's going on. Why did we have to tell them we're going in?"" The operation could last weeks, or even months. Islamic State mounted counterattacks on Monday across the country against the Iraqi army and Kurdish forces, trying to deflect attention away from the Mosul campaign.Trump suggested last week during the final 2016 presidential debate that the U.S.-backed attack on Mosul was orchestrated to help Clinton in her White House bid. With just over two weeks to go until the election, Clinton, President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state, leads the New York businessman in national opinion polls. Both candidates have been focusing on a small set of political swing states that could decide the contest.Seeking to cement a wide advantage she holds with women voters, Clinton enlisted the help of firebrand U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who blasted Trump over allegations he tried to grope or kiss several women without their consent over a 20-year span. 
""He thinks that because he has a mouthful of Tic Tacs that he can force himself on any woman within groping distance,"" Warren told a raucous crowd of 4,000 at St. Anselm College in Manchester. ""Well, I've got news for you, Donald Trump. Women have had it with guys like you.""'NASTY WOMEN'
At least 10 women have said Trump made unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, in incidents from the early 1980s to 2007, according to reports in various news outlets. Trump has denied the women's allegations, calling them ""totally and absolutely false"" and promising on Saturday he would sue his accusers. Warren's mention of Tic Tac mint candies referred to a moment in a 2005 video that surfaced earlier this month in which Trump was heard boasting about groping and kissing women.
Warren also referred to Trump calling Clinton ""a nasty woman"" at last week's debate, a phrase that quickly caught fire on social media, sparking hashtags and T-shirts.""Get this, Donald, nasty women are tough,"" Warren said. ""Nasty women are smart. And nasty women vote. And on Nov. 8 we nasty women are gonna march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever.""Clinton praised Warren for taking the fight to Trump. ""She gets under his (Trump's) thin skin like nobody else,"" the candidate said.Warren is one of a handful of high-profile surrogate campaigners helping Clinton in the final weeks of the race. In California, Obama raised money for his former top diplomat and joked on the ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" show that he laughed most of the time when he saw Trump on television.Trump spent the day campaigning in Florida, a critical swing state. At an event in Tampa, he criticized Clinton's position on Syria. ""If you look at her plans for Syria, these are the plans of a child. These are the plans of someone who doesn't know what they're doing,"" he said.
At an earlier event for farmers in Boynton Beach, Trump disputed multiple national and state polls that show him lagging Clinton and accused the media of distorting poll results to discourage his supporters from voting. ""I believe we're actually winning,"" Trump said. Just the day before, Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, acknowledged that the candidate was trailing in the race, saying in a TV interview: ""We are behind.""The former first lady is working to turn out her supporters in states such as Ohio, where singer Jay Z plans to hold a concert in support of her candidacy, the Clinton campaign said. According to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which surveys the vote in battleground states, Clinton leads Trump in most of the states that Trump would need to win to have a chance of amassing the 270 Electoral College votes needed to capture the White House. According to the survey, she had a better than 95 percent chance of winning, had the election been held last week. The mostly likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump. The Electoral College votes represent a tally of wins from the states.
