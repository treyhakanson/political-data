By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump neared the end of his vice presidential search on Thursday and appeared to be leaning toward Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a conservative with the potential to unify divided Republicans.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tweeted on Wednesday night that he would announce his choice on Friday at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) in Manhattan.The New York businessman is to be formally nominated as the party's candidate for the Nov. 8 election at the Republican National Convention next week in Cleveland. Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists.Trump's choice of running mate is seen as critical because his defeat of 16 rivals in the Republican primary race left the party divided and some party leaders are still uneasy about some of his campaign positions, and his style.Sources familiar with campaign operations cautioned that while Pence and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich were finalists, Trump could always have a last-minute change of heart and choose someone else from his short list.
A source close to the campaign said Trump appeared to be  leaning toward Pence but could easily change his mind.Gingrich told an ABC News correspondent he expected to hear Trump's decision after 1 p.m. EDT and would not be surprised if Trump chooses Pence. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53, a former rival to Trump in the presidential race, is also high on the list of potential running mates and provides the kind of counterpunch to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that Republicans like.
Pence, 57, a former congressman, is seen as a safe choice, not too flashy but popular among conservatives, with Midwestern appeal and the ability to rally more party faithful behind Trump.Gingrich, 73, is a close adviser to Trump with a wealth of ideas and deep experience in the legislative process from his time as speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.In what has been an unusually public process, Trump, 70, sat down with both Pence and Gingrich separately in Indianapolis on Wednesday.
He also met with a fourth potential No. 2, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, 69, of Alabama, who has been one of Trump's closest advisers.The New York businessman had dinner with Pence on Tuesday night after they appeared together at a rally. Trump, joined by daughter Ivanka and sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, had breakfast with Pence and his wife, Karen, on Wednesday at the governor's residence in Indianapolis.Trump adviser Ed Brookover told CNN that Trump ""first and foremost"" wants a running mate who he has good chemistry with and someone who can help him govern best.

By Eric M. Johnson

Police in the California city of San Jose, motivated by the political leanings of city officials, allowed an angry mob to assault Donald Trump supporters as they left a rally for the presumptive Republican presidential candidate last month, a lawsuit filed on Thursday alleges.The civil lawsuit, filed by 14 Trump supporters against the city of San Jose, its mayor, police chief and a number of other individuals, says police funneled Trump supporters outside the city's convention center directly into a crowd of hundreds of ""physically violent and aggressive"" protesters.The plaintiffs add that city officials directed roughly 250 San Jose police officers not to intervene amid a melee of ""violent criminal acts perpetrated by dozens of anti-Trump protesters.""The San Jose City Attorney, Richard Doyle, said he had not yet read the complaint, but that police made many arrests and the city is ""committed to first amendment rights and protecting people.""A police department spokesman referred inquiries to Doyle's office.
Mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, said in statement that the city will do ""everything necessary"" to prosecute those who acted illegally.""The ludicrous accusation that I somehow directed the police department to 'stand down' at the rally is utterly false,"" Liccardo said.Tense and sometimes violent demonstrations have peppered Trump's political rallies in New Mexico and California in recent months. Protesters are also expected to converge on the Republican National Convention next week in Cleveland.
Hundreds of people in San Jose, many angry over Trump's statements about immigration, gathered outside his event last month. Members of the crowd waved Mexican flags, chanted anti-Trump slogans, and burned Trump hats along with at least one U.S. flag.The lawsuit alleges Liccardo, police chief Edgardo Garcia, and some 40 other people stripped Trump backers of their rights to free speech and assembly.
According to the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified compensation, one Trump backer was pelted with eggs and spat on, while another, a 71-year-old woman, had her hair pulled and her glasses broken.At one point, the lawsuit says, a 14-year-old boy was struck in the back of his head as members of the crowd shouted, ""Kill him!"" Speaking at a campaign event the day after the events in San Jose, Trump described the rally as ""a love fest inside. No problems whatsoever."" But then his supporters ""walked out and they got accosted by a bunch of thugs,"" he said. (Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle; Editing by Bill Rigby and Richard Pullin)"	['Trump']	[]

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives passed two pieces of legislation linked to the international nuclear agreement with Iran on Thursday, one year after the landmark pact was announced, defying President Barack Obama's veto threat.Voting largely along party lines, the Republican-controlled House voted 246 to 179 to pass a new set of sanctions on Iran, and 246 to 181 for a measure to block Iran's access to the U.S. financial system, including use of the dollar.The House on Wednesday passed a bill to bar the U.S. purchase of ""heavy water,"" also with little backing from Democrats.Heavy water is a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The Obama administration said in April the United States would buy $8.6 million worth of heavy water from Iran, angering Republicans who called it a subsidy of the country's nuclear program.
The measures were among the last the House passed before Congress left Washington for a seven-week summer recess. There was no word on when, or whether, the measures would be taken up in the Senate.Every congressional Republican, and several of Obama's fellow Democrats, opposed the nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and other world powers announced in July 2015 in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions.
Since then, Republicans have repeatedly offered sanctions bills and other Iran-related legislation that Democrats dismiss as bids to score political points by undermining a deal seen as a potential foreign policy legacy for Obama.
Republicans say they want to punish Iran for actions including its ballistic missile tests and send a strong message that Tehran should abide by its international commitments. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	['Obama']	[]

By Richard Cowan and Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON/ANNANDALE, Virginia

WASHINGTON/ANNANDALE, Virginia Hillary Clinton campaigned with potential vice presidential running-mate U.S. Senator Tim Kaine in his home state of Virginia on Thursday, testing whether the person widely seen as the ""safe choice"" can propel her to the White House in November. Kaine's 16-minute introduction of the presumptive Democratic nominee in a community college gymnasium in the Washington suburb of Annandale reflected Clinton's need to reach out to Hispanic voters with her vice presidential pick. Kaine, a former missionary in Honduras who speaks Spanish, peppered his introduction with Spanish phrases and criticism of Republican Donald Trump's statements regarding Latinos.""He trash talks Latinos - to him it doesn't matter if you are a new immigrant or you're a worker who has been here for a long time or a DREAMer or if you're a Latina governor of New Mexico or a federal judge,"" Kaine said to applause.Kaine was referring to statements Trump has made about young immigrants brought to the United States by their parents, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and the judge overseeing a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump University.Kaine could help Clinton check a lot of boxes in the list of requirements for a running mate. The former civil rights lawyer is a Virginian, which could help Clinton win a battleground state in the Nov. 8 race against Trump. Such states are hotly contested because their populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.Kaine is also affable, savvy about foreign policy and has executive experience as a former governor of Virginia and a former mayor of Richmond, the state's capital.Though the Clinton campaign is keeping the vice presidential selection process tightly under wraps, many Democrats in Washington see Kaine as the front-runner.Some Democrats in Congress and in outside groups want to see Clinton make a more unconventional pick for her already historic run as the first female presidential nominee of a major party.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a fierce critic of Wall Street, and Julian Castro, a Latino who is the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, are two possibilities mentioned by Democrats who want to see Clinton go with a bold choice before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia July 25-28.Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Representative Xavier Becerra of California, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and, more recently, retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis have also been mentioned as possibilities.Asked about Kaine, Artie Blanco, a superdelegate from Nevada, said he would not be her top pick.""Excited, no. OK with, you know, sure,"" she said.
Blanco said she likes Becerra and Perez as potential picks. She said Warren ""would be fantastic"" and she likes Brown's stance on worker issues.CAN HE FIRE UP VOTERS?
Thursday's event with Kaine gave Clinton an opportunity to gauge whether the 58-year-old, Harvard-educated senator would help her fire up a crowd and make for a comfortable fit on the campaign trail. Cynthia Smith, a registered nurse from Cleveland, was at the event because her nephew is a volunteer with the campaign. She said she was not familiar with Kaine and would like to hear more from him, but at this point preferred Warren.
""I'd like to see two women,"" Smith said.Clinton had lunch with Democratic senators on Capitol Hill on Thursday. After the session, the lawmakers were mostly mum.When Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the top Democrat, was asked by a reporter what the takeaway from the lunch was, he responded: ""She's going to be president.""Clinton spoke to the senators about returning the Senate to Democratic control and about how to create jobs in all 50 U.S. states.Some Democratic senators have been rallying around colleague Kaine, while others are holding out for a bolder pick.Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who has served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with Kaine, said in a brief interview: ""If you look at the totality of Tim's life and his work, I think there are elements that would bridge that divide"" between progressive Democrats and more establishment Democrats who have fostered Clinton's drive for the White House.

By Lesley Wroughton and Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON As U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Thursday to propose close military coordination in Syria, the White House and Pentagon offered lukewarm support for the plan and demanded that Moscow show it was serious about fighting Islamic State, not just propping up President Bashar al-Assad.Kerry himself took a tough line after his meeting on Thursday with Putin, State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Moscow. ""Secretary Kerry emphasized that absent concrete, near-term steps, diplomatic efforts could not continue indefinitely,"" Kirby said.Kerry's proposal would create a new center where U.S. and Russian militaries would share intelligence and coordinate air strikes against Islamic State and the Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate. The move has angered U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats who argue that Russia has proved repeatedly that it cannot be trusted.Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said Defense Secretary Ash Carter supported Kerry's efforts to encourage Moscow to ""do the right thing"" in Syria. But he added that Carter has experience dealing with Moscow and maintains a ""healthy dose of skepticism"" about Russia's aims in the conflict.    ""The secretary supports Secretary Kerry's effort ... but he has also said that he's had questions about the Russian activities up to this point,"" Cook told reporters.    ""If the Russians are prepared to do the right thing in Syria, then the secretary of defense would be open to that conversation,"" he said. ""But we're waiting to see what's going on. ... It's not clear that we'll ever reach an agreement."" WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S UP TO RUSSIAAt the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest's response was similarly cautious.""It's time for Russia to make serious decisions about how they want to use their influence inside of Syria both when it comes to their diplomatic influence, but also when it comes to their military capabilities,"" Earnest told a daily briefing on Thursday at the White House, 
""They have to decide if they're going to use the military to prop up the Assad regime or if they're going to use their military to go after extremists,"" Earnest said, ""Our case is you can't do both.""Kerry has expressed growing frustration with the lack of progress in ending Syria's five-year civil war despite agreements with Russia to secure a lasting nationwide cessation of hostilities and ensure that humanitarian aid reaches besieged communities. U.N.-led efforts to bring the warring sides together to negotiate a political transition also have failed.State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau acknowledged  a ""very robust and very vigorous conversation"" among government agencies over Kerry's plan.Asked whether Kerry's visit had the full backing of the White House, she added: ""I'm not going to characterize that for the White House, but I would say that the secretary is going to ... have discussions in Moscow that present the administration's views.""
Anger Within the Administration    But U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats involved in Syria policy expressed anger about Kerry's proposal, which several called naive.    The Russians, said one official, had known for weeks about Kerry's upcoming visit to Moscow, yet two days before he was due to arrive they bombed a remote camp near Syria's border with Jordan used by U.S.-backed rebels.""That is consistent with what the Russians have been doing all along,"" said a U.S. military official, who like others spoke anonymously to criticize administration policy. ""More of it has been to us, not with us, and the message has been clear all along: 'When our interests differ from yours, ours win.""""They've violated every cessation of hostilities agreement they've ever agreed to, sometimes within hours,"" the official said.
    Another American official, who has helped train members of the Free Syrian Army rebel alliance, said the U.S.-backed opposition forces have been asking why the administration keeps seeking Russian help and are growing increasingly bitter, their anger compounded by what they complain is a lack of American military support.Former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford expressed deep skepticism with Kerry's plan, saying Russian air strikes have primarily targeted U.S-supported moderate opposition groups.""How serious are they (Russia) about defeating terrorism, as opposed to bolstering Assad's position at the center? How are we to assume that they are going to do better if they work with the Americans?"" Ford told Reuters.Ford said that Russia has been unable to get its ""obstreperous client"" Assad to make any political concessions, allow significant humanitarian assistance into numerous rebel-held enclaves or abide by a cessation of hostilities agreement.""I don't think the Russians can deliver,"" he said. ""I don't see how this American-Russian condominium on the Islamic State can help bring about a negotiated solution to the broader Syrian conflict. It will make it less likely that Assad will make concessions that will bring the broader civil war to an end."" (Additional reporting by John Walcott and David Alexander)"	['Cook', 'Jordan']	[]
6	6	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-lead-senate-idUSKCN0ZU2RR	Senators urge U.S. to close lead testing gaps, citing Reuters investigation	"


By Joshua Schneyer and M.B. Pell

Some influential U.S. senators are urging a federal agency to take action to ensure more children are tested for lead poisoning, citing a Reuters investigation that found millions are missing required lead tests, leaving some vulnerable to lifelong health effects.In a three-page letter to be sent on Friday, U.S. senators including Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Deborah Stabenow of Michigan, all Democrats, called on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to re-evaluate its lead screening policy for millions of Medicaid-eligible children.The senators want CMS to improve U.S. blood lead testing rates they called ""dismal,"" and to ensure all state Medicaid programs comply with testing rules and provide treatment for children with elevated blood lead levels. Medicaid is a U.S. government program that provides health care for low-income and disabled people. The letter, provided to Reuters by Brown's office, cites a June Reuters investigation (reut.rs/1YgbjCX) detailing how millions of U.S. children are falling through the cracks of early childhood lead testing requirements. Though Medicaid has long required children in the program to receive blood lead tests at ages one and two, Reuters obtained data from nearly a dozen states showing that only 41 percent of Medicaid-eligible children were tested as required in 2014.
    Those shortfalls left some children vulnerable to prolonged and preventable lead exposure, which can stunt their cognitive development and cause permanent mental and physical ailments.    Concerns about childhood lead exposure have grown sharply after children in Flint, Michigan were poisoned by lead-tainted drinking water starting in 2014. Across the country, more than 500,000 U.S. children have elevated lead levels, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Another exposure risk is old lead paint in millions of homes built before 1978. In Cleveland, Ohio, for instance, 13.7 percent of children tested had elevated levels of lead in their blood, Reuters found.""Children in Ohio are being poisoned by their own homes,"" Senator Brown said on Thursday. ""To protect our children, we need better coordination between federal and state health agencies and Medicaid physicians.""
Experts cited several factors for the gaps: some doctors do not order the tests or are unaware of Medicaid and state rules; children miss appointments or parents do not follow up on test referrals; and Medicaid and health departments do little to enforce testing. The testing guidelines are often confusing, and federal and state data on lead testing contain gaps.In the letter, the lawmakers urge CMS to take steps to get more children tested and to review and update its lead screening protocols, and help guide state Medicaid administrators to make sure all at-risk children get screened.

By Angela Moon

A Milwaukee-based immigrants rights group canceled plans to take children to demonstrations outside the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday, citing fears of violence after last week's shootings in Dallas.Voces de la Frontera (Voices from the Border) typically includes children in its marches, seeking to humanize the debate over immigration policy, but opted against that in Cleveland because ""things can escalate,"" group member Daniel Gutierrez said.Donald Trump is expected to officially become the Republican candidate for president at the convention, which runs from Monday to Thursday, when myriad protest groups from around the country are expected to converge on Cleveland.Protests at Trump campaign events have turned volatile, and tensions could be heightened by the presence of citizens carrying firearms.Ohio gun laws will allow people to openly carry firearms at the protests, while more innocuous items such as tennis balls, umbrellas with steel points and water guns will be prohibited.
Police said the presence of openly carried weapons complicated their job at the Dallas protest shootings, when a former U.S. Army reservist shot dead five police officers, seeking revenge for police killings of black men.About 45 members of Voces de la Frontera plan to participate in a Coalition to Stop Trump rally on Monday, said Gutierrez, adding that he was unafraid that others may bring guns.    ""If anything comes up that puts our lives at risk, we definitely are not going to stand there. If anything breaks out, just remove ourselves from there. Go to a safe location,"" Gutierrez said.
Brad Sigal, a spokesman for the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, said his organization was training marshals to keep the group safe, primarily by steering members clear of  potential confrontations.About 50 of its members would travel to Cleveland, he said.
    ""There will be a lot of police there, there may be counterprotests, but we're there to get our message out and that's what we're going to do,"" Sigal said. ""We're aware of the situation and preparing for it.""Rustbelt Medics, a group of street medics that volunteers first aid at political events, has been conducting medical training in preparation for the convention. Gloria Tavera, a medical student and street medic with the group, says Rustbelt Medics will have trained about 50 people prior to the convention.""Part of the training definitely involves what happens when people get hit by rubber bullets,"" Tavera said.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced long-stalled legislation on Thursday that would make it a federal crime to share sexually explicit material of a person online without the subject's consent.The ""Intimate Privacy Protection Act"" is an effort several years in the making to combat the rise in recent years of ""revenge porn,"" images that are shared on the internet in order to extort or humiliate someone. The practice disproportionately affects women.""These acts of bullying have ruined careers, families, and even led to suicide,"" Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and lead author of the bill, said in a statement. The legislation would allow fines and up to five years in prison for posting online or distributing sexually explicit photos or videos with ""reckless disregard"" for the consent of the subject. More than 30 states have enacted similar laws in recent years. 
Exceptions listed in the bill would allow for posting material that is in the public interest or that features a person voluntarily posing nude in a public or commercial setting.The bill stalled for years amid concerns raised by technology companies and internet freedom advocates worried that service providers such as Alphabet Inc's YouTube could be exposed to liability for acting as third-party hosts of revenge porn content shared by users. 
Speier's bill, which was introduced with support from Facebook and Twitter, exempts such companies as long as they do not promote or solicit revenge porn content.Many tech companies have tightened their terms of service in recent years to prohibit revenge porn. Those companies typically rely on users to report objectionable content to teams of human reviewers who delete content found to violate terms of service.
Democratic Representatives Katherine Clark and Gregory Meeks and Republican Representatives Ryan Costello and Tom Rooney joined the bill as original co-sponsors. (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	['Meeks', 'Rooney', 'Clark', 'Costello']	[]
