By Amanda Becker and Luciana Lopez

CLEVELAND/NEW YORK - Bracing for a general election fight with Donald Trump, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and her allies are putting resources into industrial states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania to try to block Trump from making inroads with working-class voters there.Labor leaders, progressive groups and Democratic operatives told Reuters in interviews that they took seriously Trump's appeal with white working-class voters and were studying how to respond to his promises to create jobs and negotiate better trade deals.The desire to stop the presumptive Republican presidential nominee from wresting away the support of unionized workers has even led a group organized to back Bernie Sanders, Labor for Bernie, to consider its next steps if Sanders does not win the Democratic nomination.""It may well be our task to work hard to reach out to our (labor union) members who support Trump and begin an important dialogue,"" said Rand Wilson, a staunch Sanders supporter and Labor for Bernie spokesman.The Rust Belt, which includes Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and West Virginia, has suffered heavy job losses in sectors such as autos, coal and steel that have faced fierce competition from abroad.The region, home to many unionized workers, has been a stronghold for Democrats. The exceptions are socially conservative West Virginia, which has gone Republican in the past four presidential elections, and Indiana, which has gone Democratic only twice since 1940. Ohio has switched back and forth.Trump has aggressively courted working-class voters ahead of the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. He has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and promised to rip up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal.He has also said he will consider raising the minimum wage and backing higher taxes on the wealthy. On Monday, Trump sought to backtrack from those comments on taxes. ""Now if I increase it on the wealthy, that means they're still going to be paying less than they are paying now,"" he told CNN. ""I'm talking about increasing it from my (original) tax proposal.""
Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters the campaign was targeting industrial states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, which have voted Democratic in presidential elections since 1992.Working America, an advocacy group affiliated with the AFL-CIO labor federation, is expanding operations in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and plans to open an office in Wisconsin. Its first mission is talking to voters about jobs and the economy and trying to gauge where they are leaning in the presidential race. Later in the campaign, the group will work more aggressively to win over voters.In Ohio, the Democratic Party has doubled its field operation over the past month, thanks to an infusion of cash raised by the Clinton campaign for the national and state parties.Clinton, who has a strong lead over Sanders but has yet to secure the Democratic nomination, has already hired state directors in Ohio and Pennsylvania.Working America field director Soren Norris knocked on doors on the west side of Cleveland last week as part of an effort to gauge voter sentiment.
At the first house, Tamara Phillips, 44, told Norris she was not enthusiastic about either Clinton or Trump but that she would vote for the New York businessman if forced to choose.Phillips, who works in publishing, said taxes on her commission income rose during former President Bill Clinton's administration. But she said she had reservations about Trump's ""gruff"" demeanor.MENDING FENCES IN APPALACHIA

With an eye toward voters across the Rust Belt, Clinton visited Appalachia last week with stops in West Virginia and Ohio. She apologized for previous statements related to shutting down the coal industry and told protesters she was committed to solving their economic problems even if they did not support her.Union activists said their strategy for undercutting Trump's support would be pointing out discrepancies in his positions.His comment that he is open to raising the minimum wage comes after he said in a November debate that ""wages are too high"" and that an increase would hurt the economy.Although Trump rails against trade deals and businesses that move operations to Mexico, critics say that items such as ties and suits in his clothing line were made in China.""The best way to go after Trump is to make him run against himself,"" said political strategist Brad Bannon, who advises labor unions.Tom Buffenbarger, a Clinton surrogate to labor and the past president of the machinists' union, said Democrats would have ""a lot of fun"" highlighting Trump's inconsistencies, although he acknowledged the Republican candidate presented a threat in some Rust Belt states.""Are we concerned about the industrial states in the upcoming election?"" Buffenbarger said. ""Yeah, Donald Trump's done a good job complaining about the trade deal while he continues to ship work from the U.S. to China.""

By Ginger Gibson and Jonathan Allen

 (This version of the May 5, 2016 story has been corrected to make clear Ralph Nader ran as a Green Party candidate)By Ginger Gibson and Jonathan AllenWASHINGTON/NEW YORK Donald Trump's emergence as the last man standing in the Republican presidential race has prompted his critics inside the party to intensify their search for a candidate they could back as a serious third-party alternative.Political operatives are courting donors, calling potential candidates and developing legal contingency plans for overcoming onerous ballot qualification laws.""This is as much as anything a battle for the future of American party politics,"" said Republican strategist Joel Searby, who is working with conservative writer Bill Kristol, among others, on an effort to identify a third-party candidate to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election.A separate group, Conservatives Against Trump, which includes blogger Erick Erickson, has been holding calls and meetings to discuss third-party candidates as well as other options to stop the New York billionaire from winning the White House.The hurdles to a third-party candidacy are immense. No independent candidate has ever won a presidential election, although some have played spoilers. But the efforts by the Republican groups underscore the unusual divisiveness of Trump's candidacy within Republican ranks ahead of a likely general election fight with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Trump's opposition to free trade is at odds with the views of many Republicans, especially in the party's business wing. Many of Trump's critics also find his rhetoric offensive, including his call to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country and his comment describing Mexican immigrants to the United States as rapists and drug dealers.Some Republicans say they worry that any third-party candidate would only siphon votes away from Trump and help Clinton win the election.
Ralph Nader's Green Party presidential run has been blamed by some Democrats for the razor-thin defeat of Democratic nominee Al Gore in the 2000 election. Ross Perot's independent candidacy in 1992 was seen by some Republicans as contributing to President George H.W. Bush's loss to Democrat Bill Clinton.  One outcome, though rare, may be that no candidate crosses the necessary threshold of 270 votes in the U.S. Electoral College. In that case, the vote for the next president would pass to the U.S. House of Representatives, currently controlled by Republicans.  Deborah DeMoss Fonseca, who recruited donors for former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and is working with Conservatives Against Trump, said her group was trying to find a candidate who would be high-profile enough to compete with Trump and Clinton.
NO EASY TASK
But finding a candidate of that caliber who would be willing to run is no easy feat. Searby's group has reached out to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and James Mattis, a retired U.S. Marine Corps general, among others, but both declined after discussions.Republican U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has emerged as a favorite of the Republicans seeking a third-party candidate. Kristol has had warm words for him.Sasse, a freshman lawmaker and former Bush administration official, is a strong critic of Trump and has called for an alternative candidate to him. But he says that person should be someone other than him.
On Wednesday, the morning after Trump emerged as the presumptive presidential nominee, phones at the office of Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson were ringing off the hook with calls from small-government Republicans who feel they cannot get behind Trump.But as a Libertarian, Johnson holds views on some issues, such as the legalization of marijuana, that are antithetical to the views of some Republicans. In March, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, said he had considered jumping into the race as a third-party candidate but opted against it, saying he feared it would only serve to help get Trump elected.One of the biggest hurdles to a third-party run is simply getting on the ballot in enough states to mount a viable campaign.Texas requires more than 79,000 signatures from voters who did not participate in either primary. Its deadline is Monday. Among other states, North Carolina's deadline is the end of May, and Illinois and Florida in mid-July.""A third-party candidate is a pipe dream,"" said Republican strategist Tony Fratto, who worked in Bush's administration and strongly opposes Trump. ""What's going to happen is Hillary Clinton is going to win big. It won't be close."" (Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson in Washington; Editing by Caren Bohan and Peter Cooney)"

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The U.S. presidential election may turn out to be one of the world's biggest un-popularity contests.Nearly half of American voters who support either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump for the White House said they will mainly be trying to block the other side from winning, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday.The results reflect a deepening ideological divide in the United States, where people are becoming increasingly fearful of the opposing party, a feeling worsened by the likely matchup between the New York real estate tycoon and the former first lady, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.""This phenomenon is called negative partisanship,"" Sabato said. ""If we were trying to maximize the effect, we couldn't have found better nominees than Trump and Clinton.""Trump has won passionate supporters and vitriolic detractors for his blunt talk and hardline proposals, including his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, his vow to force Mexico to pay for a border wall, and his promise to renegotiate international trade deals.

Former Secretary of State Clinton's appeal to voters seeking continuity with President Barack Obama's policies, has won her a decisive lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, but finds strong opponents among those disillusioned by what they see as lack of progress during Obama's tenure.The poll asked likely voters about the primary motivation driving their support of either Trump or Clinton heading into the general election on Nov. 8.
About 47 percent of Trump supporters said they backed him primarily because they don't want Clinton to win. Another 43 percent said their primary motivation was a liking for Trump's political positions, while 6 percent said they liked him personally.Similar responses prevailed among Clinton supporters.About 46 percent said they would vote for her mostly because they don't want to see a Trump presidency, while 40 percent said they agreed with her political positions, and 11 percent said they liked her personally.The April 29-May 5 poll included 469 likely Trump voters and 599 likely Clinton voters. It has a credibility interval of 5 percentage points. (For results, click tmsnrt.rs/1TLCbqX)
To be sure, voters' opinions could change over the next several months. Candidates will be feted at party conventions, will square off in a series of national debates, and will be targeted by millions of dollars worth of advertisements.But the negative atmosphere is likely to reign, says Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University professor who has studied the rise of negative partisanship in America.Both campaigns probably will decide their best strategy is to work even harder to vilify each other, he said.""It's going to get very, very negative,"" he added.
That would play into a longer-term trend.A 2014 study by Pew Research Center found that Democrats and Republicans have shown increasingly negative views toward each other over the past few decades. In 2014 more than a quarter of Democrats, and more than a third of Republicans, viewed the opposition as ""a threat to the nation's well-being.""Barbara Monson, 59, a Republican from Murray, Utah, is among them. ""No matter who the Republican (nominee) is, I would have voted for him,"" poll respondent Monson said of her support for Trump. ""It's never going to be Clinton. Never.""Jo-Anne Michaud, 69, an independent voter from Abingdon, Maryland, told Reuters she would try to keep an open mind. Although she has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, she feels repelled by Trump.""I used to like the guy when I watched his show,"" Michaud said. ""But I just hate the way he talks now. I don't think he's a nice person deep down inside."" (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Clarence Fernandez)"

By Jeff Mason and Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Friday that occupying the Oval Office ""is not a reality show,"" in a swipe at outspoken Republican candidate Donald Trump who is vying to replace him in the White House. Fighting with Obama is a battle Trump would likely relish as he tries to rally support within his own party. During hard-fought Republican primary campaigns, the billionaire delighted in responding to attacks from rivals and found that his support grew when he lashed out at his opponents.Asked about Trump at a media briefing in the White House, Obama called on the press and public to weigh past statements by the Republican but did not point to any specific issues or remarks. ""This is not entertainment,"" Obama said, a reference to Trump's television background. ""This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States,"" he said.Some top Republican leaders - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan among them - are still expressing wariness about Trump, who became the party's presumptive nominee this week when two Republican rivals dropped out of the White House race.Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination, posted on Facebook that he will not vote for Trump - one of the sharpest slights yet against the New York real estate mogul by a senior Republican. ""Donald Trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot support his candidacy,"" Bush wrote, adding that he would not vote for likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton either.U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, who made an unsuccessful bid for president, joined a growing list of Republicans who are refusing to support Trump and he announced on Friday he will also skip the Republican convention in July. Mitt Romney, who won the Republican nomination in 2012, is also refusing to support Trump.But Trump on Friday won the endorsement of another former Republican presidential nominee, Bob Dole, who lost to Bill Clinton in 1996.For Trump, finding unifying enemies like Obama and Hillary Clinton could help rally Republicans back to his side ahead of the Nov. 8 general election.    Obama is likely to be the feature of much of Trump's criticism in the general election. Republicans have sought to paint Clinton as an extension of the Obama administration who would continue all of his policies.
Since effectively securing the nomination on Tuesday, Trump has begun testing themes to attack Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state. On Friday, Trump took aim at Clinton for her use of a private email server while in office. Clinton has said she did not send or receive information marked as classified. The FBI is investigating whether laws were broken.""The email scandal should take her down but I don't think it's going to because I think she's being protected by the Democrats,"" Trump said on ""Fox & Friends,"" a television news program that attracts a large conservative viewership.CLINTON ""BAD ON JOBS""
Trump tried to cast Clinton as weak on the economy, which is sure to be one of the main policy issues as the election approaches.
""If you look at what she's going to do, she's going to be so bad on jobs that wages are going to go down for workers,"" he said.Early general election polls show Clinton with a lead both nationally and in key states.     Clinton has a higher probability than Trump of becoming the next president, but the gap between them narrowed this week, according to the online political stock market PredictIt.    A key factor for Trump in the general election will be whether he can rally the party behind him.Trump has seen some top Republicans who previously fought his candidacy now back him, including Texas Governor Rick Perry. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, whose daughter Liz Cheney is running for Congress in Wyoming, said he will support Trump, a source close to him said on Friday.Paul Manafort, a top Trump adviser, told MSNBC that Republicans will rally behind the businessman because he has strengthened the party by attracting new supporters.
""We want to unify the party, but the important thing to remember is Donald Trump just won a historic victory among 17 other candidates,"" Manafort said. ""He is a very strong nominee. His vision that he laid out is not something in question.""Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has already begun his efforts to rally the party behind Trump, saying at an event hosted by Politico that behind the scenes the candidate is ""more gracious and personable than I think you see at rallies.""""I think there's work on tone to do,"" Priebus said, adding that he has made that point to Trump. ""I think he gets it. I think you're going to see it. I think you're going to see the change in tone.""In addition to changing tone, Trump also faces an uphill climb to bring the party together. Ryan, the top elected Republican in the United States, said on Thursday he was not ready to support Trump, a sign of lingering establishment concern about the candidate's position on immigration and trade.Trump took issue with Ryan. ""Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters.""    Ryan has invited Trump to meet with House of Representatives Republican leaders next week, Ryan's office said on Friday.Trump's attorney was quoted in media reports on Friday as saying the candidate will testify after the November election in a class-action lawsuit that accuses him and his now-defunct Trump University of defrauding people who paid up to $35,000 for real estate seminars.A federal judge ordered the trial in San Diego to start on Nov. 28, which means he will not have to testify while he campaigns. The university case was one of the subjects Trump's rivals used to attack him during presidential debates.

HANOI A top U.S. envoy began a two-day trip to Vietnam on Monday to gauge its progress in human rights, two weeks ahead of a visit by President Barack Obama in what will be the first by a U.S. leader in a decade.Tom Malinowski, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, is expected to press Vietnam to release unconditionally political prisoners and reform its laws to comply with its international commitments.Relations between the United States and Vietnam have moved to a new level in the past two years as Washington seeks to make a new ally in Asia, but the communist nation's zero-tolerance approach to its detractors remains a sticking point.Vietnam has jailed dissidents, bloggers and religious figures in recent years, holding them for long periods without access to family or legal counsel and often subject to torture or other mistreatment, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch.The United States has been intensifying efforts in building stronger ties -  in health, education, environment, energy and recently military - to boost its influence, and offset that of China.
The United States and Vietnam, along with 10 others, this year signed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals.Though the TPP has no requirements for members to reach certain standards in human rights, analysts say Vietnam's record of arrests, intimidation and oppression of those who speak out against the ruling Communist Party could add to anticipated resistance to the pact among U.S. legislators.
The TPP must be ratified by each member country's parliament.Malinowski said during his visit to Vietnam last year that he had seen signs of progress on human rights but the country needed to make a stronger commitment.
Rights groups, however, say those improvements might be short-lived and designed to ensure its smooth accession to multilateral trade agreements, including a pact with the European Union. (Reporting by My Pham; Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel)"

By David Lawder and Lindsay Dunsmuir
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Sunday he was open to raising taxes on the rich, backing off his prior proposal to reduce taxes on all Americans and breaking with one of his party's core policies dating back to the 1990s.""I am willing to pay more, and you know what, the wealthy are willing to pay more,"" Trump told ABC's ""This Week.""After effectively sealing the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election last week, Trump has used speeches and interviews to offer more details on his policy positions.The billionaire real estate tycoon has said he would like to see an increase in the minimum wage, although he told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday he would prefer to see states take the lead on that front instead of the federal government.""I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour,"" Trump said of the current federal minimum wage. ""I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide.""Trump's call for higher taxes on the wealthy is a break with Republican presidential nominees who have staunchly opposed tax hikes for almost three decades. Tax hikes have been anathema to many in the party since former President George H.W. Bush infuriated fellow Republicans by abandoning a pledge not to raise taxes and agreeing to an increase in a 1990 budget deal.Democrats, including presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, have pressed for increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans for years.Trump released a tax proposal last September that included broad tax breaks for businesses and households. He proposed reducing the highest income tax rate to 25 percent from the current 39.6 percent rate.Pressed on the contradiction between his latest comments on taxes and the September tax plan, Trump said he viewed his original proposal as ""a concept"" and that he expected it would be changed following negotiations with Congress.
""By the time it gets negotiated, it's going to be a different plan,"" Trump told ABC. He emphasized in separate interviews with ABC and NBC that his priorities were lowering taxes on the middle class and businesses.""The middle class has to be protected,"" Trump told NBC. The rich are ""probably going to end up paying more,"" he said.The Clinton campaign said Trump was trying to pander to voters beyond those who supported him in the Republican nominating contests and that he had no intention of raising the taxes of wealthy people.""Don't believe Donald Trump's weak attempts at a general election 'makeover' for even a second,"" Christina Reynolds, a Clinton campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement. ""Trump's economic plans take direct aim at working Americans - his proposal to cut trillions in taxes for the top one percent would almost certainly come at the expense of working- and middle-class families.""When asked on NBC whether he would release his own tax returns before the election, Trump said once again that it depended on the completion of an audit.
""Sure. If the auditors finish. I'll do it as fast as the auditors finish,"" he said.  DEEP DIVIDE
Republicans remain deeply divided over Trump's candidacy, although he has pledged to try to unite the party ahead of its convention in July. Prominent party leaders such as Paul Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, have distanced themselves from Trump over his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.Ryan, who has been a leading voice for the Republican Party on budget issues for years and is the House of Representatives speaker, has proposed a series of budgets that would cut taxes across the board.
Trump has also called for new tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports to the United States, a position at odds with views on trade held by Ryan and many other pro-business Republicans.Ryan, who will preside over the July 18-21 convention in Cleveland where the party will formally nominate its presidential candidate, said last week he hoped to eventually support Trump. But he added: ""I'm just not there right now.""Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona also is undecided about Trump. Flake said he wanted to see Trump revise some of his positions, including the proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States.""He's got to soften his position there,"" Flake said.Underscoring the party's divisions, Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate and a Trump supporter, criticized Ryan for failing to endorse Trump. The conservative populist firebrand said she would work to defeat Ryan in his Aug. 9 primary race against a conservative businessman. Clinton said she hoped to take advantage of Republican reticence over Trump to draw the support of party defectors. ""I am asking people to come join this campaign,"" the former secretary of state told CBS. ""And I've had a lot of outreach from Republicans in the last days who say that they are interested in talking about that.""
