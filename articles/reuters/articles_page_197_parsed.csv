By Rory Carroll
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO The California legislature agreed on Wednesday to a $122.5 billion spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 and sent it to Governor Jerry Brown, who is expected to sign it. The budget directs $2 billion to the state's rainy day fund, a priority for Brown, a Democrat and fiscal moderate who has warned that an economic downturn could lie ahead for the nation's most populous state. Lower-than-expected income tax revenues in April caught state officials by surprise, and Brown said the state could take in $1.9 billion less than anticipated in taxes over the coming fiscal year. Democratic leaders in the state Senate praised the budget for making investments in the social safety net and early childhood education. The budget included a repeal of the state's maximum family grant rule, which prevents people on welfare from receiving additional public money if they have more children. 
Without the rule, households would receive an additional $122 a month for a newborn child. The change is expected to cost the state about $220 million a year. ""Our expenditure plan funds anti-poverty programs, child care and education,"" said Mark Leno, Democratic state senator and budget chair. ""It also includes resources to combat homelessness, support low-income working families and improve college readiness and enrollment,"" he said.
Republicans and some Democrats complained the spending increase of $6.9 billion from the prior fiscal year set California on a path of billion-dollar deficits down the road. ""Californians deserve a responsible and sustainable state spending plan,"" said Senate Republican leader Jean Fuller. ""Unfortunately, this record spending budget paves the way for future deficits and increases fees that make living in California even more expensive,"" she said. 
Some of the spending increases were attributed to an increase in the minimum wage and increased benefits for the disabled. In a tweet, Brown said: ""Good work from the state legislature: we're building reserves and investing in CA. Thanks."" Brown has until the end of the month to sign the budget.

By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. senators signaled on Wednesday a new willingness to consider restrictions on the sale of guns after the Orlando nightclub massacre, with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others in his party ready to discuss limited gun control measures. With Republicans and the National Rifle Association gun lobby under pressure to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Trump said he would meet with the NRA to discuss ways to block people on terrorism watch or no-fly lists from buying guns. Emotions have run high in Congress since Sunday's mass shooting with Democrats stalling Senate proceedings on Wednesday in a bid to push for tougher gun control legislation. Democratic senators planned to speak on the Senate floor well into Wednesday night. The Senate began discussions on legislation to ban firearm sales to the hundreds of thousands of people on U.S. terrorism watch lists after a gunman who had been on such a list killed 49 people at a gay nightclub on Sunday.But following a full day of wrangling, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said that negotiations ""were little more than a smokescreen by Republicans trying to give themselves political cover while they continue to march in lock-step with the NRA's extreme positions.""Reid said there were no Republican proposals ""that come close to attracting Democratic support.""Earlier on Wednesday, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged senators to offer ideas on how to prevent another attack like the one in Orlando. ""I do not believe this was some random act of violence,"" McConnell said. ""It seems clear this was cold-blooded murder committed by a terrorist who picked his targets with deliberate malice."" On Tuesday, McConnell said that ""nobody wants terrorists to have firearms."" Earlier in the week, some Democrats in the House of Representatives interrupted a moment of silence for the victims, with shouts of ""Where's the bill?"" to protest the Republican-led chamber's refusal to consider tougher gun laws.  If Congress was to pass a gun control measure, it would mark the first time in more than 20 years that lawmakers agreed on how to address the hot-button issue. A ban on semi-automatic assault weapons, such as the one used in Orlando, had gone into effect in 1994 and expired 10 years later.Republicans over the years have blocked gun control measures saying they step on Americans' right to bear arms as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, confirmed that he and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein were holding private talks on a possible compromise bill stopping weapons sales to those on watch lists.     
OPPORTUNITY CITED
Another Republican, Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, also is working on a bill that would keep guns from people on watch lists, a gun control group said.Toomey, who is in a possibly difficult re-election bid this year, took to the Senate floor urging compromise.""So there's an obvious opportunity here guys, to work together and find a solution,"" he said, adding, ""This is not rocket science to figure this out.""A spokeswoman for Toomey, E.R. Anderson, said the senator was seeking bipartisan support for an approach that he had tentatively agreed on with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, which is backed by ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Everytown spokeswoman Erika Lamb said the group was encouraged by the discussions but added, ""We are not there yet and our support for any compromise legislation is contingent on support from both Republicans and Democrats.""Toomey's bill would allow the U.S. attorney general to create a new list of ""likely terrorists"" and block any person on the list from buying or selling a gun. If someone was denied a gun, he or she would be entitled to a swift court hearing where the attorney general would have to turn over the evidence against the person.Democrats were dubious. One problem, a Democratic aide said, was that under the proposal officials would just have three days to try to block sales to anyone not already on the new list.Congressional Republicans and the NRA have thwarted previous gun control measures backed by President Barack Obama and other Democrats after other mass shootings, and supporters of new restrictions remained cautious about the moves.""The Cornyn bill is outlandish and is worse than nothing. From what I'm told all of the compromises proposed by Cornyn and Toomey are not at all acceptable,"" said Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat of New York.    Feinstein, speaking to reporters following a closed briefing from the Obama administration on the Orlando massacre, held out little hope her talks with Cornyn would bear fruit. ""I don't think it's going to work out,"" she said, but added she was still engaged in talks.
NRA HAPPY TO MEET WITH TRUMP
Trump said on Twitter he would meet with the NRA ""about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no-fly list, to buy guns."" His campaign did not specify what he might support legislatively, and a spokeswoman declined to give details about the timing or nature of the meeting.The NRA, a politically influential lobbying group that claims more than 4 million members, said in a statement it was ""happy to meet"" with Trump, whom it endorsed for president on May 20.The group said in a statement that anyone on a terrorism watch list who tries to buy a gun ""should be thoroughly investigated"" by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and any sale to that person delayed, a position the lobby group has long held.Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has supported gun control efforts, on Monday said she was ""bewildered"" that Republicans in Congress in December had blocked a Democratic effort to restrict gun sales to people on the watch lists.The U.S. government maintains two terrorism watch lists: a no-fly list barring people from flying to and from the United States and a larger one that subjects travelers to greater scrutiny at airports and border crossings.An FBI official said in 2014 there were 64,000 people on the no-fly list and 800,000 on the broader list. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrants, was on the broader list at one time.NRA Executive Director Chris Cox also voiced backing for legislation offered in December by Cornyn, who proposed to put gun sales on hold for 72 hours for people on watch lists. Critics have said such background checks could take longer to complete.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was too soon to tell if Republicans would support ""common sense"" steps like blocking firearm sales to people on the no-fly lists.

By Suzanne Barlyn and Rama Venkat Raman

The New York State on Wednesday confirmed Governor Andrew Cuomo's pick to become the state's top financial regulator.The confirmation vote for Maria Vullo, Cuomo's nominee for superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), was unanimous.Cuomo, a Democrat, nominated Vullo in January. Her appointment is effective immediately. Earlier on Wednesday, the New York Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on Vullo's nomination and recommended that she be confirmed. Last week, the New York Senate's banking and insurance committees also held separate hearings about Vullo. 
Vullo, a lawyer who represented banks, described herself during recent state legislative committee meetings as ""pro-business and pro-consumer."" She has been running the NYDFS as its acting superintendent since February.
Vullo will succeed former NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, who left the agency last year.Under Lawsky, NYDFS earned a reputation as an aggressive regulatory body that extracted hefty fines from global banks and other financial institutions.
The regulator, created in 2011 by consolidating the state's banking and insurance agencies, had been in flux since before Vullo's arrival in March.

WASHINGTON Democratic U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein said on Wednesday that she doubted talks with the Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, would succeed in a deal on legislation to ban gun sales to people on terror watchlists.""I don't think that going to work out,"" Feinstein told reporters, but added that she was still talking to other lawmakers in an effort to find agreement. She also said she understood that Cornyn had shared her draft legislation with the National Rifle Association. 
""Now, that would do it,"" she said, suggesting the gun lobby would reject her proposal.

By Emily Stephenson and Amanda Becker

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday called for surveillance of mosques as part of U.S. law enforcement efforts to prevent terrorism, and stood by his remarks on banning Muslim immigrants, which others in his party have criticized.Trump repeated his call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States after a U.S.-born Muslim, the son of Afghan immigrants, fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando early on Sunday.The New York real estate developer said that while the Florida gunman was born in the United States, ""his parents weren't and his ideas weren't born here."" ""We have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we don't solve it, it's going to eat our country alive,"" Trump said at a rally in Atlanta.Trump had called for surveillance of mosques in November, as well as a database of Syrian refugees entering the United States.The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed by authorities to have acted alone, inspired by radical ideology he was exposed to over the internet.
""Any kind of extremism and violence is not preached in American mosques,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""In fact, research has shown that mosques are a moderating influence on individuals who attend.""Prominent Republicans this week distanced themselves from Trump's comments about Muslims. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he did not think a ban on the entry of Muslims was in U.S. interests. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and has been a fierce critic since, said that he was ""unnerved"" by Trump's response.
Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said on Wednesday that Trump's rhetoric had grown ""even more inflammatory"" in recent days. She said the United States counts on Muslim communities in the U.S. and partners in majority-Muslim countries to help fight terrorism.""Not one of Donald Trump's reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando,"" Clinton said at an event for U.S. military families in Virginia.Trump on Monday proposed that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is ""a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats."" He also said radical Muslims were entering the country amid a flood of refugees and ""trying to take over our children.""
Trump's hard-line proposals on immigration have contributed to his popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered condemnation from minority and human rights activists and his political opponents, many of whom have called his rhetoric racist.The New York businessman also said in Atlanta he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if he came to the United States, and he dismissed the controversy he caused in May when he said in a Reuters interview he would be willing to speak to Kim.""If he came here, I'd accept him. But I wouldn't give a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people  that rip us off,"" Trump said.

By Matt Spetalnick and Dan Williams
| WASHINGTON/HERZLIYA, Israel

WASHINGTON/HERZLIYA, Israel The Obama administration is prepared to incorporate missile defense funds in a new long-term agreement on military aid for Israel, a U.S. official said on Wednesday, accommodating in principle a key request by its ally in the yet-unresolved talks.Disputes over the scope and fine print of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) have clouded already difficult ties between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama during the latter's final months in office.The current MOU, signed in 2007 and due to expire in 2018, gave Israel around $30 billion in so-called foreign military financing. Israel has been seeking around $10 billion more for the next decade and that money be earmarked for missile defense projects that were hitherto funded ad hoc by the U.S. Congress.U.S. negotiators previously proposed a total of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion annually for Israel under the new MOU, but did not say whether this might include missile defense funds. A senior U.S. official was more forthcoming on Wednesday.""We are prepared to make an unprecedented multi-year missile defense commitment as part of a new memorandum of understanding with Israel on military assistance,"" the official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.""This commitment, which would amount to billions of dollars over 10 years, would be the first long-term pledge on missile defense support to Israel, affording Israel robust support for its missile defense, as well as predictability and facilitating long-term planning.""U.S. lawmakers have in recent years given Israel up to $600 million in annual discretionary funds for missile defense, well beyond the $150 million requested by the Obama administration.
On Tuesday, the White House opposed a proposal to include $600 million for Israeli missile defense to an appropriations bill for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1.INTERNAL DEBATE

Netanyahu came out with a rare statement on the MOU talks, in the face of Israeli opposition accusations that he is endangering American largesse by feuding with Obama over Iran's nuclear program and Palestinian peace talks.Netanyahu's office said on Twitter that the White House's move on Tuesday was part of an ""internal debate"" with Congress about supplementary missile defense funding for Israel.""There has been no cut in American assistance,"" it tweeted. ""Prime Minister Netanyahu is working to anchor this supplement as part of the discussions on the assistance agreement for the next ten years. Not only will security assistance for missile defense not be cut, it will be increased.""However, Netanyahu's acting national security adviser, Jacob Nagel, made clear agreement was not a given. Israeli officials have hinted that, if the disputes persist, they might await the next U.S. president in hope of getting a better MOU. 
Netanyahu's government was working to wrap up the talks with the Obama administration, Nagel told reporters. But he added: ""When we conclude that we have arrived at the final (U.S.) offer, we will decide if we want it or not."" Another sticking point has been a U.S. demand to reduce the amount of aid money - now 26.3 percent - that Israel can spend on its own military industries rather than on American products. Visiting Israel for strategic talks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said it had received $8.5 million a day from the Obama administration in defense aid.In a speech to the annual Herzliya Conference, Blinken did not give details on the MOU talks, but he said Washington was ready to give Israel ""the largest single pledge of military assistance from the United States to any country in our history, cementing an unparalleled security relationship all the way to 2029"".

It also said protections needed to be put in place to allow people wrongfully put on a terrorism watch list to be removed.

By John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Bernie Sanders does not plan to suspend his campaign and endorse presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in a video speech to supporters on Thursday, focusing instead on ways to pursue his policy agenda and reform goals, a spokesman said.Sanders, who has resisted pressure to exit the race and back Clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the Democratic nomination last week, will address supporters nationwide on a video live stream on Thursday night.That raised expectations Sanders might formally pull the plug on his campaign. But spokesman Michael Briggs said on Wednesday the speech will focus on how Sanders' supporters can keep the fight alive on priorities such as raising the minimum wage and reducing the influence of big money in politics.""Tomorrow night, no, he's not ending it,"" Briggs said of the campaign. ""We're working our way through that, how to go forward on that front. This message to supporters is going to be a lot broader than that.""Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has promised to continue his campaign to next month's Democratic nominating convention in Philadelphia as leverage to force concessions from Clinton on his policy goals and on reforms he seeks in the Democratic Party's nominating process.
Since Clinton secured enough delegates for the nomination last week, however, Sanders has laid off some campaign staff, stopped holding rallies and dropped plans to court unbound delegates in an unspoken acknowledgment that the former secretary of state will be the nominee.""He knows how to count,"" Briggs said.Sanders and Clinton met in a downtown Washington hotel for more than 90 minutes on Tuesday night to search for common ground after she won the final nominating contest in their sometimes bitter primary campaign.
In similarly worded statements, both camps described the meeting as ""positive"" and said the two discussed their shared goal of defeating presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election.Sanders was back home in Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday to prepare his speech and consider how to keep pressuring Clinton to back issues like raising the minimum wage and fighting climate change.
He also has demanded changes to the party nominating process, including replacing the Democratic National Committee leadership and eliminating superdelegates, who are unelected and are free to support any candidate.The Sanders camp has pushed for a commitment to hold votes at the convention on some of those platform issues and on changing party nominating rules.""We see the convention as a serious opportunity for a serious discussion about a lot of these issues. We hope the Democratic Party establishment can figure out a way to open its arms and welcome into the party fold the people who have been excited by Bernie's campaign,"" Briggs said.
