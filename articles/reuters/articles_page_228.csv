By Nick Brown
| SAN JUAN

SAN JUAN The Congress' latest attempt to solve Puerto Rico's debt crisis appears to strengthen some - though not all - creditor positions in what has been a robust fight to influence the writing of a bill that lawmakers started to debate on Tuesday.The House Natural Resources Committee presented the legislation, formally called the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act or PROMESA, last week after several false starts.The bill would put Puerto Rico's finances under a federally appointed oversight board, while allowing the U.S. territory to restructure a $70 billion debt load that threatens to collapse an economy already hamstrung by rampant emigration and a 45 percent poverty rate.While that structure is unchanged from prior drafts, several small tweaks seem to benefit bondholders, including restricting the government's ability to override decisions of the seven-member board. Still, other elements of the bill are ambiguous, experts say - including the ability of Puerto Rico to enforce cuts to creditors' debt portfolios through a bankruptcy-like court process without their consent. This is also referred to as a ""cram-down.""""It doesn't strike me that there are obvious winners and losers,"" said David Skeel, a bankruptcy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, adding, ""a lot will depend on who ends up on the control board, and what stance the control board takes.""The bill also allows provisions for Puerto Rico's 18 distinct debt-issuing agencies to try to come to terms consensually with creditors, through a cooperative process where creditors would be able to vote on debt restructuring plans. Two-thirds of a creditor class would need to support a plan for it to take effect.CREDITORS BENEFIT

PROMESA, also referred to as H.R. 5278, gives significant latitude to the board to manage Puerto Rico's books and form a plan to stabilize its finances.In a change from a prior version released in April, the bill would strengthen language barring the Puerto Rican government from passing any laws to curb the board's authority.""At the end of the day, the real virtue and vice of this bill is the strength of the control board,"" Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who follows Puerto Rico closely, said in an interview.    The latest draft would also restrict the government's ability to transfer property on which creditors have liens. In the case of a proposal to cut repayments to creditors, it would compel a judge to assess the fairness of the proposal against Puerto Rico's constitution, a protection absent from the April draft.
Such protections seemed to modestly reassure markets when the bill was unveiled last week and investors bid up prices on Puerto Rico's benchmark July 2035 general obligation debt.""The revised language is certainly more positive for the commonwealth's GO (General Obligation) and GO-guaranteed bondholders as it attempts to preserve the constitutional protections they currently enjoy,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote clients.'CRAM-DOWN' 
Still, the new bill retains enough ambiguity to make some creditors nervous.
Most significantly, it preserves cram-down power and in one sense makes it easier to start the process. That is because the latest draft of PROMESA removes a pre-condition to cram-down which would have required Puerto Rico to first complete consensual workout talks with creditors, allowing them to vote on a restructuring plan. The current bill merely requires Puerto Rico to make ""good-faith efforts"" toward a cooperative deal before initiating a cram-down action. Determining when Puerto Rico had satisfied that fuzzier standard would be up to the oversight board, giving the board more leeway on deciding when to push Puerto Rico into bankruptcy, and thus more leverage in creditor talks, said Melissa Jacoby, a bankruptcy expert and professor at University of North Carolina School of Law. ""It's important that the restructuring provisions are strong enough to provide the leverage to encourage voluntary deals,"" Jacoby said in an interview. ""This bill asks a lot of Puerto Rico in some respects, and therefore, it's not a good deal for Puerto Rico unless it has a robust restructuring possibility.""One creditor source who was not authorized to speak to the press voiced concern over how the ""good-faith efforts"" standard would be assessed: ""We don't know how the it will be enforced and those are the questions we'll be asking.""

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate voted along party lines on Tuesday to repeal a new Labor Department rule on retirement advice after a debate that stretched over the course of the day.The resolution, approved by a vote of 56 to 41, is a largely symbolic move that President Barack Obama has already threatened to veto. The House of Representatives passed a similar version last month.Obama's administration in April released the rule setting a fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients' best interests ahead of their own bottom lines.Tuesday's arguments revolved around what is best for middle- and lower-income workers.Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, say the rule will be expensive for brokers and force them to get rid of Main Street clients and small businesses that offer 401(k) plans. They also say the rule does not take into account existing regulations on financial advice. Democrats say profit-hungry advisers have exploited middle- and lower-class workers by recommending retirement products that mostly serve to line their own pockets.
Kicking off the debate, the most powerful Republican in the Senate, Kentucky's Mitch McConnell, said blocking the rule would help ""smaller savers."" ""I have sincere concerns about what this could mean for the ability of investment advisers to provide quality financial advice, but also for the ability of consumers to seek affordable retirement options,"" he said.
Nevada's Harry Reid, the most powerful Democrat in the chamber, countered that there was nothing wrong with ""a rule that would require investment advisers to act in the best interest of their investors.""One Republican, Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson, described the rule as ""a solution in search of a problem,"" while fellow party member Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said ""we should call this the 'Only the Rich Retire' rule.""Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey said the rule would allow people to ""retire with dignity"" and without worries that an ""adviser will exploit you.""
Fellow Democrat Patty Murray of Washington said: ""Some financial advisers have lined their own pockets by steering clients toward complicated investments. Some have recommended that retirees make transactions that come with hidden fees. And some get commission when they sell a financial product, even if it doesn't make sense for a client,"" she said. ""We finally have a new protection that would right that wrong.""   (Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Fighting charity fraud could become more difficult under a Republican bill in Congress to prohibit the U.S. Internal Revenue Service from collecting the names of top donors to charities and other nonprofit groups, critics warned on Tuesday.Meant to protect the privacy of wealthy individuals who make anonymous, or ""dark money"" donations to politically active nonprofit groups, the bill would eliminate a decades-old IRS donor-identity disclosure requirement for a range of tax-exempt groups that includes hospitals, universities, community and sports organizations.Backers of the legislation say donor lists have sometimes been disclosed to the public even though the names and addresses are supposed to be private.  In a related development, the IRS itself plans to propose new regulations eliminating donor-reporting requirements for most tax-exempt organizations, according to a document posted on a White House Office of Management and Budget website. It is unclear which groups would still be subject to disclosure under the regulations, which are expected in December. But either move would deprive resource-strapped state law enforcement authorities of ready information used to look into wrongdoing by charities, state officials told Reuters.""It's important forensic data to us state regulators. It's evidence we can consider using in an investigation to determine whether a charity's board has breached its fiduciary duty,"" said Hugh Jones, deputy state attorney general for Hawaii.The Republican measure was approved by a tax committee in April and awaits a House of Representatives vote. If approved it would go next to the Senate, where its outlook was unclear. With ""dark money"" and other forms of cash pouring into U.S. politics, the 2016 presidential contest is expected to cost $5 billion, double that of 2012. Campaign committees and political action committees raise most of that cash, but dark money, or spending whose sources are not disclosed, could exceed $500 million this year, up from only $6 million in 2004.Known as 501(c)s for the tax law section that covers them, these groups, under current law, must disclose donor information on a confidential basis to the IRS on Schedule B of tax Form 990. But they do not have to identify their donors publicly, which makes the groups attractive to wealthy, publicity-shy individuals with a political agenda to pursue.
Representative Pete Roskam, an Illinois Republican steering the bill, said his measure is needed to protect 501(c) donors from having their identities leaked by the IRS. Such leaks could expose them to intimidation by political adversaries and infringe on their free-speech rights, he said.""The IRS is ill-equipped to deal with sensitive data, and there's a great deal of vulnerability,"" Roskam told Reuters. ""Confidentiality breached chills First Amendment rights."" IRS officials declined to comment.CHARITY FRAUD

Although Roskam's bill is geared to address the concerns of political donors, critics say it will have another impact.State authorities investigating charity fraud sometimes ask nonprofit groups for their Schedule B forms, which can help investigators spot conflicts of interest and suspicious movements of money and in-kind donations between charities. ""We would otherwise not have a clue that there was any relationship between charity A and charity B or charity C and D and E and F,"" said Karl Emerson, former director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Charitable Organizations.Experts said charity scams affect at least 1 percent of annual U.S. giving, or about $3.6 billion a year.
Backers of the Roskam bill say Schedule B is not widely used in fraud inquiries. ""I don't know of one case where a fraud was proven by the IRS having had the Schedule B,"" said David Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United.Bossie's organization won a landmark 2010 Supreme Court case that opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups.  Backers of the Roskam bill include Citizens United and billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who donate to a number of politically active nonprofit groups.The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity Foundation and other groups argue that government-mandated disclosure of Schedule B information to state authorities is unconstitutional.The groups have filed lawsuits to stop Democratic attorneys general in California and New York from obtaining Schedule Bs as a part of state-level nonprofit registration procedures.In its lawsuit against California Attorney General Kamala Harris, Americans for Prosperity said more than 1,400 Schedule Bs showed up on a public state website, court documents said.The Roskam bill would preserve some disclosure by requiring nonprofits to continue to report contributions from board members, officers and top salaried employees.

By Karen Brooks

Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards plans to sign legislation making it a hate crime to kill a police officer or another first responder, bolstering penalties for an offense that already qualifies for the state's death penalty, his office said on Tuesday.The legislation adds language to an existing law enhancing penalties for crimes targeting people based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and other identity categories to include ""actual or perceived employment as a law enforcement officer, firefighter or emergency medical services personnel.""    Edwards, a Democrat whose relatives have served as law enforcement officers, is expected to sign the bill sometime this week. The state legislature unanimously approved the measure last week. ""Police officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society,"" he said in a statement. ""The members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections."" 
Supporters say police officers are facing increased threats simply because they wear a badge. Advocates for the law have dubbed the Louisiana measure ""Blue Lives Matter,"" a reference to the color of uniforms often worn by police.The name draws on a prominent national movement, known as Black Lives Matter, which has generated wide protest over the killings of unarmed black citizens by police officers.
Yet opponents argued that the bill was unnecessary because state law already makes it a capital offense to kill police officers in the course of duty. Critics say it could weaken the hate crimes law by including a professional distinction that a matter of choice, in contrast to the color of someone's skin. ""Adding professional categories to the current Hate Crimes statue deters efforts from protecting against identity-based crimes,"" Allison Padilla-Goodman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, said in a statement earlier this month.
Louisiana would be the first state to use a hate crimes statute to enhance penalties for crimes against police officers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but other states allow for similar outcomes using different approaches.

By Megan Cassella
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A bipartisan group of U.S. senators renewed an effort on Tuesday to shift the military's handling of sexual assault cases from top commanders to independent prosecutors, insisting that the current system has left victims too fearful of retaliation to report crimes.Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat who has fought to overhaul the system for three years, introduced the legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass annual bill that sets policy for the Pentagon.The measure failed to pass the Senate in March 2014, though Gillibrand, who sits on the armed services committee, said those votes were cast amid ""false and misleading information"" the Pentagon used to bolster its own argument.""We know far more now about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did a year ago, and it's clear that nothing has changed,"" Gillibrand said at a news conference alongside both Democratic and Republican senators.The current system requires military commanders to handle sexual assault cases within the ranks. Supporters of the bill say the system is flawed because commanders can be unwilling to prosecute such cases and victims, fearing retaliation, are often afraid to report them. 
Top military leaders at the Pentagon contend that prosecutions must remain with commanders to maintain good order and discipline.""Nobody should be forced to go to their boss to report a rape,"" Republican Senator Rand Paul said.
The bill failed by 55-45 in 2014. Gillibrand said she has attempted to contact every senator who previously voted against the bill and is ""very hopeful"" the measure will this time gain the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate.""I think many senators that we've spoken to are concerned, deeply concerned,"" she said. ""The military continues to say, 'We got this,' ... but it's not shown in the data. It's not shown in the survivors' testimony.""She said the bill has not gotten support from Republican Senator John McCain, the chairman of the armed services committee, though she has spoken to him several times about the issue.
Samantha Jackson, who said she was raped by her husband when he was in the Army, said the military told the U.S. attorney's office they would investigate, only to drop her case without pursuing charges.Jackson called her treatment ""a profound betrayal,"" adding, ""I don't understand how the Army could fail to hold my rapist accountable.""

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A hard-line Republican effort to impeach the top U.S. tax collector came under fire on Tuesday from Democrats who called it an unsubstantiated partisan attack that could undermine the credibility of Congress.Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen faces  allegations before the House Judiciary Committee of ignoring congressional subpoenas and misleading lawmakers. The accusations stem from a 2013 scandal in which the IRS was criticized for targeting conservative Tea Party groups' applications for tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny.Some Republicans want the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives to vote on impeaching Koskinen before Congress leaves for its midyear break in July.Democrats oppose the effort. ""This resolution fails by every measure. It arises from the worst partisan instincts. It is not based in the facts,"" Representative John Conyers said at the outset of the first of two Judiciary Committee hearings to examine charges against Koskinen.
""When a vote for impeachment is divided on party lines ... we undermine our credibility,"" added Conyers, the panel's top Democrat.Koskinen angered critics by declining to testify, but submitted a statement saying the charges are without merit and fail to meet the constitutional impeachment standard of ""treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors.""
In his absence, the committee heard from Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which investigated the Tea Party scandal and concluded that Koskinen failed to preserve evidence that was later destroyed.""This is really a simple case in my mind. When Congress asks you a question, you're expected to give a truthful answer. When Congress issues a subpoena, compliance is not optional,"" House oversight panel Chairman Jason Chaffetz testified.Chaffetz described impeachment as the remedy Congress has for officials guilty of breaching the public trust.
But Democrats noted that IRS and Federal Bureau of Investigation probes produced no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or deliberate efforts to mislead Congress. They said the case against Koskinen showed little more than agency mismanagement and misstatements.Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte offered no direct criticism of the impeachment push, but avoided using the term other than to name impeachment as one of several options that include ""the power to write the laws, the power of the purse ... and the power to censure.""

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The Democratic Party said on Monday it would give U.S. presidential contender Bernie Sanders a prominent say in writing its platform this year, a gesture that could ease tensions between Sanders' camp and party leaders, whom Sanders has accused of favoring rival Hillary Clinton. Sanders has remained steadfast in his long-shot battle with Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, even though he lags her in the delegate count with only a few state contests remaining. The divisiveness among the Democrats stands in contrast to the Republicans, whose party leaders are slowly rallying behind Donald Trump, their presumptive nominee.Sanders' tenacity appeared to be paying off. The U.S. senator from Vermont will be allowed to name five members to the 15-member committee that writes the platform at the Democratic National Convention in late July in Philadelphia even if he is not the nominee. Clinton will name six.The party said in a statement the split was based on the results of state votes to date ""in an effort to make this the most representative and inclusive process in history.""The party's chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, will name the committee's final four members.The Democratic Party's rules allow the chair to name all 15 members, suggesting the party was trying to accommodate Sanders and his fervent supporters, who still pack rallies by the thousands as he campaigns in California, which will hold its primary on June 7.Sanders did little to dispel the acrimony between himself and the party, which he joined only last year after more than two decades in Congress as an independent, when he said over the weekend he was endorsing Wasserman Schultz's Democratic opponent in her Florida congressional district.On Monday, he repeated some of his criticisms of Clinton, who he has suggested is vulnerable to influence by corporate donors to her campaign, which she denies. 
Sanders also told the Associated Press in an interview that if Democratic leaders open the convention's doors ""to working-class people and young people and create the kind of dynamism that the Democratic Party needs, it's going to be messy.""""Democracy is not always nice and quiet and gentle but that is where the Democratic Party should go,"" he added.The Clinton campaign said it was pleased to see Sanders represented, describing the party as a ""big tent.""""Hillary Clinton is committed to continue welcoming different perspectives and ideas,"" spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.Sanders, who has criticized Clinton for being too biased toward Israel, has named a pro-Palestinian activist and a prominent environmentalist among his picks for the committee.
CLINTON TURNS ATTENTION TO TRUMP
Clinton has said she now considers herself the de facto Democratic nominee. Increasingly, she has turned her attention to attacking Trump as a ""bully"" when speaking at campaign events while urging Sanders supporters to rally to her side.She told labor union members in Detroit on Monday that if elected, she would embrace issues important to Sanders' supporters, including reform of campaign financing and reducing income inequality.
Underlining Clinton's confidence that she will become the Democratic candidate, her campaign said on Monday she would not participate in a debate with Sanders in California, despite having previously agreed to attend the event hosted by Fox News.    Trump is steadily escalating his criticism of both Hillary and Bill Clinton's relationship with women, using rhetoric that has little precedent in U.S. presidential politics. On Monday, Trump circulated a new online video that shows images of Bill Clinton, the former president, as voices of women play on the soundtrack saying he had assaulted them, before ending with the sound of Hillary Clinton, his wife, laughing.Although none of the women are identified in the video, one of the voices is that of Juanita Broaddrick in an NBC interview from 1999 in which the former nursing-home manager accused Bill Clinton of raping her in a hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1978.The Clintons' lawyer, David Kendall, said in 1999 that the accusation was false. The Clintons have declined to discuss the accusation and are ignoring his personal attacks, with Hillary Clinton saying instead she will defend vulnerable Americans from the consequences of Trump's proposals.""Trump economics is a recipe for lower wages, fewer jobs, more debt,"" she told the union members on Monday. ""He could bankrupt America like he bankrupted his companies. I mean, ask yourself: How can anybody lose money running a casino, really?""
