By Jeffrey Hodgson and Charlotte Greenfield
| TORONTO/WELLINGTON

TORONTO/WELLINGTON Canada's main immigration website remained down on Wednesday and New Zealand reported increased traffic to its website for residency visas from U.S. nationals as Donald Trump surged to victory in the U.S. presidential election.Americans have often vowed to leave the country if their chosen candidate doesn't win the election, but this time around some are actually preparing to do so after Trump stunningly won the Nov. 8 election.A spokeswoman for Canada's immigration department said the website crashed ""as a result of a significant increase in the volume of traffic"" as election results rolled in Tuesday night.Bonnie Quinn, a New Jersey insurance underwriter planning to move to Canada with her husband said she felt ""just downright embarrassed"" by the election results.""I'm not sure in what order we should do things - find jobs first or move,"" said Quinn, 35, whose Irish grandparents once immigrated to Canada.In New Zealand, immigration officials said the New Zealand Now website, which deals with residency and student visas, had received 1,593 registrations from United States citizens since Nov. 1 - more than 50 percent of a typical month's registrations in just seven days. Rod Drury, the chief executive of NZ-based global accounting software firm Xero, said the statistics matched up with interest his company has been seeing from prospective U.S. national employees concerned about a Trump win. 
Drury said what started as a joke was becoming a reality. ""I've got lots of messages coming through at the moment asking for a job in New Zealand, and we're saying 'Yes you can',"" Drury told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday.In the hours after Trump's victory, Americans were searching for jobs in Canada at 10 times the rate of previous nights, said Jed Kolko, chief economist for job website Indeed.""It's far too soon to guess how many of these searchers will make a move after the shock wears off. But the jump in searches shows how many Americans were surprised by Trump's victory and are thinking about their options elsewhere,"" Kolko said in an emailed statement.
In Atlanta, business coach Nancy Chorpenning, 62, said she and her husband are looking to move to Costa Rica sooner than their planned retirement because of the Trump victory.""I am simply terrified the new administration and Congress may destroy the Social Security we count on when my husband retires,"" said Chorpenning, who is traveling to Costa Rica next week to scout for condos.After some Americans, often jokingly, said they would move to Canada if Trump was elected, the idea was taken up by some Canadian communities. 
In February, the island of Cape Breton on Canada's Atlantic coast marketed itself as a tranquil refuge for Americans seeking to escape should Trump capture the White House.On Maple Match, a recently-launched dating website aimed to match Americans fleeing Trump with Canadians, users have more than doubled to about 14,000 overnight, according to chief executive Joe Goldman.While the pledge to ""move to Canada"" has been made in elections past, it has rarely played out, although thousands of Americans who opposed the Vietnam War moved to Canada.Migration data from after Republican George W. Bush's 2000 election and 2004 re-election - other moments when liberal Americans pledged to move to Canada in protest - suggest few followed through on their promises. While immigration to Canada increased during the years of Bush's elections, the rise was not more than increases in other years, data from the Montreal-based Association for Canadian Studies show.

By Deena Beasley
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES California voters turned down a ballot initiative aimed at reining in rising prices for prescription drugs after pharmaceutical companies spent more than $100 million to fight it.The California Drug Price Relief Act, also known as Proposition 61, sought to limit state health programs from paying more for medications than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which receives the steepest discounts in the country. As of Wednesday morning, with more than 99 percent of precincts partially reporting from Tuesday's election, the vote was 46 percent in favor of the measure and 54 percent opposed, according to California's Secretary of State.""The pharmaceutical companies spent a lot to defeat this,"" said Stuart Schweitzer, professor of health policy and management at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. ""They wanted to draw a line in the sand.""The measure's defeat ""reaffirms the power of the biopharma lobby,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to investors on Wednesday.
The rising cost of prescription drugs came under attack during the U.S. presidential campaign. Both President-elect Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton called for cost-trimming measures including allowing Medicare, the federal health plan for seniors, to negotiate prices with drugmakers.Shares in pharmaceutical and biotechnology shares, under pressure in recent weeks, soared on Wednesday as market fears of a win by Clinton and Democrats gaining power in Congress receded. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index .NBI advanced 7 percent and was on track for its biggest single-day gain in about five years.    Proposition 61's opponents, led by global drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc and Amgen Inc, spent around $106 million. They argued that it would benefit only 12 percent of Californians, while putting the other 88 percent, and veterans across the country, at risk of higher drug costs.
Supporters, led by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and AARP, which advocates for seniors, said only drug companies themselves can raise prices for veterans or other consumers. Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders also campaigned in support of Proposition 61, calling on voters to ""stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.""Proponents, who raised $17 million to support the initiative, estimated it could save California taxpayers up to $5.7 billion over 10 years, although a state legislative analysis said the financial impact is not clear.UCLA's Schweitzer said the measure would have had only a modest impact on state drug costs.
There were also questions about how Proposition 61 would be implemented. The VA's mandated prices are listed publicly, but its steepest negotiated price discounts are required by law to be confidential.The VA spends some $6.1 billion a year on medicines for 6 million veterans. Proposition 61 would have extended those discounts to around 4.5 million Californians, including certain members of the state's low-income Medicaid plan, state employees and retirees, university teachers and prisoners.A similar proposition has been approved for Ohio's 2017 November ballot.

| SEVNICA, Slovenia

SEVNICA, Slovenia The small Slovenian town of Sevnica, Melania Trump's birthplace, savored her husband's shock win in the U.S. election as a likely boon for tourism on Wednesday, while a former schoolmate remembered her as ""creative and innovative"".Until about a year ago, the town of fewer than 5,000 people, nestled in the foothills of the Alps, was scarcely known in Slovenia, let alone abroad.  But on Monday, Sevnica was clearly looking forward to a financial spin-off from being the hometown of the 46-year-old future U.S. First Lady.""Sometimes the pressure of the media was too hard. The people of Sevnica are not used to it. On the other hand, the global attention is positive because Sevnica is developing into a tourist destination,"" mayor Srecko Ocvirk said.Speaking to Reuters shortly after 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) in Sevnica's Central cafe, the smiling mayor said local residents had supported Trump and his wife's campaign.
""We are very satisfied at the result,"" he said.Born Melania Knavs in 1970, she lived in an apartment block in Sevnica with her family as a child. When she was a teenager, the family moved to a modest two-storey house above the Sava river on the outskirts of town, which sits below a well-maintained medieval castle.Residents say her father sold car parts and her mother worked for a factory that made a brand of children's clothing very popular in communist Yugoslavia, before the country fell apart in the 1990s.
Melania's modeling career took her to Milan and thence to the United States, far away from her native Slovenia, a tiny former Yugoslav republic of 2 million people comparable in size to New Jersey.""Even as a child Melania was creative, innovative and Sevnica was too small for her,"" said Mirjana Jelancic, Melania's friend who is now a headmistress of Melania's elementary school.
""She was reserved and when I heard that Donald was running I said (to myself) this will be hard for her. She never wanted to be in the spotlight,"" Jelancic said. ""She was excellent at her job (in the campaign).""The head of the town's health center, which received a donation from Melania in 2005 when she was pregnant with her son Barron, said she believed Melania would be a success in the White House, as well.""Melania will be an excellent First Lady who will take Slovenian values of generosity, loyalty and trust to the United States and the world,"" Vladimira Tomsic said.

Trump, who strongly criticized the Iran deal and the Paris agreement, will start his four-year term on Jan. 20.

By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress in a momentous election on Tuesday in which Republican Donald Trump won the presidency, empowering the party to reshape Washington.The Republican sweep sets up the United States for two years of ""unified"" government, which would normally mean significant policy change, although Trump's election was anything but normal and he will start his presidency with unusual handicaps. Both Republican leaders on Capitol Hill held Trump at arm's length during the campaign. Trump offended and attacked some congressional Republicans on the stump, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.Early on Wednesday, shortly after Clinton conceded to Trump, Ryan said in a statement: ""We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican,  said in a guarded and similarly timed statement: ""The American people have chosen a new direction for our nation.""The new Congress will not convene until Jan. 3, but the ""lame-duck"" Congress will return next week and Republicans are set to begin the process of picking leaders for both chambers.Ryan's position as speaker could be challenged by Republican conservatives who backed Trump and it remains to be seen if the president-elect himself will try to push Ryan out.""Trump seems magnanimous right now,"" an aide to one of Trump's House supporters said after Trump stressed unity in his victory speech in New York. ""We shall see.""In a huge disappointment to Democrats, Republicans were on a pace to lose only a handful of seats in the House, well below the double-digit losses some predicted.Similarly, Democrats gained only one seat in the Senate, although a few races were still to be determined, including New Hampshire, where incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte was deadlocked with Democrat Maggie Hassan early on Wednesday.
In Illinois, Democratic U.S. Representative Tammy Duckworth defeated Republican Senator Mark Kirk. Democrats needed to pick up a net five seats to win Senate control.PREDICTIONS DEFIED
Republican successes came on the heels of big Republican gains in the 2014 congressional elections and defied predictions the party was in tatters and on the verge of splitting apart because of deep divisions over Trump.Congressional Republicans are sure to flex their muscles on a range of legislation, not the least of which is fulfilling a six-year quest to repeal President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law known as ""Obamacare.""
Republicans also campaigned on an agenda that shunned comprehensive immigration reform and opposed gun control and expanded environmental and financial regulations.In the Senate, McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was expected to remain at his post for at least the next two years.Paul Sracic, who chairs the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said: ""There was all this concern that Trump would damage Republicans down-ticket. Just the opposite happened"" as Trump brought out more Republican voters.Come January, Republicans will have to pivot from trying to block Obama's initiatives - such as his signature health insurance program Obamacare - to governing along with Trump.""Republicans no longer have the luxury of being the opposition party, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University.
""For example, will they actually repeal Obamacare and agree what to implement in its place?"" she added.MCCONNELL'S PAYOFF
McConnell led conservatives' opposition to any Supreme Court nominee named by Obama following last February's death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.His gamble paid off and he will now await a nomination from Trump, likely dooming Obama's choice of federal judge Merrick Garland.Star-power incumbent Republicans, such as Senator John McCain in Arizona and Marco Rubio in Florida, also scored victories. Issues ranging from tax cuts to border security will now take center stage in Washington. Trump's opposition to trade deals with foreign countries puts in serious jeopardy the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by Obama that would cover economies from Japan to Chile.""In terms of trade, I think TPP is dead. The stake went through its heart tonight,"" Sracic said.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who sparred with Donald Trump at times during his presidential campaign, pledged on Wednesday to work closely with the president-elect to forge an aggressive Republican legislative agenda from the outset of 2017.At a news conference in his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, Ryan said he and Trump are arranging a meeting to discuss the transition to a new Congress and administration, as well as the Republican agenda for the lame-duck session of Congress that begins on Monday.Tuesday's election results will give the Republicans simultaneous control of the White House, Senate and House for the first time since early 2007.""He just earned a mandate and we now just have a unified Republican government,"" Ryan said of Trump. ""The opportunity is now here. And the opportunity is to go big, to go bold and to get things done.""Ryan said he expected his six-point ""A Better Way"" blueprint to provide a framework for future action. The plan, which House Republicans used an election platform, calls for initiatives that include repealing and replacing Obamacare, reforming the U.S. tax code and scaling back federal regulations on industry. 
Ryan had been slow to endorse Trump for president and clashed with the wealthy businessman over his incendiary campaign rhetoric, accusing him of making comment that was ""the textbook definition of racism"" about a judge of Mexican heritage. Last month Trump described Ryan as ""a very weak and ineffective leader.""But on Wednesday Ryan said he and Trump had held two ""fantastic conversations"" in the past 18 hours. Ryan's aim is to ""make sure that when his hand comes off the Bible, when he is sworn in as president, we are hitting the ground running.""
Ryan said Republicans in Congress also would coordinate with Trump on the upcoming lame duck session on what can be achieved. The speaker also said it was time for ""redemption, not recrimination"" and dismissed concerns about civil liberties created by Trump campaign talk.""Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no one else did. He turned politics on its head,"" Ryan said.
""Donald Trump provided the kind of coattails that got a lot of people over the finish line so that we could maintain our strong House and Senate majorities.""There had been speculation Ryan would not run for the speaker job in January but last week his staff said he would run for re-election to the post.
