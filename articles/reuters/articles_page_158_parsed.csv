By Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON When the U.S. Congress returns in September from a summer recess, it is expected to consider legislation called the Blue Lives Matter Act that would make killing a police officer a hate crime, a step first taken by Louisiana earlier this year. Debate in Louisiana over the law enacted in May pitted police unions, which supported tougher hate-crime sentences for police assailants, against civil rights groups, which felt police did not face the historic discrimination hate-crime laws were intended to address. The Louisiana debate could play out on a national stage with the Blue Lives Matter Act as police shooting deaths this month in Dallas and Baton Rouge stoke momentum for action to combat violence against police and build support for the law. ""Since the Baton Rouge tragedy, we've received calls and messages from around the country from individuals asking about the Blue Lives Matter Act, and we're confident more members of Congress will be co-sponsoring the legislation as soon as they can when Congress reconvenes,"" said Kyle Huwa, a spokesman for the bill's author, Colorado Republican Representative Ken Buck. 
Sixteen Republicans in the House of Representatives are co-sponsoring the bill, which was introduced in March and has failed to gain Democratic support.Its title plays off the Black Lives Matter movement that arose in protest against police use of force against minorities, especially black men, and deaths of minorities at the hands of police in recent years. Fraternal Order of Police Executive Director Jim Pasco said he has in private meetings urged President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Loretta Lynch to protect police under the federal hate crime statute. 
That law covers violence motivated by bias against a victim's race, gender, national origin, religion or sexual orientation and imposes harsher penalties as a deterrent.But Pasco said he received no confirmation such a move would be supported by the administration. The Justice Department and the White House declined to comment on their positions. 
In the shooting deaths of three police officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday, Louisiana prosecutors would have been able to seek hate crime penalties against gunman Gavin Long if he had survived.Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington based advocacy group, said many states have increased penalties for assaults against police and police deaths have been declining.Police shootings overall have been down in recent years. Preliminary Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics released Monday show 41 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2015. That was down almost 20 percent from 51 officers killed in 2014.""We should not use this as a moment to dilute the unique problem of long standing discrimination and violence directed toward groups on the basis of race in our country,"" Clarke said.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON In a last-ditch effort to revive a White House plan to protect up to 4 million immigrants from deportation, the Obama administration on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rehear a case on which the eight-member court was split 4-4 last month.The June 23 high court decision left in place a lower court ruling that blocked the plan, which has never been in effect. The court is currently one justice short following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.In a filing, the Justice Department asked the court to take a second look at the case once it has a full complement of nine justices. It is unclear when that would be, as the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate has declined to act on Obama's nominee, appeals court judge Merrick Garland. As such, even if the Supreme Court was to grant the request, it is unlikely to rule on the case until well after Obama leaves office in January.Acknowledging that the high court rarely rehears cases, Acting Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn said the immigration case is unique because the court could not in future take another case to resolve the issue if the plan is blocked. The high court ""should be the final arbiter of these matters through a definitive ruling,"" he wrote.
Obama unveiled his plan in November 2014. It was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued that Obama overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress.""Because we are right on the law, we have prevailed at every stage in this case, and we are confident that we will continue to prevail,"" said Marc Rylander, a spokesman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. 
As a result of the high court's 4-4 split, a 2015 lower-court ruling invalidating Obama's plan was left in place. The plan never was implemented because the lower courts had blocked it.The plan was tailored to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits.

By Ginger Gibson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND The Republican National Convention was in an uproar on Monday after opponents of presumptive U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump failed in their effort to hold a roll-call vote in opposition to his candidacy.The anti-Trump forces at the Cleveland convention started shouting ""Roll Call"" after the party leaders approved by acclamation rules at the start of the convention that barred them from registering their opposition.
Party leaders declared there was insufficient support to allow for a roll-call vote that would record the number of delegates opposed to Trump, a New York businessman who has never held political office and has struggled to win over many mainstream Republicans.Some delegates walked out of the convention in protest at the leaders' ruling while others chanted loudly, demanding a roll-call vote take place.
Trump last week declared the so-called ""Never Trump"" movement dead, tweeting that ""#NeverTrump is never more.""

BRUSSELS U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry paid tribute to the European Union on Monday as it tries to heal the wound of Britain's vote to leave, saying detractors were overlooking what it had achieved in alliance with America.""I ask anyone who questions the importance of the EU or its relationship with the United States, (to consider) not just the history that I articulated, but the increase of prosperity, the rise in the standard of living ... the better protection of rights for individuals in the EU, as a consequence of what we have done together,"" Kerry said in Brussels.He was speaking at a joint news conference with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini after a meeting with his European counterparts including Boris Johnson, Britain's new foreign minister, who led the Leave campaign.His comments sounded like a jab at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who last month forecast the break-up of the EU due to fears over immigration, and at Johnson, who during the campaign compared the EU's ambitions with those of Hitler and Napoleon.
Kerry, a Democrat, spoke of the close ties between the United States and European Union dating back to the U.S. role in freeing Europe from Nazism in World War Two. But he acknowledged that such memories were fading. ""There's a whole separation of time which has changed attitudes of some people,"" he said, adding that in the face of common threats such as Islamist militancy, the EU-U.S. partnership was ""as important as it has ever been"".
Mogherini responded that it sometimes took a clear-sighted transatlantic view to put Europe's value into perspective.""I would like to thank you personally, and through you the U.S. administration of President Obama for the strong message and clear message that we always hear from you on the need for a strong and united Europe,"" she said.

By Steve Holland and Ginger Gibson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Cleveland's police union called for the suspension of a state law allowing people to carry firearms during the Republican National Convention but Ohio's governor said he was powerless to act despite heightened security concerns with the killing on Sunday of three police officers in Louisiana. Republican Donald Trump seized on the shooting deaths in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to bolster his case the United States is leaderless and he is the better candidate in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election to restore law and order than his rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.It was not immediately clear there was a link between Sunday's shootings and recent unrest countrywide over police killings of black men, one of them a shooting in Baton Rouge about two weeks ago.Despite a lack of clarity about the motive and specifics of Sunday's incident, Trump said President Barack Obama ""doesn't have a clue"" on how to handle the problem after Obama voiced concern about inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail. ""Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!"" Trump said.He issued statements on Twitter on Sunday, a day before the start of the four-day Republican Convention in Cleveland this week due to formally nominate him for the White House.After the shootings in Baton Rouge, in which three other police officers were wounded, the head of Cleveland's police union, Steve Loomis, asked Governor John Kasich to suspend state laws allowing people to openly carry firearms, but Kasich said he lacked the authority to do so.Kasich, a Republican who lost his bid for the White House to Trump, issued a statement through his spokeswoman Emmalee Kalmbach, saying:""Ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested. The bonds between our communities and police must be reset and rebuilt - as we're doing in Ohio - so our communities and officers can both be safe.""Clinton called the shootings ""devastating"" and urged the country to work together. ""We must not turn our backs on each other. We must not be indifferent to each other,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""We must all stand together to reject violence and strengthen our communities.""OBAMA: SHUN INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC

Speaking at the White House, Obama said that with this week's Republican convention followed next week by the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, political rhetoric would likely be more overheated than usual.""We don't need inflammatory rhetoric, we don't need careless accusations thrown around to score political points or to advance an agenda. We need to temper our words and open our hearts, all of us,"" Obama told reporters.There were no plans to delay Monday's start of the Cleveland convention, where thousands of Republican delegates are gathering amid a threat of protests both for and against Trump, 70, a businessman-turned-candidate.Security was extraordinarily tight with downtown streets lined by concrete traffic dividers and tall metal fences, propelled by a new urgency after an attacker drove his truck into a holiday crowd in Nice, France, last week, killing 84 people.Jeff Larson, chief executive officer of the convention, said he was not worried about the open carry law.""There's going to be plenty of law enforcement in downtown Cleveland,"" he told reporters. ""I feel good about the security and what we've done.""
Trump sought to link the violence to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, writing: ""We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching.""Trump enters the crucial week trailing Clinton in most national opinion polls and needs a bounce from the convention to vault him into a more competitive position.Republican strategist Hogan Gidley said the violence gave relevance to Trump's message.""It's something that Donald Trump and his crowd were already prepared to talk about,"" he said. ""This is an epidemic in this country now and we've got to solve it.""NIXON IN 1968

Democratic strategist David Axelrod tweeted that Trump's effort to make himself a law-and-order candidate reminded him of a similar attempt by Richard Nixon in 1968, when the Republican won his first presidential election.""Someone's been studying '68,"" Axelrod tweeted.Trump's goal at the convention is to get more American voters to take a fresh look at him and, he hopes, to see him in a more favorable light, after his victory over 16 other Republican candidates in a brutal battle marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric that left many in the party divided.To that end, many speakers will talk about their views on Trump, from daughter Ivanka to women's pro golfer Natalie Gulbis.""It's going to be a very personal convention. I mean, you're going to have his family speaking. You're going to have friends who have known him speaking,"" Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told CBS's ""Face the Nation.""Many longtime party fixtures are staying away.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has been a private counselor to Trump, said the convention would help Trump pivot to the general election.""He's never run for anything before. ... I think it's just taken longer to pivot, and I think he's pivoting,"" Priebus told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The convention will also provide Republican faithful with their first look at his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who was announced on Saturday after a messy selection process.Hoping to win over more traditional Republicans, Trump picked the social conservative Pence over two other finalists, former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.The disorganized nature of the running mate rollout - in which Trump failed to fully project the power of the partnership  - had some Republicans worried that they could see more of the same at Cleveland.

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump, who often says he only likes winners, tells one grand tale of loss: In 1990, he nearly went bankrupt and was forced to ask dozens of banks to whom he owed money to change the terms on their loans and forgive some of his debts.It was, the real estate developer admits in his 1997 book ""The Art of the Comeback,"" the darkest period of his professional life. In his telling, it's a story of redemption, of resilience, and proof of his exceptional negotiating skills and shrewd thinking.Six people who participated in the loan workout negotiations have a different recollection, raising questions about a key part of the personal narrative that many of Trump's supporters have found compelling as he campaigns to be the next president of the United States on Nov. 8. On the campaign trail he has portrayed himself as a survivor and a master negotiator.Trump says his comeback began when he recognized a downturn in the real estate market and quickly asked banks to renegotiate his loans. ""That decision was perhaps the smartest thing I did,"" he wrote.The six bankers and lawyers involved in the talks say the bailout wasn't based on any overture Trump initiated with the banks - and the terms of the deal were dictated by what was best for the banks, not Trump. Three of the participants say Trump didn't acknowledge he had a problem until his lenders reviewed his books, realized he was on the brink of collapse, and summoned him for debt restructuring talks. While much has been written about Trump's financial troubles at the time, there has been little examination of his description of the bank negotiations in ""The Art of the Comeback,"" including his assertion that he chose to initiate those talks.Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, declined to comment for this story.WARNING SIGNS 
Following the U.S. stock market crash of 1987, a global recession hit New York real estate. New construction stalled, and several big developers declared bankruptcy. As the real estate market slumped, Trump ran out of cash.At the beginning of 1990 he owed a combined $4 billion to more than 70 banks, with $800 million personally guaranteed by his own assets, according to Alan Pomerantz, a lawyer whose team led negotiations between Trump and 72 banks to restructure Trump's loans. Pomerantz was hired by Citibank but became lead counsel for the negotiations.At the time, Trump was not considered a major developer, but he was a New York celebrity. His affair with the actress Marla Maples and his divorce from his first wife Ivana Trump made national news headlines, and his first book, ""The Art of the Deal,"" was a bestseller.He didn't have a large portfolio of real estate in New York, with the notable exceptions of his 5th Avenue building, Trump Tower, completed in 1983, and the Plaza Hotel, which he bought in 1988 after borrowing heavily from Citibank.He also owned three casinos in Atlantic City, having made a financial bet that he could revive the East Coast gambling destination. And in 1989 he added part of an airline to his portfolio, again turning to Citibank for a loan to help finance the acquisition of bankrupt Eastern Airlines Shuttle. He turned it into Trump Shuttle.
LOOKING AT THE BOOKS
In 1989, in response to growing concerns about the economic downturn, the Federal Reserve began asking big banks to review their exposure to the sinking real estate market.At the beginning of 1990, a credit specialist at one of Trump's biggest lenders decided to take a look at the bank's book of loans to him.The decision was prompted in part by the Fed's questions, as well as concerns within the bank about its exposure to the real estate market. The credit specialist, who did not want to be identified, concluded at the time that Trump was ""about to go into bankruptcy."" ""The banks were onto the problem before he was onto the problem,"" the specialist told Reuters.Pomerantz said some of the banks became aware of the magnitude of Trump's financial problems when, on a single day, he drew down every cent of a $100 million line of credit one of the banks, Banker's Trust, which was purchased by Deutsche Bank in 1999, had given him to meet his obligations.Reuters was unable to independently confirm this.""He did not come to the banks and say 'I have a problem.' That did not happen,"" said Pomerantz.Pomerantz, who says he is not a member of any political party, argued in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that Trump's record in real estate was not a good way to measure whether or not he would be a good president. 
In ""The Art of the Comeback,"" Trump says he began loan workout talks in March 1990 when he informed his bankers he might miss a payment on his casino debts. ""If I had waited just six months longer to renegotiate terms with the banks, I might have lost everything,"" he wrote. ""I would have had to stand in line with a whole bunch of other moguls who were trying to do the same thing.""MAKING A DEAL
Soon, in boardrooms of banks and law firms around Manhattan, Trump's deputies and lawyers began a series of meetings with representatives of the 72 banks, which had billions in outstanding loans, according to Pomerantz.During the same period, Trump was separately renegotiating a series of loans on his Atlantic City casinos. One of the bankers involved in those negotiations, Ben Berzin, said Trump seemed unaware of the depths of his financial troubles even after the banks had stepped in. ""There was a period during these negotiations when he was still spending money like a drunken sailor,"" Berzin said, recalling the uproar among the bankers when, in a TV interview in the summer of 1991, Trump displayed a large diamond engagement ring he had given Maples. Media reports said the ring cost $250,000, and Pomerantz said the bankers complained about it to Trump in their next meeting.At one point, Trump invited all of the bankers to a Broadway show that Maples had a role in, according to Berzin and a banker who took part in the larger talks with the 72 banks. Both said they believed Trump was trying to curry favor to win better terms in the workouts. Berzin attended the show but the other banker did not.
Trump described Berzin in ""The Art of the Comeback"" as a ""jerk"" who would ""scream at people at the top of his lungs about nonsense."" Berzin said he was irritated by Trump's characterization and denied ever raising his voice in a meeting.BANKING ON ""TRUMP THE SALESMAN""
In his book, Trump says he told representatives of the 72 banks he would declare bankruptcy and ""tie you guys up for years"" in the proceedings unless they staked him $65 million to keep his businesses running until the real estate market recovered. He also wanted them to agree to defer all loan payments until that time.  ""The banks more than capitulated - they enthusiastically agreed to my proposal,"" Trump wrote.The bankers and lawyers interviewed dispute this. Though it was true that a personal bankruptcy would have made it harder for the banks to collect what Trump owed them, he had little leverage in the talks, they said.He, too, would have been seriously hurt in a bankruptcy, especially since he had personally guaranteed so much of what he had borrowed. In Pomerantz's analysis, he would have been able to hold on to little else beyond his home and his pension plan.During the 18-month process of negotiations and asset sales, Trump also asked for more time to develop his business ideas, like his plan to turn hotel rooms at the Plaza Hotel into condominiums, according to one of the bankers, who declined to be identified.That proposal was vetoed. While he did receive a $450,000-a-month allowance from the banks to keep his business operations going, it was structured and executed on the banks' terms, several of the negotiators said.The banks decided they could recover more of the $4 billion they were collectively owed if they sold Trump's holdings one by one, waiting until the market recovered, rather than taking possession of the assets, four participants in the talks said. These individuals said the banks agreed to forgive Trump's personal liabilities in exchange for his help in selling the properties. The proceeds of the sales would then be split among the banks.Trump agreed that the banks could take away all his personal property, including his beloved Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, if he failed to execute the agreement.""We had to be sure he would pay attention,"" Pomerantz said of the liens on Trump's personal holdings. ""We would meet with him every Friday morning. He was under very strict restrictions by the banks."" Trump worked with the bankers to sell his assets, even when he disagreed about the timing of the sales, most notably when Citibank eventually sold The Plaza.The banks did not recover 100 percent of what they were owed and several lenders vowed never to work with Trump again.
