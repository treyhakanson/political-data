By Katie Paul and Hadeel Al Sayegh
| RIYADH/DUBAI

RIYADH/DUBAI A U.S. law allowing lawsuits against Saudi Arabia over the Sept. 11 attacks met a stony silence from Riyadh on Thursday but some Saudis bristled, saying the kingdom should curb business and security ties in response.The Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government.Riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of Islamist militant group al Qaeda. Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"", or JASTA, in the run-up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity.But Saudi officials who had lobbied against the bill stopped short of threatening any retaliation if the law was passed.There was no official reaction from Saudi Arabia after the votes, and in the short-term, few expect little more than a curt statement of disapproval from Riyadh.The long-standing alliance between the kingdom and the United States is one of the cornerstones of Middle East politics, security and trade, and in their reactions on Thursday some Saudis said JASTA would jeopardize what they see as an interdependent relationship.  ""What would happen if Saudi Arabia froze its cooperation with the United States with regards to counter-terrorism as a response to JASTA?"" Salman al-Dosary, editor-in-chief of the pan-Arab, Saudi-owned Al Sharq al-Awsat newspaper, wrote on Twitter.
The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the bill was passed, prompting a drop in dollar demand in Riyadh.""People are reluctant to buy dollars ... because of the price,"" said Raed al-Sayari, whose family runs an exchange shop in a bustling commercial district popular with foreign workers.""We're concerned that if the dollar keeps appreciating and the situation doesn't stabilize in the coming days there will be no demand. This would be a big loss for the market.""The Saudi riyal SAR= is pegged at 3.75 to the dollar in the spot market, but banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks.
POLITICAL EXPEDIENCE?
Some analysts argue the Al Saud ruling family will interpret the move as political expedience by lawmakers in a U.S. election season and that the chances of a successful lawsuit are uncertain at best.But the measure does nothing to ease long-standing friction in the alliance: President Barack Obama, who had vetoed JASTA but was overridden by Congress, is increasingly seen by the kingdom and fellow Gulf Arab as favoring their bitter rival Iran, a charge Washington denies, and differs with Riyadh over Syria and other Arab crises.
""This bill reflects an anti-Saudi campaign. It is time to see less of America in our midst,"" said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political scientist in the United Arab Emirates.Some analysts have speculated that Riyadh could retaliate by curbing U.S. trade with the biggest Arab economy or restrict cooperation on security, a crucial relationship for U.S. counter-terrorism and for peace efforts in Arab conflicts.Theodore Karasik, of Gulf State Analytics, wrote on al Arabiya website that JASTA would ""ignite a firestorm of legal warfare that will directly undermine political relationships at a time when robust ties to fight terrorism is required"".He said the measure could also disrupt sweeping economic reforms meant to boost the private sector and foreign investment and wean the kingdom off oil dependence. Some analysts speculated that bilateral trade and investment could be hurt. The kingdom owns $96.5 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds, and is believed to hold at least that sum in other U.S. assets and bank accounts.

WASHINGTON The White House said on Thursday that Congress's passage of a law allowing Sept. 11-related suits against Saudi Arabia was ""an abject embarrassment"" and that the administration was willing to talk to lawmakers about narrowing the measure's impact.""I think what we've seen in the United States Congress is a pretty classic case of rapid onset buyer's remorse,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a briefing, noting that 28 senators had written a letter expressing concern about the measure within minutes of voting to override President Barack Obama's veto.

Congress on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected President Barack Obama's veto of the legislation.

By Andrew Torchia and Tom Arnold
| DUBAI

DUBAI The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the U.S. Congress voted to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. Any legal action could take years to wind through the U.S. court system, and analysts said there might be little if any impact on the Saudi economy or state finances. But the decision by Congress was an unwelcome reminder of political and financial pressures on Riyadh as low oil prices strain its budget.Saudi Arabia has been preparing to make its first international issue of sovereign bonds next month to raise $10 billion or more, but some Gulf bankers said the issue might now be delayed to give investors time to digest the news.Similarly, the legal threat could make Riyadh less likely to choose New York for a listing of shares in national oil giant Saudi Aramco. An offer of Aramco shares is expected as soon as 2017, possibly raising tens of billions of dollars, and Saudi officials have said they are considering several foreign bourses.The Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to override President Barack Obama's veto of legislation granting an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil.This clears the way for attempts to seek damages from the Saudi government. Riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.One-year dollar/riyal forwards, which are trades scheduled to take place 12 months from now, were at 550 points early on Thursday, up from Wednesday's close of 330 points. They rose as far as an eight-week high of 625 points.
The Saudi riyal is pegged at 3.75 to the dollar in the spot market, so banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks.""In the short term you might have volatility but the legislation will take a decade to have a result, so markets will calm down,"" predicted a banker involved in Gulf currency trade, adding the main impact might be to saddle the Saudi government with tens of millions of dollars in annual legal fees.Five-year Saudi credit default swaps, used to insure against the risk of a sovereign debt default, rose slightly to 157 points from 152, and the Saudi stock market fell slightly.
But the price of state-run Saudi Electricity Co's April 2023 dollar Islamic bond, one of the few outstanding international bonds from Saudi Arabia, did not move significantly.Some analysts speculated that trade and investment ties between Saudi Arabia and the United States could be hurt. The kingdom owns $96.5 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds, according to the latest official U.S. data, and is believed to hold at least that sum in other U.S. assets and bank accounts.""From a Saudi foreign ministry perspective, there will be a review of investment policy and that could move the kingdom down a different path, which could include diversification away from U.S. Treasuries,"" the Gulf banker said.In May, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said the proposed U.S. law ""would cause an erosion of investor confidence"" in the United States, though he added that Riyadh was not threatening to pull its money out of the country.
Riyadh has been selling several billion dollars in U.S. bonds each month to cover its budget deficit, and bankers think it is unlikely to step this up as a result of the Congress vote. That is because few other markets or currencies provide the combination of liquidity and security of the $13 trillion U.S. Treasury market.Saudi Arabia has also been eagerly courting investment by top U.S. companies such as General Electric Co to help diversify its economy beyond oil, and a trade or investment war with the United States could damage its economic reform drive.""The U.S. is a market where the Saudis will continue to invest. I don't think they'll adopt a knee-jerk reaction to their investments,"" said John Sfakianakis, economist with the Jeddah-based Gulf Research Centre.""If it makes sense, they will continue to keep their assets in the United States.""

By David Morgan and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Congress approved a stop-gap funding bill on Wednesday that averts a looming federal government shutdown and provides urgently needed money to help battle an outbreak of the Zika virus.Passage of the bipartisan legislation came shortly after Republicans and Democrats ended a months-long fight over whether Washington should provide aid to the city of Flint, Michigan, as it struggles with a crisis over contaminated drinking water.Separate legislation was approved by the House of Representatives earlier in the day setting aid for Flint. It must now be reconciled with a somewhat different bill passed by the Senate.  The House voted 342-85 in a late-night session on Wednesdayto approve stop-gap funding to keep the U.S. government operating from Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year, until Dec. 9, when lawmakers will attempt to approve longer-term money.With existing funds due to expire on Saturday, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said the legislation ""is a last resort, but at this point it is what we must do ... to keep the lights on in our government.""The Senate voted 72-26 earlier on Wednesday to adopt the short-term spending bill.
Besides providing money to keep the government operating, the legislation also contains $1.1 billion to battle the Zika virus that has hit Puerto Rico hard and spread to U.S. states, most notably Florida.The disease can cause severe birth defects. Funds would be used to develop a vaccine and reduce Zika exposure.The bill also includes $500 million for flood relief in Louisiana and other states.
In a series of carefully orchestrated maneuvers after the Senate approved the temporary funding, the House passed a wide-ranging water resources bill containing $170 million to assist Flint by a vote of 399-25.Democrats have demanded action on the crisis, which stems from dangerous levels of lead in Flint's drinking water.A Senate version of the bill contains $220 million for Flint and other cities with problem water systems.The two chambers will have to hammer out compromise legislation after the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections. Wednesday's flurry of activity in Congress came as lawmakers rushed to recess this week until after the elections.       
Conservative groups urged Congress to defeat the funding bill. However, with House and Senate members facing an imminent deadline for approving new money and lawmakers eager to go home to campaign for re-election, the measure moved quickly through Congress on Wednesday.The White House said it was disappointed that the temporary funding bill continued a provision barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from taking action to increase transparency in public companies' political spending.It also expressed disappointment that Congress failed to take steps to ensure that the Export-Import Bank was able to fully operate its loan guarantee programs.Nevertheless, President Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill into law.

By Jonathan Allen
| DURHAM, N.H.

DURHAM, N.H. U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton shared a stage with former rival Senator Bernie Sanders on Wednesday to appeal for youth votes in the Nov. 8 election as opinion polls show a close race with Republican Donald Trump.Clinton told an audience at the University of New Hampshire that she would make college affordable if she wins the White House, the kind of promise that won Sanders many young supporters during the Democratic nominating contest.       ""We should and we will make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year,"" Clinton said. She vowed to help those who already have student debt to refinance.Clinton's campaign is worried that some polls show voters under the age of 30 might not turn out in great numbers at polling stations in November, potentially giving an advantage to Trump.Members of the crowd on Wednesday waved signs that read: ""I will vote.""Recent opinion polls have shown the race tightening between Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, and Trump, a New York real estate magnate. A majority of Americans say Clinton won Monday night's presidential debate, but her performance does not appear to have boosted support among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Wednesday.The online poll found that 56 percent of American adults felt Clinton did a better job, compared with 26 percent who believed the Republican did better.
Even so, Clinton's performance seemed to have little impact on her support. The poll showed 42 percent supported her, while 38 percent backed Trump. Trump, often described as racist by Clinton, tried to turn the tables at a rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin.He pointed to the Democrat's remark that ""implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just the police,"" when asked at the debate whether she believed police are implicitly biased against black people.""She accuses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of 'implicit bias,' essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced,"" Trump said.
PRAISING SANDERS
Clinton's event with Sanders took place on a university campus, but it was not open to students without an invitation, according to attendees, many of whom were middle-aged and said they were members of local Democratic organizations or invited by the campaign.Clinton praised Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who was her opponent in the hard-fought struggle for the Democratic nomination earlier this year.
""He is one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone that I am looking forward to working with,"" Clinton said of Sanders, who introduced her on Wednesday.Although Sanders lost to Clinton, he consistently drew younger voters to his side with promises to take on Wall Street, make college less expensive and close the income gap.He called on young people in New Hampshire, a swing state in the presidential election, to get behind Clinton.""Get your uncles, your aunts, get your friends to vote for Hillary Clinton,"" he said.Clinton's campaign said it hoped to get Sanders to make more appearances on Clinton's behalf before the election.

By David Lawder
| BOGOTA

BOGOTA Colombia's peace deal with the Marxist FARC rebel group will bring more investment to the country, backed partly by new donor aid and loans from multilateral development banks, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and his Colombian counterpart said on Wednesday.    Lew told a news conference in Bogota that the peace accord, signed on Monday and set to be voted on by the Colombian people on Sunday, would add to the confidence of foreign investors in Colombia. The 52-year war killed 220,000 people and left millions displaced.    ""Implementing the agreement, showing that Colombia has a stable future, I think will make Colombia a more attractive place for foreign investment,"" Lew said after meeting with Colombian Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas and President Juan Manuel Santos.     He said Santos' government already had an ""excellent reputation"" among foreign investors for sound management of fiscal policy and pursuit of economic reforms, despite major challenges from low oil prices.
Cardenas said the peace accord would attract both domestic and foreign investment and spur new spending on infrastructure and schools in former conflict areas. He declined to specify amounts but previously estimated that peace with FARC could boost Colombia's economic growth by 1 percentage point annually.     ""It will be at the initial stages, more tourism. That's one of the areas we think the agreement will have the most direct and immediate impact,"" Cardenas said. ""We will be able also to secure additional funding through cooperation, donors and lending by multilaterals to support expenditures and investments in the rural communities where the conflict was most acute.""    
Former FARC fighters are already making plans for eco-tourism ventures and cheesemaking operations in vast jungles largely untouched for decades.The peace deal gives FARC a voice in Colombia's political process. Cardenas said that put the group ""in the competition for ideas"" but would not alter the center-right government's economic reform plan, ""which thinks that one of the pillars of the success of any country is having low inflation, low fiscal deficit, low debt, and at the same time having a progressive agenda.""         
Lew said the United States was still committed to providing bilateral aid to Colombia and that he and Cardenas discussed opportunities to gain support from multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which oversees the confirmation of foreign service nominees, said on Wednesday it was ""highly unlikely"" that an ambassador to Cuba would be approved this year.President Barack Obama on Tuesday nominated career diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis to be the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than five decades.""The committee was notified of the nomination yesterday but has not yet received the appropriate paperwork to begin its work,"" Republican Senator Bob Corker said in a statement emailed to Reuters. ""However, it is highly unlikely that an ambassador to Cuba would be approved in the lame-duck.""The appointment of DeLaurentis, the top American official at the U.S. embassy in Havana, marked Obama's latest move to go as far as he can in normalizing ties between the former Cold War foes before he leaves office in January.
But the nomination must be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, which is seen as a long shot.Corker's committee would have to hold a confirmation hearing for DeLaurentis and vote to approve his nomination before it would go to the full Senate, where it could be blocked by any senator.
Many lawmakers have warmly embraced Obama's moves toward more normal relations with Cuba, which became public in a shock announcement in December 2014. But several strongly oppose his efforts, arguing that Cuba must do far more to improve human rights before it can deal normally with the United States.Cuban-American senators such as Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and Democrat Robert Menendez are particularly opposed to Obama's policy. Rubio and Menendez are both members of the foreign relations panel.
Congress' ""lame-duck"" session takes place in November and December, after the elections on Nov. 8 and before the new Congress comes to Washington in January. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Sandra Maler and Leslie Adler)"	['Corker', 'Cruz', 'Menendez', 'Rubio', 'Obama']	[]
9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-congress-mylan-nl-idUSKCN11Y1X5	U.S. agency told Mylan that EpiPen was misclassified	"


By Diane Bartz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. federal health agency said on Wednesday it had ""expressly advised"" Mylan NV (MYL.O) that the drugmaker had improperly classified its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment in a way that allowed it to pay lower rebates to state health programs.The disclosure comes as U.S. lawmakers and prosecutors are investigating Mylan over steep price hikes for the EpiPen device which have rendered the drug unaffordable for a growing number of families. A least one state has launched an investigation into whether Mylan failed to pay proper rebates to the Medicaid program for the poor.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, said in a statement it had ""on multiple occasions, provided guidance to the industry and Mylan on the proper classification of drugs and has expressly advised Mylan that their classification of EpiPen for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate program was incorrect.""CMS, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, declined to say what action it took to push for the misclassification to be corrected or when it spoke to Mylan.
Mylan classified EpiPen with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program as a generic treatment, which provides a rebate of 13 percent to state Medicaid programs, rather than as a branded drug, which pays a minimum rebate of 23.1 percent. Mylan has said it complied with CMS rules. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the CMS statement.
Mylan has been heavily criticized for sharply raising the price of EpiPen devices, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. Mylan acquired the product in 2007 and has raised the list price for a pair of EpiPens to $600 from about $100 in 2008.Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Charles Grassley and Amy Klobuchar asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate a possible misclassification.
""The facts ... suggest that Mylan may have knowingly misclassified EpiPens, potentially in violation of the False Claims Act and other statutes,"" the lawmakers said in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The False Claims Act is used to pursue companies that defraud the federal government. (Editing by Alan Crosby and Matthew Lewis)"	['Klobuchar', 'Grassley', 'Lynch']	[]
