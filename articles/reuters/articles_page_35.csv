WASHINGTON Two-thirds of Americans voting in Tuesday's presidential election favor moderate or strong gun control measures, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll, up from 59 percent who said so in 2012.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been a vocal opponent of increased limits on American gun ownership, while Democrat Hillary Clinton has advocated for an assault weapons ban and comprehensive background checks on would-be gun owners, following a slew of deadly mass shootings in the United States.The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states and included about 38,000 people who had already voted in the presidential election. The poll reading will be updated as more poll responses are tallied and more votes counted across the country.
The survey found that Americans' views on abortion - another divisive issue in American politics - has not changed significantly since 2012, with 39 percent of voters saying it should be illegal. Trump opposes abortion and has said it should be punished while Clinton believes it should remain legal.

WASHINGTON Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would have to ""see how things play out"" before accepting the election results, pointing to possible irregularities as he again warned of a rigged political system.Local media reported that voters in several counties in Pennsylvania had reported that touch-screen voting machines had not been recording their ballots correctly. ""We're going to see how things play out today. Hopefully they'll play out well and hopefully we won't have to worry about it, meaning hopefully we'll win,"" Trump said in a telephone interview on Fox News. ""I want to see everything honest.""Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that rely on electronic voting machines without a paper backup that allows officials to double-check the outcome, if challenged.
The machines can record votes incorrectly if they are not calibrated properly, a problem that is magnified as the screens degrade with age. The Pennsylvania Secretary of State's office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.Trump's campaign also sued election officials in Nevada, arguing they violated state law by allowing voters during early voting on Friday to line up to cast ballots at a Las Vegas polling location after the time when polls were supposed to close. A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected Trump's request for records from the polling site.
Nevada state law says voters who are in line when the polls close must be allowed to cast their ballots.At a court hearing in Las Vegas on Tuesday, a county attorney argued that election officials already preserve records.

WASHINGTON The economy, terrorism and healthcare ranked as the top three concerns facing Americans casting ballots in Tuesday's presidential election, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll.The poll of about 35,000 people found that 25 percent of voters picked the economy as the ""most important problem."". Another 14 percent named ""terrorism/terrorist attacks"" and 13 percent picked healthcare.By contrast, the economy was the No. 1 concern for 46 percent of American voters in 2012, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll four years ago. Almost nobody listed terrorism as a top concern in 2012, and 8 percent listed healthcare as the top worry.
A signature Trump issue, immigration, was chosen by 7 percent of voters as the most important issue in Tuesday's poll.
The poll reading will be updated as more poll responses are tallied and more votes are counted across the country.

WASHINGTON Some 15 percent of Americans who cast a ballot on Tuesday said it was their first time voting in a presidential election, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll, up from 9 percent of voters who said so in 2012.The poll of nearly 35,000 people also showed that 13 percent of voters had waited until the final week of the presidential race to make up their mind between the candidates, who include Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, up from 9 percent who said so in 2012.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation announced in late October that it was looking at more emails connected to its investigation of Clinton's use of a personal email server while secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey later said that the new trove of emails did not affect his earlier decision to not bring a criminal case against Clinton.

By Dan Levine and Mica Rosenberg

A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's request for records from a Las Vegas polling place that the campaign said had allowed people to vote after a deadline last week.Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton are in a close contest for Nevada's six electoral votes in Tuesday's election after a long and contentious campaign. Nevada is one of several states that permits early voting, and Las Vegas is viewed as a base of support for Clinton.Nevada state law says voters who are in line at 8 p.m., when the polls close, must be allowed to cast their ballots. Trump's lawsuit, filed in a Nevada state court on Monday, said election officials violated state law because they allowed people to join the line after 8 p.m. at a polling location at a Latino market during last week's early voting period. Trump, a New York businessman and reality TV personality who had never previously run for political office, said last month that he might not accept the outcome of the national election if he thinks it is unfair.""Today may be the last time that ordinary citizens are able to stand up and say 'No' to an overreaching, unaccountable government controlled by a ruling establishment,"" Charles Munoz, the Nevada state director for Trump's campaign, said in a statement after the ruling. 
The suit had asked the court to order officials to preserve various records from the Cardenas Market and to segregate ballots from the voting machines at issue. At a court hearing in Las Vegas on Tuesday, a county attorney argued that election officials already preserve records. Sturman agreed, saying she did not want to issue an order that could help reveal which candidates were chosen by particular voters. 
The Trump campaign also asked for information about poll workers on duty at the market, and Sturman said she was concerned they might face threats for helping people vote.""Have you watched Twitter? Do you watch any cable news shows? People can get information and harass them,"" the judge said.Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said the campaign was pleased by the ruling. He described Trump's suit as ""a desperate response to the record turnout we're seeing in Nevada and across the country.""
Dan Kulin, a spokesman for the Clark County Office of Public Communications, said that when early voting was taking place on Friday ""most if not all"" polling places had lines at the time they were scheduled to close. ""As has been our practice for many, many years, those early voting locations continued processing voters until the lines were gone,"" Kulin said.

AUSTIN, Texas Former Republican President George W.

In a break from custom, neither George W. Bush, president from 2001 to 2009, nor his father, former Republican President George H.W.

Jeb Bush, the younger brother of George W. Bush and the son of George H.W. Bush, ran against Trump in the acrimonious and insult-laced Republican nominating contest this year.

By Michael Connor
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton as president will have no policy mandate, even if elected by a wide margin, and would be wise to court Congress for an easy win on a big-dollar infrastructure bill, an economic aide to former Republican President George W. Bush said.Keith Hennessey, a former director of the White House National Economic Council and now professor at the Stanford Graduate Business School, joined the Global Markets Forum on Tuesday as Americans voted on a new president for the next four years. Clinton led Republican candidate Donald Trump, 44 percent to 39 percent, in the last Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll before Election Day.Here are excerpts from the conversation with Hennessey.Question: You see Hillary Clinton possibly scoring an outsized victory over Donald Trump in Electoral College votes. So why wouldn't that be a mandate for her policies?Answer: I'm sure her team will want to claim a mandate, especially if the (Electoral College vote) is high. But this has been a near-zero policy election, so it's super hard to make that case with a straight face.
Q: There is wide agreement America needs to spend much more on highways, transport, airports and other fundamentals of modern society. How should a President Clinton go about securing that?A: She makes phone calls to (Congressional Republican leaders Paul) Ryan and (Mitch) McConnell. She invites our members to the White House to meet her. She engages with them, asks them what's important to them, and listens. She could do an infrastructure bill first. That has potential to be an easy bipartisan win.
Q: What do you expect Clinton's economic agenda to look like?A: She has taken an Obama-like position on debt: I'm not prioritizing decreasing it, I'm not prioritizing slowing the growth of it. But I'm going to ""pay for"" all my new spending so my new proposals won't make the current policy path worse.If Clinton wins the White House, I expect at most only relative modest moves on fiscal policy (probably +/- <= 1% of GDP in the short run). Nothing like the 2009 initial Obama fiscal stimulus. If that's right, I assume the Fed stays on its current track on monetary policy.

| CHICAGO

CHICAGO A sexual abuse victim will continue to try to collect $1.8 million from former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, the victim's attorney said on Tuesday, after an Illinois judge denied Hastert's motion to dismiss a breach-of-contract lawsuit. The plaintiff, identified in court documents as James Doe, claims that Hastert agreed to pay him $3.5 million as compensation for decades of pain and suffering caused by Hastert's sexual abuse.Hastert, 74, the longest-serving Republican U.S. House speaker in history, pleaded guilty last year to the crime of structuring, which involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection.Hastert has not been charged with or convicted of sex abuse due to the statute of limitations, but at his sentencing hearing in April, he admitted to sexual abuse of boys when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville, around 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Chicago. Hastert was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison, followed by two years of probation and sex-offender treatment. 
He is serving his sentence in the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota.Doe filed the lawsuit in Kendall County Circuit Court in northeastern Illinois in April, claiming Hastert owes him the unpaid portion of a $3.5 million deal they verbally agreed to in 2008. ""There is no public policy against an abuser agreeing to compensate his victim and the victim seeking to enforce that commitment to compensate him,"" Kristi Browne, Doe's attorney, said in a statement on Tuesday. 
""We will proceed now to prove our claim by seeking documents from Mr. Hastert and others and taking his deposition.""Judge Robert Pilmer rejected Hastert's motion to have the case dismissed on Monday and the decision was disclosed on  Tuesday, according to court documents. The plaintiff had established a basis for a ""claim for contract,"" Pilmer wrote in his order. Hastert's attorney did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
Hastert's attorney sought dismissal because the contract was not in writing, saying it would be void because Doe broke confidentiality by speaking about it, according to court documents Doe said he was 14 when he was molested by Hastert, a trusted family friend, high school teacher and ""beloved coach"" of the state champion wrestling team in the town of Yorkville, Illinois, according to court documents.The next hearing in the contract case is scheduled for Jan. 18.
