By Steve Holland
| BEDMINSTER, N.J.

BEDMINSTER, N.J. President-elect Donald Trump and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney set aside their long-simmering rivalry on Saturday and sat down for talks that could include whether Romney should serve as Trump's secretary of state.""Mr. President-elect, how are you sir?"" Romney said in greeting Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence on his arrival at Trump's golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.Romney was the first in a long list of people Trump was meeting on Saturday and Sunday as he seeks to fill out his Cabinet and seek advice ahead of his Jan. 20 move to the White House.As a leader of the establishment Republican ""never Trump"" movement, Romney had sought in vain to derail Trump's march to the Republican presidential nomination.Back in March, he delivered a biting speech saying Trump would be dangerous as president, with policies that could throw the United States into a recession.
He had also said, ""I'm afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very, very not smart.""For his part, Trump had denounced Romney as a ""choke artist"" for losing the 2012 election to President Barack Obama.
But with Trump now the president-in-waiting, Romney's appearance at Trump National Bedminster on an unseasonably warm November day was symbolic of hard-won party unity.Whether it will lead to Romney joining the Trump administration is unclear. Trump has been considering former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a close adviser, for secretary of state, as well as former U.S. ambassador to the United States John Bolton and U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee.Trump transition officials said his meeting with Romney was supposed to be a general discussion about the incoming Trump administration.
A Romney confidant said of Romney's secretary of state prospects: ""Could it happen? I suppose. But it's unlikely.""Instead, the source said the meeting gives ""the good housekeeping seal of approval to Republicans who don't know if they should help Trump or not.""

NEW YORK President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday demanded an apology from the cast of the Broadway hit ""Hamilton"" for appealing from the stage to Vice President-elect Mike Pence to uphold American values, with the conservative in the theater.""The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, taking time out from his search for appointees to his incoming administration.""Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!"" Trump wrote.Pence was greeted with a mix of boos and cheers as he entered the Richard Rodgers Theater in New York on Friday night to watch a performance of the highly acclaimed musical about the country's founding fathers, played by a racially diverse cast.After the show, Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays America's third vice president Aaron Burr, read a statement directed at Pence while standing in front of the cast in full costume.    ""We, sir -- we -- are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,"" Dixon said. Pence had already begun to leave his seat as Dixon began his remarks, videos posted on social media showed.
""We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us,"" Dixon said as audience members cheered and clapped.  A show spokesman said Pence stood in the hallway outside the entrance to the auditorium and heard the full remarks, the New York Times reported.  
The incident in the theater happened the same day that Trump picked three conservative loyalists to lead his national security and law enforcement teams, setting his administration up to take a hard line confronting Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration.""Hamilton"" is a musical biography of Alexander Hamilton, who rose to become the right-hand man of General George Washington, as well as a key figure in the creation of the U.S. financial system and the creator of the U.S. Coast Guard. He was killed in an 1804 duel with Burr.            The actor Dixon fired back at Trump's allegations of harassment. 
""@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen,"" he tweeted in response to Trump's Tweet. The show's award-winning creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, said he was proud of the cast.""Proud of @HamiltonMusical. Proud of @BrandonVDixon, for leading with love. And proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater,"" Miranda wrote on Twitter.

President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday defended his decision to settle lawsuits over his Trump University real estate seminars for $25 million, saying he does not have time to fight the fraud cases in court now that he is headed to the White House.The lawsuits cast a shadow over the Republican's presidential campaign and led to one of the more controversial moments of his run for the White House when he claimed the judge overseeing two of the cases was biased because he was of Mexican ancestry. While denying any wrongdoing, Trump agreed on Friday to pay $25 million to settle the lawsuits.""I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has said over 5,000 students across the country were defrauded out of about $40 million, so Trump's settlement of $25 million was around 60 percent of these estimated damages. 
""The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!"" He said in a second tweet.In announcing the settlement, Schneiderman said the deal followed repeated refusals by Trump ""to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university.""
In a statement, Schneiderman called the settlement a ""stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.""Students had claimed they were they were lured by false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Trump's lawyers denied this.
The deal covers three lawsuits relating to Trump University: two class actions suits in California and a New York case brought by Schneiderman. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego must still approved the settlement.During his election campaign, Trump said that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trump's campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to control illegal immigration.

SHANGHAI Chinese state media warned U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday against flip-flopping on trade deals in Asia, as Asia-Pacific leaders gathered for a summit amid fears that growing protectionism will stunt global economic growth.During the raucous election campaign, Trump fuelled concerns among many of the United States' trading partners by pledging to renegotiate trade accords such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and impose tariffs on imports from countries such as China.""Turning his trade-bashing campaign talks into actual policies could bash any hope that the Asia-Pacific will finally have its much-wanted free trade deal,"" said a commentary in the official Xinhua news agency on Saturday.""Worse, it could drag his country and the wider world into deeper economic distress,"" added the agency, which is a barometer of government thinking. Xinhua also said that the exclusion of China from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement was not about boosting trade and instead was U.S. President Barack Obama's strategy to make sure Washington ""rules supreme in the region.""Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and other Pacific Rim leaders are meeting at the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Peru this weekend.
Though Obama championed the TPP as a way to counter China's rise, his administration has now stopped trying to win congressional approval for the deal that was signed by 12 economies in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, but excluded China. Without U.S. approval the agreement as currently negotiated cannot come to fruition.China's Xi is selling an alternate vision for regional trade by promoting the Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which as it stands excludes the Americas.
Chinese state media has warned Trump against isolationism and interventionism, calling instead for the United States to actively work with China to maintain the international status quo.""The billionaire-turned-politician needs to prove that derailing the global economy has not been one of the reasons why he ran for U.S. president,"" Xinhua said.

SEOUL U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's national security adviser says North Korea's nuclear program would be given a high priority under the new administration, a South Korean official who held talks with him said on Saturday.Michael Flynn, one of Trump's closest advisers, also said he would work to strengthen the U.S. alliance with South Korea, calling the relationship ""vital,"" the South's deputy presidential national security adviser Cho Tae-yong was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.Cho was leading a South Korean delegation to the United States to meet with key advisers to the president-elect to discuss the two countries' response to the North's pursuit of nuclear weapons in defiance of international sanctions.Cho spoke to South Korean reporters in Washington following the meeting with Flynn, Yonhap said.Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general and a military intelligence veteran of three decades who has championed Trump's promises to take a more aggressive approach to terrorism. His appointment as national security adviser this week does not require Senate confirmation.    
The North conducted its fourth and fifth nuclear tests this year under young leader Kim Jong Un, who has vowed to build a nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles to deliver them.The U.N. Security Council has held discussions to adopt a toughened new sanctions resolution following the North's Sept. 9 nuclear blast. 
U.S. President Barack Obama has been criticized by Congressional Republicans that his policy of ""strategic patience"" was a failure and that he must make full use of sanctions authorities given to him by Congress. Trump pledged his commitment to defend South Korea under an existing security alliance during a phone call with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Yonhap said last week.
Trump had suggested during the election campaign he would be willing to withdraw U.S. military stationed in South Korea unless Seoul paid a greater share of the cost of the deployment. There are about 28,500 U.S. troops based in South Korea in combined defense against North Korea. (Reporting by Jack Kim; Editing by Kim Coghill)"	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]
6	6	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sessions-whitecollar-idUSKBN13E049	Pro-business Sessions will not go easy on corporate crime: lawyers	"


By Nathan Layne and Joel Schectman

Jeff Sessions may be known as a pro-business conservative but as U.S. attorney general he is unlikely to shy away from indicting big companies and individuals for serious white-collar crimes, legal experts said, citing his record as a lawmaker.President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named Sessions, a four-term senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor, to lead the Justice Department. Sessions, 69, an early supporter of Trump, is expected to accept the cabinet post if confirmed.A spokesman for Sessions did not respond to a request for comment.Because of the dearth of big banks and companies in his home state, there is little in Sessions' track record as a federal prosecutor and state attorney general from the 1970s to the 1990s to suggest how he might approach complex cases of corporate malfeasance.But a review of his record in the Senate indicates he will likely push for corporate indictments, instead of settling for fines, and may focus on putting more executives in prison, lawyers who specialize in white-collar crime said.For example, during a 2010 confirmation hearing for James Cole, Sessions questioned the former U.S. deputy attorney general about the ""dangerous"" philosophy of not charging companies criminally because of concerns that doing so could lead to bankruptcy and hurt employees and shareholders.""Normally, I was taught if they violated a law, you charge them. If they didn't violate the law, you don't charge them,"" Sessions said during the hearing.
RENEWED PUSH TO PROSECUTE
Matthew Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor and lawyer at Boies, Schiller & Flexner, said Sessions' remarks suggested that he may be more willing than the current administration to require a guilty plea from corporations with less concern for  collateral consequences. He said Sessions would also likely support the Justice Department's renewed efforts to prosecute executives, outlined in a policy memo last year by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.While an unabashed businessman, Trump was highly critical of Hillary Clinton's ties to Wall Street, accusing his Democratic rival of being beholden to the interests of big investment banks. That message resonated with many working class voters who suffered in the financial crisis of 2008 and are still angry that no top-level Wall Street figures have been prosecuted for acts that almost brought down the global financial system. 
""Until we see evidence to the contrary, it appears that the new Justice Department will be one that will seek to hold every individual accountable to the fullest extent. So the stakes may be higher,"" Schwartz said.NO LENIENCY
Jackson Sharman, a white-collar defense lawyer in Alabama, said that he believed Sessions would want to be as tough on white-collar as on street criminals. He pointed to Sessions' recent opposition to a crime bill that would have shown sentencing leniency for non-violent offenders.
Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor, who has testified before Sessions' Senate Judiciary Committee, agreed that the Alabama senator will be ""a strong supporter"" of corporate enforcement.In the past, Sessions has come out in favor of tough Justice Department tactics against companies accused of fraud. In 2007, corporate counsels pushed for a law that would have stopped the Justice Department from pressuring companies to waive attorney-client privilege during fraud investigations.But during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sessions argued against any such rule, noting that prosecutors regularly pressure street criminals to waive constitutional rights using the threat of tougher penalties if they do not co-operate. Sessions said the Justice Department should be able to use similar leverage against corporations. Corporate crime ""is not easy to prosecute or investigate. They have the best lawyers that you can find, and they utilize all the legitimate tools that they have,"" Sessions said. ""And you have to be strong... a prosecutor cannot be a weak-kneed person going up against a major corporation in a fraud case.""

By Colleen Jenkins
| WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. North Carolina's gubernatorial race was undecided 10 days after the Nov. 8 vote and new allegations by the Republican incumbent's campaign about felons and dead people casting ballots could leave the outcome in limbo for weeks.Republican Governor Pat McCrory, trailing Democratic challenger Roy Cooper by about 6,300 votes according to the state elections website Friday afternoon, has not conceded. Under state law, Friday was the deadline for counties to certify their results.But challenges over the validity of hundreds of votes and reviews of provisional ballots were expected to delay the reports from many, if not all, of the state's 100 counties, elections officials said.The uncertainty has been punctuated this week by a war of words, with McCrory's campaign accusing Cooper of being lax on voter fraud and Cooper's campaign calling the incumbent dishonest and desperate.""It is unfortunate to see that rather than accepting the results, Pat McCrory is going to go down by besmirching Republican election officials (and) by impugning voters,"" Marc Elias, a lawyer for the Cooper campaign, said in a call with reporters on Friday.
McCrory's campaign, however, argues it is following the legal process to ensure all legitimate votes are counted.Protests being filed by registered voters in some 50 counties argue that up to 200 ballots should be thrown out because they were cast under the names of dead people or by felons or individuals who voted more than once, according to the campaign.McCrory representatives also said thousands of votes in 12 counties may have been part of an absentee ballot fraud scheme.
Several counties rejected election protests on Friday, including Durham County, where Republicans had called into question the tabulation of about 90,000 ballots on election night, local media reported.All of the state's county elections boards are controlled by Republicans.Elias said there are not enough votes at issue to keep Cooper from winning. McCrory campaign spokesman Ricky Diaz called that claim presumptuous with counting incomplete.
""There's additional cases of voter fraud being discovered each day,"" he said in a phone interview.If McCrory trails by 10,000 or fewer votes once counties submit their final tallies, he could demand a recount.A Cooper victory would be the only governorship addition  for Democrats. Republicans, who flipped seats in New Hampshire, Missouri and Vermont, will hold at least 33 governor offices next year, the most for the party since 1922.

By Steve Holland
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. President-elect Donald Trump picked three conservative loyalists to lead his national security and law enforcement teams on Friday, underscoring his campaign promise to take a hard line confronting Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration.Trump picked U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, rewarding a staunch supporter whose tough and sometimes inflammatory statements on immigration have reflected his own. The choice was applauded by the top Republican in the Senate but drew sharp criticism from civil rights activists.Retired Army Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, who has championed Trump's promises to take a more aggressive approach to terrorism, was chosen as his national security adviser. Trump named Representative Mike Pompeo, a vocal critic of the Obama administration's security policy, as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.The three choices, announced by Trump's transition team, come as the Republican president-elect works to fill key positions in his administration, which will take over from Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20.The picks could heighten concerns abroad that the Trump administration might carry out campaign promises of banning Muslims from entering the United States or imposing more severe restrictions on migrants from countries or regions with high levels of militant Islamist activity, such as Iraq and Syria. Sessions and Pompeo seem likely to be confirmed by the Senate despite heavy resistance from Democrats. Republicans will control a majority, with at least 51 seats in the 100-seat chamber, when Congress reconvenes in January. Flynn's post does not need Senate confirmation.  One of the earliest Republican lawmakers to support Trump's White House candidacy, Sessions opposes any path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and was an enthusiastic backer of Trump's campaign promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has also argued for curbs on legal immigration on the grounds that it drives down wages for U.S. workers.A former Alabama attorney general and U.S. attorney, Sessions, 69, has been in the Senate for 19 years. Allegations that he made racist remarks led the Senate to deny his confirmation as a federal judge in 1986. The chamber's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said he would want Sessions to answer  ""tough questions"" about his civil rights positions.The attorney general acts as the country's chief law enforcement officer and head of the Justice Department. Civil rights groups slammed Sessions as a poor choice to head a department charged with protecting voting rights and running immigration courts.
""How can we trust someone in that role who has demonstrated he thinks all forms of immigration are bad for America?"" said Beth Werlin, head of the American Immigration Council. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he strongly supported Sessions for attorney general, calling him ""principled, forthright, and hardworking.""Sessions has been one of Trump's most enthusiastic backers on Capitol Hill and the president-elect has hired several of Sessions' staffers, including policy chief Stephen Miller and Rick Dearborn, who has a top job managing the transition.Also on Friday, the first set of transition ""landing teams"" were starting work at the departments of State, Justice, Defense and the National Security Council to begin hashing out the details of shifting to a new administration. 
ISLAMIST MILITANTS
Flynn, one of Trump's closest advisers, was fired from the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, a move he has attributed to his outspoken views about fighting Islamist militancy. Other officials who worked with Flynn cited his lack of management skills and leadership style as reasons for his firing.An Army intelligence veteran of three decades, Flynn was assistant director of national intelligence under Obama. He views the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a strategic blunder and has refused to condemn Trump's support for the renewed use of waterboarding. This is an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, is widely considered torture and was banned by Obama.Pompeo, 52, a third-term Republican congressman and former U.S. Army officer who founded an aerospace company, was a surprise pick to lead the CIA.A member of the House Intelligence Committee, Pompeo has called for a revival and expansion of a now-defunct domestic spying program to include ""financial and lifestyle information"" as well as phone records. He has said that Edward Snowden, a former government contractor who uncovered the spying program and who now lives in Russia, should get the death penalty if he is ever tried and convicted.
Pompeo has been one of the most aggressive critics of the Obama administration's handling of a 2012 attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. Nevertheless, Democrats who have worked with him joined Republicans in describing Pompeo as knowledgeable and hard working.""While we have had our share of strong differences - principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi - I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage,""  Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said on Friday. Trump met on Friday with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a possible pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a possible candidate for defense secretary.Trump is considering retired General David Petraeus, who resigned as CIA chief in 2012 after an extra-marital affair, is being considered for the post of defense secretary, the Wall Street Journal said.Trump was expected to spend the weekend in Bedminster, New Jersey, the home of the Trump National Golf Club. On Saturday he was scheduled to meet with Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.Romney was one of the fiercest Republican critics of Trump during his unorthodox election campaign but is now under possible consideration for secretary of state.Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, is the leading candidate to serve as Trump's director of national intelligence, the Wall Street Journal reported.
