NEW YORK U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has offered retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn the position of White House national security adviser, a senior Trump official said on Thursday.Asked if Flynn is expected to accept, a person familiar with the offer replied: ""When the president of the United States asks you to serve, there is only one answer.""
Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, advised Trump during the campaign on national security issues and often served as an introductory speaker at campaign rallies.

By David Shepardson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move a Kentucky plant to Mexico, but the firm said it informed him the decision was to keep one vehicle in U.S. production.On Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: ""I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!"" ""He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,"" the President-elect tweeted.But Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019.This is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 - long before Trump announced a run for president.Spokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford ""confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky"". ""We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,"" she added, in a statement.The company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the ""Lincoln plant"" and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs.
It is not clear how many jobs would have been impacted if the low-selling MKC had moved to Mexico. Ford has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs.Ford said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand. In 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere.    The U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border.
SCATHING CRITICISM
Ford has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. He has said at times incorrectly that Ford planned to fire American workers because of its Mexican investments. During his presidential campaign, the Republican candidate also said that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there.
A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether Ford's decision to keep production of an SUV in the United States would cause him to drop plans to impose tariffs on some Ford vehicles built in Mexico.In April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018.In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. Ford has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars.In October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on Ford's investments in Mexico.Ford said Trump's criticism was ""infuriating"" and ""frustrating"" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States.

By Daniel Wiessner and Robert Iafolla

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has often boasted about the strict confidentiality pledges he exacts from his employees. Now a legal challenge to one of those agreements is pending before a U.S. agency over which he will soon have influence, potentially posing an early test of concerns about conflicts of interest between Trump's public role and his business empire.In September, a worker-advocacy group filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claiming a nondisclosure contract used by Trump is unlawfully broad. The contract prohibits employees, independent contractors and even volunteers from ever disclosing any information that Trump deems confidential about his personal, business or political life.The NLRB has said that sweeping or unclear contracts inhibit workers from discussing working conditions or speaking to union organizers. The five-member NLRB currently has two vacancies that Trump is slated to fill early in his term, likely tipping what has been a liberal-leaning agency under President Barack Obama to a more business-friendly posture. If the NLRB rules against Trump, it could free up workers to be more vocal about their concerns and strengthen their bargaining power.In addition to the confidentiality case, there are about 10 other Trump-related cases pending at the NLRB. The cases involve alleged labor violations at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, where management has refused to bargain with the Culinary Workers Union.It was not clear if the confidentiality contract was intended for workers on Trump's election campaign or employees in his businesses, and Reuters could not independently verify its authenticity. Representatives of the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.The case is at a very early stage and could be settled or dismissed before reaching a full hearing before the five-member NLRB. The board's decisions may be appealed in a federal court.The NLRB is comprised of three members from the sitting president's party and two from the opposing party, a system that typically results in wide policy shifts between administrations. In addition to the current two vacancies, another will arise when a current member's term expires next December. 
Under the Obama administration, the NLRB has struck down  confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from organizing at T-Mobile USA Inc, Quicken Loans, DirectTV and a number of other companies. Government ethics experts and labor lawyers said that if Trump's handpicked NLRB members uphold the contract, it could suggest favoritism. ""There is an appearance of bias and political pressure that could undermine the legitimacy of the agency,"" said Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under Republican President George W. Bush.The NLRB cases represent one of several areas where concerns may arise over potential conflicts of interest raised by Trump's new role and his sprawling business interests. Trump last week said he would allow his children to run his businesses while maintaining his ownership interest via a ""blind trust.""If the current cases are ruled upon by the NLRB, one possible solution to the potential conflict could be for Trump appointees to recuse themselves from cases involving his business organization, said a former NLRB chairman, William Gould. 
Gould said that during his tenure at the agency, in the mid-1990s, members recused themselves from cases that raised any chance of a conflict. Gould, who is now a professor at Stanford Law School, said he disqualified himself from cases involving a union of which his son was a member.Several experts, however, said recusal would not be legally required unless Trump's appointees represented him or his companies in the past or were otherwise involved in his business.        
'MR. TRUMP INSISTS'

The challenge to Trump's confidentiality agreement was filed by David Rosenfeld, a California labor lawyer, on behalf of the Committee to Preserve the Religious Right to Organize, a worker advocacy group that he created. Reuters reviewed a copy of the employment agreement that Rosenfeld filed with his complaint, which targeted both the Trump Organization and the Trump campaign. Rosenfeld said he copied it from the campaign website, but that the agreement was no longer posted there. It was not clear how many employees signed this version of the agreement, and Reuters was unable to find a copy on the website.The agreement prohibits disclosure of details about Trump's ""personal life, political affairs and/or business affairs,"" as well as anything ""Mr. Trump insists remain private or confidential."" It forbids employees from publicly disparaging Trump and his wife, children, grandchildren, siblings and other relatives.Confidentiality agreements are common, but labor law experts said they can be unlawful if they are too broad or don't specify what types of information will be deemed confidential. Trump defended a similar confidentiality agreement in a case earlier this year involving a former campaign aide, whom Trump accused of giving information about other staffers to reporters.In a statement, the Trump campaign said confidentiality agreements were ""standard practice"" for entities that need to safeguard sensitive information. The case settled for undisclosed terms.  (Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York and Robert Iafolla in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Amy Stevens and Stuart Grudgings)"

NEW YORK Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday he was confident of building a relationship based on trust with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.Abe said the two talked about various issues but refrained from disclosing the contents of the meeting with Trump because the talks were unofficial. 
He made the comments in New York after a meeting that was intended to smooth relations following Trump's campaign rhetoric that cast doubt on long-standing U.S. alliances.

By Lisa Lambert
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Congress could as soon as January start to dismantle President Barack Obama's transformation of student loan rules by blocking freshly minted regulations designed to help students who say they were defrauded by for-profit colleges.The new measures, which lay out loan relief procedures for the students, were issued by the Department of Education just days before the election. That is recent enough to allow the new Republican-led Congress to disapprove them under a 1996 law called the Congressional Review Act. It gives Congress 60 legislative days to reverse regulations with a simple vote.Republicans opposed the rule when it was proposed. Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate committee on education, is considering introducing a resolution that would overturn the so-called ""Borrower Defense"" rule, according to a spokeswoman. Even without a legislative reversal, president-elect Donald Trump, who ran on an anti-regulation platform and started his own for-profit school, could instruct agencies to be more restrictive in how they interpret this rule and others aimed at easing student loan burdens.Students who attended the now-defunct Trump University did not qualify for federal loans and are not eligible for loan relief. Trump is facing civil lawsuits alleging fraud related to the school.After he was elected president, the stocks of for-profit education companies rose.The borrower defense rule was inspired by the meltdown of Corinthian Colleges Inc. in 2015, according to Rohit Chopra, who worked on the Corinthian case at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and later moved to the Department of Education as a special adviser. In recent months, ITT Tech. Inc. has also folded, leaving students adrift.
By law, students at struggling technical and professional colleges are already allowed relief on federal loans, but the new rule creates a path for getting that relief. Students can make a fraud claim to the Education Department and then apply for a refund of federal money they borrowed and then paid to the school.It is the payment on a fraud complaint - sometimes made in the absence of any actual conviction - that rankles Republicans. They also dislike that the rule leaves students free to file class action suits against the schools, instead of arbitrating all disputes, said Neal McCluskey, who follows higher education at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. It is not clear how many students - or how much in loans - would be affected by the new rule. The Education Department says it has already approved $250 million in relief to more than 15,000 applications from students who borrowed to attend Corinthian.The projected 10-year federal government expenses associated with the rules total $16 billion. 
AN UP OR DOWN VOTE
Congressional disapproval resolutions have failed in the past, because Obama vetoed them. But in 2017, anti-regulation Republicans will control the House, the Senate and the White House, and it takes only a simple majority of both chambers to reverse a rule. Education Secretary John King defends the rule, saying his department went through a very thorough rule-making process and addressed thousands of comments in the final version of the regulations.
""The fact remains that students need some sort of process for student loan discharge in the case of a school closure or fraud,"" said Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. ""I'm not sure it's as easy as simply voiding the entire regulation.""There are other higher education reforms a Trump administration might undo, said Elizabeth Baylor, director for post-secondary education at left-leaning Center for American Progress.Many borrower programs instituted under Obama are at the education secretary's discretion, and Trump could appoint someone stricter on granting relief. A new secretary could also simply discontinue programs, she said. In the same vein, Steve Gunderson, president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, says Congress could block the new rule without a resolution, either through an upcoming budget bill or education legislation.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said on Thursday he was challenging House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who has led the party in the chamber for 14 years, as Democrats question their strategy and leadership after a stinging general election defeat.Ryan, 43, who has been in Congress since 2003, said in a statement that Democrats had only been in the House of Representatives majority for four of the past 18 years, ""and last week's election results set us back even further."" ""Vote for me and I will dedicate all of my energy to lead us back into the majority,"" said Ryan, who is from an old working-class, steel area of northeastern Ohio, the type of region the Democrats want to wrest back from Republicans.""At this time of fear and disillusionment, we owe it to our constituencies to listen and bring a new voice into leadership.""  Democrats had expected to do much better in the Nov. 8 election, when Republican Donald Trump, a New York businessman with no experience in public office, won the White House on the back of working-class voters. 
Republicans kept their majorities in both Senate and House after some Democrats had predicted double-digit wins in the House and a chance to win the Senate. Ryan announced his long-shot challenge after several days of publicly weighing it. Pelosi, 76, of California, claims she has support of two-thirds of Democrats before they vote Nov. 30.
""I'm respectful what people are saying. There's a lot of unease,"" Pelosi said when asked about the potential challenge.""And as members in there said, we cannot be taking in the full responsibility for what happened in the election ... a lot of it was beyond our control,"" she added.A senior House Democratic aide called Ryan's bid a ""publicity stunt."" He said Ryan had shortchanged party coffers, paying only half of his dues owed since 2014 to the party's campaign committee. Ryan's office declined comment.
At a closed-door meeting of House Democrats Thursday, about half the roughly two dozen lawmakers who spoke ""said we need new leadership,"" Representative John Yarmuth of Louisville, Kentucky, said in an interview. He declined to say who he would support.Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Kansas City, Missouri, was also noncommittal but said the caucus should ""take his (Ryan's) candidacy seriously and contemplate where the caucus is, and where it could go under his leadership.""
