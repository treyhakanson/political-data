Asked about a Senate proposal for $1.1 billion in emergency funds, Earnest said the administration would ""have to take a close look at it to see if it is sufficient.""

By Daniel Bases
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Puerto Rico's debt crisis, if left unaddressed by the U.S. Congress where legislation has stalled in the House Natural Resources Committee, will result in the need to pay for a humanitarian aid package, Congressman Raul Grijalva said on Thursday.Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the HNRC from Arizona, said in a teleconference with reporters that it is an ""either/or"" situation as Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in debt it cannot pay off and a growing humanitarian crisis because it cannot afford maintaining basic social services.""Either we begin this process, stabilize, create some carve out opportunities for essential services and/or wait for the crisis to get worse and then have to respond with humanitarian relief,"" Grijalva said, adding that a new draft of the bill had not been made available as of Thursday morning.Grijalva visited Puerto Rico this week and met with the island's leadership and toured its main medical facilities. He said austerity alone is not going to stay the situation of degraded conditions for health, nutrition and education.
""People talk about a bailout. Thus far there is no money being talked about extended by the United States government,"" Grijalva said, adding: ""We are talking about a piece of legislation that provides for a method of restructuring and for some accountability attached to that restructuring.""The Republican chairman of the HNRC, Rob Bishop of Utah, said he wants a bipartisan bill to emerge from committee but canceled an expected release of the legislation on Wednesday while lawmakers hashed out language revolving around the status of the island of Vieques, pensions and minimum wage rates.
Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the island's main fiscal agent. It faces a near $2 billion July 1 debt payment.The legislation's basic structure still includes the creation of an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealth's credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan.
On the issue of Vieques, Democrats are concerned the language regarding the transfer of federal land on the island, which is mainly a nature preserve, could leave it vulnerable to commercial development in the name of recreation.""Our position has been from the beginning that Vieques did not belong in this package of legislation,"" said Grijalva.

Results of Baltimore's primary election were ordered decertified on Thursday by the Maryland elections board, which cited irregularities in the April 26 vote that may have influenced a tight mayoral race.The state panel will begin a precinct-by-precinct review of voting in the overwhelming Democratic city. The Baltimore elections board will pull its certification this evening, state board administrator Linda Lamone said.The state review could cast doubt on the narrow victory by state Senator Catherine Pugh in the mayoral primary, where she defeated former Mayor Sheila Dixon.Pugh had backed law enforcement reform as Baltimore recovers from April 2015 rioting sparked by a black man's death from an injury in police custody. Three City Council races were determined by a few hundred votes.
Lamone said officials had found 80 provisional ballots that had not been checked to see whether they were cast in the right precinct or the voters were registered.Unusually high numbers of voters also checked in at polling places but never cast ballots, she said. That issue was not cleared up when the city board certified the election this week.
""There were enough discrepancies in that reconciliation (on the number of voters) that made me determine we need to review everything more,"" Lamone said.
A group of activists has questioned the fairness of the election. Victory in the Democratic primary means an almost certain win in the November general election. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by David Gregorio)"

WASHINGTON The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Department of Justice was still deciding whether to appeal a court ruling challenging President Barack Obama's healthcare law, but a spokesman predicted Republicans ultimately would lose the fight.""This suit represents the first time in our nation's history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a briefing.""It's unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing,"" he added. ""They've been losing this fight for six years and they'll lose it again.""
His comments came shortly after a U.S. judge ruled on Thursday in favor of congressional Republicans who challenged the implementation of the healthcare law, arguing that the administration cannot spend funds Congress did not appropriate.

WASHINGTON Members of Congress on Thursday grilled the main U.S. banking regulator about a recent raft of data breaches, highlighting two incidents where workers downloaded more than 10,000 sensitive and private records onto portable storage devices before leaving the agency's employ.After the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp uncovered those two breaches, it conducted a review and found five other instances when employees improperly stored and took personal information for tens of thousands of individuals, according to Representative Barry Loudermilk, a Republican who chairs a House of Representatives subcommittee on oversight and technology.Altogether, more than 160,000 people were affected, Loudermilk said at a hearing covering the breaches.""To date, FDIC has failed to notify any of those individuals that their private information may have been compromised,"" he added. The highest-ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Representative Don Beyer, said the concerns were shared by members of both parties and added the FDIC was too slow in notifying Congress about the breaks in data security. It should have informed lawmakers within seven days of the incidents, he said.
The FDIC's chief information officer and chief privacy officer, Lawrence Gross, told the hearing the agency is working to eliminate employees' use of portable media and has installed technology blocking most employees from downloading data from its systems to DVDs, CDs and flash drives.It is also looking into ""digital rights management"" software limiting the time period someone can access information and putting up other barriers to redistributing information.Gross, who started his role in November, said he is conducting a ""top to bottom review"" of the agency's information technology policies and planned to hire an independent third party to conduct an assessment. 
The FDIC has said the downloads were inadvertent. But members of Congress remained skeptical that the breaches were not intentional. 
""In at least one case...a former employee who downloaded such data was evasive about her actions and not cooperative when initially confronted,"" said Representative Bill Johnson.""Some FDIC employees also suggest that it was highly improbable that this former employee's actions were accidental. In addition this former employee is now working for a U.S. subsidiary of a non-U.S. financial services company which raises additional concerns.""

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lawrence Delevingne
| LAS VEGAS

LAS VEGAS Top fundraisers for Donald Trump made pitches on Wednesday to prominent hedge fund investors to line up behind the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to raise $1 billion for the general election campaign.The New York billionaire businessman was a topic of discussion as some 2,000 hedge fund managers, investors, lawyers and journalists gathered in Las Vegas for the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as SALT, the industry's most prominent annual meeting.Steven Mnuchin, Trump's newly appointed national finance chairman and a private investor himself, met with some of the attending hedge fund managers and others, including oil investor T. Boone Pickens, Georgette Mosbacher and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown.In an onstage interview, Kenneth Griffin, the billionaire founder of powerful hedge fund firm Citadel who previously supported U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, did not address the presidential campaign. A spokesman for Griffin did not respond to a request for comment.Also speaking at the event was former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who in an onstage interview, declined to endorse any presidential candidate. Earlier this year, Bloomberg flirted with an independent presidential candidacy, but decided against it for fear it would help Trump's chances of getting elected.Some investors told Reuters they were disappointed Bloomberg did not enter the race.Trump is the last man standing in the Republican race after U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich dropped out last week. Trump, who has never held elective office, is trying to unite Republicans behind his candidacy after a primary election campaign in which his fiery rhetoric on trade, immigration and Muslims rankled party elites.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Trump had pulled even with Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 presidential election.
David Rubenstein, co-founder of private equity powerhouse Carlyle Group, kicked off the three-day conference by asking the audience which candidate they thought would move into the White House in January after November's election. The vast majority did not express an opinion on either Trump or Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Away from panel discussions on how the industry can salvage a poor start to the year - the average hedge fund is off 0.8 percent this year, according to eVestment - powerful Trump backers were working smaller venues around the Hotel Bellagio.Anthony Scaramucci, who hosts the conference and runs hedge fund investment firm Skybridge Capital, said he was reaching out to his contacts to convince them Trump would run his candidacy like an entrepreneur, something he said America needed. 
'ENTREPRENEURIAL AVENUE'
""You have an opportunity now to bring an entrepreneur and a team of advisers that are entrepreneurial, out-of-the-box thinkers into Washington,"" Scaramucci told Reuters. ""That's the sell to potential donors.""Scaramucci has long been a powerful Republican fundraiser who originally backed Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in this year's race and later Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. He said there would be the Trump ""Entrepreneurial Avenue"" versus the ""Clinton cul-de sac,"" a suggestion that economic growth would be stronger under the likely Republican nominee.
Scaramucci added that potential donors would soon get over any fears of publicly helping Trump.""Candidate Trump has said some things that some business people think: 'Jeez, if I'm associated with some of those things, it could be perceived negatively for my business.' I think that will wash away in the next two months,"" Scaramucci said.Among big-name Trump backers at the conference were Pickens, an oil investor and hedge fund manager who previously supported Bush's candidacy.""Yes, I'm for Donald Trump,"" he said on stage, adding Trump was smart enough to get himself help where he needed it politically and that it would be refreshing to have a businessman instead of a politician in the White House.""Donald almost always overestimates how successful he is,"" Pickens said, ""but nonetheless he has been out there and he does know something about what he is talking about.""(This version of the story corrects paragraph three to remove reference to Mnuchin meeting with Griffin) (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lawrence Delevingne; Editing by Peter Cooney)"
