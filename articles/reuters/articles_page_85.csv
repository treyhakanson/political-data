By Sarah Marsh
| HAVANA

HAVANA President Barack Obama's nomination of an ambassador to Cuba is welcome but he should still do more to normalize relations between the two countries during his remaining time in office, a senior Cuban government official said on Wednesday.Gustavo Machin, the deputy director for U.S. affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry, told a news conference that Cuba will make those concerns known during a bilateral commission meeting on Friday in Washington.""The Cuban delegation will point out the lack of advances of in the economic, commercial sphere,"" Machin said. ""We consider the measures adopted by President Obama's administration are positive but still insufficient and limited.""Obama on Tuesday nominated career diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top official at the U.S. Embassy in Havana since relations were restored last year, to be the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than five decades.This was ""welcome"" news, Machin said. Cuba appointed its ambassador to the U.S. a year ago.  Still, the nomination must be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, which is seen as a long shot in a presidential election year and given expected strong resistance from Cuban-American senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas.
Obama should also use his executive powers, as he has done in the past, to further hollow out the trade embargo imposed on Cuba after its 1959 revolution, Machin said.Only Congress can lift the embargo, and the Republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon.""If the president could... allow investment in telecoms, why can't he authorize investments in other areas?"" Machin said. 
If he allowed the export of certain Cuban products to the United States, why could he not broaden the export of Cuban products?"" Machin asked.Obama's critics meanwhile accuse him of already making too many concessions towards Cuba without getting enough in return.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said earlier this month that if elected he would seek to reverse the detente unless the leaders there allowed religious freedoms and freed political prisoners.Machin said he hoped the next president would take into account the opinion of the majority of Americans, who agree with the opening to Cuba, according to opinion polls. Despite the need for more progress still, the two countries have made concrete progress in improving relations over the past four months since a previous commission meeting, Machin said, for example re-launching commercial flights.

By Scott Malone

Testimony by a former ally of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie that the Republican knew about the ""Bridgegate"" traffic scandal as it was going on could endanger his best chance at a political future: a role in a Trump administration.Christie has denied claims he had been an active participant in the plan to deliberately create massive traffic jams on a key bridge to New York to punish a Democratic mayor's refusal to endorse his re-election bid.But each piece of evidence that ties Christie closer to the scandal makes him more of a liability for Republican presidential contender Donald Trump, a New York real estate developer who has tapped the governor to head his transition team.""Every revelation increases the odds that Trump will distance himself from Christie, especially as Election Day gets closer,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at New Jersey's Princeton University.""Christie still serves a value to Trump, who wants to compete in blue states,"" he added. ""But there will be a point where the revelations overwhelm any sense of loyalty or any perception that he remains valuable to the campaign.""A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The 53-year-old governor's political future is already limited. New Jersey law prevents him from running for a third consecutive term next year, and polls show that Bridgegate has seriously hurt his popularity, explaining in part why Christie, who hoped to be president, quickly tied his fortunes to Trump.Christie on Tuesday repeated that he had not known about the lane-closure plan. 
""There's all kinds of stuff going on up in a courtroom in Newark, and I want to be really clear to all of you about something,"" Christie told reporters in Trenton. ""I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments.""That contradicted the testimony of David Wildstein, a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, in a federal court in Newark, where two other ex-Christie allies face criminal charges for their role in the scandal.While Bridget Kelly, his former deputy chief of staff and Bill Baroni, a close associate and former executive at the Port Authority, are on trial for their role in the 2013 incident, Christie himself has not been charged criminally.The governor was at the peak of his popularity at the time, having stepped into the national spotlight when he toured  Superstorm Sandy-ravaged New Jersey shore with President Barack Obama.With his eye on the White House, he was eager to secure the endorsements of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich and other Democratic mayors to show he was a politician able to forge alliances across party lines.
The lane closures, which generated massive traffic jams at the George Washington Bridge and national headlines, took a heavy toll on Christie's image and drew the mockery of the state's favorite son, rock star Bruce Springsteen.A Rutgers-Eagleton poll conducted early this month found that 23 percent of state residents held a favorable view of Christie, down 7 percentage points from a year earlier and one-third of what it was at Christie's peak of popularity in February 2013.""Bridgegate almost wholly contributed to the downfall that we've seen for the governor,"" said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at New Jersey's Rutgers University.His low popularity makes it highly unlikely he'd be successful in another statewide run, whether it was for governor in 2021 or for another office, she said.
After Christie's bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination failed, he pivoted quickly to endorse Trump, who embraced his support and named him transition chair in May.Christie would be charged with helping build a cabinet for a Trump White House and serve as a liaison with the outgoing Obama team. Christie was a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, suggesting the likeliest job in a Trump cabinet would be attorney general.""It's hard to imagine that he would be able to win Senate confirmation with knowledge of this scheme confirmed,"" said Brigid Callahan Harrison, professor of political science and law at New Jersey's Montclair State University. Trump could also pick Christie for a staff role, she said. Bill Stepien, who managed both of Christie's gubernatorial runs, is an adviser to the Trump campaign.Harrison added: ""From what we know of Trump, he may not be overly cautious about affiliating himself with people that could be damaging.""

By John Whitesides
| RALEIGH, N.C.

RALEIGH, N.C. Democrat Hillary Clinton sought on Tuesday to keep Republican rival Donald Trump on the defensive a day after their first U.S. presidential debate with accusations he is a sexist, racist and tax dodger, while Trump suggested he would ""hit her harder"" next time by bringing up her husband's infidelity.While the New York real estate mogul found himself in another controversy over his fresh insults about the weight of a former beauty pageant winner, Clinton tried to keep up the momentum after her forceful debate performance.She told reporters that during the debate, Trump ""was making charges and claims that were demonstrably untrue, offering opinions that I think a lot of people would find offensive and off-putting.""For his part, Trump, speaking at a rally in the battleground state of Florida on Tuesday, said of the debate: ""On issue after issue, Secretary Clinton defended the terrible status quo - while I laid out our plan to bring jobs, security and prosperity back to the American people.""Monday night's face-off between Clinton, with decades of experience in public life, and Trump, famous as a television personality but running for office for the first time, attracted a record audience for a U.S. presidential debate.Nielsen data showed 84 million people watched the debate on U.S. television, topping the 80.6 million viewers for the Jimmy Carter-Ronald Reagan TV presidential debate in 1980. Trump praised himself for not attacking Clinton during the debate about the marital infidelity of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, but said he may take up the attack line going forward. There are two more debates scheduled, on Oct. 9 in St. Louis and Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, ahead of the Nov. 8 election.""I may hit her harder in certain ways. I really eased up because I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings,"" Trump said in an interview on the Fox News program ""Fox & Friends.""He added that when Clinton criticized him for his treatment of women, he held back, saying: ""I was going to hit her with her husband's women. And I decided I shouldn't do it because her daughter was in the room.""Clinton brushed off Trump's vow, saying: ""He can run his campaign however he chooses."" She added that ""the real point is about temperament and fitness and qualification to hold the most important, hardest job in the world.""Trump himself was still married to his first wife, Ivana Trump, when he had a high-profile affair with Marla Maples, who became his second wife. He eventually divorced Maples and married his third and current wife, Melania Trump.
In the interview with Fox News, Trump sought to deflect criticism of his debate performance, saying the debate moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, asked him ""very unfair questions"" and that he was given a ""very bad"" microphone.""I don't want to believe in conspiracy theories, of course, but it was much lower than hers and it was crackling,"" Trump said of the microphone. Clinton, speaking to reporters on her campaign plane, said: ""Anyone who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.""BEAUTY QUEEN

Clinton, 68, excoriated Trump, 70, during the debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, for having called women ""pigs, slobs and dogs."" But Trump leveled new and highly personal criticism on Tuesday toward Venezuelan-born beauty queen Alicia Machado, who won the 1996 Miss Universe title and is now a U.S. citizen.""She was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight,"" said Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe pageants. ""And it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that - her attitude - and we had a real problem with her.""Clinton, the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party, seemed to pique Trump when she brought up during the debate how Trump had insulted women, mentioning Machado by name. Clinton said Trump called her ""Miss Piggy"" and also ""Miss Housekeeping"" because she was a Latina.'GAMING THE SYSTEM'
Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, stepped up her criticism of Trump for refusing to release his tax returns, as presidential candidates have done for decades, and for saying during the debate that not paying federal income tax ""makes me smart.""
""He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years,"" she said at a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, a pivotal state in the election.""He probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our healthcare system.""Trump held a campaign event in Miami's Little Havana, aiming to shore up support among Hispanic voters. His campaign said on Tuesday it had raised more than $18 million since the debate.Trump earlier complained that issues from Clinton's 2009-2013 tenure as secretary of state were not addressed on Monday night, including topics such as her use of a private computer server for government emails, the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, and the Clinton Foundation charity.In one of their more heated exchanges, Clinton accused Trump of promulgating a ""racist lie"" by questioning the citizenship of Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, saying he was not born in the United States.Obama lent his support again to Clinton's bid to become his successor, tweeting on Tuesday: ""Couldn't be more proud of @HillaryClinton. Her vision and command during last night's debate showed that she's ready to be our next @POTUS.""The Washington Post, citing a Clinton campaign source, reported she would be endorsed by John Warner, a former Republican U.S. senator from Virginia and Navy secretary, who the newspaper said would appear at an event in Virginia on Wednesday with Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine.The Arizona Republic's editorial board also endorsed Clinton, the first time in the newspaper's 126-year history it has backed a Democrat for president.

By Jill Serjeant and Lisa Richwine
| NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES

NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES The first presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump drew 84 million U.S. television viewers, a record for such an event and numbers rarely seen on TV in the age of digital streaming and social media.The audience for the Monday night face-off beat the 1980 record of 80.6 million set by the Jimmy Carter-Ronald Reagan presidential debate, when viewers had far fewer entertainment options. But it fell short of the 100 million viewers some analysts had predicted.The estimated ratings figure from Nielsen included people who watched the raucous encounter across 13 U.S. cable and broadcast networks and public television station PBS. The TV figures did not include millions of people who watched the debate online through Twitter (TWTR.N), Facebook (FB.O) and other social media, including in large groups in bars and restaurants.Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube reported nearly 2 million live concurrent streams of the debate on its platform.The National Football League's annual Super Bowl attracts more than 100 million viewers, making it the biggest U.S. TV event. 
Monday's debate was the first of three scheduled between Clinton and Trump before the Nov. 8 election. The other two are set for Oct. 9 and 19.Fox News Channel (FOXA.O) grabbed the biggest cable audience with an average 11.4 million viewers, early Nielsen data showed. NBC CMSCA.O, whose ""Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt moderated the contentious exchanges about race, the economy and national security, was first overall with an estimated audience of 18.2 million.TV networks had promoted the debates for days beforehand and reported strong demand compared with four years ago for commercial time during pre- and post-debate programming. Ad rates were far higher than for typical news programming.
CNN (TWX.N) charged more than $55,000 for 30-second ad spots as part of packages ranging from $800,000 to $1 million that included future debates and election night, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. CBS (CBS.N) charged between $200,000 to $225,000, according to another source.  Both CNN and CBS have limited availability left for the next debate on Oct. 9, the sources said. 
""Clearly the debate did really well last night,"" said Michael Law, managing director of video investments at Dentsu Aegis Network.Law said he did not expect ad rates for the next debate would rise significantly based on Monday night's audience. The Oct. 9 face-off airs against an NFL matchup of two popular teams - the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants.""The NFL will likely do well on that night, but will probably see some fall-off during the 90 minutes of debate,"" Law said.

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy, preserve the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.	Here are the proposals the former secretary of state has made as part of her argument that she is best qualified to occupy the Oval Office:ECONOMIC POLICY
Clinton has said the rich, not the middle class, would see their taxes go up.She supports billionaire investor Warren Buffett's eponymous tax proposal calling for those making more than $1 million a year to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Clinton has also called for an additional 4 percent tax on those making more than $5 million annually.Clinton has pledged to raise the estate tax levied on property transferred from a deceased person to their heirs. She also supports a tiered inheritance tax structure, with a top rate of 65 percent on the wealthiest estates of more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple.Clinton has pledged to unveil a plan to rebuild U.S. infrastructure during her first 100 days, saying this would create new jobs.She would use some of the revenue generated from her tax plan to pay for making community colleges tuition-free and ensuring students can graduate from public colleges and universities without incurring debt.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that independently scored Clinton's proposals in their totality, estimated her policies would cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade and would be offset by $1.6 trillion, mostly generated by taxing high earners. The group said the remaining $200 billion could be covered by $275 billion in corporate tax revenue the Clinton campaign has called for but not yet spelled out in sufficient detail for them to credit as an offset at this time.IMMIGRATION
Clinton has promised to propose broad legislation within her first 100 days in office to overhaul the immigration system and establish a process for undocumented workers to become citizens.Clinton has said she will defend executive actions taken by Democratic President Barack Obama to defer deportations of children brought illegally to the United States and the parents of children who are citizens or legal residents. She has said if Congress does not pass comprehensive immigration reform, she will similarly use executive action to defer deportations in ""sympathetic cases.""
A federal court has ruled that Obama did not have the authority to issue his executive orders on immigration, known as DACA and DAPA. The U.S. Supreme Court, currently short one member, split 4-to-4 on whether to hear the administration's appeal, leaving the lower court's ruling in place for the time being.WALL STREET REGULATION
Clinton has promised to preserve the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, and to pursue further measures to toughen Wall Street regulations.She has proposed a fee for large financial institutions based on their size and the level of risk they pose. She would also give regulators additional authority to force institutions that pose high risks to break apart or reorganize.Clinton has also urged strengthening the Volcker Rule, which restricts proprietary trading by commercial banks. She has called for a new tax on high-frequency trading and for stricter oversight of hedge funds, private equity firms and other players in the so-called shadow-banking system.She has promised stiffer policies on people who commit financial crimes, including an extension of the statute of limitations on such crimes and a requirement for bank executives to return bonuses if their institutions suffer major losses.
Changes to Dodd-Frank have stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress, and it is unclear whether Clinton could get congressional backing to strengthen the law, unless Democrats win control of one or both chambers in the Nov. 8 election.ISLAMIC STATE 
Clinton has pledged to defeat Islamic State and has said the first step to fighting the militant group is to eliminate its strongholds in Iraq and Syria.In a departure from the Obama administration, she supports the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria and has called for an intensified air campaign by the U.S.-led coalition. Clinton has said she would send additional American special forces to help Arab and Kurdish forces already on the ground. She opposes sending additional U.S. ground troops to the region.Clinton has said the United States and European allies must share intelligence more effectively in order to thwart potential attacks.She has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with the government to track militant recruitment tactics on the internet. 
RUSSIA
Current and former Obama administration officials have told Reuters they believe Clinton would  take a harder line on Russia than either Obama or Trump.Clinton has said she believes Russian hackers are behind the breach of Democratic Party systems in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election.Clinton has said Russia should play a role in combating Islamic State in Syria, and her foreign policy adviser has said she would consider arming government forces in Ukraine, one of Russia's neighbors, in a move to combat Russian ""aggression in Europe."" Russia has backed ethic Russian separatists in Ukraine.CHINA
Clinton was a key player in Obama's ""pivot"" to Asia when she served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.Clinton has said she will ""aggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences"" against China when it commits trade abuses.She opposes granting China market-economy status, which China will be seeking when a World Trade Organization clause expires in December, and has said she would make sure a newly installed trade prosecutor would ensure that China is playing by the rules.Clinton has said she would treat cyber attacks from countries such as Russia and China ""like any other attack"" and that the United States ""will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.""

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the border with Mexico, boost spending on the military and slap trade tariffs on China.Here are those positions and others the real estate developer, who has never held elective office, has put forward to convince the American people that he should be the next U.S. chief executive:ECONOMIC POLICY
Trump has proposed collapsing the current seven income tax brackets to three with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. The current top rate is 39.6 percent. He also would eliminate the estate tax, and slash the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent.His plan would allow families to deduct childcare costs from income taxes and offer further support through an existing tax credit for lower-income people. He would also provide six weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers through temporary unemployment insurance. He has proposed paying for it by cracking down on fraud in the unemployment insurance program and through other changes to the system.Trump has proposed increasing spending on the U.S. military and infrastructure but says he would reduce spending on other categories by 1 percent each year. However, the Social Security and Medicare programs for the elderly would be exempt from cuts.Some economists questioned whether Trump's ideas for reducing spending would be enough to make up for major tax cuts, particularly since many Republicans believe Medicare and Social Security must be revamped to control government outlays.IMMIGRATION
Trump launched his presidential campaign with his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and has said he would insist that the United States' southern neighbor pay for it.He has promised to triple the number of immigration enforcement officers, hire more Border Patrol agents and boost penalties for overstaying visas.Trump has said he would prioritize the deportation of people in the United States illegally who have committed crimes and of those who have arrived recently or overstayed visas.He would require people seeking legal status to leave and reapply. Trump said that after his immigration goals are achieved, he would determine what to do about people still in the country illegally.
    Trump has proposed ideological screening, or ""extreme vetting,"" of people coming to the United States to determine whether they share American values. He has proposed a ban on immigration from countries where vetting would be difficult. Initially, he proposed a temporary ban on all Muslims from entering the United States.Critics, including some of Trump's defeated rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, said the initial plan to ban all Muslims was discriminatory and likely unconstitutional. Others have since said his ""extreme vetting"" idea might not be feasible.        
    WALL STREET REGULATION
    Trump has promised a ""dismantling"" of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details.    The Republican Party's platform calls for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said in July that his campaign backed this change.Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall.
        
    ISLAMIC STATE 
    Trump has offered few details about his plans to combat Islamic State but has said he would ""knock the hell out of"" the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump has said if he wins, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017 to propose their own plans.    Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create ""safe zones"" there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states.President Barack Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something unlikely to be popular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
    RUSSIA
    Trump has said he would have a ""very, very good"" relationship with Russia. He has said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was a better leader than Obama.    Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab.    Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense.  NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that country's behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism.    CHINA
    Trump has made criticism of China's trade practices a central campaign theme. He has vowed to formally label China a currency manipulator, impose tariffs on Chinese imports and bring unfair trade cases as punishment for what he believes are improper subsidies.    Trump has called for a stronger U.S. military presence in the South China Sea.    He has said he would pull the United States out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Though the trade agreement does not include China, Trump has said he is concerned it could try to enter it through the ""back door.""TPP supporters, including Obama, have said China hoped to reach its own deal that would make it the leader in Asian trade. They have said the pact would enable the United States to take a leadership role in the region instead of China. (Compiled by Emily Stephenson; Editing by Caren Bohan and Jonathan Oatis)"

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate's senior Democratic tax law writer says he will rip up a root of corporate tax avoidance if his party wins Senate control in November, targeting trillions of dollars in tax-deferred profits being held abroad by U.S. companies.In an interview with Reuters, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden   said he wants to put an end to a Kennedy-era law that lets U.S. corporations indefinitely hold profits from active business operations offshore without paying U.S. tax on them. Corporate tax avoidance is under trans-Atlantic assault. The EU has slapped a $14.5 billion back-taxes bill on Apple Inc. Ten days ago, the Obama administration imposed another in a series of recent clamp-downs on tax avoidance.The idea of ending tax deferral of foreign profits has been kicked around for years. Wyden, 67, is a long-time proponent and might finally be able to do something about it, if voters support enough Senate Democrats in the Nov. 8 elections.""This is going to be front and center at the beginning of January,"" said Wyden, who is the top Democrat on the tax law-writing Senate Finance Committee. The panel and the full Senate are presently controlled by Republicans.Wyden said his first action, if he becomes chairman, will be to propose a funding package to upgrade U.S. infrastructure. It would require U.S. companies to bring home more than $2 trillion in foreign profits held offshore as part of an international tax reform package.A previous tax ""holiday"" for profits held offshore was tried in 2004 but was voluntary, not mandatory. Under that program, $360 billion in foreign profits was ""repatriated"" at a discounted tax rate of 5.25 percent, far below the statutory corporate income tax rate of 35 percent. Wyden has not specified a rate for his proposal.Six years later, with corporations pushing for another such holiday, a congressional committee said the 2004 program had little economic impact and cost the U.S. Treasury about $3.3 billion in lost revenue. 
The tax reforms Wyden envisions would also lower corporate tax rates and simplify the convoluted U.S. tax code to prevent tax planners from ""gaming"" the system. The code has not been thoroughly overhauled in 30 years.""The first bill out of the gate would be roads and bridges and transportation,"" Wyden told Reuters on Friday. ""My sense is that there will be an interest among members in using a portion of the money derived from international reform for the roads and bridges and transportation systems.""Most multinationals and many lawmakers, both Republicans and some Democrats, favor a foreign profit repatriation program, but not like the one Wyden wants. The United States has a ""worldwide"" corporate income tax system that taxes profits of U.S. companies no matter where they are made, with some exceptions. One is that earnings from active business operations, as opposed to passive income such as rent or royalties, can be left offshore on a tax-free basis under the Kennedy-era deferral rule. Passive income is taxed.
In contrast, most large countries have ""territorial"" systems in which companies pay income tax only to the government of the country where the profits were made.Corporate America has been lobbying for many years for a territorial system that would make deferral obsolete. Wyden and other Democrats want to keep a worldwide system and eliminate deferral, a position singled out for criticism last week by House Speaker Paul Ryan. ""The fear I have is the progressives who kind of control the Democratic Party don't think anything close to what looks like tax reform is a good thing,"" Ryan told the Economic Club of New York. ""I hope that view changes.""But Wyden says the public is unlikely to accept a system under which U.S. corporations do not pay taxes on foreign profits. ""At a time when Americans are so angry about jobs being shipped overseas... I don't think it's going to go over very well,"" he said.
""A competitive rate, no deferral and no gaming, I'm going to argue gets you the benefit of territorial.""Some Republicans also oppose tying tax reform to infrastructure.Wyden says failing to reform the tax code could strain U.S. relations with the European Union, if EU state aid probes continue to penalize U.S. companies, possibly resulting in U.S. action before the World Trade Organization.""To Democrats and Republicans, this feels more like the European Commission declaring open season on the American tax base than (them) joining us to fight tax dodgers,"" he said.""I could see members saying the United States should respond with a WTO case,"" Wyden added. ""There's that kind of anger."" (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Dan Grebler)"

By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The FBI is investigating suspected attempts to hack mobile phones used by Democratic Party officials as recently as the past month, four people with direct knowledge of the attack and the investigation told Reuters.The revelation underscores the widening scope of the U.S. criminal inquiry into cyber attacks on Democratic Party organizations, including the presidential campaign of its  candidate, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.U.S. officials have said they believe those attacks were orchestrated by hackers backed by the Russian government, possibly to disrupt the Nov. 8 election in which Clinton faces Republican Party candidate Donald Trump. Russia has dismissed allegations it was involved in cyber attacks on the organizations.The more recent attempted phone hacking also appears to have been conducted by Russian-backed hackers, two people with knowledge of the situation said.Federal Bureau of Investigation representatives had no immediate comment, and a Clinton campaign spokesman said they were unaware of the suspected phone hacking.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) did not respond to a request for comment. An official of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) said that nobody at the organization had been contacted by investigators about possible phone hacking.Interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile told CNN: ""Our struggle with the Russian hackers that we announced in June is ongoing - as we knew it would be - and we are choosing not to provide general updates unless personal data or other sensitive information has been accessed or stolen.""
FBI agents had approached a small number of Democratic Party officials to discuss concerns their mobile phones may have been compromised by hackers, people involved said. It was not clear how many people were targeted by the hack or whether they included members of Congress, a possibility that could raise additional security concerns for U.S. officials.'OFFICE BRAIN'
If they were successful, hackers could have been able to acquire a wide range of data from targeted cellphones, including call data, text messages, emails, photos and contact lists, one person with knowledge of the situation said.
""In a sense, your phone is your office brain,"" said Bruce Schneier, a cyber security expert with Resilient, an IBM company, which is not involved in the investigation. ""It's incredibly intimate.""""Anything that's on your phone, if your phone is hacked, the hacker can get it.""The FBI has asked some of those whose phones were believed to have hacked to turn over their phones so that investigators could ""image"" them, creating a copy of the device and related data.U.S. investigators are looking into whether hackers used data stolen from servers run by Democratic organizations or the private emails of their employees to get access to cellphones, one person said.
Hackers previously targeted servers used by the DNC, the body that sets strategy for the party, and the DCCC, which raises money for Democrats running for seats in the House of Representatives, officials have said. Clinton said during Monday's presidential debate there was ""no doubt"" Russia has sponsored hacks against ""all kinds of organizations in our country"" and mentioned Russian President Vladimir Putin by name.""Putin is playing a really tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee,"" Clinton said.Trump countered that there was no definitive proof that Russia had sponsored the hacks of Democratic organizations.""I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,"" he said. ""It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people."" (Reporting By Mark Hosenball; Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Grant McCool)"

MELBOURNE, Fla. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump got back on message on Tuesday after Democrat Hillary Clinton put him on the defensive at their first debate, and he cast her as ""stuck in the past"" and himself as a change agent.Trump's speech to thousands at a rally in a Florida airport hangar included some points that some supporters wished he had made before the record television audience of 84 million people for the debate on Monday in Hempstead, New York.One was Clinton's promise during her successful campaign to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2000 to create jobs in upstate New York.When Clinton pledged at Monday's debate that her economic plan would create millions of jobs, Trump did not use the opportunity to point out she oversold how many jobs she could create in upstate New York.Trump raised the issue on Tuesday in Melbourne, Florida,  about 70 miles east of Orlando on Florida's Atlantic coast where several defense and technology companies have operations.
""She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. It's so sad when you see what has happened to upstate New York. It's a disaster. She said she was going to do something about it... This is exactly what would happen if she ever won,"" he said.Trump's first campaign day after his debate performance, which received mixed reviews from voters, was aimed at taking advantage of polls showing him in a tight race in Florida with 41 days to go until the Nov. 8 election.
""For 90 minutes, Secretary Clinton was stuck in the past. For 90 minutes, on issue after issue, Secretary Clinton defended the terrible status quo - while I laid out our plan to bring jobs, security and prosperity back to the American people,"" he said.Earlier, at a Cuban bakery in Miami's Little Havana area, Trump sipped coffee and ordered pastries and empanadas and heard cries of ""Viva Trump"" from some patrons there. Elsewhere in the neighborhood, Trump held a roundtable discussion with Latino supporters, an effort to bolster his support among Hispanic-American voters who worry about his hardline immigration policy.
At that event, a Trump supporter, Irina Vilarino, a Cuban-American restaurant owner, told reporters that Trump needs to show improvement at his next debate on Oct. 9 in St. Louis.""He needs to take this debate and learn from his mistakes,"" she said. ""And I think he needs to address the issues that are pertinent to everyday Americans on the street."" (Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"
