By Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Representative Mike Pompeo, President-elect Donald Trump's surprise choice to head the CIA, supports the U.S. government's sweeping collection of Americans' communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.The retired Army officer, West Point and Harvard Law School graduate also has defended the CIA's use of interrogation techniques that are widely condemned as torture.The Kansas Republican has criticized Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state and her handling of the 2012 attacks on U.S. posts in Benghazi, Libya.A member of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Pompeo, 52, was first elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave from the congressional district centered on his hometown of Wichita. Members of both parties regard him as intelligent, collegial and capable, with a keen grasp of national security issues.""Mike is very bright and hard-working, and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policy makers,"" said Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. ""While we have had our share of strong differences - principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi - I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage."" Pompeo ""is a serious guy who studies issues carefully,"" said former National Security Agency and CIA director Michael Hayden.Some civil liberties and human rights advocates, however, expressed concern over Pompeo's selection because he opposes  closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center.They also criticized his support for the National Security Agency's now-defunct bulk communications metadata collection and other surveillance programs.""These positions and others merit serious public scrutiny through a confirmation process,"" said Anthony Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.In a January op-ed in the Wall Street Journal he co-authored, Pompeo called for a ""fundamental upgrade to America's surveillance capabilities,"" including resuming bulk collection of domestic phone metadata, the numbers and time stamps of calls, but not their content. 
The program, which a federal appeals court and two governmental review panels found to be illegal and ineffective, should be expanded to include ""publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database"", and that ""legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed,"" he wrote.He also called for the death penalty for Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor who disclosed the existence of the metadata program and other top-secret surveillance programs.   Pompeo stands a good chance of being confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Announcement of his nomination was warmly greeted by Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which will conduct his confirmation hearing. ATTACKING CLINTON

Pompeo has been at the forefront of attacks in Congress on Clinton, accusing her of ""criminality"" for storing emails containing classified information on her private server.He served on the Republican-led House committee that investigated the attacks by Islamist extremists on U.S. diplomatic and CIA posts in Benghazi that killed four Americans.While the panel found no wrongdoing by the administration, Pompeo and another member appended to the final report a commentary accusing Clinton and other officials of failing to protect the posts and to respond appropriately to the attacks.    Democrats accused Pompeo of using inaccurate information to exaggerate alleged failures by Clinton on Benghazi.Some of Pompeo's positions also are at odds with the assessments of the intelligence officers and analysts Trump wants him to command.While he has argued that the CIA's use of harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, which simulates drowning, produced useful intelligence, current CIA Director John Brennan has said he would resign if he were ordered to resume the practice.
Other CIA and military officers and FBI agents have said so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" do not produce reliable information because prisoners will ""say anything"" to end their suffering, as one CIA official put it.Pompeo also is at odds with the intelligence community's assessment of the 2015 deal that lifted financial sanctions from Iran in return for limits on its nuclear program.He has vowed to overturn the deal, and suggested in a 2014 roundtable with journalists that the United States should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, a proposal that U.S. intelligence experts said would only delay Tehran's development of a warhead, not halt it.Pompeo also has opposed the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, while at the CIA, a recently created Mission Center for Global Issues tracks global warming as a threat to U.S. security.He has taken positions that are at odds with Trump's, notably on Russia's actions in Ukraine and its military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who also is supported by Iran.Russia has established a toehold in the Middle East, and ""we now have the Iranian-Russian axis there largely running free,"" Pompeo told a security forum in 2015.Pompeo, who was born in California, graduated first in his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and was an artillery officer in the army for five years. He received a degree from the Harvard Law School and was an editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review.

By Julia Edwards Ainsley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to rapidly deport 2 to 3 million illegal immigrants with criminal records would further tax a system already stretched to its limits, current and former U.S. immigration officials say.Immigration courts, which issue deportation orders, set bond and grant or deny asylum, currently have a backlog of more than 500,000 cases. Boosting staff could help address the problem but that could prove difficult. Officials at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security say they have had trouble quickly finding and vetting enough qualified candidates to fill all the positions for judges and immigration agents that Congress has authorized. The Executive Office of Immigration Review, which adjudicates immigration cases, has so far been able to fill only 294 judge positions out of the 374 Congress has authorized because the process is slow by necessity.Candidates for the job ""face a rigorous screening process comparable to that of the appointment of a U.S. attorney,"" said spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly. Trump said last week after his election victory that once he takes office he will move to deport or incarcerate up to 3 million illegal immigrants who have criminal records.    
At U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a force of 6,200 agents responsible for arresting and deporting criminal migrants is already spread thin. While some agents could be redeployed to other areas, more agents would likely need to be hired if deportations were sharply escalated, said an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official who asked not to named. The agency would probably need to add detention space as well, the official added. More apprehensions of migrants could also strain the Border Patrol, which has struggled to fill open positions. Congress has mandated a force of more than 21,000 border agents, but it currently stands at just over 19,000.Former U.S. Border Patrol chief Mike Fisher said the agency ran into problems a decade ago after Congress asked it to double the number of Border Patrol agents from 6,000 to 12,000 between 2004 and 2006.
The push to hire quickly helped fuel corruption, a March 2016 report by the Department of Homeland Security's independent advisory council found.  The report concluded that the rapid hiring was exploited by Mexican drug gangs, which sent in cartel-friendly applicants for the patrol jobs. Once hired, they then facilitated drug smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border.The agency began using polygraph tests in 2010 to weed out applicants with criminal histories or ties to cartels. Fisher said the testing made it harder to find qualified candidates, estimating that by the time he left in 2015, the border patrol made one hire out of every 100 applicants.
""I can't imagine if they said 'double it' now,"" Fisher said. Trump could try to change laws and procedures to expedite deportation processes, which could reduce the need for additional personnel. On Friday, Trump tapped Republican Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Sessions has supported Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and undo Obama's executive actions on immigration. During President Barack Obama's time in office, the United States has deported about 2.5 million illegal immigrants, more than under any other president.

By Karen Freifeld and Dan Levine
| NEW YORK/SAN DIEGO

NEW YORK/SAN DIEGO Donald Trump agreed on Friday to pay $25 million to settle fraud lawsuits over his Trump University real estate seminars, in what New York's attorney general called a ""stunning reversal"" for the U.S. president-elect.The lawsuits had dogged Trump, who denied any wrongdoing,  throughout his campaign. They led to one of the more controversial moments of his run when he claimed the judge overseeing two of the cases was biased because he was of Mexican ancestry.The settlement was announced by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who said it followed repeated refusals by Trump ""to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university.""Lawyers for Trump had argued against students, who claimed they were they were lured by false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing ""secrets"" from his ""hand-picked"" instructors.Three lawsuits relating to Trump University will be covered by the deal: two class actions suits in California and a New York case brought by Schneiderman. The agreement must still be approved by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego.Trump will not admit any wrongdoing under the agreement. His attorney, Daniel Petrocelli, acknowledged Trump had previously vowed to fight the case.
The settlement demonstrated Trump's desire to set his personal feelings aside in order to work on issues facing the county, Petrocelli said.""President-elect Trump has laser focus on moving forward. It's time to move on,"" Petrocelli told reporters on Friday.Schneiderman and attorneys for the students praised the deal.
""Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university,"" Schneiderman said in a statement.At a court hearing on Friday, students' attorney Jason Forge said that out of the $25 million proposed settlement, $4 million will be earmarked for students represented by Schneiderman who were not part of the California class actions, as well as administrative costs.Class action lawyers for the students will not seek attorneys fees, but reimbursement for costs, he said. 
Curiel, who is presiding over the two California cases, had urged both sides to settle. Trump said during his election campaign that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trump's campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to control illegal immigration.In court on Friday, Trump lawyer Petrocelli praised Curiel for his hard work on the case. Curiel said he hoped the settlement could be part of a healing process after the U.S. election ""that this country very sorely needs.""

By Phil Stewart and Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON On his way to the polls on election day, Michael Flynn pulled out his phone and took a video of himself saying his vote for Donald Trump was part of a larger fight against ""the dishonesty and deceit of our government.""For Flynn, a retired U.S. Army three-star general and one of Trump's closest advisers, it was another parting shot at an administration he thinks unfairly fired him from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2014 for telling hard truths about the war on Islamist extremism.Named on Thursday to become Trump's national security adviser, Flynn is now poised for a second act in public life - and he has promised nothing short of an upheaval.   ""We just went through a revolution,"" Flynn, 57, told a forum on Saturday. ""This is probably the biggest election in our nation's history, since bringing on George Washington when he decided not to be a king. That's how important this is.""Flynn's advocates say his experience battling radical Islamist militants in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with candor that has ruffled feathers in Washington more than once, makes him the kind of ally Trump needs on his national security team.David Deptula, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who used to work with Flynn, praised his willingness to ""speak truth to power and not politicize his answers.""""Mike Flynn is a straight shooter and a no-bullshit kind of guy. And that's exactly what we need in terms of senior leaders giving advice to the national leadership,"" Deptula said.His critics voice concerns about a management style that alienated some of his subordinates at DIA, a lumbering bureaucracy that Flynn sought to shake up. That's an explanation some gave for why he was pushed into retirement.Flynn could not be reached for comment.Several former U.S. officials who worked closely with Flynn described him as extremely smart but a poor manager who advocated a precipitous overhaul of the DIA that ignited hostility and resistance from veteran intelligence officials.""Flynn understood that DIA was a mess,"" one said.
""But he telegraphed his intent for radical change in a way that he immediately created resistance to his ideas, no matter their merits.""Two other former officials also said they had concerns about Flynn's management style, a potential liability in a White House job that requires coordinating U.S. policy and resolving disagreements among senior officials at different agencies.One of the officials said senior career DIA officials and other agency employees held Flynn responsible for an offensive ""Dress for Success"" presentation that was distributed to the workforce in January 2013.It recommended gender-specific fashion guidelines, urged people to ""consider your body type"" and said makeup made women ""more attractive.""    Flynn apologized for the presentation in a subsequent memo that said neither he nor the agency ""condone this briefing.""    

POLICY CONCERNS
Flynn's policy views suggest he will take a more aggressive approach against Islamist militants.Former colleagues expect his effort to bolster America's battle against jihadists to be shaped by his belief that the United States is losing a global war against Islamist extremism that may last for generations.In a new book Flynn co-authored, he prescribes a harder political line on Iran, including information warfare to expose shortcomings in Iran's revolution.Like Trump, Flynn calls the 2003 invasion of Iraq a strategic blunder and says that energy should have been directed instead toward political support for opponents of Iran's theocratic rulers.
He shares Trump's vision of warmer relations with Israel  but also advocates stronger ties with Egypt, whose autocratic president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, ousted the Muslim Brotherhood and was the first world leader to congratulate Trump on his victory.Flynn's appearances on Russia's government-run broadcaster RT, particularly at a gala last year attended by President Vladimir Putin, have also raised eyebrows in military circles. However, he has also expressed skepticism about Moscow's intentions - a view that does not seem to fit Trump's vision of a new era of detente with the Kremlin. Although he has more experience battling the Taliban, al Qaeda and other militant groups than anyone else in Trump's inner circle, Flynn's critics in the intelligence community and the military question whether his ouster from the DIA has changed him.""The whole experience seems to have made him bitter,"" said another former U.S. official who worked with Flynn and spoke on condition of anonymity.Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, questioned Flynn's temperament, saying Trump needs someone more steady and ""thorough in their analysis"" to temper him. ""I'm not sure that's what you get with General Flynn. And I would be worried about an impulsive president with an impulsive security adviser,"" Schiff told CNN.Former colleagues are alarmed by his adoption of Trump's divisive campaign rhetoric - including leading chants of ""Lock Her Up!"" aimed at Hillary Clinton during the Republican National Convention and saying on Twitter ""Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.""""I think what you have is frustration that eventually turns to anger after he leaves,"" said this former U.S. official. ""He was frustrated over DIA; he was frustrated over administration policy toward Syria; and he's frustrated and angry over his removal from the Department of Defense.""

Even for a 2016 election campaign marked by rhetorical invective, the remarks President-elect Donald Trump and Mitt Romney made about each other in the run-up to the Nov. 8 vote were especially harsh. Those exchanges make all the more significant Trump's plan to meet Romney, the unsuccessful 2012 Republican presidential candidate, on Saturday. A source familiar with the meeting said they may discuss whether Romney should be considered for secretary of state in a Trump administration. Here are some of the things, kind and unkind, that Trump and Romney have said about each other.* ""Governor Romney, go out and get 'em. You can do it."" - Trump endorsing Romney in February 2012* ""Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works ... It means a great deal to me to have the endorsement of Mr. Trump."" - Romney accepting the 2012 endorsement* ""Dishonesty is Donald Trump's hallmark."" - Romney speaking at a political forum in Utah in March
* ""He was begging for my endorsement. I could've said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees,' and he would've dropped to his knees."" - Trump at a March campaign rally responding to the Romney speech and describing how Romney had sought his endorsement in 2012* ""Think of Donald Trump's personal qualities. The bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics. Now, imagine your children and your grandchildren acting the way he does."" - Romney's anti-Trump speech in March
* ""He failed horribly ... Mitt is indeed a choke artist."" - Trump in March assessing Romney's presidential run* ""Here's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University."" - Romney in March
* ""Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist - but I am least racist person there is."" - Trump tweet in June* ""I think his comments time and again appeal to the racist tendency that exists in some people and I think that's dangerous."" - Romney in a CNN interview in June* ""Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win.

WASHINGTON Most Americans want the media to present facts in news stories without adding interpretation, a Pew Research Center survey said on Friday amid a debate in the media about its role in covering Donald Trump's unconventional presidential campaign.Journalists face the issue of how much guidance they should provide to help their audiences make sense of the news. The question is especially keen after the 2016 election when the media grappled with challenging false statements made by Republican Trump in his campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton.Fifty-nine percent of U.S. adults reject the idea of adding interpretation, saying that the news media should present the facts alone, the survey showed. Four in 10 favored adding some interpretation to the facts.""Although the public prefers the news media to present 'just the facts,' they may not even agree on what the facts are,"" Pew said in a statement.In the same survey, 81 percent of registered voters said that most supporters of Clinton and Trump not only disagreed over plans and policies, but also disagreed on basic facts.
Voters who supported Trump, now the president-elect, favored a ""just the facts"" approach by 71 percent to 29 percent. Clinton supporters were evenly split on the issue.The survey showed strong support for fact-checking by the media.
The election campaign saw a proliferation of fake news sites and articles on social media competing with news published by traditional media, although this was not included in the survey.Eighty-one percent of those who prefer facts without interpretation believe fact-checking is a major or minor responsibility of the news media. Among those who prefer interpretation, 83 percent think fact-checking is a responsibility.
The survey of 4,132 adults was conducted from Sept. 27 to Oct. 10, before Election Day. The margin of error is 2.8 percentage points. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; editing by Grant McCool)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sessions-newsmaker-idUSKBN13D22Y	Conservatives have concerns about Sessions as Trump's attorney general	"


By Julia Edwards Ainsley and Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named his earliest and staunchest supporter in the Senate, conservative Republican Jeff Sessions, to become the next U.S. attorney general, triggering an outcry from civil rights groups as well as some conservatives outside Congress who are uneasy about Sessions' positions.If approved for the job by a simple majority in the Republican-dominated Senate, Sessions, 69, would lead the Justice Department and the FBI. He brings a record of controversial positions on race, immigration and criminal justice reform that Democrats may target.Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, said on Twitter, ""Jeff Sessions, considered too racist to be a judge in the '80s, is Trump's AG.""Holly Harris, executive director of U.S. Justice Action Network, a sentencing reform advocacy group that includes powerful conservative tax reform lobbyist Grover Norquist, said Sessions' nomination ""obviously presents a challenge.""Sessions has opposed lowering mandatory minimum sentences for low-level offenders.  Many civil rights and immigration groups also have concerns about Sessions with the American Civil Liberties Union saying his positions on gay rights, capital punishment, abortion rights and presidential authority in times of war should be examined.Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Reuters: ""Our nation deserves an attorney general who will be committed to enforcement of our nation's civil rights laws and who will not turn the clock back on progress that has been made.""Trump spokesman Jason Miller defended Sessions against allegations of racism, saying: ""When Senator Sessions was U.S. attorney he filed a number of desegregation lawsuits in Alabama, and he also voted in favor of the 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act... So we feel very confident that Senator Sessions has the background and the support to receive confirmation.""Sessions' office did not respond to a request for comment on his nomination or criticism.REJECTED FROM JUDGESHIP

Sessions was a federal prosecutor in 1986 when he became only the second nominee in 50 years to be denied confirmation as a federal judge. This came after allegations that he had made racist remarks, including testimony that he had called an African-American prosecutor ""boy,"" an allegation Sessions denied.Sessions said he was not a racist, but he said at his hearing that groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union could be considered ""un-American."" He also acknowledged he had called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a ""piece of intrusive legislation.""Sessions, a four-term senator from Alabama, has friends on Capitol Hill. Convivial, with a pixie-like demeanor and soft Southern accent, his gentle manner belies his hard-line positions.No members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold Sessions' confirmation hearing, had expressed outright opposition to his nomination as of Friday morning, but many Democrats said he would get a thorough and tough confirmation hearing. ""Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say,"" said Charles Schumer, the newly elected Democratic Senate leader.
Judiciary Committee member Senator Jeff Flake, a moderate Republican on immigration issues and a long-time critic of Trump, said on Twitter that he will support Sessions, who he said is ""well regarded, even by those who don't always agree with him.""INVESTIGATIONS OF POLICE
The Justice Department under Democratic President Barack Obama has been criticized for siding with protesters over police in matters of racial profiling or unlawful use of force. His Justice Department opened investigations of 23 police departments around the country for patterns of civil rights violations and Sessions, as attorney general, would have the discretion to drop investigations that are still open.Jim Pasco, the executive director of Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's largest police union, said police have had a good relationship working with Sessions, especially on policies that allow police to keep assets seized from criminals. ""The door (to Sessions) has been open and we expect it to remain open,"" Pasco said. 
Sessions' hard-line and at times inflammatory statements on immigration are similar to Trump's but have angered other members of Congress. He opposes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and was an enthusiastic backer of Trump's promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico.As a senator, Sessions opposed Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch as attorney general on the grounds that she would carry out an Obama immigration policy that shielded many undocumented immigrants from deportation.Sessions also has questioned the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to everyone born in the United States, and opposes plans to admit more immigrants from war-torn Middle Eastern countries.As attorney general, Sessions would be able to turn more to state governments to enforce federal immigration laws. He also could increase enforcement on companies that outsource technology jobs. As a senator, Sessions criticized U.S. companies that brought guest workers to the United States on temporary visas. Sessions first endorsed Trump's presidential bid in February, surprising those who had expected him to embrace Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a fellow Southerner and the favorite of the chamber's most conservative wing.Sessions was Trump's only backer in the Senate for months and became a powerful member of his inner circle. He has led Trump's national security committee since March and was named vice chairman of the transition's executive committee last week.Sessions defended Trump in October when a leaked video showed him bragging about groping women, leading dozens of Republican officials to drop their support.
