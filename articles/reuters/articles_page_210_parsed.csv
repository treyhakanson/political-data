ABU DHABI - Hillary Clinton's victory in the Democratic presidential primary race is a ""historic moment"" for the United States and should be celebrated by Republicans and Democrats alike, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday.Clinton declared herself the Democratic Party nominee on Tuesday evening after winning the New Jersey primary, setting up a general election campaign against Republican candidate Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. She is the first woman in American history to attain the presidential nomination of a major political party.
""As a father of two daughters, I'm proud,"" Kerry told reporters while traveling from China to the United Arab Emirates, adding that he had sent a message to Clinton congratulating her on the outcome. ""She'll make a terrific president.""    Kerry, who was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004 but lost to Republican incumbent President George W. Bush, said Clinton's achievement was a ""truly historic moment for the nation.""    
""Everybody ought to celebrate it, Republican or Democrat alike,"" he said. ""It's a breakthrough, and I think that whether you're voting for Trump or you're voting for her or whoever, you ought to take pride.""

By Elisabeth O'Leary
| EDINBURGH

EDINBURGH Scottish Muslims have invited Donald Trump to visit a mosque and learn about their faith during his visit to Scotland this month in the hope of changing his views.The presumptive Republican U.S. presidential candidate, whose mother was Scottish, last year proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States as a response to Islamist attacks in Paris and California, causing a furor in Europe.Accepting a visit to learn about the Muslim community might help show that he is not so extreme, Edinburgh Central Mosque Imam Yayha Barry told Reuters.""I would say: 'Hi Donald, we're Muslims, welcome to our mosque! Do you still see Muslims as a threat to Western civilizations?'"" he said.Trump's views prompted widespread opposition in Britain, where he owns two golf courses on the west and east Scottish coasts. His comments about stopping Mexican migrants entering the United States also caused offense, leading to the withdrawal of Scottish business and academic accolades. Prime Minister David Cameron said the remarks by the potential leader of Britain's closest international ally were ""divisive, stupid and wrong"". 
Neither Cameron nor Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon plan to meet him on his visit, which coincides with the result of Britain's referendum on EU membership on June 24. Spiritual leaders in the Islamic community invited Trump to ""learn more about the Muslims that he offends"".""We would welcome the opportunity to show him the work that we are doing in the community in Edinburgh when he comes to Scotland,"" said Hafiz Ghafoor of Annandale Mosque and Munawar Hussain, secretary of Roxburgh St Mosque and Islamic Centre, in a joint statement.
Trump's relationship with Scotland has been rocky since he contested a decision to build an offshore wind farm opposite his golf course in Aberdeenshire. His trip will include a visit there as well as to his courses at Turnberry, in southwestern Scotland, and Doonbeg, in Ireland.Protests at Trump's ""misogynist, racist and xenophobic"" views are planned by Aberdeen University students during his visit, the president of the Students' Association said. A spokesperson for the Trump Organisation did not respond to a request to comment. 
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Trump should witness first hand the work being done by local Muslims to reach across faiths and help those in need.""Muslims are our friends, colleagues, family and neighbors. When he insults them in such a grotesque manner he insults us all.""About 77,000 Scots are Muslims, or 1.4 percent of the population, according to the latest official census in 2011.

By John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Bernie Sanders' upstart U.S. presidential campaign may be headed to defeat, but his goals of reining in Wall Street, ending big money in politics and eradicating income inequality were the big winners in the bruising Democratic race.Sanders, who started as a little-known long-shot, pushed the party and established front-runner Hillary Clinton sharply to the left during a long primary battle. Along the way, the 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont energized young and progressive voters and prepared the ground for what his allies predict will be a lasting influence on the party.Clinton, one of the best-known political figures in the United States, clinched the Democratic Party's nomination in a last round of state nominating contests on Tuesday.  But even before her victory, Sanders began taking steps to turn his newfound political influence into an enduring progressive movement.In the last few weeks, he has lent his influence and fundraising power to progressive congressional and state legislative candidates who share his agenda, urging his supporters around the country to donate to their campaigns.Sanders also appointed prominent activists to the panel writing the issues platform for the party's convention in July, ensuring a strong voice in the process.His convention delegates will push for changes to party primary rules, including letting independents vote in primaries and reducing the influence of superdelegates, the hundreds of party elites who can support any candidate regardless of voting in their constituencies, and who in this primary season have largely backed Clinton.""I do think we are going to see real changes in the Democratic Party going forward because of Bernie. The future of the party is with the people supporting Sanders,"" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a liberal Vermont-based group that rose from Howard Dean's failed 2004 presidential bid and endorsed Sanders this time.""He has proven the power of this message,"" Chamberlain said.
During the campaign, Sanders forced Clinton to tack left repeatedly on issues ranging from her support for a higher minimum wage to her opposition to the Asian trade pact and Keystone XL oil pipeline.Sanders' progressive allies said those shifts by Clinton will be helpful in the Nov. 8 election against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has touted an anti-trade and pro-jobs economic agenda, and for Democrats in their efforts to recapture a majority in the U.S. Senate.""When the story of the 2016 election is told, a major part of it will be that Bernie Sanders helped the Democratic Party turn up the volume on economic populism issues,"" said Adam Green, co-founder of the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee.'FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHTS'

If Democrats win back the Senate in the November election, Sanders will be in line for either the chairmanship of the Budget Committee or the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, both powerful platforms to advance his ideas.Chamberlain said Sanders would create a formidable one-two  punch in the Senate with Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator who has been the leader of the party's progressive wing.""Bernie Sanders is going to fight all the good fights,"" he said. ""With Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren we're going to see a Senate team that will be very powerful.""Sanders' investment in the next generation of progressive politicians, meanwhile, is aimed at spawning a new generation of liberals who back his agenda.
He has sent emails to his grassroots fundraising list urging his donors to back six insurgent congressional candidates and eight statehouse candidates who echo his economic message, sparking a flood of donations to their campaigns. More endorsements are expected.""Our movement is so powerful that we can change congressional elections overnight. Let's keep going,"" Sanders said on Tuesday in an email to supporters asking them to support two more candidates for Congress - Eric Kingson in New York and Paul Clements in Michigan.Justin Bamberg, a first-term state representative from South Carolina, said he received about $70,000 in small-dollar donations after Sanders sent an email to his supporters backing Bamberg. In Bamberg's first campaign, he raised $21,000 during the entire cycle, he said.""They don't know me from Adam, but they believe in Senator Sanders, and because of that they believe in the people that Senator Sanders has supported,"" Bamberg said, adding he was also getting calls offering to volunteer on his behalf.Terry Alexander, a South Carolina state representative backed by Sanders, said he also had received about $70,000 in donations after the Sanders email. The money freed him from worrying about raising funds, giving him more time to focus on meeting voters, he said.""It has made a difference in how people see my candidacy, it's created a lot of enthusiasm and a tremendous boost in fundraising,"" he said.

By Sharon Bernstein
| SACRAMENTO, Calif.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. California voters on Tuesday were poised to choose two Democrats to face off against each other in the race to succeed Barbara Boxer in the U.S. Senate, shutting out Republicans in a sign of diminished support in America's most populous state.State Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez will meet in what would be the state's first single-party Senate election under a 2010 California law advancing the top two primary vote-getters to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.With 16 percent of precincts reporting in early returns on Tuesday, Harris, 51, led the crowded field of 34 candidates with 40 percent of the vote. None of the Republican contenders came close to Sanchez, 56, who was firmly in second place with 16  percent of the vote.Boxer, 75, a Democrat, is retiring after 24 years in the Senate.Republicans hold no statewide offices in California and represent about 27 percent of registered voters. The state, home to former Republican Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, last elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1988.On Tuesday, former California Republican Party chairman Duf Sundheim was in third place with 10 percent in early returns, followed by fellow Republican Phil Wyman with 6 percent.      Harris is the daughter of two college professors. Of African-American and Indian descent, she was raised amid civil rights activism in Berkeley and Oakland, eventually becoming a prosecutor in San Francisco. She was elected attorney general in 2010 and 2014.
For the primary, Harris ran a tightly controlled campaign, touting her role negotiating a settlement with big banks over the mortgage meltdown and using her position as the state's top prosecutor to fight human trafficking, cyber crime and other issues.Sanchez, who represents Orange County near Los Angeles, has served in Congress since 1997. Her win in the once staunchly Republican county was an early sign of California's demographic shift, as the state became more ethnically diverse and far more Democratic.
COULD GO NEGATIVE
Such a matchup could easily go negative, experts said, straining relationships within a party that are already bruised by the tense competition between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Clinton and Sanders also face off in California on Tuesday.""The fact that they're both in the same party doesn't mean they're going to treat each other with kid gloves,"" political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said of Harris and Sanchez.""When ideological and policy differences aren't as great, it's only natural for the candidates to focus on personal issues,"" said Dan Schnur, who heads the Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California.
Sanchez, seeking to become the state's first Latina U.S. senator, has raised less money than Harris and trails her by about 8 percentage points in polls. But factors including a recent surge in voter registration among Latinos will make her a strong competitor in the general election, analysts said.She has positioned herself more to the political center than her opponent.With support from Latinos, independents and Republicans, Sanchez could win in November despite Harris' advantages, Schnur said.""We're prepared for any turn in the race,"" said Harris spokesman Nathan Click. A Sanchez campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

By Richard Cowan and Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would no longer talk about a Mexican-American judge after U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the presidential candidate's criticism of the jurist as textbook racism.But Trump refused entreaties from party leaders to disavow his charge that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was showing bias because of his Mexican heritage and should recuse himself from a lawsuit alleging fraud at Trump's defunct Trump University real estate training school.Trump said in a statement that his previous remarks about Curiel had been misconstrued.""I do not feel that one's heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial,"" the presumptive Republican nominee said. Trump added that he did not plan to comment further on the matter.Trump had been suggesting that Curiel's heritage was influencing the judge's opinion about the case because of Trump's campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Trump has pledged to seal the U.S.-Mexico border with a wall, and has said Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States.Ryan, the country's top elected Republican, blasted Trump's comments, which have threatened to disrupt Republicans' already rocky efforts to unite behind the candidate.""I regret those comments that he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed,"" Ryan told reporters.The controversy over Trump's attacks on the judge has set back his efforts to try to unify the Republican party behind him ahead of the Nov. 8 general election when he will face off against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Speaking to supporters at the golf club he owns in the hilly suburbs of New York later on Tuesday, Trump laid out his vision for the meaning of his campaign slogan ""America First,"" talking about its implications for trade, energy, financial regulation and tax policies.Breaking with his usual practice of speaking off the cuff, Trump read from a teleprompter and left without taking questions from reporters.
Ryan, who endorsed Trump last week after initial misgivings, said he still supported his candidacy, saying Trump would be preferable to Clinton.Behind the scenes, Trump has been pressured from friends and family to back down, fearful of the damage that may be done to his prospects in the general election, a source close to the Trump campaign said.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a potential Trump vice presidential running mate, was spotted at Trump Tower in New York before Trump's statement was issued. Christie earlier in the day defended Trump as ""not a racist.""""Some of his friends and family have talked to him and asked him to drop it and so far he won't do it,"" the source said, speaking before Trump's statement was issued. ""Everybody is mystified about why he would keep doing it.""HIGH ANXIETY

Ryan's emphatic rejection of Trump's comments showed anxiety among party leaders about their ability to hang on to control of the U.S. Congress in November if voters trounce Trump and also punish candidates for other offices on the Republican ticket.Ryan's counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said Trump should stop attacking minority groups.""My advice to our nominee is to start talking about the issues that the American people care about, and to start doing it now,"" the Senate Republican leader told reporters.""In addition to that, it's time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message.""Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican who said back in March he would support whoever turned out to be the Republican nominee, said on Tuesday he could not support Trump because he did not have the ""temperament necessary"" for the White House.
Kirk condemned Trump's comments on Curiel as ""dead wrong"" and ""un-American."" Kirk is seeking re-election in November.During the Republican primary campaigns, in which Trump vanquished 16 opponents with a stream of insults to rivals and inflammatory comments about Muslims, immigrants and women, establishment Republicans squirmed over the prospect of the former reality television host becoming their standard-bearer.But many, seeing no alternative, have reconciled themselves to a Trump run for the White House.'UNFAIR POSITION'
Trump's continuing practice of making explosive remarks about racial, religious and gender issues is making Republicans, including those who have embraced him, uncomfortable.With greater scrutiny of Trump now that he is set to formally win the Republican presidential nomination at the party's July convention in Cleveland, there are concerns about the party's ability to maintain control of the House of Representatives and Senate.""Trump's continuing missteps, punctuated by his outrageous and indefensible comments about Judge Curiel, make that goal much more difficult to achieve,"" said Lanhee Chen, a senior adviser to former presidential candidate Marco Rubio and a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution.

By Karen Freifeld
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK When lawyers for Donald Trump asked a court to throw out one of the proposed class actions over Trump University, they backed it up with a financial disclosure meant to bolster the Republican presidential candidate's credentials as a global businessman.But the form they filed with the court was actually that of the man Trump hopes to succeed in the White House, Democratic President Barack Obama.The president's nine-page disclosure filed before his 2012 re-election was erroneously included as an exhibit to a motion Trump filed in April asking U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel for the Southern District of California to toss the case before trial, according to a person familiar with the case. A corrected exhibit was filed on Tuesday. Plaintiffs' lawyer Jason Forge seized on the goof in a court document filed late on Friday opposing Trump's motion. Forge said the candidate's filing was meant for a court in ""Bizarro world."" 
""This is just one example of Trump's statement's complete lack of credibility,"" Forge said.Julie Fei, a spokeswoman for O'Melveny & Myers, the firm that has been representing Trump in the case, declined to comment.In court filings, Trump's lawyers said the form supported the ""undisputed fact"" that Trump is chairman, president and chief executive of the Trump Organization, which conducts business around the world and is affiliated with over 500 companies.
Instead, it showed Obama's royalties from his memoir ""Dreams from My Father"" and disclosed the first family's 2011 assets of between $2.6 million and $8.3 million.Trump is facing two lawsuits in California and one in New York over Trump University that allege the series of real estate seminars taught students nothing and defrauded them of as much as $35,000 each in fees.
The presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election has raised the litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated, and accusing the Indiana-born Curiel of being biased against him because of his Mexican ancestry. Trump's lawyers intended to file the 92-page financial disclosure form he made public last summer at the time he announced he was running for president. That lists some $1.4 billion in assets, including real estate and other holdings, and $265 million in liabilities. The disclosure does not note his net worth, which he has said is over $10 billion.

By David Shepardson

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rebuked General Motors Co (GM.N) on Tuesday, widening his criticism of American companies that have invested in Mexico.Trump has made criticism of Ford Motor Co (F.N) a staple of his campaign speeches for more than a year, repeatedly suggesting that the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker would back down from plans to expand in Mexico or face a 35 percent tariff on vehicle exports.Trump also has criticized Carrier, a manufacturer of air conditioning units, which is owned by United Technologies Corp and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the owner of Nabisco, for shifting jobs to Mexico.""I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies - like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier - are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage,"" Trump said in a statement defending his comments about a Mexican-American judge overseeing civil lawsuits against Trump University. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn criticism, including from within his own party. A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Trump had decided to criticize GM.
GM spokesman Jim Cain declined comment on Trump's criticism.In December 2014, GM said it was investing $5 billion in Mexico through 2018 - a move that would allow it to double its production capacity at its plants around the country. GM said in 2014 the investment would create 5,600 jobs in Mexico.
The Detroit News reported in May that GM plans next year to move some light-duty pickup production to the Flint Assembly Plant from Mexico, according to a memo from UAW Local 598 to membership.Mexican auto production has been rising in recent years as numerous automakers expand operations.Mexico produced 3.4 million vehicles in 2015, the seventh largest vehicle producer worldwide, and could surpass South Korea by 2020, producing more than 5 million vehicles, according to industry forecasts.
Ford has repeatedly rejected Trump's criticism and emphasized its significant U.S. investments and employment.In April, Ford announced it would invest $1.6 billion to build more small cars in Mexico. In 2015, Ford said it would invest $2.5 billion in new engine and transmission plants in Mexico, creating 3,800 jobs. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Howard Goller)"	['Trump']	[]
