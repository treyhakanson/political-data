WASHINGTON Federal election observers can only be sent to five states in this year's U.S. presidential election, among the smallest deployments since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 to end racial discrimination at the ballot box.The plan, confirmed in a U.S. Department of Justice fact sheet seen by Reuters, reflects changes brought about by the Supreme Court's 2013 decision to strike down parts of the Act, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement.Voting rights advocates told Reuters they were concerned that the scaling-back of observers would make it harder to detect and counter efforts to intimidate or hinder voters, especially in southern states with a history of racial discrimination at the ballot box.The Supreme Court ruling undercut a key section of the Act that requires such states to obtain U.S. approval before changing election laws. The court struck down the formula used to determine which states were affected.By doing so, it ended the Justice Department's ability to select voting areas it deemed at risk of racial discrimination and deploy observers there, the fact sheet said.Eleven mostly Southern states had been certified as needing federal observers by the department.Federal observers can still be sent to monitor elections but only when authorized by federal court rulings. Currently, courts have done so in five states: Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, and New York, according to the Justice Department.A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the fact sheet or say how many people will be deployed to monitor voting until closer to the Nov. 8 election pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton.In recent presidential elections, the Justice Department has sent more than 780 people to watch elections around the country. They were split into three categories. The Supreme Court ruling reduced that to two, according to the document.One category is Justice Department staff, who have no statutory authority to access polling sites but still monitor voting nationwide. They must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations.
A second group are federal observers trained by the Office of Personnel Management with unfettered access to polling sites. They are only deployed by federal court order.A third group -- which the document said has been eliminated by the Supreme Court decision -- are federal observers deployed to jurisdictions that the attorney general selected based on evidence of possible racial discrimination. They were also trained by the Office of Personnel Management and had full access to polling sites.Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Friday the Justice Department's ability to deploy election observers had been ""severely curtailed"" by the Supreme Court's decision.Since Congress passed the 1965 Act, federal observers have gathered evidence of unlawful activity and prepared reports from polling sites that can be used as evidence in court.In the November 2004 presidential election, the last for which the Justice Department provided numbers of federal observers, about 840 federal observers and more than 250 department personnel were dispatched to polling sites in 86 jurisdictions in 25 states.
""VERY DISAPPOINTED""
""The mix of tools has shifted,"" said Justin Levitt, who oversees the Justice Department's voting section.The department still has the ability to send in personnel and take legal action against election officials where necessary, he said in an interview.But Justice Department staff who monitor elections have significantly less authority than federal observers.At any point on Election Day, Justice Department staff can be denied entry to a voting area or asked to leave, unlike a federal observer. That could make it more difficult to gather evidence of voting problems and potentially make it harder to prosecute cases of suppression, say voting rights advocates.
Suppression can take a number of forms, such as intimidating or misinforming voters, or denying them access to voting materials in their own language.Relying on Justice Department personnel to monitor elections is ""a far cry"" from federal observers who are statutorily authorized to be inside the polling place, said Gerry Hebert, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based non-profit Campaign Legal Center.Hebert, a former senior Justice Department voting rights official, oversaw teams of federal observers in the U.S. South before leaving the department in 1994.Federal observer reports have been cited in court cases by groups alleging voter fraud.In Sandoval County, New Mexico, federal observer reports showed that Native-American voters had difficulty getting voting information in their native languages during the decade between 1994 and 2004, according to a 2011 court order in a case the United States brought against the county.Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, said federal observers are especially needed this year because 17 states have tightened restrictions on voting since the last presidential election.""We're very disappointed by the decision of the Justice Department,"" said Ho. The Supreme Court ruling did not mention the federal observer program specifically, ""so I don't think this decision was inevitable,"" he added.Anita Earls, the executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice and a former senior official in the Justice Department's voting section, said the guaranteed ability of federal observers to examine voter registration rolls and remain inside polling stations makes them more effective than Justice Department staff at catching voter suppression.

By Daniel Trotta
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND East 4th Street, emblematic of the new Cleveland as a once-downtrodden area turned trendy, is bustling ahead of the Republican National Convention.Outdoor diners on the cobblestone restaurant row enjoy a glorious summer afternoon while cable network MSNBC shoots its politically themed shows on the street. Just ahead of the four-day convention that starts on Monday, a festival of commerce and smiling faces takes place a few steps from the so-called hard zone, delineated by a literal iron curtain that surrounds the sports arena where Donald Trump will be crowned the Republican presidential candidate.""Ten years ago, this place was a dump. A wasteland,"" said John Lusk, 70, a semiretired publisher of a newsletter. ""A group of young, hardworking entrepreneurs came in and look what they did.""   The sunny celebration butts uncomfortably against a massive security operation that shows the other side of Cleveland's big moment. City and U.S. officials are preparing for the worst, aware that tensions over race relations and police use of force, as well as reaction to Trump's polarizing campaign, could result in violence on the streets.Clevelanders are also aware of the backdrop for their convention: the mass shooting in Orlando that killed 50 people in June, the sniper attack that killed five Dallas police this month, and the truck assault that killed 84 this week in Nice.On this same idyllic block just over a year ago, police in riot gear clashed with demonstrators reacting to the acquittal of police officer charged with manslaughter for firing 15 rounds into the car of an unarmed black man and woman, killing them both. More than 70 people were arrested, disturbing the al fresco dining experience on East 4th Street.Unrest also followed the fatal police shooting in 2014 of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, an African-American who had a toy gun, and the officer who shot him was not charged with a crime.
Cleveland, a city of 390,000, has been revitalized in part by billions of dollars in infrastructure spending in recent years, but the black majority still lags behind.Black Lives Matter, the protest group formed after a series of police killings of African-Americans raised questions about justice in America, held a protest on Saturday in Public Square. It was entirely peaceful, with about 100 activists clapping to speeches.In between the civic protest and festival atmosphere, there are pockets of emptiness. Street closing and security cordons seem to have scared off customers at the Arcade, a late 1800s shopping mall that has been modernized. The ornate interior, illuminated by a skylight, is full of boutiques like Prosperity, which sells handcrafted art glass jewelry. Business is slow on a Saturday afternoon.""A lot of people are afraid to come downtown,"" said Cat Zurchin, one of the artist/storeowners, from an empty shop.   ""Some of these stores opened up just for the convention. Retail people have been excited, but we also have some anxiety. The Secret Service is everywhere.""
Black SUVs have invaded the city center as the U.S. Secret Service has taken charge of security. Concrete median barriers and the tall, anti-scaling fence circumscribe the city into impenetrable sectors.A column of police ride through the city center on bicycles, a dozen more on horseback. Helicopters clatter overhead. Cleveland police are trying to stay restrained, avoiding the militarized presence that has become common thanks to free war surplus equipment from the Pentagon.Even so, the city's courts are preparing to process up to 1,000 arrestees per day, ready to stay open 20 hours a day. 
Hospitals are bracing for the worst. The Cleveland Clinic, one of the largest hospitals in the country, will have 50 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel at the convention site and its entire staff on standby.If needed the hospital can take over an adjoining hotel and conference center, enabling it to handle 1,000 general trauma cases. The hospital is prepared to operate without reinforcements for 96 hours.""All boots on the ground,"" said Dr. Robert Willie, chief of medical operations.    Likewise, the Secret Service says it can handle the spotlight.""We are prepared,"" said Ronald Rowe, the agent in charge of the convention, ""and ready to welcome the world to Cleveland.""

By Kristina Cooke

In 1990, during a close and bitter congressional race, Mike Pence came under attack for using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses, including his mortgage and credit card bills.The expenditures were not illegal at the time, but proved difficult to explain for a candidate who had railed about the outsized role of money in politics.Pence in turn blasted his opponent with attack ads, including one featuring a man in traditional Arab clothing who thanked Pence's opponent in thickly accented English for policies that benefited Middle Eastern oil producers. The commercial was attacked by Arab-American groups, and the Indianapolis Star called it one of the two worst campaign commercials that year.Pence, who is now Indiana's governor and was selected this week to be Donald Trump's presidential running mate, lost his 1990 race, but what he regretted more than losing, he later said, was his decision to sling mud.In the 25 years since that loss, Pence's political allies and enemies alike say he has steered clear of personal attacks. This could prove challenging when campaigning with Trump, who enthusiastically tears into his rivals. Pence's style is likely to cast him in a very different role from that of traditional vice presidential candidates, who often throw and take punches to allow presidential contenders to remain above the fray.In the case of Trump and Pence, said Indianapolis University Professor Laura Merrifield Albright, the roles are likely to be reversed.""It's a different dynamic. It's tough to imagine anyone out-trumping Trump,"" she said, noting that he is ""willing to do his own dirty work.""Michael Totten, a retired architect who worked on Pence's 1990 campaign, thinks the two candidates will complement one another. He dubbed Pence ""the perfect No. 2,"" a running mate who can ""temper some of Trump's enthusiasm"" and ""be the calming voice."" Neither Pence nor the Trump campaign immediately responded to a request for comment.
'I REALLY SCREWED UP'
After losing his 1990 race, Pence apologized to his opponent for the oil advertisement. He later told his colleague at a conservative think tank, William Styring, that he regretted the tone of the campaign. ""I really screwed up on this. It's not me,"" Styring recalled Pence as saying. In 1991, Pence wrote an apologetic article for the think tank's policy journal, titled ""Confessions of a Negative Campaigner.""After the defeat, Pence did not seek public office again for a decade. He worked at the Indiana Policy Review and hosted his own statewide conservative radio talk show, describing himself as ""Rush Limbaugh on decaf."" He also hosted a morning TV show in Indianapolis from 1995 to 1999.
In 2000, Pence again ran for a U.S. House of Representatives seat, this time successfully. And he demonstrated that his 1990 mea culpa was more than just political theater, observers of Indiana politics say. His opponents in campaigns after he re-entered politics describe him as extremely disciplined and cordial.Melina Fox, Pence's Democratic challenger in 2002, said that his statements in the race were ""calculated and thought-out."" Democrat Barry Welsh, who ran against him in 2006, 2008 and 2010, said Pence was invariably ""polite, professional and gentlemanly."" But some question how he will cope with being constantly challenged in a hard-fought presidential race. ""He seems uncomfortable with difficult questions and does not take counterpunches very well,"" said Rebecca Pearcey, who ran the losing campaign of Pence's opponent in the 2012 race for Indiana governor, Democrat John Gregg. ""He doesn't engage. He operates as though the opponent is not there.""  INDIANA CONTROVERSY
Before being picked as Trump's running mate, Pence was poised for a tight rematch race against Gregg. In recent months, Pence's approval rating had fallen below 50 percent, in part because of controversy surrounding the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which held that ""a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion.""
Pence first alienated liberals and moderates by signing the bill into law. He then outraged the measure's evangelical supporters by endorsing changes to the law aimed at preventing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.The 2016 gubernatorial campaign had started to become more negative, with yard signs calling for Pence to be fired. The Republican Governors Association ran an independently produced ad that attacked his opponent's record. But Pence himself had not gone negative.At a Saturday morning event to formally introduce his running mate, Trump called Pence ""a man of honor,"" contrasting him with Hillary Clinton, whom he described as ""the embodiment of corruption.""It remains to be seen how aggressive Pence will be in campaigning for Trump in coming months - and whether he will stick to the principles outlined in his 1991 article on negative campaigning.""It is wrong, quite simply,"" he wrote at the time, ""to squander a candidate's priceless moment in history ... on partisan bickering."" In an interview with CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl that will air on ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday evening, Trump suggested he may not expect his running mate to go on the attack.  While discussing his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Trump told Stahl, ""I call her 'Crooked Hillary' ... but I don't think he should do it, because it's different for him.""

By Jonathan Allen and Ginger Gibson
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Saturday presented his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, as the man who can unify a fractured Republican party and help him bridge the gap created by the candidate's outsider status.In a wide-ranging speech in which he touted his own ""landslide"" victory in the Republican primaries, Trump cast Pence as a perfect complement for the White House: a veteran of government, a man with a Midwestern sensibility and strong Republican credentials as a job creator and budget balancer.  ""Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice, I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana,"" Trump said at an event in New York City. ""And one of the reasons is party unity, so many people have said, party unity. Because I'm an outsider,"" he added in explaining his decision.Trump and Pence made their debut just two days before the beginning of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where delegates from around the country will convene to officially nominate the pair as their party's ticket for the Nov. 8 election.Frequently straying from the notes on the lectern, Trump talked about himself and likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, often detouring from the purpose of the event: to introduce a little-known politician to the broader public.""Back to Mike Pence,"" Trump said, interrupting himself during a lengthy explanation about why evangelical voters support his candidacy. He then read a series of statistics highlighting the job growth in Indiana.    ""He looks very good,"" added the New York real estate mogul, who is known to comment openly on people's appearances.  Trump had a bit of a winding path to settle on Pence, a devout Christian and conservative. He postponed his planned Friday announcement after the deadly attack in Nice, France and saying he had not made his ""final, final decision,"" Trump privately had second thoughts on who to pick in late-night conversations on Thursday, said a Republican source familiar with the situation.
Trump had been annoyed that the element of surprise had been taken away by the leaking of Pence's name, the source added. Trump ended up announcing Pence as his running mate on Twitter on Friday. Saturday's event in a New York City hotel ballroom had few of the traditional hallmarks of what is arguably one of the most important decisions for a presidential candidate. Before it started, supporters listened to the Rolling Stones song ""You Can't Always Get What You Want,"" a tune in regular rotation at Trump events.There were no ""Trump Pence"" signs distributed to the crowd or adorning the room. The two appeared together on stage only briefly - each standing out of view while the other one spoke. On stage, they made scant eye contact and shook hands rather than raising arms together in the classic pose of running mates. Neither offered anecdotal stories about their private time together.      
'COME TOGETHER'
Pence, in sharp contrast to Trump, delivered a prepared speech, discussing the love of his wife and country and his adoration for Ronald Reagan. He gave a full-throated call to fellow Republicans to back Trump.""Lets come together as a party, as a people, as a movement, to make America great again and that day begins when Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States of America,"" Pence said.Trump has struggled to bridge the gap between himself and the establishment and conservative wings of the party. The drastically different styles highlighted Pence's ability to provide a complementing tone to the presidential ticket.    
It's unclear when the two will appear together again. Pence heads back to Indiana for a solo event on Saturday night, and the Trump campaign hasn't released a schedule for the convention that would include a joint appearance.The pair recorded an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" that is scheduled to air on Sunday night.        One of their big challenges will be to brook their policy differences in public. Pence gave a nod to that by saying ""strong Republican leadership can bring about real change.""Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a central theme of his campaign, while Pence has spoken in favor of trade agreements. In an appearance on Friday night on Fox News, Pence offered a moderated take on trade, saying he agrees with Trump that deals should be renegotiated. He also softened his vocal opposition to Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.     ""I am very supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States,"" Pence told conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity.Pence added that he supports Trump's call for building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND In an age of social media and sound bites, advocacy groups in Cleveland have turned to the old-fashioned medium of billboards to display messages during the Republican National Convention, from the serious to the ridiculous and shocking.Among them is an artist's fanciful rendering of Donald Trump about to kiss former rival Ted Cruz, a poke at a Republican Party platform that would limit gay rights, the sign's sponsor said. ""Love Trumps Hate. End Homophobia,"" reads the billboard featuring Trump and Cruz moving in for a lip-lock. Elsewhere in Cleveland, there are also chestnuts such as ""Don't Trust the Liberal Media,"" and the eternally contentious issue of abortion is the focus of another that says, ""How much time will we serve - when the RNC platform makes abortion illegal?""Some 50,000 visitors are expected in Cleveland for the convention that runs from Monday to Thursday. There Trump, who has selected Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate, is expected to officially accept the Republican nomination for president.
With so many party insiders, activists, lobbyists and reporters descending on Cleveland, political groups have chosen a direct path to their eyeballs.""Don't Trust the Liberal Media,"" paid for by the Media Research Center, stands beside a highway near the airport and is repeated at least twice more in central Cleveland, where the convention will take place.Six strategically placed signs around the city depict a group of women in a police-style lineup. The message, sponsored by the National Institute of Reproductive Health, which supports abortion rights, is intended to bring attention to recently passed state laws seeking to limit access to abortion. 
""We wanted to use the RNC to raise awareness with the public. We wanted to give the public the facts about what is happening and the laws on the books being quietly passed behind the scenes and the logical conclusion that those laws will put women in jail,"" said Andrea Miller, president of the institute.The Trump-Cruz makeout illustration resembles images of unstated political motives depicting Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that went up in Lithuania and another in Bristol, England, that showed Trump bussing British politician Boris Johnson. The Cleveland sign was paid for by Planting Peace, a group favoring equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. ""Planting Peace calls for the immediate change in the Republican Party platform with regard to our LGBT family and LGBT rights,"" said Aaron Jackson, president of the group. 
The 2016 Republican platform includes a plank called ""Preserving and Protecting Traditional Marriage"" that calls for marriage to be defined as ""a union between one man and one woman."" About half a mile (one km) east of the convention site is a fake advertisement for a company called ""Dick to Dick LLC"" that ends with the line, ""We're not going to live forever. So why should the earth?""The billboard sponsor's website (here) contains more satire including the bon mot, ""Need to buy a politician, the Media, or a law? Dick to Dick Executive Consulting is the website for you. If you are interested in buying God, please contact us for today's Market Price.""

By Daniel Trotta and Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Cleveland on Friday set up concrete traffic dividers and tall metal fences around next week's Republican National Convention site, measures meant to thwart an attacker like one in France who drove a truck into a crowd, killing more than 80 people.Security experts said police, the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies have viewed vehicles as a potential threat since early in their 18 months of planning for the convention where Donald Trump is due to be formally nominated for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The decision to erect the protective barriers was taken before Thursday night's attack in the French city of Nice. Ron Rowe, a high-ranking special agent with the Secret Service, told a news conference on Tuesday that some of the barriers would be going up that day. Much of the focus has been on stopping a car or truck bomb like those that struck New York's World Trade Center in 1993 and an Oklahoma City federal office building in 1995.    ""A vehicle-borne attack is always something you're concerned about,"" said Jason Porter, vice president for the central region of security provider Pinkerton, which is advising private sector clients on security around the convention.     Officials in Cleveland did not respond when asked whether the Nice attack had altered their security plans. The driver there, shot dead by police, was known to police for petty crimes but not for ties to Islamist militants.
PROTESTS EXPECTED
Thousands of people, including protesters against Trump, are expected to pack into Cleveland for the July 18-21 convention.
Cleveland has banned drones, limited the size of bags people can carry and on Friday removed opaque rubbish bins near the Quicken Loans Arena convention site, replacing them with wire frames holding clear plastic waste bags that make it more difficult to hide objects.A memorial to slain police officers was cordoned off, an apparent reaction to protests against high-profile killings of black men and youth by police in U.S. cities including St. Paul, Minnesota, Baltimore, New York and Cleveland.After last week's killing of five police officers in Dallas by an African American angry about police killings of black men, nearly half of America's 30 biggest cities issued directives to pair up police officers on calls to boost safety, according to a Reuters survey of police departments.
    T.J. Dow, a Cleveland city councilman for the neighborhood expected to see the bulk of protests, said the security plan was designed to be flexible.Dorothy Strauss, a 68-year-old retired customer service representative, acknowledged her fears in the face of the France attack while watching her granddaughters play in a sprinkler near the convention site.Were she a delegate, she would attend, Strauss said. ""On the flip side, I wouldn't come down here and hang out with my two granddaughters during the RNC."" (Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Howard Goller)"

By Steve Holland and Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump's choice of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate on Friday helped bolster support among some conservatives skeptical about his policies, a crucial step as he prepares to accept the party's nomination next week.Some conservatives who had fought against Trump's ascendancy in the Republican nominating race welcomed his announcement that he had picked Pence, a well-known social and evangelical conservative.The Club for Growth, a conservative economic group, had sharply criticized Trump's support for protectionist trade policies. On Friday, the group noted that as a member of the House of Representatives, Pence had been a strong voice for ""free markets and economic liberty"" at a time when the Republican leadership had been weak on these issues.""Today's news gives a similar hope that Mike Pence will be  effective in pulling the Republican ticket toward economic conservatism and limited government,"" the group said.Other conservatives were also heartened by Trump's VP pick, which the businessman announced in a tweet ahead of a joint appearance in his hometown of New York on Saturday.""Pence is a principled conservative, man of faith, and talented messenger for Republican ideas,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""His addition to the ticket will bring even more excitement to the voters who are eager to put a Republican in the White House and deny a third term for President Obama's liberal agenda.""Trump, 70, chose Pence, 57, over two politicians he considers friends and close advisers, former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, 73, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53.Pence is viewed as a safe choice for Trump. The Indiana governor's low-key demeanor is a contrast to that of the bombastic real estate developer. And he could take the fight to the Democrats in the months leading up to the Nov. 8 election without upstaging Trump.He and Trump will have to smooth over some policy differences. Pence has said he does not support trade protectionism or a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, two policies that are central to Trump's campaign message.
In his first public remarks after Trump announced his running mate, Pence appeared to soften his opposition to a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country after he called it  ""offensive and unconstitutional"" in a tweet last December.""I am very supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States,"" Pence told conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity.""We have no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people,"" Pence said, adding that he suspended a Syrian refugee program in Indiana after a shooting rampage last year in San Bernardino, California. Pence also said he ""absolutely"" backed Trump's promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to stem illegal immigration and make Mexico pay for it.
DEMOCRATS DERIDE 'DIVISIVE' CHOICE 
Trump said Pence had done a great job in Indiana and that of all the people he had interviewed for the job, ""there's nobody that agrees with me fully on everything.""Pence's selection was slammed by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign.""By picking Mike Pence as his running mate, Donald Trump has doubled down on some of his most disturbing beliefs by choosing an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families,"" said Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta.
Trump had faced a midday Friday deadline to announce Pence because the governor had to declare by then whether he would be on the ballot in his home state for re-election.Trump had postponed his announcement, which had been planned for Friday, out of respect for the victims in Nice, France. An attacker in a heavy truck drove into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing at least 84 people and injuring scores more in what President Francois Hollande called a terrorist act.Trump is set to be formally nominated as the party's candidate for the presidential election at the convention, which opens in Cleveland on Monday. Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists.The Republican National Committee expects the convention to draw 50,000 people to the Ohio city, whose population is about 390,000. U.S. authorities were preparing for the possibility of violence, whether from demonstrators or planned attacks.The Cleveland conclave and the Democratic Party Convention the following week in Philadelphia have been given the status of special national security event by the federal government for the first time, and security will be heightened, said Republican Party spokesman Sean Spicer.The Department of Homeland Security will send more than 3,000 personnel to each convention, Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Thursday, speaking before the Nice attack. No specific or credible threat to either gathering has been reported, he said. (Additional reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Mary Milliken)"

By Daniel Trotta
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND A handful of donors to the Republican National Convention have withdrawn pledges and fund-raising has stalled during Donald Trump's polarizing bid for the presidency, leading organizers to ask casino mogul Sheldon Adelson for an urgent donation.The Cleveland 2016 Host Committee said in a statement on Friday it had approached Adelson, a generous party benefactor, while also acknowledging its fund-raising has come to a virtual standstill, leaving a $6 million shortfall.""Negative publicity around our potential nominee resulted in a considerable number of pledges backing out from their commitments,"" the Host Committee said in a letter it sent to Adelson, according to the political news website Politico, which said it had obtained the letter.The Host Committee on Friday confirmed such a letter was sent to Adelson and his wife, Miriam Adelson, but it downgraded the withdrawn pledges from ""considerable"" to ""a handful."" It said the hastily sent original letter ""mischaracterized"" the status of some donations. Some companies identified in the letter as having backed out said on Friday they had never made such pledges.""Unfortunately, this letter (to Adelson) was not reviewed nor authorized by the Host Committee chairpersons, and it mischaracterized certain donations from individuals and corporations,"" the statement said.""Some of what were referred to as pledges were actually expectations based on pledges made to previous conventions, while a handful had been withdrawn from the Host Committee for 2016 Republican National Convention,"" it said.
The committee said it had apologized to the Adelsons' staff.Host Committee officials on Friday declined to comment beyond the official statement, leaving open the question of which donors reneged. Donations will be disclosed after the convention in U.S. Federal Election Commission filings.The statement, from Host Committee Chief Executive David Gilbert, also said the committee had raised $58.25 million to date, about $6 million short of its goal of $64 million to cover expenses for the four-day convention that starts Monday in Cleveland, where Trump is expected to receive the Republican presidential nomination.
A month ago, a committee spokeswoman said $57.5 million had been raised.The Politico report, citing the letter, said David Koch, like Adelson a wealthy donor to conservative causes, and Coca-Cola (COKE.O) each withdrew a pledge of $1 million. Koch and Coke representatives told the Wall Street Journal they never made such pledges. Coke previously said it donated $75,000 last year.Visa, cited in the letter as having backed out of a $100,000 pledge, said in a statement it never made a pledge.    
FedEx (FDX.N) and BP (BP.L) were named in the letter as withdrawing support but also told the Journal they had not made the stated commitments.Other marquee companies were also named but did not respond to Reuters queries after business hours on Friday. Representatives for the Adelsons could not immediately be reached for comment.Last month activists disturbed by Trump's campaign and led by the political arm of California-based advocacy group Color of Change launched an effort to try to shame companies into dropping sponsorships.It was unclear if that effort, which targeted more than 30 companies, had an impact.

RALEIGH, North Carolina On Election Day in 2014, Joetta Teal went to work at a polling station in Lumberton, North Carolina. Like all poll workers, she was required to stay until voting booths closed, so she decided to cast her own vote there.That was a mistake, she later discovered. What she didn't know was that under a 2013 state law she had to vote in the precinct where she lived. The polling station where she voted was not in her precinct, so her vote was not counted.    A Reuters review of Republican-backed changes to North Carolina's voting rules indicates as many as 29,000 votes might not be counted in this year's Nov. 8 presidential election if a federal appeals court upholds the 2013 law. Besides banning voters from voting outside their assigned precinct on Election Day, the law also prevents them from registering the same day they vote during the early voting period. The U.S. Justice Department says the law was designed to disproportionately affect minority groups, who are more likely to vote out of precinct and use same-day registration. Backers of the law deny this and say it will prevent voter fraud.The battleground state has a recent history of close races that have hinged on just a few thousand votes. Barack Obama, a Democrat, won North Carolina by just 14,177 votes in 2008. In 2012, Mitt Romney, a Republican, narrowly carried the state by a margin of just 2.04 percent.    Reuters reviewed state election board data showing the number of North Carolinians who made use of out-of-precinct voting and same-day registration in previous elections, including March's state nominating contest, or primary, when voters nominated their preferred presidential candidate.     The Reuters analysis includes some assumptions. For 29,000 votes to go uncounted on Nov. 8, North Carolinians would need to vote in the same numbers and in the same ways they have in previous elections, including the March primary.  In that primary, after a court temporarily ordered a stay on  the bans, 6,387 North Carolinians voted out of their assigned precinct and 22,501 registered the same day they voted.     The North Carolina Board of Elections did not respond to requests for comment on Reuters' findings.     North Carolina Senator Bob Rucho, a Republican who backed the law, declined to comment specifically on the findings but disputed the notion that the law suppressed votes, saying the increased turnout between the 2010 and 2014 elections shows it has not had a disparate impact on minority voters.""How can it show voter suppression when more black voters voted and more white voters voted, and there was more opportunity, and there are more black voters registered than there were before?""     Turnout between those elections did rise by 1.8 percentage points for black voters and by 1.1 percentage points for white voters, according to data the state election board entered as evidence in court.  Advocacy group Democracy North Carolina, however, said their poll monitors saw many people attempting to vote out of precinct in 2014 who were told by officials their ballots would not count, and as a result cast no vote. And it says 23,500 voters would have used same-day registration to vote in 2014 if it had not been banned, basing its findings on a review of election board data, hundreds of hotline calls, and the observations of more than 300 poll monitors.  North Carolina Board of Elections executive director Kim Strach said her office looked into claims of voters being turned away ""but generally did not find statewide evidence of it.""
LEGAL CHALLENGES
    The Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considering legal challenges to the law from the Justice Department and civil rights groups and citizens, is expected to issue a ruling in the next few weeks.North Carolina's Senate passed its new voting laws weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 in June 2013 to eliminate a requirement that nine states mostly in the South with a history of discrimination, including North Carolina, receive federal approval before changing election laws.Had that requirement been in place, ""it may have blocked the provisions now at issue,"" said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a non-profit legal defense fund.The Justice Department alleged a ""race-based purpose"" to the new law in a legal brief. Studies the department cited show that minority and low-income voters are more likely to use same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting because they are less likely to own a car or have flexible working hours. These voters are also more likely to vote for Democratic candidates. ""If you pick out precisely the way minority voters are engaging with the process, that's intentionally treating minority voters differently,"" Justin Levitt, who oversees the Justice Department's voting unit, said in an interview. 
    North Carolina state officials say the changes cut fraud by making it harder for people to cast multiple ballots or impersonate other voters.  The Justice Department said in court documents that voter fraud was ""virtually non-existent"" in the state.Rucho, the state senator, said while the law banned some voting methods and cut the early voting period from 17 to 10 days, it extended the hours during which voters could vote.    ""We opened up more locations for them to vote, more times to vote, more flexible times,"" said Rucho.FOUR-PERSON TEAM   
Teal, who is African American, was one of 14 North Carolina voters Reuters contacted whose votes were invalid in 2014 because of the law.    Ten of them, including Teal, did not realize their votes were not counted until informed by Reuters. One was told his vote would not count by a voter advocacy group, and the other three were told by poll workers that their ballots likely would not count.
In all, 1,390 ballots were rejected in the 2014 election because they were cast out of the voter's assigned precinct -- up from 49 rejected for the same reason in 2010, according to the Reuters review of provisional ballots.    ""If they could have just sent people letters and told them exactly where to go, that would have been helpful,"" Teal said. The North Carolina Board of Elections website has a tool for residents to look up their assigned precincts, but Teal did not know about it.This year she plans to vote early.In other developed democracies, ""the government takes a greater responsibility for ensuring that voter registration lists are kept up to date and accurate,"" said Tova Wang, senior fellow at the policy research group Demos.    The election board has been trying to educate North Carolinians about the ban on out-of-precinct voting through ads and a four-person voter outreach team that travels around the state to raise awareness about the changes, said Strach, the board's director.     ""We're telling people, go find out where you are, make sure you're showing up at the right precinct,"" Strach said.(Related stories: INSIGHT-Native Americans move to frontlines in battle over voting rightsINSIGHT-Thousands of voters in limbo after Kansas demands proof they're AmericanINSIGHT-Use it or lose it: Occasional Ohio voters may be shut out in November)     (Editing by Jason Szep and Ross Colvin)"
