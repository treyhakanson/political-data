U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Tuesday requested a recount in the close Kentucky presidential primary against front-runner Hillary Clinton, state election officials said on Tuesday.The recanvass will take place at all 120 county boards of election on Thursday, according to the Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Grimes.Clinton won Kentucky by just 1,924 votes, according to the unofficial totals posted on the secretary of state's elections page. She won Jefferson County, which includes Louisville and is the largest by far of the state's 120 counties, by nearly 10 times that amountIn his filing on Tuesday, Sanders requested a full check and recount of every voting machine and absentee ballot from all precincts in the counties, according to Grimes' website.
""My office is notifying all county boards of elections that Sen. Sanders has requested a recanvass, and we are reminding them of the laws and procedures to be followed,"" Grimes said in a statement.Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, narrowly defeated Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, in the May 17 presidential nominating contest in Kentucky, a state she had not been expected to win. 
A Sanders campaign representative said the recount request was important for the integrity of the Democratic presidential contest, in which Sanders is continuing to challenge Clinton despite her formidable lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination.""I think the point is just transparency, it's not just about Kentucky,"" Sanders aide Larry Cohen said on CNN. ""It's about trying to create a context, now and at the (Democratic) convention, that these primaries and caucuses need transparency, they need to be authentic, they need to build confidence among voters, particularly younger voters, that this is not rigged."" 
Sanders has generally drawn more support from young voters than Clinton. (Reporting by Steve Bittenbender and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Matt Spetalnick and Martin Petty
| HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam U.S. President Barack Obama chided Vietnam on political freedoms on Tuesday after critics of its communist-run government were prevented from meeting him in Hanoi, a discordant note on a trip otherwise steeped in amity between the former foes.Tens of thousands turned out to welcome Obama on the second leg of his visit, Ho Chi Minh City, which was called Saigon until April 1975 when North Vietnamese tanks rolled in to bring U.S.-backed South Vietnam under communist rule.Many in the crowds lining the streets chanted ""Obama, Obama,"" some held handwritten signs reading ""Obama, we love you,"" and one woman held a boy dressed in a Captain America costume, complete with shield.Underlining the importance of the growing economic ties between the countries, Obama held an open forum with young  entrepreneurs and laid out the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact between 12 Pacific Rim countries.The high point of his visit came on Monday, with an announcement that Washington was scrapping its embargo on the sale of lethal arms to Vietnam. That clears the biggest hurdle remaining between two countries drawn together by concern over China's military build-up.Critics said that by removing the ban, a vestige of the Vietnam War, Washington had put concerns about Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea first and given up a critical lever to press Hanoi for improvements in human rights.'FREEDOMS STILL A CONCERN'
One prominent intellectual, Nguyen Quang A, told Reuters that about 10 policemen had come to his house at 6:30 a.m. and put him in a car that was driven out of the capital until Obama was about to leave.An outspoken lawyer, Ha Huy Son, said he was also stopped from joining Obama's meeting with six other civil society leaders. Human Rights Watch said a journalist who was also invited had been arrested on Monday.
Quang A, a former IT entrepreneur, was one of more than 100 Vietnamese who tried to run as independents for last weekend's election to the parliament, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party. Almost all failed to get on the ballot.Before he was taken away, Quang A posted on Facebook a photograph of himself dressing for the meeting with Obama, with the message: ""Before going. May be intercepted, arrested. Advising so people know.""Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Obama noted that several activists had been blocked from meeting him and said this was an indication that, despite some ""modest"" legal reforms ""there are still folks who find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around issues that they care deeply about.""""There are still areas of significant concern in terms of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, accountability with respect to government,"" he said.U.S. officials said that lifting the arms embargo would make it easier for Washington to engage with Vietnam on such issues.
In Washington, members of the U.S. Congress, including Republicans as well as some of Obama's fellow Democrats, criticized the policy shift alongside about a dozen Vietnamese human rights activists.""This is the definition of a bad deal,"" Republican Representative Chris Smith said at a news conference. ""This is not smart diplomacy, it is surrender of U.S. interests and values.""Democratic Representative Adam Lowenthal said, ""I am very disappointed that we lost yet another opportunity to elicit any kind of commitment from the Vietnamese government on improving the human rights of the Vietnamese people."" TOUTING THE TPP

In a speech before leaving Hanoi, Obama stressed the importance of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, where China has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and harbors.""Big nations should not bully small ones. Disputes should be resolved peacefully,"" he said, without naming China, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea.China's Global Times, run by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, said the decision to lift the embargo showed a willingness to relax standards on human rights for the sake of containing China.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Ho Chi Minh City with Obama, told reporters that Washington's efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam were not aimed at China.""This is not about China. Nothing that we did here or (are) arguing here is focused on China. It is focused on the fastest-growing marketplace in the world,"" Kerry said. Obama interviewed three entrepreneurs at Ho Chi Minh City's ""Dreamplex,"" which hosts budget tech start-ups with support of angel investors and Silicon Valley funds. He also touted the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, especially for unlocking entrepreneurial innovation.Vietnam's manufacturing and export-led economy is seen as the biggest TPP beneficiary. Annual U.S.-Vietnam trade swelled to $45 billion last year from $450 million when ties were normalized. Washington is a big buyer of Vietnam's televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood.But the TPP, which would remove tariffs across a 12-nation bloc worth a combined $28 trillion of gross domestic product, is not a done deal. Opposition is expected in Washington amid concern about competition and a loss of U.S. jobs.

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton, seeking to dampen Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's growing appeal with working-class voters, on Tuesday accused him of having cheered on the 2008 housing market crash.Clinton's campaign released an ad with audio that the presumptive Republican nominee recorded in 2006 for his now-defunct Trump University venture. Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, in remarks on a ""bubble burst,"" said: ""I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy"" property and ""make a lot of money.""Clinton's campaign and her surrogates used the recording to argue that she would take better care of the U.S. economy. Clinton is seeking to blunt the inroads that Trump has been making with voters in crucial states such as Florida and Ohio.Trump defended his comments on Tuesday evening at a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, saying buying when the housing market was down showed smart dealmaking skills that he would bring to the White House.""I'm a businessman, that's what I'm supposed to do,"" Trump said. ""I feel badly for everybody. What am I going to do? I'm in business.""The New Yorker also impersonated Clinton on the campaign trail, who he said ""screams,"" and said other big names in business did similar deals as he did before the housing crisis.Trump has never held elected office and often touts his history as a businessman in response to accusations that he is unprepared to assume the presidency.Anti-Trump protestors and police clashed outside the Albuquerque convention center on Tuesday when protestors tried to storm the center, calling for an end to the Trump rally.
Albuquerque police said on Twitter that protestors threw rocks and bottles and a door to the facility appeared to have been hit with something. Police said the only arrests so far had been inside the rally, where Trump was interrupted multiple times by protestors. Opinion polls in key states show Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and Trump in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Nationally, Trump has been rising in polls to pull roughly even with Clinton.U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is a favorite of financial reformers, bashed Trump in prepared remarks released ahead of a speech in Washington on Tuesday. Trump's 2006 comments, she said, amounted to rooting for ""people to get thrown out on the street.""""The rest of us were horrified by the 2008 financial crisis,"" Warren said in the comments. ""But Donald Trump was drooling over the idea of a housing meltdown - because it meant he could buy up a bunch more property on the cheap.""
Warren also criticized Trump for saying in a Reuters interview last week that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, enacted in response to the crisis, made it hard for bankers to operate.""Let me find the world's smallest violin to play a sad, sad song,"" Warren said. ""Can Donald Trump even name three things that Dodd-Frank does? Seriously, someone ask him.""Trump did not directly respond to Warren's comments on Tuesday, but he called her a ""total failure"" as a U.S. senator during the rally.Clinton surrogates from Ohio and Florida held a conference call with reporters about Trump's housing statements. Her campaign hosted related events in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada, which will all be battlegrounds in November's general election.
""How could Trump possibly champion the collapse of the housing market and our economy?"" U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said on the call.Clinton is still fighting on two fronts as she seeks to wrap up her primary battle with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.Clinton and Sanders both campaigned on Tuesday in California, which is among six states holding Democratic nominating contests on June 7. California, the most populous U.S. state, has more Democratic delegates than any other state, and Sanders has invested heavily there.Clinton needs a solid win in California for a strong finish heading into her party's national convention in July and to dispel questions about whether she can unite the party after a drawn-out, increasingly bitter primary race.Clinton on Monday turned down an invitation by Fox News to debate Sanders in California despite having agreed previously to a May debate. Her campaign said Clinton's time would be better spent meeting directly with California voters. Sanders said her refusal was an insult to California voters.Sanders on Tuesday requested that the state of Kentucky review his loss there last week to Clinton by fewer than 2,000 votes. Kentucky's secretary of state, Alison Grimes, said in a statement that the state will recanvas the results at all 120 county boards of election.

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama plans a return visit to Elkhart, Indiana, next week, some seven years after going to the city on his first trip as president, to highlight economic progress there and across the United States, the White House said on Tuesday.The repeat visit to Concord High School on June 1 will feature a town hall hosted by broadcaster PBS, as Obama looks to burnish his legacy in the final year of his administration.Unemployment in Elkhart, a manufacturing center for recreational vehicles and band instruments, has fallen to 4.1 percent from 19.6 percent in 2009, according to a White House statement that also noted improvements in high school graduation  and mortgage foreclosure rates.
The White House also touted improved healthcare coverage in Indiana and nationally under Obama's signature Affordable Care Act. Obama said that in addition to economic progress already made, he planned to talk about the future.
""We still face some tough economic challenges, there's no doubt about it. And all of us have to make some very important decisions about where we go from here,"" he said in the statement.

By Jane Ross

 (Reprise Records corrects release date of next album to June 24 from June 17, last paragraph)By Jane RossNeil Young, a Canadian citizen, can't vote in the upcoming U.S. presidential election - but the 70-year-old rocker has plenty to say about it. In a video interview with Reuters ahead of the release of his new album ""Earth,"" the Grammy-award-winning singer-songwriter excused Donald Trump for using his music without asking his permission. Trump's use of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" during the Republican nominee's campaign launch raised heckles last June. Young's management company released a statement at the time saying that Trump was not authorized to use the song in the announcement of his presidential candidacy.Young now says he has nothing against Trump using his song. He just would have liked to have been asked.     ""The fact that I said I was for Bernie Sanders and then he didn't ask me to use 'Rockin' in the Free World' doesn't mean that he can't use it,"" said Young, who has long lived on a ranch in California. 
Young confirmed the Trump's campaign statement that the campaign had a license agreement with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for the right to play the recording.""He actually got a license to use it,"" Young said. ""I mean, he said he did and I believe him. So I got nothing against him. You know, once the music goes out, everybody can use it for anything. ""But if the artist who made it is saying you never spoke to them, if that means something to you, you probably will stop playing it. And it meant something to Donald and he stopped.""
Young says his support for Sanders in the election race was still strong, despite Hillary Clinton's lead in the contest for the Democratic nomination. ""He's the only one talking about the issues, about issues that matter to me, the issues on my mind - problems of corporate control of democracy and everything slipping away and not being able to have six major companies owning all the media in the United States,"" Young said. Young has retained his Canadian citizenship. Although becoming a U.S. citizen would allow him to vote in the country's November presidential election, he dismisses the notion. 
""Oh, that would be a big ruse. I'm a Canadian. There's nothing I can do about that,"" he said. But, he says, he will keep on talking politics, in his music and in public. ""I vote in my own way, by making a lot of noise. If you don't want to listen to me, fine. If you don't want to vote like I would, don't. But I still have a voice.""Young's latest album, featuring live recordings of songs from throughout his career, will be released on June 24 on Reprise Records.

By Letitia Stein

Opening statements in the ethics trial of Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard got underway on Tuesday in a political drama that could rattle the Republican Party controlling the state, where two other top party leaders are ensnared in separate scandals.The proceedings against Hubbard, a powerful Republican who faces 23 ethics violations, involve actions taken in office and while he was a state party chairman. Alabama's governor and chief judicial officer also face scrutiny in other matters. Governor Robert Bentley, a Republican, is under fire for his relationship with a former political advisor, prompting efforts to begin impeachment proceedings this spring.Bentley is among the state party leaders who could be called to testify in the Hubbard case, according to local media.Meanwhile, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended this month amid an ethics inquiry over his urging state probate judges not to grant marriage licenses to gay couples, despite a U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that legalized gay marriage last year.
Hubbard was indicted by a state grand jury in October 2014 on charges of using his elected office, along with his former post as chair of the state Republican Party, for personal gain. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing, describing his prosecution as politically motivated, local news outlets have reported. Hubbard's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.During opening arguments on Tuesday, state prosecutors said Hubbard used his powerful roles to send money to businesses that he had an interest in.
""He sees an opportunity and he takes it,"" state prosecutor Matt Hart, who oversees a special prosecutions division, told the courtroom, the Montgomery Advertiser reported.Hubbard's defense said it would show he had not committed the alleged felony crimes.
""They're not going to prove anything,"" said defense attorney Bill Baxley, according to the Advertiser newspaper.If convicted, Hubbard could see prison time and removal from office, local news outlets reported.The office of State Attorney General Luther Strange, a Republican, declined further comment, noting that the judge in the case has imposed an order restricting comments to media.

WASHINGTON A Congressional plan to help Puerto Rico shed billions of dollars in bad debt can win enough support to make its way to a vote in the House of Representatives, U.S. lawmakers who support the measure said on Tuesday.Under the rescue plan, an independent panel would erase some of Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt load that has crippled the island state already facing a 45 percent poverty rate and the Zika epidemic.U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, a Republican, has endorsed the fix and the fate of the measure could help define his tenure as party leader which began in October.But Ryan can rely on some Democrats who say the rescue will aid the ailing island even if some of the legislation's provisions are too punitive of Puerto Rico.""This is the only bill that will attract enough support from our colleagues on the Republican side to pass in a Congress they control,"" said Rep. Raul Grijalva, the leading Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.Grijalva of Arizona said he expects lawmakers will ratify the plan when they write the fine-print of the legislation at a hearing on Wednesday.
Rep. Rob Bishop, the panel's chairman, postponed a law-writing session in April because of opposition to the Puerto Rico rescue but on Tuesday he said he was hopeful.Ryan and Democratic leaders stress the aid plan for the
island means relief without federal spending though investors will see a cut in their Puerto Rican bond holdings and they are fighting for terms that could limit the hit to their portfolios.A leading voice for investors, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), on Tuesday backed the plan which expects Puerto Rico to control deficit spending.A Puerto Rico oversight panel, or control board, could veto Puerto Rico spending measures that it finds irresponsible and SIFMA endorsed such ""broad powers to enforce and monitor fiscal discipline.""
The oversight board would have the power to push creditors to accept a write-down of debt, even over the objections of holdout investors.The plan would also ask the oversight board to protect the interests of Puerto Rico pensioners who rely on a system that is now under funded by at least $40 billion.

By Gina Cherelus

A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that Ohio violated voters' rights in 2014 by cutting the number of days in which people were allowed to cast early ballots to 28 from 35.Judge Michael Watson of U.S. District Court in Columbus ordered Ohio to reinstate the 35-day period and also to grant residents a week-long opportunity to register and cast a ballot at the same time - a period known as ""Golden Week.""If the ruling stands, voters in Ohio will be able to vote a full 35 days before the general election on Nov. 8.
Watson said the earlier changes violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and were unconstitutional. Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature changed the system two years ago. The move was challenged by the state's chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union. 
The two groups argued that the limited opportunities for early voting directly affected minorities.
Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday: ""It is disappointing that a federal judge would again change the election rules after the current laws were upheld in the same federal district court by a settlement agreement we reached with the NAACP and the ACLU."" Husted said in a statement. The settlement between Husted and the organizations allowed residents to vote on multiple Sundays leading up to a presidential election and gave access to additional evening voting hours, according to ACLU documents. Husted said he plans to consult the leaders of the state Senate and state House of Representatives before deciding how to proceed."

The initial draft, I have some real problems with it,"" the Illinois lawmaker told reporters. He added that some other Democrats had also expressed strong reservations with the measure.Durbin said he was concerned that the bill that could move through the House would cut the minimum wage and overtime pay for some Puerto Ricans and fail to increase federal payments for Medicare and Medicaid, the healthcare programs for the elderly, poor and disabled, on the island.He also said there were deep concerns whether bondholders ought to be able to be paid back in full under any debt restructuring plans that would be overseen by a newly created oversight board at a time when social services are being cut on the island. Lawmakers are trying to enact a bill to prevent further economic and social chaos in Puerto Rico, where the government faces a July 1 debt payment of $1.9 billion.
The island, a territory of the United States, has a total debt of roughly $70 billion.The Republican chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee is hoping his panel votes by Wednesday to approve a Puerto Rico debt bill he negotiated with leading House Democrats and the Obama administration and send the measure to the full House for debate and passage.
