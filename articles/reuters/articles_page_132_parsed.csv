U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Monday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's remark that President Barack Obama founded Islamic State had increased threats to the physical safety of U.S. troops in Iraq.""Trump is already making our country less safe,"" Biden told a crowd at a joint Scranton, Pennsylvania, appearance with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

| YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio Republican Donald Trump said on Monday he would work closely with NATO allies to defeat Islamic State militants if he wins the White House, reversing an earlier threat that the United States might not meet its obligations to the Western military alliance.In a policy speech, Trump said he would wage a multi-front ""military, cyber and financial"" war against Islamic State, although it was not clear how that would differ from the Obama administration's fight with the jihadist group. ""We will also work closely with NATO on this new mission,"" said Trump, whose remarks about the defense organization earlier this summer drew heavy criticism from allies and even some of his fellow Republicans.Trump said a newly adopted approach to fighting terrorism by the organization had led him to change his mind and he no longer considered NATO obsolete. He was apparently referring to reports the alliance is moving toward creating an intelligence post in a bid to improve information sharing.   While Trump appeared to claim credit for prodding NATO to focus more on the threat of terrorism, the 28-nation alliance has been grappling with the issue for more than a decade. NATO invoked Article 5, its collective self-defense mechanism, for the first time in its history to offer support to the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Trump called for shutting down access to the internet and social media for those aligned with Islamic State, which holds territory in Syria and Iraq. But he said he did not want to detail military strategy because it would tip off potential foes.""We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we've faced at every age and before,"" Trump said, blaming his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, and President Barack Obama for aiding the rise of Islamic State.In a speech in the swing state of Ohio, Trump also said that in implementing his call for a temporary ban on Muslims immigrating to the country, he would institute ""extreme vetting"" and develop a new screening test to try to catch people who intend to do harm to the United States.As president, he said, he would ask the U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security to identify regions of the world that remain hostile to the United States and where normal screening might not be sufficient to catch those who pose a threat.
The Clinton campaign said Trump's plan to have immigrants submit to ideological tests was ""a cynical ploy to escape scrutiny of his outrageous proposal to ban an entire religion from our country and no one should fall for it.""Reading from a teleprompter, Trump said Clinton did not have the judgment and character to lead the country.""Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face,"" he said. Trump, a wealthy New York businessman whose volatile campaign has alienated some in the Republican establishment, faced a fresh rebuke on Monday as he falls behind Clinton in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election.The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial he should fix his campaign within weeks or step down. Echoing growing alarm about Trump's candidacy among many leading Republicans, the newspaper said Trump had failed to establish a competent campaign operation.
'STOP BLAMING EVERYONE ELSE'
""If they can't get Mr. Trump to change his act by Labor Day, the GOP will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the Senate and House and other down-ballot races,"" the newspaper said.Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 5 this year, marks the end of U.S. summer vacations and traditionally launches the final phase of the long U.S. election season. ""As for Mr. Trump, he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be president - or turn the nomination over to Mike Pence,"" it said, referring to the Indiana governor, who is Trump's vice presidential running mate.
Adding to Trump's woes this week was the news, first reported by The New York Times, that the name of his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia. Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement on Monday.   ""I have never received a single 'off-the-books cash payment' as falsely 'reported' by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia,"" he said. Artem Sytnik, the head of Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau, confirmed in a briefing with reporters that Manafort's name appeared on a ledger and that more than $12 million had been allocated as an expenditure, referencing Manafort.But Sytnik said the presence of Manafort's name ""does not mean that he definitely received this money.""The Clinton campaign said the news was evidence of ""more troubling connections between Donald Trump's team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine.""Trump has spoken favorably in the past of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last month, he invited Russian hackers to find ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time as secretary of state, when she used a private email server to conduct government business, although he later described that comment as sarcasm.   The current RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls puts Clinton 6.8 points ahead of Trump, at 47.8 percent to Trump's 41 percent. Polls also show Trump trailing in states such as Pennsylvania that are likely to be pivotal in the election.

By Ori Lewis
| JERUSALEM

JERUSALEM The Israeli branch of the U.S. Republican party began a campaign on Monday to get American voters living in Israel to cast absentee ballots in favor of Donald Trump.According to the Israeli chapter of the Republican party, around 300,000 Americans are eligible to vote in the November presidential elections. They live in Israel or in settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.Marc Zell, the head of Republicans Overseas Israel branch,  said the campaign aimed to rekindle interest in U.S. politics among second- and third-generation citizens, many of whom have children who will be eligible to vote for the first time.""We want to try to attract new voters who perhaps in the past had no special interest in voting in the U.S. elections,"" Zell told Reuters.
Tzvika Brot, who is heading the campaign, estimated that about three-quarters of American-Israelis would support the Republican party.A Democratic party representative in Israel disputed that estimate, telling Israel Radio the majority of Israeli and U.S. Jewish voters had always preferred the Democrats.A poll of Jewish Israelis conducted in May found 40 percent of respondents backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and 31 percent supported Trump. The poll didn't specify whether those who responded were eligible to vote in the U.S. election.
The pro-Trump drive opened at a shopping mall in the central Israeli town of Modiin and will focus on areas with high concentrations of American-Israelis. Brot said he hoped the new votes being sought might help tip the balance in swing states. Trump, who has accused the administration of President Barack Obama of lacklustre support for Israel, won his party's nomination for the presidency last month. He has rejected last year's nuclear deal with Iran and called for more investment in missile defense in Europe.
His views, including a vow to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and a proposal to impose a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country, have polarized the Republican party and caused widespread consternation.Trump has also been criticized for his lack of foreign policy knowledge. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said last month he would put at risk U.S. and world security with his ""politics of fear and isolation"".

By Ginger Gibson
| FAIRFIELD, Conn.

FAIRFIELD, Conn. U.S. Republican Donald Trump on Saturday repeated his attack on President Barack Obama that he helped ""found"" Islamic State and railed against media reports that his campaign is failing, at a campaign rally in Connecticut, a state where he has a long-shot of being victorious. Speaking for more than an hour in a sweltering room, Trump spent a significant portion of his speech complaining about the media.   He again threatened to revoke the press credentials of The New York Times. The credentials allow reporters access to press-only areas of his campaign events. He has already banned other outlets, including The Washington Post. On Saturday, the New York newspaper published an article detailing failed efforts to make Trump focus his campaign on the general election.""These are the most dishonest people,"" Trump said. ""Maybe we'll start thinking about taking their press credentials away from them.""     
Trump visiting Connecticut, a heavily Democratic state, raised eyebrows among many Republicans.""It's asinine that he would be in Connecticut holding a public rally less than 90 days before the election,"" said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. ""You don't see Hillary publicly campaigning in Idaho and Mississippi. I have to think this proves the candidate is running the campaign, which explains why it's such a disaster of biblical proportions.""At several points the crowd chanted ""lock her up,"" a frequent campaign rally chant in reference to Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
Trump told the crowd that normally he responds by saying he intends instead to defeat her in the Nov. 8 election, but this time added, ""You know what? You have a point!""Trump also dropped his recent efforts to say he was not being serious when he said Obama was the ""founder"" of the Islamic State militant group . ""It's the opinion of myself and a lot of people that he was the founder,"" Trump told the crowd.
Democrats and Republicans alike have criticized Trump's assertion as patently false.    Trump took a detour from attacking Clinton's economic record to discuss the 1998 scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky and former President Bill Clinton, whom Republicans attempted to impeach. ""Remember when he said, he did not have sex with that woman, and a couple of weeks later, oh you got me,"" Trump said, to cheers. He then made reference to a blue dress that became a symbol in the investigation. ""I'm so glad they kept that dress, so glad they kept that dress, because it shows what the hell they are.""

Senator Ben Sasse was in a fairly lonely place when he wrote on his Facebook page back in February that he could not support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.That is changing. Since Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, staked out his position, the ranks of Republican Trump critics in the U.S. Congress have grown, with the New York real estate mogul stirring almost constant turmoil within his party.The following are Republicans in Congress who have said they will not vote for Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election, followed by those who have said they are keeping their options open.WILL NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP
Senator Ben Sasse. Wrote in February he could not support Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Sasse wrote: ""Mr. Trump's relentless focus is on dividing Americans, and on tearing down rather than building back up this glorious nation.""Senator Lindsey Graham. A strong Trump critic, Graham sought the Republican presidential nomination, but drew little support. He has told reporters he may write in someone for president.Senator Mark Kirk. The Illinois lawmakers faces a tough battle for re-election and withdrew his endorsement of Trump in June, citing Trump's attacks on ""Hispanics, women and the disabled like me."" Kirk had a stroke in 2012 and uses a wheelchair. He told CNN on Aug. 10 that he will write in former Secretary of State Colin Powell for president.Senator Susan Collins. The Maine moderate said in a Washington Post opinion article on Aug. 8 that she will not vote for Trump or Clinton. She has said she may write in another candidate.Representative Carlos Curbelo. A Cuban-American from Florida, Curbelo was an early Trump critic. ""If the nominee is a fraud, and someone who's offensive, and incapable of being an effective president like Donald Trump, I won't support him,"" Curbelo told Reuters in February.Representative Justin Amash. A libertarian-leaning Michigan congressman, Amash says Trump's policies go in the wrong direction. ""I'm not voting for him,"" he told Reuters in March.
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. A Cuban-American whose south Florida district is next door to Curbelo's, Ros-Lehtinen said in May that she will not support Trump or Clinton.Representative Bob Dold. A longtime Trump critic from Illinois who plans to write someone in.Representative Adam Kinzinger. Another Illinoisan, Kinzinger told CNN on Aug. 3 he did not see how he could support Trump.Representative Charlie Dent. The Pennsylvanian said earlier this month he was not planning to vote for Trump or Clinton.
Representative Richard Hanna. On Aug. 2, Hanna, of New York state, became the first House Republican to say he will vote for Clinton. He is retiring from Congress at the end of this year.Representative Scott Rigell. A Virginian who is also retiring from Congress, Rigell said on Aug. 7 that he would vote for the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson.Representative Reid Ribble. The Wisconsinite already was blasting Trump last September, saying Trump was doing ""serious damage"" to the Republican brand and that he could not support him. Ribble is retiring from Congress.HAVE NOT ENDORSED

Some prominent lawmakers have not endorsed Trump, but will not say whether they will vote for him, leaving their options open.Senator Jeff Flake. The Arizona lawmaker on Aug. 9 said there was ""slim hope"" he could vote for Trump, and added Trump could not win the presidency unless he changes.Senator Pat Toomey. A Pennsylvanian in a tight re-election race, Toomey has not endorsed Trump and says he has not made a decision on what he will do.Senator Ted Cruz. A conservative Texan and former Trump rival for the Republican nomination, Cruz was booed at the Republican convention after he pointedly did not endorse Trump and urged delegates to ""vote your conscience.""Senator Mike Lee. A Cruz ally, the Utah senator says he has concerns about whether Trump is conservative enough. ""He has not endorsed and he has no plans to do so,"" a Lee spokesman said.Representative Mike Coffman. The Colorado lawmaker has not ruled out voting for Trump, but put out a television ad saying ""I don't care for him much.""Representative Fred Upton. From Michigan, he says he is not endorsing anyone and has not said for whom he will vote.

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A senior official with the Republican National Committee on Sunday played down the prospect that the party would cut off cash and logistical support to White House nominee Donald Trump in order to shift resources toward congressional races.Last week 70 Republicans wrote a letter urging the RNC to stop helping Trump and to focus instead on candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The letter, signed by former members both of Congress and RNC staff, said Trump's actions were ""divisive and dangerous"" and posed a threat to the party and the country. Sean Spicer, RNC communications director, said in a telephone interview that abandoning Trump with nearly three months to go to the Nov. 8 election ""doesn't make logical sense."" In October 1996 the RNC moved money from the presidential race to congressional candidates after Republican nominee Bob Dole fell far behind Democratic President Bill Clinton in opinion polls.
But Spicer said giving up on Trump could be harmful to other Republican candidates and there was still time for him to rebound in opinion polls against Democrat Hillary Clinton.""Number one, you need a strong top of the ticket. That's number one. Number two, we're only six points down,"" Spicer said, referring to the gap that Clinton has opened up against Trump in some national polls.Clinton led Trump by more than five percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.
Clinton has strong leads in hotly contested states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire and some polls show her within a few percentage points of Trump in some states such as Georgia that normally lean strongly Republican.Any discussions of cutting off funds to Trump in August would be ""ridiculous,"" Spicer said.
Trump has polarized the party with his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and his plan to impose a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country.Trump has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for a prolonged feud with the Muslim family of a fallen U.S. Army captain and his assertion last week that President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had co-founded the Islamic State militant group.

By Jonathan Allen

ALGONAC, MICH.--Parker Fox drifted out of the Donald Trump rally in a sort of euphoric daze, along with the thousands emptying into the parking lot alongside him. ""After leaving a Trump rally, you're very pro-Trump,"" he recalled a few weeks later, describing a noisy communion with people who understood that politics mattered, unlike some people he could name at his high school. ""It was so enthusiastic and so energetic you could feel it in your body. It gave you chills.""He'd barely had time to calm down when he learned through Facebook that his other favorite presidential candidate would also be passing through his quiet corner of eastern Michigan--Bernie Sanders. In fact, the U.S. senator from Vermont would be at the same community college the very next day. This thrilled Fox: his first presidential election as a voter--he was 18--and the two most crowd-whipping, pundit-defying, establishment-bucking candidates in the entire race were practically paying him personal visits.As it turned out, the residents of this part of Michigan were especially fond of the two men who had done the most to upend the 2016 presidential race. Both Sanders and Trump won the state, with Sanders' narrow win in the Democratic contest stupefying pollsters who had predicted a comfortable lead for Hillary Clinton. Both did especially well in St. Clair County, with double-digit victories over their rivals. And, down at the precinct level, they barnstormed Algonac, a town of about 4,056 people about an hour's drive from Detroit on a curve of the St. Clair River in the county's southern end corner, and neighboring Clay, home to another 9,066 or so, including Fox and his family. In some Algonac and Clay precincts, Sanders and Trump won more than two thirds of the votes. Residents have a needlessly unflattering nickname for Algonac: The Swamp, derived, apparently, from the reed marshes that engulf the town's edges and which are prettily dive-bombed by feeding birds and buzz with hidden insects.If Sanders and Trump were the two insurgents of 2016, then the Algonac Swamp must be a sort of encampment of their guerrilla foot soldiers. What might such a place be like, down in the trenches?An editor's working hypothesis was that a town full of Trump and Sanders fans might turn out to be the Angriest Town in America, and so that became our shorthand before my visit in April, only to be laughed at when I finally got the chance to broach the label with residents.Of course, no one can persist in a permanent state of anger, especially in an entire town. Contempt, on the other hand, can smolder indefinitely, and Algonac reeked of contempt: It would take longer than a week's visit to find someone here who does not think Washington is, on the whole, a besmirched place of selfish politicians in thrall to the powerful moneyed interests who keep them in office. Clinton, fairly or otherwise, is generally seen here as the very embodiment of this; Sanders and Trump the only possible saviors, Trump because he's never held elected office, and Sanders, despite his decades in Congress, because he is still viewed as a cranky outsider. Nonetheless, for a small minority, the idea of a President Trump sends them into a panic.Fox is young enough to have never had his heart broken by a politician, but he's heard his father, Jerry, go off at the dinner table enough times to pick up some of his parents' wariness.""He might get a lot of this because I work for the auto industry,"" said Jerry, who has a job at a nearby Chrysler truck factory and is a competitive walleye fisherman on the side. Father and son were sitting on couches in the family's comfy living room, with large windows looking out onto surrounding woods where deer and turkeys roam. Jerry had also been struggling over whether he preferred Trump or Sanders, and so had decided to let his politics-inhaling son make the call for him.""I've always heard dad saying, you know, 'There goes another plant to Mexico,'"" Fox said, doing an angry-dad voice, as Jerry gave a smiling ""it's true"" nod of recognition. And so Fox marveled to hear Trump lambast companies for moving production abroad, or Sanders' refrain that 60,000 factories have closed down in America since 2001. The rallies were like a Fox family dinner blown up to stadium size. COMPASSION VERSUS WALL-BUILDING
Should either candidate want to make a movie adaptation of their campaign speeches, they could do worse than to set it in Algonac and Clay: A few strip-mall businesses and a scattering of mostly two-story, middle-class homes, none too far from the teal waters of the St. Clair River, along which massive freighters creep carrying goods to and from Canada. To wander around Algonac, a predominantly Republican place, is to encounter familiar stump-speech lines made manifest. There's the town's old Chris-Craft power boat factory that made Algonac a proud little manufacturing hub until it closed in 1960, a hole that's never quite been filled or forgotten. Algonac falls within the gravitational pull of Detroit's Big Three automobile companies; the factories of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler are major employers, and families' fortunes are tied to international trade deals that both Trump and Sanders deride. Ford, in particular, has come under attack from Trump for expanding its manufacturing in Mexico. The only other language besides English on the signs at the nearest major airport, Detroit Metropolitan, is Japanese, viewed by some residents as an unnecessary concession to visiting Japanese automobile executives.When talk turns to immigration--Sanders in terms of compassion, Trump in terms of wall-building--people here are reminded of the U.S. Border Patrol officers they see boating up and down the Canadian border, which floats somewhere halfway across the St. Clair River. Both candidates decry what they say is the undue influence of American billionaires on politics. In Algonac, they tend to picture Manuel Moroun, a Detroit businessman, in the local version of this role. He proposed building a bridge that was widely opposed here, connecting the mainland to Harsens Island, a peaceful outpost of Clay Township, home to about 1,200 people and a couple of bald eagles and currently accessible only by a small, 12-car ferry. Regulators denied the $45 million plan in June.In some ways, voters have changed little since the 1980s, when pollster Stan Greenberg first visited neighboring Macomb County and announced that he had discovered the Reagan Democrat. The belief persists that the system is so rigged that politicians' largesse only flows to those much richer than you, or much poorer, leaving you to struggle unaided. The difference this time--and everyone agrees it's different this time--is that there were two viable-seeming chances to send a man to Washington who would be the very personification of your contempt. Some were voting for Trump only in his capacity as a stink bomb. 'MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE'""You guys know the story, I'm sure, of Jesus Christ in the temple, when he goes into the temple and he turns everything upside down,"" said Jay DeBoyer, the only person dressed in a suit on a weekday afternoon in Johnnie Lega's, a popular riverside Algonac dive bar filled with nautical-themed clutter. He worked behind the bar years ago when he was a student before becoming a salesman for a company that made trusses and other lumber products for the home-building industry. Now DeBoyer is the county clerk, whose job includes running elections here. He has a close-shaved head and silver goatee, his suit fits well, and he speaks in neat paragraphs of political analysis. He was evoking a rare moment in the Gospels, in which the normally sanguine Christ appears to get angry at the corrupting quality of money, as he explained why the county's primary results were more or less as he anticipated.""Now, we can argue from a Christian perspective, was that Christ-like? We can have that debate, that discussion. But for every circumstance there's a reaction and there's a resolution."" In his analogy, Christ was Trump, but Sanders, too, and also, in a sense, the voters themselves, newly awakened at the possibility of disruption. ""In these non-engaged individuals who are becoming engaged, they want him to go into the temple and turn the tables upside down,"" DeBoyer said. ""That means we need to shake it up. We need to come back to the people in control.""In DeBoyer's view, this may be the first election in which the so-called culture wars will not prove decisive. DeBoyer is a Republican, though he declined to say for whom he voted. He's pro-gun and opposes abortion, but is unfazed, for example, by Trump's difficulty in stating what his policy on abortion access would be. Most Trump voters he knows don't care if they only agree with ""two in 10 things"" that Trump says, according to DeBoyer. They just want a change. He described his family's finances to explain why.""I don't have a bunch of debt. I have a mortgage and a couple of car payments. I don't have a pension; I have to save in a 401k like everyone else. It's impossible for me to save enough money to pay for my kids to go to college."" He has a 13-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter, who is applying to Duke. ""Mathematically impossible. I live in a $125,000 house, I drive a Dodge pick-up truck and a Jeep, I don't have any credit card debt. None of that. And it's mathematically impossible for me to save enough for retirement and enough to send my kids to college. Household income of $100,000, with no debt. Do you understand how a person in my exact financial category gets sucked into that world, between those two? If I tend to lean to the left, I'm all in with Bernie Sanders. If I tend to lean right, I'm all in with Donald Trump. Frankly, even if he's wrong, what he's saying are the only options I have, the only hope I got.""Leaving Johnnie Lega's to head into Algonac proper, you pass by the taxidermy store of Paul Burczycki--a Trump supporter with qualms. He is angry with the government not least because his insurance payments went up with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. ""Trump's a tough guy to vote for,"" he said. ""He's a loose cannon. Maybe that's all part of his master plan.""
Further down the road, on the right, there's Peter Beauregard's Algonac Harbour Club on the right, a marina and restaurant on the spot of the old Chris-Craft factory.He's a Trump fan, too.""I'm a lifetime Republican who has been disenchanted like, I guess, a lot of people in our town, so I'm definitely for the outsider,"" Beauregard said, ""and I've upset several of my local colleagues who are Republicans. If you're a Republican you either love him or you hate him. There's nobody on the fence.""Life here revolves around the water. Almost as many driveways are graced by boats as cars. Garfield Wood, a pioneering boat builder and racer who once lived in Algonac, broke the water speed record in 1932, tearing along the St. Clair in a boat powered by airplane engines at 124.86 miles per hour. Chris-Craft made a landing craft used by the U.S. military in the D-Day invasion at Normandy, as well as mahogany-hulled powerboats that are still cherished by nostalgic collectors. The Michigan Senate is contemplating a bill that would recognize Clay Township, Algonac's neighbor, as ""the sturgeon angling capital"" of the state, and some residents think it will sail through committee.It's beautiful in the summer, residents say, with people boating in the sunshine and the restaurants busy with seasonal visitors. Nevertheless, multiple residents liked to efface the town using the same little shorthand list, as if they'd all memorized it from the same source: Algonac? It's three dollar stores, one grocery store, three pharmacies, and that's about it. About 97 percent of the residents are white, according to the last census, compared to 74 percent for the United States as a whole. Both Trump and Sanders have found their most reliable support among those in this racial group.It is only after several days in Algonac, at the annual American Indian Festival at the local high school, that I find someone willing to say she is a Clinton supporter, if in a limited sense. Ringed by chairs in the school gym, dancers moved to throbbing drums; fox furs, tribal jewelry and dreamcatchers were for sale at stalls around the gym's edge, many run by members of tribes from Walpole Island, just across the Canadian border.Susan Wrobel, the festival's organizer and a lifelong Algonac resident, runs a weekly community meeting where she teaches children Anishinaabemowin, the language of her Ojibwe tribe. She said elders there have been ""shaking their heads"" in wonder and fear that Trump could become president. ""I was very pleased whether it was Hillary or Bernie, I actually I like them both,"" she said. She had just bought some new earrings, which danced as she spoke. ""So I chose the Republican ticket to vote for my favorite Republican, and that was Kasich. I love Kasich. He's the only one that talked about doing something about the national debt, and I loved that. So I thought, well, the Democratic ticket's taken care of for me."" Michigan's primaries are open to all voters regardless of party affiliation, and strategic voting is common. A few days after this conversation, John Kasich, the Ohio governor, would drop out of the race. 'SAME OLD FACES'Once again, it was time for the Algonac-Clay Historical Society's monthly meeting. Some of the women at the society are particularly interested in the Victorian era and were making final arrangements for a forthcoming talk on Victorian hair fashions. ""Hats and tea cups are encouraged,"" noted the flyer. Trump struck them as unnecessarily crude.""I don't like the name calling,"" said Marilynn Genaw, who was in charge of ordering the strawberries they'd need for the tea. ""It's good manners not to say something derogatory about an individual."" She was still deciding on how to vote.
Joan Bulley, a former Algonac bank teller and the town's de facto historian-in-residence, could also do without Trump's brusqueness, but wonders if it points to an underlying virtue. ""One thing about Donald Trump is he tells it as it is,"" she said. ""I don't care for his rudeness, his insults, but he gets things done."" Sanders, she said, is at least ""a little bit more dignified"" in his speeches.She dislikes Clinton. ""She doesn't tell the truth. I don't like that.""Bulley's grievance with the federal government is that she has never quite forgiven it for transforming the city's waterfront under the ""urban renewal"" push of the 1960s and 1970s.""Urban renewal demolished our town"" she said. She pointed to an exhibit in the society's museum, a little hand-drawn map of the businesses that used to line a walkable, 19th-century main street on the riverfront: Koch's Jewelry Store, the Starlight Dance Pavilion, the Algonac Theatre. For the most part, those buildings were demolished and replaced with a pleasant, if quiet, boardwalk backed by tidy lawns, and, on the other side, the sort of boxy, parking-lot-fringed architecture that lures chain stores and franchise restaurants. She kept pointing at the exhibits. ""This was Henry's on the corner,"" she said, referring to one of her favorite restaurants. ""It's now a parking lot, which is stupid. If they would have saved some of these stores we would at least have something to attract people.""As the historical society meeting breaks up for homemade snacks and cake, I meet Bud Zeigler, 85, who spent 12 years sanding down Chris-Craft powerboats on the assembly line until the factory moved to Florida, taking some of his colleagues with it. Soon after, he ended up as a carpenter making Pontiacs at General Motors down the road, working there for 30 years until retirement. His complaint about the government is that it's always the same old faces in charge, who never seem to get things done.""I voted for Bernie Sanders,"" he said. ""I just wanted to break it up a little bit. Because everybody figures this one is favored, that one is favored, well, give the other guy a chance."" He chuckles a bit at this.""Somewhere along the line you've got to get somebody in there that maybe can change things a bit with a new thought in their head, without having the same ones always running for office, families running, you know?""Even in late April, there was little doubt that it'd be Clinton versus Trump come November. Trump thinks he can flip Michigan, a state that has reliably gone with theDemocratic presidential candidate for years, to support him. At the Schoolhouse Grille, a buzzing restaurant on Harsens Island, two women stepped outside at the end of the Saturday night dinner rush. Sheltering from the drizzle in an outdoor bar area, the two friends discussed how they would approach the polling booths in November.Kristin Bane, who owns the restaurant and was seeking to escape the kitchen's heat, is a Democrat who voted for Sanders. She likes Obama not least because she also spent part of her childhood in Hawaii, opposes fracking and thinks the government should spend more on education. Nancy Bryson, who came out for a smoke and whose family runs the island's ferry service to the mainland, most admires the two presidents Bush.""I enjoy listening to Bernie,"" Bryson said. ""I do. And I think that there are so many things that he's saying that I'm, 'You know what? I agree with you wholeheartedly. But I don't want the government to tell me that I have to do that. I don't want to be taxed to do that.'""
Bryson argued that Trump would help bring the country back to its founding principle. Bane was unconvinced.""How can we vote for a man who's proposing to build a wall that we have spent so many years breaking down in other countries?"" Bane said as Bryson lit a cigarette.""My grandfathers and my uncles have died because they were trying to break down walls in other countries so that we could live free--and we want to build one? That's the wrong message.""""OK, I disagree with you there but I love you,"" Bryson replied. Her mother was an immigrant, she explained, arriving at Ellis Island from Copenhagen as a 12-year-old girl. The barriers to immigration are higher than they were in the Ellis Island era, but Bryson said there was still no good reason to immigrate to the United States through anything but the legal channels.""I've been wanting to have this conversation for a long time,"" Bane said, without backing down on her point. ""It's good that we can do this and not get angry and stomp our feet about it.""They found common ground in their dislike for Clinton.""And Benghazi?"" Bryson said. ""I mean it's just unforgivable what happened there.""""I think she's a professional liar,"" Bane said.""I agree.""Still, for Bane, the idea of having to vote for someone other than Sanders in November left her anguished.""I could say, 'Oh, you know, change, yes change, I want change, and so Trump is the quickest way to a change in government.' I could tell myself that hopefully it's going to work out for the best. But I can't get past some of these issues like the wall, and I can't get past some of these issues like abortion. 'A woman should go to jail.' What the fuck?""It became apparent that Bryson was not aware that Trump has said he now opposes abortions. This new information was absorbed quickly.""Oh, he's going anti?"" she said. ""Well you know what, here's the bottom line, he's just trying to buy the Christian base.""Neither was surprised at how well Sanders and Trump had done in Michigan.""The common ground with them is change,"" Bane said.""Anti-establishment,"" Bryson said.""Here's how I feel,"" Bane said, in a sort of closing statement. ""I would hope that Bernie would get in at least to in to run against Trump. I have no time for Hillary Clinton. And when it comes down to it I more than likely will not vote for her. And if it comes down to her and Trump, even though I cringe and I think what's going to happen, I at least will have some hope of some kind of change. Something's going to shift if he gets in there. Something's got to give. And at least there would be that hope still attached to him. With her, I almost fear her. I think she's a dangerous woman. I think she's an extremely dangerous woman."" Again, she worried about Trump's wall and his position on abortion. ""A painful change is still change.""The two women smiled at each other and hugged and then hurried through the drizzle back into the restaurant.'BOTH OF MY GUYS WON'sFox and his parents were approaching November with less trepidation. After attending the Trump and Sanders rallies in quick succession, he made up his mind and informed his parents, who were similarly torn between the two, of his decision. Fox thinks women should be allowed to have abortions and that same-sex couples should be able to marry, views he attributes to his age, and here he felt he parted company with Trump.""I couldn't find anything with Bernie I disagree about. At all. And that's the reason. As simple as it gets."" Also, he said, ""it seemed like Trump didn't need my help,"" he said, which was part of his father's thinking, too. They would vote for Trump in November instead.Fox's mother, Tracy, came in from work and sat down in an armchair opposite her sons; her husband moved to sit at the floor by her feet. The family talked politics for another hour as the room darkened, illuminated only by a muted CNN flashing on the television.""Both of my guys won,"" Fox said with satisfaction, ""so that's cool.""This report first appeared in ""The American Voter,"" Reuters' special election issue.

By Steve Holland
| ALTOONA, Pa.

ALTOONA, Pa. Republican Donald Trump on Friday backed away from comments calling President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the founders of the militant group Islamic State, while the Republican Party sought to project unity behind their candidate.     A new poll showed Trump, whose unfiltered speaking style has repeatedly landed him in hot water, losing ground in three crucial states ahead of the Nov. 8 general election against Clinton.In a surprise appearance, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who in private expressed fury over some of Trump's actions earlier this month, introduced the candidate at a campaign event in Erie, Pennsylvania, and the two hugged onstage.""We're so honored to be working with Donald Trump and the campaign,"" Priebus told thousands of Trump supporters.""And don't believe the garbage you read. Let me tell you something. Donald Trump, the Republican Party, all of you, we're going to put him in the White House and save this country together.""Republican sources earlier this month said Priebus was furious over Trump's failure to endorse House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and his feud with the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. Trump did endorse Ryan a few days later.Trump brought Priebus on stage later at another rally, in Altoona, Pennsylvania, to thank him for the work he has done as he insisted there is great unity in the party.""I have to say we have great unification,"" Trump said.Trump on Friday told the rallies in Altoona and Erie that his remarks earlier this week calling Obama and Clinton the founders of ISIS, as Islamic State is also known, had been sarcastic.""I have been saying because it's true, but somewhat sarcastically, that he's the founder of ISIS and she's a close second,"" Trump said in Altoona.
Trump first made the unfounded claim on Wednesday and repeated it through the week.Trump claimed sarcasm in July as well after he was heavily criticized for inviting Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time as U.S. secretary of state.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released on Friday suggested support for Trump is eroding among voters in three battleground states.Such states are hotly contested because their populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and thus play a decisive role in presidential elections, which are ultimately decided by the state-by-state tally of the Electoral College.The poll found Clinton widening her lead in Colorado, Virginia and North Carolina, while holding her advantage in Florida. Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, painting the move as a sign of transparency that her campaign says Trump lacks.
U.S. presidential candidates are not required to release their tax returns, but it has become a common custom.Trump has cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service in refusing to release his returns. Trump also has said his taxes are no one's business and that they reveal little.Trump scheduled a speech in Warren, Ohio, on Monday that will focus on how he would handle the threat posed by Islamic State. Trump has said he would ""knock the hell out of ISIS,"" without offering details.Trump has been mired in repeated controversies in recent days. He drew heavy criticism after he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her.Nearly one-fifth of registered Republicans now want Trump to drop out of the race for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.
Republicans frequently trace the birth of Islamic State to the Obama administration's decision to withdraw the last U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011.But many analysts argue its roots lie in the decision of George W. Bush's Republican administration to invade Iraq in 2003 without a plan to fill the vacuum created by Saddam Hussein's ouster. It was Bush's administration that negotiated the 2009 agreement that called for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011.At his Erie event, Trump seemed to acknowledge he is facing a formidable opponent in Clinton as well as a difficult electoral path.""The Republicans have a tougher path - not my fault,"" he said.He said Clinton's campaign is smart to keep her out of the spotlight.""She doesn't talk to reporters very often. ... She doesn't expose what's going on up here, which isn't good,"" he said, meaning her brain. ""She's doesn't expose her mind to questions. What they want to do is try to fake it through.""Trump also said in Altoona that the only way he could lose Pennsylvania to Clinton is if ""cheating goes on.""He said he wants authorities to monitor the voting closely. ""I know what's happening here, folks. She can't beat what's happening here.""

By John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Saturday she has been flooded with ""obscene and sick"" calls and text messages after a hacker linked to Russia posted personal contact information online for her and hundreds of other Democratic lawmakers and aides.Pelosi sent a letter to colleagues warning them to take precautions and said she was changing her phone number after a hacker identified as ""Guccifer 2.0"" posted the personal cellphone numbers and email addresses on Friday. The posted information appeared to have been gained in the electronic breach of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fundraising and campaign arm of Democrats in the House of Representatives.Other Democratic campaign groups, including the Democratic National Committee, also were targeted by the cyber attack, which was made public late last month.""On a personal note, I was in the air flying from Florida to California when the news broke. Upon landing, I have received scores of mostly obscene and sick calls, voicemails and text messages,"" Pelosi told her colleagues, urging them to keep their phones and incoming text messages away from their family members and children.
""This is a sad course of events, not only for us, but more importantly for our country,"" said Pelosi, who earlier in the week blamed Russia for the cyber attack and called it an ""electronic Watergate"" akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters that ultimately brought down Republican President Richard Nixon.John Ramsey, the House's chief information security officer, sent a memo to lawmakers and aides whose information had been made public urging them to change passwords for all their accounts and to consider changing their non-House email addresses.He said the hacker had uploaded a spreadsheet with a mix of House and personal email addresses and cellphone numbers for ""nearly every"" House Democrat and ""an assorted number of Republicans,"" and similar information for hundreds of staffers.
""Along with the Excel file, 'Guccifer 2.0' uploaded documents that included the account names and passwords for an assortment of subscription services used by the DCCC. Initial analysis identifies some members' home addresses, along with their spouse's name, marital status, and religion,"" the memo said.U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Guccifer 2.0 is an individual or group operating with or for the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. Russia has denied involvement in the breach.The potential Russian involvement in the cyber attack has ignited a fierce campaign debate, with Democrats accusing the Russians of trying to aid Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
But U.S. officials suspect the operation and others directed at the DNC and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign were more likely an attempt to pursue email chains into classified networks or in search of national security policy information than to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. election.""The Russian assumption probably is that it doesn't matter much who wins the election, because Wall Street and other powerful lobbies really run the country,"" one of the officials said on Saturday, speaking like the others on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments.""The old Soviet belief hasn't faded completely when it comes to foreign policy,"" the official said.

By Amanda Becker and Susan Heavey
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns. They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.""Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency,"" Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. ""In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.""It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so. Clinton's tax returns have been made public, in some form, every year since 1977.Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns. Trump also has said his taxes are no one's business and that they reveal little.""Your move,"" Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
The Trump campaign dismissed Clinton's action, saying in a statement: ""This document release is nothing more than an attempt at distraction and misdirection"" from controversy about her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit.On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
RETURNS SHOW BUSINESS TIES
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.    Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes. On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.""He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns,"" she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election. Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent. President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns. Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is ""afraid"" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters. Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007. The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages. Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.
