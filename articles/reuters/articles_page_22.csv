MOSCOW Russia is ready to work on improving bilateral relations win the United States after Donald Trump won presidential elections, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday.Speaking at a weekly briefing, Zakharova said that it was premature to expect more specific steps in improving relations with the U.S. as Trump is yet to form his own team.

By Howard Schneider

CHARLOTTE, North Carolina - Donald Trump's promise to revive small town America faces a tough challenge in an economy that for decades has been wired to direct income and opportunities toward urban hubs and the better educated.Little in the president-elect's so far sketchy economic plans indicates the trend can be reversed any time soon, according to interviews with experts on income inequality and  recent occupational trends.The manufacturing jobs Trump pledges to bring back have disappeared as much because of automation as the trade deals he has promised to rewrite, and that process will only continue. A promised infrastructure revamp would boost middle wage jobs but for only as long as the programs last, economists point out.During President Barack Obama's eight years in office incomes for the best off continued to diverge, despite nearly 10 million new jobs and recent strength in those paying middle-tier wages.On a pre-tax basis, the share of income to the top fifth of households increased from 50.4 percent to 51.4 percent between 2008 and 2015 at the expense of all the others, according to census estimates. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2elimH2)Without the sort of tax and redistribution policies Republicans have traditionally opposed, Trump may struggle to make good on his promise to help those left behind in the global economy, economists who study inequality trends say. ""We have 30 to 40 years to catch up on...Lots of money has gone to the top and to change that is going to be a long and slow process,"" said David Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank with close ties to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign. Trump campaigned promising to shake up a Washington establishment he argued was responsible for destroying middle class jobs with bad trade deals. The message hit home across rural America and mid-sized cities, where voters felt they missed out on the fruits of the seven-year economic recovery that big cities may have enjoyed.Charlotte has been growing fast as a financial hub that attracts college educated talent from around the country, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did better there than Obama did in 2012, handily beating Trump by 137,000 votes.
But in the state's textile and furniture belt just northwest from here, Trump's promise of economic renewal and anxieties of a shrinking white majority more than offset Clinton's urban victory, giving him 76 out of 100 North Carolina's counties.The Catawaba County region, one of the nation's hardest-hit by cheap imports from China, now has a more diverse economy and even the furniture industry has begun adding jobs. But many still live in poverty and rely on disability and social services for support.""The trade argument was as prominent as any. That is certainly the bet that the Trump campaign has made,"" said     John Dinan, a political scientist at Wake Forest University.
TAKING OUT OBAMACARE
Trump has not highlighted income inequality the way Clinton did, but to help low-wage industries such as textiles or offer a ""new deal"" for blacks, he would need to tackle the income gap.Recent data show how hard it may be if Trump relies on economic growth alone: Despite a record jump in household income and a continued surge in middle wage jobs nationally, the effect on income inequality was ""statistically insignificant"" according to census estimates.Under Obama, after tax income for the bottom fifth of households did increase by about 18 percent, or $2,200, according to a recent Council of Economic Advisers study.
But that was made possible by higher taxes on the wealthy, more benefits for the poor and, in large part, by an estimated $1,900 gain from health coverage extended under the Affordable Care Act. Trump has vowed to roll Obamacare back.Instead, Trump has proposed to strike better trade deals and offered a familiar Republican recipe - tax cuts for businesses meant to spur investment and jobs. He has been ambiguous about a possible increase in the federal minimum wage typically opposed by Republicans, but advocated by many economists as a way to help the disenfranchised workers Trump focused on in his campaign.Economists say that even if economic growth accelerates under Trump, it may not do much to counter the downward pressures on wages and middle income jobs from automation, technology and other longstanding trends.Brookings Institution senior fellow Isabel V. Sawhill said researchers on inequality agree on one point: it is hard to move the needle.""Even when you distribute all of the dividends from growth in a progressive fashion you don't change things very much,"" Sawhill said. ""You shift things at the margin."" (Correct paragraph 2 to remove extraneous word.) (Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by David Chance and Tomasz Janowski)"

By Julia Edwards Ainsley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans in the House of Representatives hope to offer President-elect Donald Trump an alternate plan to his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, a first test by lawmakers from his own party of one of his key campaign promises.Just a day after Trump's stunning election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, congressional aides told Reuters the lawmakers wanted to meet with Trump's advisers to discuss a less costly option to his ""big, beautiful, powerful wall.""The plan would involve more border fencing and additional border staffing with federal agents, many of whom belong to labor unions that supported Trump's candidacy, the aides said.Double layers of fencing would be extended along parts of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border, rather than constructing a brick-and-mortar wall, according to the proposal.A House Republican aide and a Department of Homeland Security official said a wall was not realistic because it would block visibility for border agents and cut through rugged terrain, as well as bodies of water and private land.The House aide said House Republicans working on the alternative plan were waiting for Trump's transition team to be put in place before setting a date for the meeting.
A spokesman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers' proposal or their desired meeting. Mexico said on Wednesday that it would not pay for a border wall, as Trump has pledged.Immigration was a central feature of the Trump campaign, focusing on concerns among some voters about illegal immigrants and perceptions they take jobs and pose security risks. 
Before the Republican convention in July, party platform committee members successfully petitioned delegates to add language about the proposed wall to the platform statement. But U.S. Republican Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has called a wall along the entire border a ""knee-jerk"" reaction and has not mentioned the idea in legislation on Capitol Hill. If Congress stands up to Trump, his wall may end up being a fence extension, said Steve Legomsky, professor emeritus and immigration law expert at Washington University School of Law.
""Congress won't fund the kind of wall Trump promised, and Mexico won't pay for it. But to save face, President Trump and congressional leaders will likely agree to a modest extension of the existing border fence,"" Legomsky predicted.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Wednesday that border security was an important agenda item that he wanted to achieve ""in whatever way is the most effective.""The National Border Patrol Council, a union representing border agents, said the agency had already had a difficult time meeting hiring goals mandated by Congress.

By David Henry and Olivia Oran
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Wall Street power brokers may have rolled their eyes in private when ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Steven Mnuchin agreed to be Donald Trump's national finance chairman, but now they are lining up to meet him.Financial lobbyists and their bosses are hoping that Mnuchin and others Trump has enlisted as advisers will help convey their views and act as interpreters of the president-elect's so far at times confusing messages.""This is different from a lot of elections in the past where you could say, 'If so-and-so wins, this will be good for that industry and bad for that one,'"" said Scott Bok, chief executive of investment bank Greenhill & Co Inc.""It's not like Trump laid out a clear set of policies where you can say, 'This is good for these types of companies and bad for those.'""Bankers and their lobbyists are hoping their path to influence will become clearer in the coming weeks with Trump's cabinet appointments.""It is a matter now of getting to the people who are coming in and convincing them of the benefits of some moderate deregulation to foster economic growth,"" said one industry executive, who declined to speak publicly about Trump.During the presidential campaign, many people on Wall Street had supported his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton viewing her as a pragmatist and a stabilizing force.   Despite castigating hedge fund managers for ""getting away with murder"" on their taxes and making a vague pledge to strip big banks of their profitable trading arms, Trump has surrounded himself with financiers including Mnuchin and hedge fund firm bosses John Paulson and Anthony Scaramucci.At the time some of their peers thought they were taking an opportunistic punt as they viewed Trump as unpredictable and populist and were vexed by his snipes at the industry.Six months later, government-relations executives for big banks are scrambling to secure meetings with them as well as key staffers on Capitol Hill's important financial committees, in hopes they can provide a sympathetic ear for the industry.
""That work begins immediately,"" said one industry lobbyist who was not authorized to speak publicly.Trump's lack of political experience and his scattershot pronouncements have made him a wild card for big business, making private contacts with his inner circle especially critical.    On bank regulation, Trump has promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and implement a new, possibly tougher one, but offered few details on what it would look like.SEC APPOINTMENTS
Although Trump's outsider status helped him win, he has turned to some well-known Washington insiders when looking to fill vacancies at U.S. financial regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Former Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who founded and heads the regulatory consulting firm Patomak Global Partners LLC, is leading the transition team for financial regulation, according to a person familiar with the matter.Come January, Trump is expected to designate SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar as acting chair. It is unclear if Trump will make the role permanent or later tap someone new.SEC Chair Mary Jo White, an independent appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013, is expected to leave the agency when Obama's term is over.Mnuchin is seen as the likely pick for Treasury Secretary. He did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.KBW policy analyst Brian Gardner predicts Vice President-elect Mike Pence will have a major influence on who gets appointed to key roles, and will choose ""orthodox Republicans"" who are equally familiar as some others in Trump's circle.
In an emailed statement, Scaramucci said Trump's reputation for unpredictability was undeserved.""While spending time with President-elect Trump during the campaign I got to know a very analytical and compassionate person,"" Scaramucci, founder and a co-managing partner of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, said. Several policy experts predicted Trump and the new Congress will water down some financial reform rules, such as the Durbin amendment that limits bank fees or the Volcker rule against proprietary trading. They uniformly expect diminished power, if not a gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.But the Trump administration may also propose regulations that are more problematic, such as extremely high capital requirements or a revival of the Depression-era Glass Steagall law that broke up big banks.Mnuchin, however, was cited by many as a ray of hope.Although he has not publicly expressed opinions on financial regulation or fiscal policy, bankers and lobbyists said they felt reassured by his experience on Wall Street.""I can't imagine that his goal would be to destroy Goldman Sachs,"" said the industry executive, ""which is better than some.""

By Steve Holland
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK President-elect Donald Trump's early list of potential appointments to top positions appears to reward people who were loyal to him after a campaign in which many Republican Party leaders kept their distance.Jeff Sessions, an Alabama senator who was one of Trump's most fervent supporters in the U.S. Congress, is said to be under consideration for a prominent role, perhaps defense secretary, sources familiar with transition planning said on Wednesday.    Retired General Michael Flynn emerged as a possible pick for Trump's national security adviser, the sources said.Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, played a prominent role during the campaign, often serving as an introductory speaker at campaign rallies and has provided private counsel on foreign affairs.""He has a calming influence on Trump,"" said a source familiar with transition planning.    In addition, former House of Representatives Newt Gingrich and U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee were also considered potential selections for secretary of state, the sources said. Corker chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Both Corker and Gingrich had been under discussion as potential vice presidential picks for Trump, a position that eventually went to Indiana Governor Mike Pence.These same sources said Republican National Committee Reince Priebus, who has emerged as a trusted adviser to the New York businessman, was being talked about as a potential White House chief of staff.A Priebus deputy, RNC senior strategist Sean Spicer, was a possibility for White House press secretary.
Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who helped bring about a more disciplined approach to the candidate, was seen as potential White House senior adviser.Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who endorsed Trump after dropping out of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination fight, was a possible education secretary.Richard Grenell, a former spokesman for the United States at the United Nations, was a potential U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as was New York Republican Representative Peter King.
Mike Rogers, a former chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, was in the mix for CIA director, the sources said.Trump's transition team set up a website (www.greatagain.gov/) and Twitter account (@transition2017), promising to keep the country posted on plans, Politico reported. Trump was a prolific user of Twitter during the campaign, sometimes using it to deliver pithy put-downs of his critics and rivals. (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"

By Steve Holland and John Whitesides

Republican Donald Trump put aside the celebrations and focused on Wednesday on his 73-day transition to the White House as rival Hillary Clinton promised to bury the bitterness of their long presidential race and work to unify a divided country.After Trump's stunning upset of the heavily favored Clinton, Democratic President Barack Obama and leading figures in the Republican Party who had struggled to make peace with Trump all vowed to move past the campaign ugliness.""Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead,"" Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said in a concession speech in New York, joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and daughter Chelsea.While her loss was painful ""and it will be for a long time,"" she had offered to work with Trump as he prepares to begin his four-year term on Jan. 20, Clinton told supporters.A wealthy New York real estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to win Tuesday's election against Clinton. A former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, Clinton also ran for president in 2008.Obama, who campaigned hard against Trump, invited him to the White House for a meeting on Thursday after a brutal night for the Democratic Party, which also fell short of recapturing majorities in both chambers of Congress.""We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country,"" Obama said at the White House, adding he and his staff would work with Trump to ensure a successful transition. ""We are not Democrats first, we are not Republicans first, we are Americans first.""But reflecting the bitterness of a long election campaign that often focused more on character than on policy, scattered anti-Trump protests broke out across the country, including in New York and Chicago, with demonstrators denouncing Trump's campaign rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and other groups.Thousands of protesters thronged Midtown Manhattan and marched toward Trump Tower on Wednesday evening, while at a park farther downtown, hundreds of people shouted: ""Not my president."" In Chicago, thousands gathered outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower downtown while chanting phrases like ""No Trump! No KKK! No racist USA.""Trump and his senior aides met at Trump Tower in New York  to begin the transition. ""They are hunkered down in meetings, plotting the next steps, the transition, the first 100 days, key staff positions,"" said a source close to Trump's campaign.Potential choices for his administration included Republican figures who eagerly supported Trump even when he faced opprobrium from other senior Republicans.Possible names included Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer as White House spokesman, U.S. Senators Jeff Sessions and Bob Corker in possible roles as secretary of state or defense secretary, and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich as secretary of state, a source close to the campaign said.Trump will enjoy Republican majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress that could help him implement his legislative agenda and appoint a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy created by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.In the Senate, Democrats secured a second gain on Wednesday, when Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte conceded defeat in New Hampshire to challenger Maggie Hassan, the state's Democratic governor. But the Republicans retained their majority.""Now, Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government and we will work hand-in-hand on a positive agenda to tackle this country's big challenges,"" House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who had a strained relationship with Trump, told reporters, saying Trump had earned a mandate in the election.
TRUMP PRIORITIES
In an Oct. 25 Reuters interview, Trump said his top priorities when he took office would be building stronger borders, repealing Obama's national healthcare plan, aiding military veterans and working to create more jobs.In his victory speech early on Wednesday, he also promised to embark on a project to rebuild American infrastructure and to double U.S. economic growth.Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday that repealing the healthcare plan known as Obamacare would be a ""pretty high item"" on the agenda. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that she spoke to Trump about passing a ""robust"" jobs bill.Worried that a Trump victory could cause economic and global uncertainty, investors initially fled stocks worldwide, but Wall Street made a dramatic turnaround and the U.S. dollar hit its highest level against the Japanese yen in nearly four months. The Mexican peso recouped some losses after falling to a record low. The currency has been vulnerable to Trump's threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and to tax money sent home by migrants to pay to build a border wall.Speaking to cheering supporters after his victory, Trump said it was time to heal divisions. ""It is time for us to come together as one united people,"" Trump said. ""I will be president for all Americans,"" he said, praising Clinton for her service.His comments departed sharply from his campaign rhetoric in which he repeatedly branded Clinton as ""Crooked Hillary"" amid supporters' chants of ""lock her up.""
Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, did not rule out on Wednesday the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton's past conduct, a threat Trump made in an election debate last month.Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House hoped the tradition of not using the criminal justice system to exact revenge on political opponents would continue under Trump.Senior House Republican Jason Chaffetz plans to continue investigating Clinton's use of a private rather than government email server while she was secretary of state, a Chaffetz aide said. FBI Director James Comey has said a year-long probe by the agency into the setup revealed nothing to merit criminal charges.    Despite losing the state-by-state electoral battle that determines the U.S. presidency, Clinton narrowly led Trump in the nationwide popular vote, according to U.S. media tallies.Fueling his upset win was Trump's avid support among white non-college educated workers. He ran up big leads in rural areas, beating Clinton by 27 percentage points among voters outside of urban areas, a Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll found.While Clinton, 69, won Hispanics and black and young voters, she did not win those groups by greater margins than Obama did in 2012. Younger blacks did not support Clinton like they did Obama. She won eight of 10 black voters between the ages of 35 and 54. Obama won almost 100 percent of those voters in 2012.At 70, Trump will be the oldest first-term U.S. president. The presidency will be Trump's first elected office, and it remains to be seen how he will work with Congress. During the campaign, Trump was the target of sharp disapproval, not just from Democrats but from many in his own party.
GOOD NEWS FOR RUSSIA 
Foreign leaders pledged to work with Trump, but some officials expressed alarm the vote could mark the end of an era in which Washington promoted democratic values and was seen by its allies as a guarantor of peace.During the campaign, Trump expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioned central tenets of the NATO military alliance and suggested that Japan and South Korea should develop nuclear weapons to shoulder their own defense burden.Russia and Putin appeared to be winners from Trump's victory. Defying years of U.S. foreign policy orthodoxy, the Republican had promised much warmer relations with Moscow, despite Russia's intervention in the Syrian civil war and its seizure of Ukraine's Crimea region. Russia's parliament erupted in applause after a lawmaker announced that Trump had been elected, and Putin told foreign ambassadors he was ready to fully restore ties with Washington.Russia is hoping that improved relations could yield an elusive prize: the lifting or easing of sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union to punish Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sparred with Obama, spoke by phone to Trump, who proposed they meet ""at the first opportunity,"" Netanyahu's office said. Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing and Washington shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity.Iran urged Trump to stay committed to the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers, which Trump has sharply criticized. Several authoritarian and right-wing leaders hailed Trump's victory.Other officials abroad, some with senior roles in government, took the unusual step of denouncing the outcome, calling it a worrying signal for liberal democracy and tolerance in the world.""Trump is the pioneer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist international movement. He is also a warning for us,"" German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said in an interview with the Funke newspaper group.U.S. neighbor Mexico was pitched into deep uncertainty by the victory for Trump, who has often accused it of stealing U.S. jobs and sending criminals across the U.S. border.Trump campaigned on a pledge to take the country on a more isolationist, protectionist ""America First"" path. He wants to rewrite international trade deals to reduce trade deficits and has taken positions that raise the possibility of damaging relations with America's most trusted allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

This will finance new construction and modernization for K-12 and charter schools and community colleges, according to semi-official election results on the California Secretary of State's website.""Passage of Proposition 51 is credit positive for school districts with approved, but unfunded capital projects under the state School Facility Program, which is depleted,"" Lori Trevino, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, wrote in a research note on Wednesday.With 195 bond measures totaling $41.7 billion, California issuers accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total par amount of debt on ballots nationwide.California's voters rejected Proposition 53, a proposal to rein in debt by requiring statewide voter approval for revenue bonds exceeding $2 billion for projects financed, owned or managed by the state.The rejection removes a hurdle standing in the way of projects such as the $14.9 billion California Water Fix project for upgrading its water infrastructure.
""It assures that the state's water policymakers will have the tools necessary to implement the California Water Fix, although they still face an uphill battle to secure the full approval and financial backing necessary to implement the plan,"" Shannon Groff, Fitch Ratings director of U.S. Public Finance, said in a statement.As for tax measures, California voters passed a 12-year extension of a temporary state personal income tax increase on earnings of $250,000 or more and a cigarette tax hike.Voters in 35 states weighed 154 state-wide measures, including bonds and taxes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which posted results on its website.Montana voters said no to creating a biomedical research authority funded by $200 million of bonds over 10 years.

WASHINGTON U.S. intelligence agencies will soon begin giving President-elect Donald Trump the same top secret national security briefings they give President Barack Obama, current and former intelligence officials said Wednesday.The briefings by veteran career intelligence analysts, which will begin in the next few days, will include some of the government's most closely-guarded secrets, including details of undercover espionage operations and classified intelligence collection methods, including the National Security Agency's controversial eavesdropping operations, the officials said.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which will be in charge of Trump's briefings, had no immediate comment.""I'm certain the intelligence agencies will approach these briefings with absolute professionalism,"" said John McLaughlin, a former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency who participated in presidential briefings.

By David Lawder
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday dashed any remaining hopes that President Barack Obama's signature Pacific-Rim trade deal would come up for a vote before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.""It's certainly not going to be brought up this year,"" McConnell said of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) at a news briefing in Washington.McConnell said any decisions on TPP or other future trade agreements would be up to Trump, who would still have the authority for four more years to negotiate ""better deals"" with expedited approval procedures in Congress.Trump excoriated TPP on the campaign trail as a ""disaster"" and ""a rape of our country,"" tapping into populist anger at globalization, trade and manufacturing job losses that helped propel his candidacy.In an opinion piece published on Monday, Trump advisers Peter Navarro and Alexander Gray reiterated his opposition to major trade deals.  
""Trump will never again sacrifice the U.S. economy on the altar of foreign policy by entering into bad trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, allowing China into the World Trade Organization, and passing the proposed TPP,"" Navarro and Gray wrote in Foreign Policy magazine. ""These deals only weaken our manufacturing base and ability to defend ourselves and our allies."" The Obama administration has been promoting TPP among lawmakers and industry groups in anticipation of a long-shot, post-election vote despite opposition to the deal by Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.While there are many Republican supporters of free trade and TPP in Congress, McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday they were now focused on laying the groundwork with Trump to pass Republican-focused healthcare and tax reform legislation next year.
A spokeswoman for Ryan said he had not had a change of heart since he said on a radio talk show in October that the House would not bring TPP up for a vote because of problems with several provisions and insufficient support in the House.McConnell said his priorities for the post-election ""lame-duck"" session were passing a government funding extension and medical innovation legislation.White House spokesman Josh Earnest was still trying to sell the TPP agreement in a news briefing on Wednesday.
""President Obama does continue to believe that this is the best opportunity that the Congress has to take advantage of the benefits of a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that cuts taxes, 18,000 taxes, that other countries impose on American products,"" Earnest told reporters. ""We've got a strong case to make.""But the strong vote for Trump in industrial states made it unlikely Republicans would be willing to go against him on trade policy, analysts said.""It's fair to say that TPP is now in the dustbin of history,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade think tank in Washington. ""I don't see a path forward for the United States to join."" (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Leslie Adler and Peter Cooney)"
