By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives nominated Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday for re-election to his post next year, as lawmakers giddy with election success smoothed over their differences and pledged to unite behind Republican President-elect Donald Trump.Ryan, who faced no challengers from Republican ranks, was nominated in a unanimous voice vote in a closed-door meeting of all Republican lawmakers in the House. He will face an election in January, when all members of the new House, both majority Republicans and minority Democrats, vote on a new speaker.While January's outcome is not guaranteed, Republicans who had been feuding with each other and Trump before the election said Tuesday they thought Ryan was in a solid position to be re-elected speaker now that intra-party tensions have dramatically lessened with the Republican election victory.""Politics is politics, but this is as unified as I've ever seen it,"" said New York Republican Representative Peter King, who has been in Congress since 1993.Republicans kept their majorities in both the House and Senate in the Nov. 8 elections in which voters elected Trump to the White House over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Ryan, 46, had criticized Trump numerous times during the campaign, which angered some of Trump's supporters in the Republican caucus. Had Trump lost the election, these Republicans and some conservatives who already had doubts about Ryan might have sought to blame him and block his re-election.But lawmakers said Trump's election, along with a stronger-than-expected performance at the polls by House Republicans, changed the outlook.
""To suggest that President-elect Trump's victory didn't weigh as a factor in terms of the speaker's race would be disingenuous"" said Representative Mark Meadows, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus.However, one conservative lawmaker, Representative Raul Labrador, continued to express skepticism about Ryan ahead of Tuesday's vote, and said he would not consider Tuesday's outcome binding on his vote in January.""I haven't heard from him what he wants to change -- what's going to be different the next two years than the last two years?"" Labrador asked reporters.
Ryan, for his part, said House Republicans would be working ""hand in glove"" with Trump. ""We're going to do everything we can to help him be as successful as he can,"" Ryan told reporters ahead of Tuesday's vote.Republicans also re-elected three other lawmakers to leadership positions: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, and the chairwoman of the Republican conference, Cathy McMorris Rodgers.

By Lisa Lambert
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican lawmakers told the top U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday they are concerned her agency will rush out new rules in the final weeks that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, holds the Oval Office.The chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, who has been mentioned as a possible Treasury secretary under Republican President-elect Donald Trump, said ""whenever there is a transfer of power from one presidential administration to another, there is a temptation for federal agencies to rush pending rulemakings to completion, as a way of cementing the policy priorities of the outgoing administration.""""I would strongly urge you to respect the results of last week's election and resist the temptation to finalize any regulations, including Dodd-Frank ... regulations,"" added Hensarling during a hearing on the Securities and Exchange Commission.SEC Chair Mary Jo White was the hearing's sole witness. On Monday she announced she will leave her post when Obama's term ends in January, a decision made before Trump's stunning election win.She told the committee firmly there would be no surprise rulemakings or ramming pending rules through to completion. ""I don't see any last-minute rushes. I do intend to carry out the agenda I outlined in February 2016 as much as I can,"" she said.
""I don't think any rulemaking benefits from it being rushed. It's hard to do it right,"" she also said. Nonetheless, White would not commit when asked about a proposed multi-agency rule for clawing back compensation from executives who have committed wrongdoing.The SEC and fellow major financial regulators must approve the rule for it to become final, and the lawmakers pressed White to not bring it up for a commission vote while she is still chair. 
White said she could not predict what will happen in the next 2-1/2 months, or what will be included in the final draft of the rule.To continue carrying out its agenda announced earlier this year, the SEC will focus on capital segregation rules, an outstanding derivatives rule, and a staff recommendation on mutual fund disclosure, White said.The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law is considered one of Obama's signature domestic achievements, and federal agencies have furiously put in place new regulations and systems to carry out its many moving parts.
Trump has said he would repeal parts of the law, and he is expected to use legislation Hensarling drafted as a blueprint for his plans.Only half a dozen Democrats attended Tuesday's hearing, primarily asking about corporate board diversity and the Wells Fargo ghost account scandal, or blasting Trump.White, an independent, has been criticized by both parties. Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren recently called on Obama to fire her, and progressives say she slowed down implementing Dodd-Frank. White said the SEC has completed 80 percent of the rulemakings required by Dodd-Frank. She added that she would not want to see parts of the law, including the Volcker rule restricting banks from making speculative investments, rescinded in the future.

By Jennifer Ablan and David Lawder
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Longtime Donald Trump supporter and activist investor Carl Icahn confirmed on Tuesday that the president-elect is looking at Wall Street veteran Steven Mnuchin as his choice for treasury secretary and billionaire Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary. ""Spoke to @realDonaldTrump. Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices,"" Icahn wrote on Twitter. Icahn, a close ally of Trump who was often praised by the Republican during the presidential campaign for his business acumen, also tweeted that both Mnuchin and Ross were friends and ""two of the smartest people I know.""Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Trump's campaign finance manager, has been considered a front-runner for the Treasury post for much of the past week since Trump's stunning election victory.Mnuchin's inclusion in Trump's campaign team was questioned at the time by Stephen Bannon, now Trump's chief White House strategist. In an interview on Breitbart News, Bannon asked Trump whether the then presidential candidate was ""selling out to Wall Street"". The list to head the Treasury Department has also included JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon and Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Hensarling has said he would prefer to focus on a revamp of financial regulation, while Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has denied interest in the job in the past.        Ross, a billionaire investor, is a part of Trump's economic advisory team. Calls to Ross were not immediately returned.
INTO THE TOWER
Mnuchin walked through the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan on Tuesday morning. He would not comment on personnel decisions but said the Trump team is ""making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan. So a lot of exciting things in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency.""With Republicans retaining majorities in Congress, Trump will have a clearer shot at enacting major tax cut and reform legislation and rolling back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law passed in the wake of the financial crisis.
The new treasury secretary would play a key role in crafting such legislation, as well as managing potential new debt issuance of as much as $1 trillion if Congress agrees to Trump's proposed infrastructure spending program.With such high stakes, Wall Street is more focused on the selection of the next treasury chief than it was during President Barack Obama's choices for the post.""This time will be different,"" Gregory Peters, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income, said Tuesday at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. ""That role takes on greater importance.""    
Unlike current Secretary Jacob Lew, who is viewed investors to have taken a lower profile focused largely on international issues over the past year, the next Treasury secretary is expected to be a featured player in articulating and executing the Trump administration's new economic policies and initiatives.    A figure such as Mnuchin, with Wall Street experience, might be seen as better equipped to manage the relationship between Treasury and the banks that facilitate U.S. debt issuance. The last Wall Street insider to serve in the post was Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO appointed by George W. Bush and whose term was dominated by the bank bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis.Mnuchin, whose father was also a Goldman Sachs partner,  worked at the investment bank for nearly two decades starting in the mid-1980s, a time when Wall Street was developing major financial innovations including new securitization techniques and collateralized debt obligations -- instruments that would later contribute to the financial crisis.In 2009, he led a group of investors that purchased the assets of failed California-based mortgage lender IndyMac, for $1.55 billion that included a loss-sharing deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. After rehabilitating the operation and rebranding it as OneWest Bank, they sold it in 2014 for $3.4 billion to CIT Group Inc for $3.4 billion.

By Richard Valdmanis
| BOSTON

BOSTON Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, who has spent more than $140 million on fighting climate change, said on Tuesday he will spend whatever it takes to fight President-elect Donald Trump's pro-drilling and anti-regulation agenda.The former hedge fund manager from California is putting together a strategy that will ""engage voters and citizens to fight back"" once Trump takes the White House in January, he told Reuters in an interview. However, he stressed he was not planning to fight Trump through the courts.Instead, he would focus on ""trying to present an opposite point of view and trying to get that point of view expressed, and communicated to citizens.""Steyer's pledge to fight Trump suggests an intensifying battle for U.S. public opinion on global climate change, an issue that has already divided many Americans, lawmakers, and companies between those who consider it a major global threat and those who doubt its existence.Other U.S. environmental groups are also preparing to resist Trump's agenda, with some vowing street protests and more established organizations that helped draft some of President Barack Obama's environmental regulations preparing to defend them in court.""We have always been willing to do whatever is necessary,"" Steyer said, when asked how much money he was willing to spend to oppose Trump's agenda.Trump campaigned on a promise to drastically reduce environmental regulation and ease permitting for infrastructure, moves he said would breathe life into an oil and gas industry ailing from low prices, without harming U.S. air and water quality. 
He has also called climate change a hoax and has promised to ""cancel"" the Paris Climate Accord between nearly 200 nations to slow global warming, a deal he said would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage.While the approach has cheered the industry, it has sent shockwaves through the environmental movement, which is confronting the prospect of losing all progress it made during the Obama administration.Steyer, who had endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, called Trump's policies dangerous.""Every single one of these things, whether it was getting rid of Paris or cutting back the EPA, we think are extremely dangerous to the security of every American,"" Steyer said. ""We think it is based on willful ignorance of the facts and flies in the face of the realities facing the world.""
ARCTIC DRILLING
Steyer's main political vehicle, NextGen Climate, on Tuesday called on the Obama administration to defy Trump's pro-drilling agenda by issuing an order permanently blocking all new drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Trump has also promised to ask Canadian oil pipeline company, TransCanada Corp, to resubmit its application to build a pipeline into the United States that would link Alberta's vast oil sands to American refineries and ports on the Gulf Coast. The project, Keystone XL, had been rejected by the Obama administration after years of mass protests and lobbying by environmental organizations.Steyer said the project may no longer make sense since a slump in oil prices has reduced the profitability of oil sands production.Steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co-founded to devote himself full-time to environmental activism, said young voter turnout in areas where NextGen focused its mobilization efforts during the 2016 campaign was up more than 20 percent from the last presidential election in 2012.""Did we get the president we want, absolutely not. Did we get a majority of clean energy supporters in the senate, no,"" Steyer said. ""But in terms of what we did, and the strategy we took, we wouldn't do anything differently."" NextGen poured nearly $69 million into its elections related programs during the presidential campaign, according to federal records compiled by OpenSecrets.org, slightly lower than the $74 million it spent during the mid-term congressional elections in 2014, when only two of the six candidates it supported won.

By Warren Strobel and John Walcott

 (Corrects this Nov. 14 to clarify details of Bolton's recess appointment, paragraph 8.)By Warren Strobel and John WalcottWASHINGTON Despite his professed opposition to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, President-elect Donald Trump is considering several of the major advocates of that war for top national security posts in his administration, according to Republican officials.Among those who could find places on Trump's team are former top State Department official John Bolton and ex-CIA Director James Woolsey. Both men championed the Iraq invasion, which many analysts have called one of the major U.S. foreign policy debacles of modern times.Also involved in transition planning for Trump's presidency is Frederick Fleitz, a top aide to Bolton who earlier worked at the CIA unit that validated much of the flawed intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs.Although it is impossible to predict how a Trump foreign policy might evolve, one U.S. official who has served in Iraq said advocates of the 2003 invasion might be more inclined to commit additional U.S. forces to the fight against Islamic State there, despite the absence of a status of forces agreement that protects Americans from Iraqi legal action.Paul Pillar, the top U.S. intelligence official for the Near East from 2000 to 2005, said that because Trump had little foreign policy experience and had given conflicting accounts of what policies he would pursue, the Republican president-elect's senior personnel appointments would be crucial.""What we're seeing going on - and we should be worried about it - is a new president who on so many foreign policy issues has been all over the map,"" said Pillar, now at Georgetown University. ""Thus, the senior appointments game that we go through every four years has more consequences than it usually does.""  
Bolton, who is under consideration as Trump's secretary of state, the officials said, and Woolsey, reported to be in the running for U.S. director of national intelligence, did not respond to requests for comment. The Trump transition team also did not immediately respond when asked for comment.Even if Bolton is nominated, Senate confirmation is not a foregone conclusion. In 2005, Senate Democrats - with the support of a single Republican - blocked a vote to confirm him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He was appointed to that post by Republican President George W. Bush while the Senate was in recess.NEOCONSERVATIVE REVIVAL?

Fleitz, in a brief phone conversation, confirmed he was involved in Trump's transition effort, but declined further comment. A return to power for the three officials would represent a change of fortune for them and other ""neoconservatives"" who provided the intellectual backing for the invasion of Iraq. During the presidential campaign, some leading neoconservatives and Republican foreign policy veterans opposed Trump, saying he was unfit to lead.The group saw its clout wane in Bush's second term, as U.S. troops in Iraq found themselves mired in a sectarian civil war, and has watched from the sidelines during Democratic President Barack Obama's eight years in power.Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he opposed the invasion of Iraq, in which more than 4,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died, and which led to the creation of al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner to the violent, ultra-hardline Islamic State group.
Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and ties to al Qaeda, used to justify the invasion, proved to be nonexistent. ""As you know, for years I've been saying: 'Don't go into Iraq.' They went into Iraq. They destabilized the Middle East. It was a big mistake,"" Trump said in August 2015 on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program.His account that he always opposed the war was challenged during the campaign by Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who cited a 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern in which he replied: ""Yeah I guess so"" when asked if he supported invading Iraq.Consideration of Bolton, Woolsey and others is ""another demonstration of how those who supported one of the biggest mistakes in American foreign policy have not been - they don't seem to be sufficiently discredited to be removed from the Washington foreign policy dialogue,"" Pillar said.

By David Ingram
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK This is not the kind of wall Donald Trump was talking about.In the liberal stronghold of New York City, residents distraught over the incoming Republican administration were finding solace a week after the U.S. presidential election by placing handwritten, anonymous notes on the walls of a busy subway station.On Tuesday, many notes offered support to immigrants or mocked Trump's promise to build a wall along the United States-Mexico border and have Mexico pay for it.""A better wall,"" read one sticky note.""This is the wall that love can build,"" read another. Titled ""Subway Therapy,"" the installation lining the underground walls beneath Manhattan's Union Square was the idea of artist Matthew ""Levee"" Chavez.
""The last couple days have been stressful and I wanted to provide people with an opportunity to engage in a small and easy way,"" he wrote in the magazine Quartz.Anyone can post a note, and more than 10,000 people have, Chavez wrote on Instagram. Democrat Hillary Clinton bested Trump 79 percent to 18 percent in New York City. 
Writers of the sticky notes took varied approaches. Some pledged political action, saying ""Vote in 2018"" and ""I will do my part to change this!""A blue sticky note quotes novelist Zadie Smith on the subject of despair, and a pink one quotes Jesus' Sermon on the Mount: ""Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.""New York's Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, struck a pro-immigrant message, posting a note with lines from the Emma Lazarus poem that appear on the Statue of Liberty: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free... I lift my lamp beside the golden door.""
The defiant stance expressed in the notes is the right message for New Yorkers to send, said waitress Caitlin Cherry, 28, as she paused to look at them.""I'm happy that people who are visiting can see that not all Americans want this,"" she said.In a separate sign of protest, three apartment buildings on Manhattan's Upper West Side are dropping the name Trump Place and will be known by their addresses, the trade publication Real Deal reported, citing an email to tenants from landlord Equity Residential.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi agreed on Tuesday to postpone the party's leadership elections until Nov. 30 amid discontent among some rank-and-file Democrats over her leadership style, according to sources familiar with closed-door discussions.Democrats in the House of Representatives now are scheduled to vote on Nov. 30 on whether to renew Pelosi's long-held position as Democratic leader for another two years. Other Democratic house leadership jobs also will be up for a vote.No other Democrat has come forward to challenge Pelosi, although at least one is weighing what likely would be an uphill bid to dethrone the liberal California Democrat.House Democrats gathered behind closed doors to assess what went wrong in the Nov. 8 elections that swept Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump into power and allowed Republicans to retain their majorities in both houses, although slightly smaller ones than in the past two years.One senior House Democratic aide described Tuesday's meeting as being unusually contentious as members grappled with how the Democratic Party should rebuild following last week's election losses, with some wanting new blood in leadership.""After every single election cycle, she (Pelosi) says things are going to change"" in how she interacts with the caucus, the aide said characterizing lawmakers' concerns. ""But then, she doesn't do anything different. It's the same inside circle"" surrounding her.Democratic aides and a lawmaker said Pelosi made the announcement on the new date for party elections ""after protracted discussion"" in the meeting. The elections had been expected to take place on Thursday in preparation for Congress convening on Jan. 3.""We've been through hell,"" Pelosi told lawmakers, according to a Democratic aide who was in the room but spoke on condition of anonymity. ""And it's only going to get worse as he (Trump) makes his appointments and we have this fight. But we have to see it as an opportunity.""
DISMAYED DEMOCRATS
Pelosi, who has been the House Democrats' leader for 14 years and speaker of the House part of that time, said she did not care when the election was.""I do care that we have the strongest possible leadership at the table, whoever that may be,"" she said.
Representative Seth Moulton and other Democrats dismayed by the national election results had urged Pelosi to postpone the leadership vote.""As we begin the 115th Congress, House Democrats must take the time to reflect on the message the American people sent us last Tuesday,"" Moulton said in a statement after the caucus.""Delaying the vote on leadership positions is the necessary first step to have that conversation,"" he said. ""The American people cried out last week and we've got to listen.""Representative Tim Ryan, 43, is weighing a run against Pelosi, 76, Ryan's spokesman Michael Zetts said on Monday.
""He is concerned that if changes aren't made we will be in the political wilderness for many years to come,"" Zetts said.   Ryan has been in the House since 2003.A Democratic lawmaker who declined to be named said Ryan would represent a new generation.""I think a lot of us feel the landscape has changed,"" he said. ""We need people who can learn new tricks and not do things the way they have been done that last 20 or 30 years.""But Representative Steve Israel, a member of House Democratic leadership and who is retiring from Congress at year's end, said: ""There is nobody who could have led House Democrats who would have had a different outcome"" in last week's presidential and congressional elections.""This was not about Nancy Pelosi,"" Israel told MSNBC. ""This was about a national Democratic strategy and message that simply did not tap into the unprecedented anxieties of middle-class voters.""

MEXICO CITY Mexico will need to show ""enormous pragmatism"" in its dealings with Donald Trump's government, President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Tuesday, as his administration prepares to seek common ground on trade and immigration issues.Mexico is on tenterhooks awaiting the accession of Trump to the U.S. presidency because of his repeated threats on the campaign trail to impose tariffs on Mexican-made goods and seal the country off behind a massive border wall.Acknowledging that Trump's victory had generated some uncertainty, Pena Nieto reiterated his government would pursue dialogue with the next U.S. government to reach agreements.""We'll have to work with enormous pragmatism to agree what's useful and convenient for Mexico and for the whole of North America,"" he told a business summit in the central city of Puebla, Mexican headquarters of German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE).
The Mexican president added that his government was committed to providing macroeconomic stability for investors, listing a flexible exchange rate, central bank independence and a solid banking system among the key planks of his pledge.Concern has been widespread among business leaders and officials in Mexico that Trump could follow through on threats to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if he cannot renegotiate it in the United States' interests.
Struck between the United States, Mexico and Canada, NAFTA took effect in 1994 and has been the cornerstone of Mexican international trade policy. Mexico sends four-fifths of its goods exports to the United States.
Still, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo believes Trump will not back out of NAFTA, and has said Mexico could add new chapters to the deal to update it. (Reporting by Dave Graham; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"	['Trump']	[]

By Jon Herskovitz
| AUSTIN, Texas

AUSTIN, Texas Texas plans to introduce a measure next year aimed at protecting women in bathrooms and locker rooms, a move that has raised concerns of activists who say the legislation is really an attempt to discriminate against transgender people.The office of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said on Tuesday that a state senator will file the so-called ""Women's Privacy Act"" for consideration in the session that starts in January.Patrick's office did not have any details of the bill, but the Republican lieutenant governor has been a supporter of only allowing access to facilities such as bathrooms based on gender at birth rather than the gender with which a person identifies.North Carolina in March became the first state to enact a law that restricts bathroom access for transgender people. The law prompted a federal civil rights lawsuit and has been blamed for hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses and the relocation of major sporting events from the state.
Patrick, one of the most powerful forces in the Texas legislature and a supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, called the measure in Texas one of his top priorities.""Starting in 2017, we will have a friend in the White House who was clearly elected because the people of this country believe in the conservative principles that have guided the way we govern in Texas,"" Patrick said in a statement on Monday.
Patrick has been an opponent of policies under President Barack Obama administration's allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, saying the guidelines represented federal overreach and could allow for sexual predators to attack women.Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups say the current White House policies protect transgender students from discrimination and dismiss the safety concerns as rubbish.
""It is a total misnomer because the legislation has nothing to do protecting women's privacy,"" said Chuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, a leading LGBT civil rights group in the state. ""The purpose of the legislation is to allow discrimination against transgender children and adults.""Texas business leaders, a base of support for the Republican party, in October warned lawmakers in the Republican-dominated statehouse that measures targeting the LGBT community would hurt the state's $1.8 trillion-a-year economy and make it difficult for employers to attract talent for crucial industries.
