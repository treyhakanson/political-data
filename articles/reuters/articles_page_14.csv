By Robin Respaut

The California Public Employees' Retirement System said on Monday it shared about 14 percent of the profit made on private equity investments in the past year with firms managing the money.The announcement by the nation's largest public pension fund marks a milestone toward greater fee disclosures for private equity assets, which make up $26.4 billion or almost 9 percent of the total fund. The move is sure to be noticed by other state and city pension funds.CalPERS and other large public pension funds are under increasing pressure to track and disclose the costs of private equity investments. A new California law passed this year requires the state's public pension funds to disclose more about the fees paid to manage the funds.CalPERS paid $228.4 million in fees in fiscal year 2015-2016, and shared $539 million in profits with private equity firms. In total, CalPERS realized $3.26 billion in gains from its private equity portfolio last year. The asset class returned 1.7 percent in fiscal 2015-16. In fiscal year 2014-2015, when the asset class returned 8.92 percent, the pension fund paid $431.7 million in fees. 
CalPERS has been working with the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) to shed more light on fees paid to manage funds and profits shared with private equity firms. Few public pension funds disclose these costs, despite a growing consensus from government officials, regulators, and the public to do so.On Monday, some members of CalPERS Board pushed for further transparency by requiring private equity firms to reveal the portfolio fees, offsets or management fee waivers that they may collect.
""If somebody is not willing to disclose to us these kinds of fees, I'm not sure it's somebody we want to play with,"" said CalPERS board member J.J. Jelincic.""We are the gold standard,"" said fellow board member Richard Costigan. ""Every one of those funds should be disclosing and if they are not, or they are refusing, we should not be doing business with them.""CalPERS consultants advised prudence when setting strict new rules that could dissuade firms from working with CalPERS. The asset remains highly competitive, said Michael Moy of Pension Consulting Alliance, and private equity firms have ""absolutely no trouble getting commitments from investors.""
""You are not alone, but you are darn near it,"" Moy said. ""They are very reluctant to give any kind of ground in negotiations."" (Reporting by Robin Respaut; Editing by Daniel Bases and Andrew Hay)"

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday it was important for President-elect Donald Trump to send signals of unity after a bitterly fought campaign.At a news conference, Obama declined to comment on Trump's selection of conservative provocateur Steve Bannon as his White House chief strategist.But the Democratic president said he privately told the Republican Trump in an Oval Office meeting last week that because of the ""bitterness and the ferocity of the campaign that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups, to women and others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign.""

| BUENOS AIRES

BUENOS AIRES Donald Trump's election as U.S. president raises concern that Washington may increase the intrusiveness of domestic intelligence gathering, former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden said on Monday, warning that democratic checks and balances were losing ground to authoritarianism.Snowden lives in Moscow under an asylum deal after he leaked classified information in 2013 that triggered an international furor over the reach of U.S. spy operations. He spoke at a teleconference hosted by Buenos Aires University's law school.""We are starting to substitute open government for sheer authoritarianism, a government based not upon the principle of informed consent granted by people who understand its activities but rather a trust in personalities, a trust in claims, a trust in the hope that they will do the right thing,"" Snowden said.Washington pledged not to engage in indiscriminate espionage following Snowden's 2013 disclosures. But Snowden questioned if that policy could be modified by new officials ""who have a very different set of values and can govern in the dark.""
""If government does actually win our trust, because they go for some years and they do operate in a way that we should support, what happens when it changes?"" he asked.""This is kind of the challenge that we're facing today in the United States with the result of the last election.""
Supporters see Snowden as a whistleblower who boldly exposed government excess. But the U.S. government has filed espionage charges against him for leaking intelligence information.Trump, who scored an upset win over Democrat Hillary Clinton in last Tuesday's election, broke with many in his own Republican Party during the campaign and emphasized his success as a businessman and reality TV show star. He promised sweeping security measures to deal with the threat of attacks on the United States.
His election was greeted with concern from the American Civil Liberties Union over statements he made during the campaign supporting increased surveillance of U.S. Muslims, mass deportation of illegal immigrants, reauthorization of waterboarding and changing libel laws to increase press restrictions.    Snowden, asked if he thought the election of Trump, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, might increase chances of him being pardoned by the U.S. government, responded: ""Who knows?""

It added that the countries should ""return to pragmatic, mutually beneficial cooperation, which would address the interests of both countries as well as stability and safety the world over.""Trump's team issued a statement saying Putin called to offer congratulations. The statement said Trump told Putin he was looking forward to a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and its people.
The two men will maintain contact by phone and seek to meet each other in person, the statement said. 
Trump will succeed President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. Obama's relations with Putin have become tense over issues that include Syria and Ukraine. (Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow and Steve Holland in Washington; Editing by Robin Pomeroy and Howard Goller)"

By Michelle Conlin
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm is at the top of President-elect Donald Trump's list to serve as energy secretary, according to U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a Trump energy adviser who confirmed he is also under consideration for the job.""In my view, Harold Hamm has the right of first refusal,"" Cramer told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""In my view, he's likely to be asked. And, because he's a patriot and an American, he's likely to say yes.""Hamm, 70, became one of America's wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into controversial hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakota's shale fields.Continental spokeswoman Kristin Thomas said, ""There has never been a conversation"" between Trump and Hamm about the position. She declined to speculate on how Hamm would respond if asked to take the job.People close to Hamm were mixed on the possibility.""I think Harold would be great in the (Energy Secretary) job. If the president calls, I think he would do it,"" said Mike Cantrell, a former vice president of government affairs at Continental who remains close to Hamm.Another prominent U.S. oil and gas executive who knows Hamm and asked not to be named, however, said he doubted Hamm would be willing to leave Continental and may be more interested in having a strong say in who gets the job.Aside from Hamm and Cramer, Trump's short list for energy secretary also includes venture capitalist Robert Grady, who served as associate director for Natural Resources, Energy and Science in President George H. W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget, according to Cramer and two other sources with knowledge of the situation.
Grady did not respond to requests for comment. If Hamm is nominated, the Oklahoman would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump's pro-drilling energy platform.Trump, a Republican who will take office on Jan. 20 and succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, is also working to fill other top administration jobs in the coming weeks.
SECOND TIME AROUND
Hamm addressed the Republican convention in July, calling for expanded drilling and saying too much environmental regulation threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the country's dependence on Middle East oil producers. Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology, including nuclear weapons production and labs, have typically boasted a political or academic background.Dan Eberhart, a Texas oil investor and Republican party financier who has worked with Hamm and has had conversations with the Trump campaign, said, ""I know Hamm is being seriously considered. And I know that he wants it.""
A former Capitol Hill staffer who knows both Hamm and Cramer said he thought Trump would be wise to favor the North Dakota congressman, a self-described climate change skeptic who has a history of supporting the oil, gas and coal sectors.""Both Hamm and Cramer would be fantastic choices, but I think Cramer brings more balance and stability,"" he said, asking not to be named. This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job.The Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.Hamm made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be one of the biggest divorce settlement in history.

By Noah Barkin
| BERLIN

BERLIN Donald Trump's victory has been a shock for America's major partners around the world. But perhaps nowhere has the blow been more painful than in Germany, a country that under Angela Merkel has come to see itself as a bastion of openness and tolerance.On virtually every issue of importance to the German chancellor, from confronting Russian aggression and promoting free trade, to combating climate change and tackling the tide of refugees fleeing Syria, Trump seems likely to turn Washington from an ally into an adversary.He invoked the German chancellor's name to insult his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the U.S. campaign, calling her ""America's Merkel"". And he described her decision last year to open German borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants as ""insane"".So although Trump's election is being seen as a rejection of the political establishment and liberal democratic values in general, it represents a very personal blow to Merkel, Europe's most powerful leader.It heaps more responsibility on her at a time when she is nearing an announcement on whether she will run for a record-tying fourth term as chancellor next autumn.Despite the toll that 11 years of non-stop crisis fighting has taken on her, Merkel's aides say that Trump's victory and Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union have, if anything, reinforced her determination to continue.""Given the challenges we face, in Europe and beyond, she can't simply walk off into the sunset. That would look very bad. She has a sense of responsibility,"" said an adviser.Germans have been falling out of love with the United States since George W. Bush invaded Iraq more than a dozen years ago. But the election of Barack Obama in 2008 was seen here as proof of America's capacity to correct its ""mistakes"".Obama was hailed as the heir to John F. Kennedy, who came to a divided Berlin in 1963, two years after construction of the Berlin Wall began, and reassured Germans with the word ""Ich bin ein Berliner"". Obama, who developed a close relationship with Merkel in his eight years in office, will make what promises to be a bittersweet farewell visit to Berlin this week.Trump's win heralds a hard break in a relationship that grew extremely close during the Cold War, before wobbling when Germany refused to go along with Bush's Iraq war and was derided by his Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as ""old Europe"".Last week, Germany's Suddeutsche Zeitung published a cartoon of a beaming Trump opening his jacket to reveal the message ""Ich bin kein Berliner"" (I am not a Berliner) plastered across his chest.
PROVOCATIVE MESSAGE
This won't stop Merkel, a restrained politician who prefers small steps to giant leaps, from trying to work with the brash Trump, who rode to victory on the dreamy promise to ""Make America Great Again"".She is a pragmatist who has maintained dialogue with strongmen like Vladimir Putin and Tayyip Erdogan through crises in Germany's relationship with Russia and Turkey.But Merkel's statement on Wednesday, in the aftermath of Trump's election, was telling. In it, she set conditions for cooperation with Trump, a provocative message from a close ally to the democratically elected leader of the United States.""Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,"" she said. ""I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.""
Merkel's cabinet colleagues have been far more outspoken. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has denounced Trump as a ""preacher of hate"". Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has called him the pioneer of an international ""authoritarian and chauvinist"" movement.The German press has not pulled punches either. The cover of Der Spiegel magazine this weekend showed the head of a grimacing Trump hurtling toward earth like a giant flaming asteroid, above the title ""The End of the World (as we know it)"".One of Merkel's biggest foreign policy successes as chancellor was rallying the European Union's disparate 28 member states behind sanctions against Russia in response to its intervention in eastern Ukraine.If Trump follows through on his promise to forge a closer relationship with Putin, the transatlantic and European front against Russia would crumble, leaving her Putin policy in tatters.
HIGHEST PRICE
Merkel was also the driving force in Europe behind the ambitious trade deal between the EU and United States, known as TTIP (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership).That agreement, still in the negotiation phase, seems sure to die under Trump, whose protectionist promises, should they become reality, would hit few countries harder than Germany, whose economic strength depends heavily on the openness of the global trading system.""Nowhere would a move toward renationalization be more dangerous,"" former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer wrote this week. Germany, he predicted, would pay ""the highest economic and political price"" if the wave of populism led to a further weakening, or even a collapse, of the EU.Trump's presidency will challenge Germany on a number of other fronts, from climate and fiscal policy to defense spending and financial regulation.Trump has promised to do what Merkel and her veteran Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble have resisted for years: take advantage of an ultra-low interest rate environment to invest vast amounts of public money in modernizing infrastructure.It was ironic that in the same week Trump was elected, Germany was finalizing a 2017 budget that is a model of fiscal restraint. How long Schaeuble will be able to stick to his cherished ""Schwarze Null"", or balanced budget, with Trump demanding that Europe shoulder more responsibility for its own defense, is unclear.But one thing does seem clear: in Trump, Germany faces its biggest test since the fall of the Berlin Wall.""To suggest that Germany has suddenly become the new leader of the western world is not only absurd but dangerous - because it raises expectations that simply can't ever be met,"" a senior German official said.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON With a bitter election campaign finally over, the Congress will reconvene this week to try to set aside its partisan differences long enough to keep the government from closing.As President-elect Donald Trump shapes his administration, Republicans are expected to move away from initial plans for compromise funding legislation and opt instead for a short-term measure to keep the government running into next year, when they will have control of Congress and the White House.  Washington has been operating since Oct. 1 under a temporary ""continuing resolution"" on the budget. It expires on Dec. 9. Lawmakers will be trying to approve a new one before then.Mired in partisan gridlock, Congress in recent years has seldom completed the entire federal budget process, falling back frequently on stop-gap measures that last a few months.
During their ""lame-duck"" session starting this week, lawmakers will have little time to draft another continuing resolution to cover funding U.S. agencies and military operations. Congress is tentatively set to adjourn by Dec. 17 and has an additional break over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.A new Congress will meet in January, with the 100-seat Senate more closely split than before last week's elections. Neither party will have the 60 votes needed to move legislation easily through the chamber.The voters last Tuesday also preserved the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, though it is slightly smaller, giving the Democrats more power to block the Republicans.
Legislation to streamline federal regulations for new drugs could come up during the lame duck session. So could funding for cancer research, precision medicine and treatments for opioid addiction, said congressional aides.Some conservative House Republicans want a budget measure that will expire in March, which would coincide with needed action on the federal debt limit, according to House aides.
Others have talked about a continuing resolution that would run until sometime February, giving the new president and Congress enough time to determine their priorities for more comprehensive funding legislation for the remainder of the federal fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.Before the election shifted the political center of gravity in favor of Republicans, Republican leaders had talked about crafting funding legislation through negotiations with Democrats and President Barack Obama and approving it before Christmas.

By Valerie Volcovici and Alister Doyle
| WASHINGTON/MARRAKESH, Morocco

WASHINGTON/MARRAKESH, Morocco President-elect Donald Trump is seeking quick ways to withdraw the United States from a global accord to combat climate change, a source on his transition team said, defying broad global backing for the plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Since Trump's election victory on Tuesday, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed support for the 2015 Paris agreement during climate talks involving 200 nations set to run until Friday in Marrakesh, Morocco.Trump has called global warming a hoax and has promised to quit the Paris Agreement, which was strongly supported by outgoing Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama.Trump's advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord, according to the source, who works on Trump's transition team for international energy and climate policy.""It was reckless for the Paris agreement to enter into force before the election"" on Tuesday, the source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Paris accord won enough backing for entry into force on Nov. 4, four days before the election.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday in New Zealand the Obama administration would do everything it could to implement the Paris accord before Trump takes office.The accord says in its Article 28 that any country wanting to pull out after signing on has to wait four years. In theory, the earliest date for withdrawal would be Nov. 4, 2020, around the time of the next U.S. presidential election.The source said the future Trump administration is weighing alternatives to accelerate the pull-out: sending a letter withdrawing from the 1992 international framework accord that is the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement; voiding U.S. involvement in both in a year's time; or issuing a presidential order simply deleting the U.S. signature from the Paris accord.
Withdrawing from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) would be controversial, partly because it was signed by former Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and approved by the U.S. Senate. The action also could antagonize many other countries. [L8N1DB41L]The UNFCCC sets a goal of avoiding ""dangerous"" man-made damage to the climate to avert more heat waves, downpours, floods, extinctions of animals and plants and rising sea levels.The 2015 Paris Agreement is much more explicit, seeking to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.Many nations have expressed hope that the United States will stay. But the host of the current round of climate negotiations, Morocco, said the pact that seeks to phase out greenhouse gases in the second half of the century was strong enough to survive a pullout.
One party deciding to withdraw would not call the agreement into question, Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar told a news conference.In Beijing on Monday, the foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a regular news briefing that China would like to continue working with all countries, including the United States, in the global fight against climate change. The agreement was reached by almost 200 nations in December and, as of Saturday, has been formally ratified by 109 representing 76 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, including the United States with 18 percent.The accord seeks to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to increasing economic damage from desertification, extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa declined to comment on the Trump source's remarks to Reuters.
""The Paris Agreement carries an enormous amount of weight and credibility,"" Espinosa told a news conference.She said the United Nations hoped for a strong and constructive relationship with Trump.The Trump source said the president-elect's transition team is aware of the likely international backlash but said Republicans in the U.S. Congress have given ample warning that a Republican administration would take action to reverse course.""The Republican Party on multiple occasions has sent signals to the international community signaling that it doesn't agree with the pact. We've gone out of our way to give notice,"" the source said.The source blamed Obama for joining up by an executive order, without getting approval from the U.S. Senate.""There wouldn't be this diplomatic fallout on the broader international agenda if Obama hadn't rushed the adoption,"" the source said.
