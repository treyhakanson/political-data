By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Friday that would allow the families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia's government for damages, despite the White House's threat to veto the measure.The U.S. Senate in May unanimously passed the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,"" known as JASTA. The bill's passage in the House by voice vote, two days before the 15th anniversary of the attacks that killed about 3,000 people, was greeted with cheers and applause in the chamber.""We can no longer allow those who injure and kill Americans to hide behind legal loopholes, denying justice to the victims of terrorism,"" said Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers who crashed airliners in New York, outside Washington and in Pennsylvania were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government, which strongly denies responsibility, has lobbied against the bill.Opponents of the measure said it could strain relations with Saudi Arabia and lead to retaliatory laws that would allow foreign nationals to sue Americans for alleged involvement in terrorist attacks.The White House on Friday reiterated that President Barack Obama would veto the bill.But some members of Congress have become increasingly restive about relations with Saudi Arabia, long an important player in U.S. Middle East policy. On Thursday, four senators introduced a resolution seeking to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to the kingdom, after 64 House members signed a letter in August asking Obama to delay the sale.
If Obama carries out the veto threat and the required two-thirds of both the Republican-majority House and Senate still support the bill, it would be the first time since Obama's presidency began in 2009 that Congress had overridden a veto.The House passed the measure by voice vote, without objections or recorded individual votes. That could make it easier for Obama's fellow Democrats to uphold his veto later without officially changing their positions.SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY

JASTA would remove sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. It also would allow survivors, and relatives of those killed in them to seek damages from other countries.In this case, it would allow suits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.Backers say passage is long overdue. They argue that if Saudi Arabia, or any other government, is innocent of involvement in attacks, they have nothing to fear from the legislation.
""If they've done nothing wrong, they have nothing to worry about,"" said Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a vocal advocate for the measure.Previous versions of the bill had stalled in Congress because they provided fewer protections for countries against lawsuits.Lawmakers had been under intense pressure from the Sept. 11 families to pass JASTA before the 15th anniversary of the attacks on Sunday.A member of the French parliament, Pierre Lellouche, said he would consider retaliatory legislation in France, and would anticipate it elsewhere, if the final version of JASTA does not include waivers for countries that are U.S. allies and actively involved in fighting terrorism.""It may trigger similar acts all over the place, and then you enter into a 'state of jungle' where everybody sues everybody,"" Lellouche, who runs a parliamentary committee on international law, told reporters on a conference call on Friday.

By Timothy Gardner and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama has invited congressional leaders to the White House on Monday in an attempt to break deadlocks over government spending plans and funding the fight against the Zika virus.Congress must pass a temporary spending bill by Sept. 30 or much of the federal government will shut down. With the deadline approaching, Obama is set to meet with House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and his House counterpart Nancy Pelosi will also be present, White House and congressional officials said on Friday.Of particular urgency is a program to fight the Zika virus which is running out of money, U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden told reporters. Frieden also noted the virus, which can cause severe birth defects, would pose a threat well into 2017. ""Zika is likely to become endemic in this hemisphere,"" he told reporters.Congressional leaders are considering attaching as much as $1.1 billion in Zika spending to a bill to temporarily fund the government during the 2017 fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
Congress has yet to approve individual appropriations bills to fund the government in fiscal 2017. If no spending is approved before the end of September, much of the government would have to shut down.House Republican leaders are considering a Senate Republican proposal to extend the current government spending levels until Dec. 9, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a Republican, told reporters.
Rogers said he wants the package to include funding to combat Zika, but that this was being negotiated. On Thursday, Pelosi called for a temporary funding measure that would include a full year's funding to combat Zika.In February, Obama asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with Zika. Since then, both political parties have backed $1.1 billion, but fights over side issues related to abortion have divided them.One of the biggest controversies involves Democrats' opposition to Republican-proposed language that Democrats say would prevent Zika funds for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, mainly in Puerto Rico.
A spending bill expiring in December would provide time this autumn for lawmakers to negotiate spending levels for the rest of fiscal 2017.Some House conservatives oppose the idea, preferring to leave decisions up to the next president and a new Congress that take office in January.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Justice Department has formed a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other Internet-connected tools, a senior official said.The new group's goal is to secure the so-called ""internet of things"" from exploitation by ""terrorist threats"" and by others who might try to hack devices to cause loss of life or achieve political or economic gain, according to Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's national security division.The impetus for the team, which has been informally active for about six months, was an understanding that the internet is vulnerable to cyber attacks partly because it was not designed with security in mind, Carlin told Reuters, after announcing the group on Thursday at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance conference in Washington. Carlin said the group, a small team of about five to 10 people, did ""not want to be alarmist"" about new technologies such as self-driving cars, but that it wanted to identify and address security challenges presented by the internet of things before they are exploited.He cited the July truck attack in Nice, France, in which 86 people were killed, as an example of how automated driving systems could present a national security threat if they were remotely hijacked.
""The internet on wheels ... clearly is going to present national security risks as this transformation takes place,"" Carlin said. Transportation and public health experts say that self-driving cars could dramatically reduce auto fatalities and injuries, most of which are due to human error.
Car hacking has grown as a cyber security concern in recent years.The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a bulletin in March warning that motor vehicles were ""increasingly vulnerable"" to hacking. 	In July 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  recalled 1.4 million U.S. vehicles to install software after a magazine report raised concerns about hacking, the first action of its kind for the auto industry.
Carlin said he has been to Detroit twice in the past six months on trips that included visits with auto industry executives to discuss national security issues surrounding smart cars.The group is being led by Adam Hickey, acting deputy assistant attorney general of the national security division, and will include industry experts and partnerships with other federal agencies, a Justice Department spokesman said.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a bid by Michigan to reinstate its Republican-backed ban on straight-ticket voting for the Nov. 8 general election.  The justices left in place a decision by a federal district judge in Michigan who in July suspended a law that abolished straight-ticket voting, the practice of using one mark to vote for all candidates from one party, finding that it would disproportionately affect black voters. The 6th U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that finding last month, prompting the state to seek a stay from the Supreme Court.Two conservative justices on the eight-member court, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, voted to grant the request, the brief order said.   
The Michigan law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by a Republican governor, was one of numerous voting measures passed at the state level that put new restrictions on voting. These measures also include stricter voter-identification laws and reduction of early-voting periods before election day.Proponents of the law, enacted in January, have said most states have moved away from a straight-ticket voting option. Removing the option forces voters to study candidates and encourages voters to make decisions based on criteria other than party affiliation, they said.Opponents say voting restrictions are aimed at reducing turnout of minorities, who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain in July granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil rights and labor groups who sued Michigan's Secretary of State Ruth Johnson and Attorney General Bill Schuette. The judge said elimination of straight-ticket voting would be a burden on voting rights and cause long wait times at polls.After Friday's decision, Schuette said, ""It is my duty to defend Michigan's laws, in this case a law that stands in 40 other states. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken and I will respect that decision.""
The case is one of several voting disputes being litigated ahead of the election and is the second emergency application the Supreme Court has recently been asked to handle. On Aug. 31, the court rejected a bid by North Carolina to reinstate for November's elections several voting restrictions, including a requirement that people show identification at the polls.The high court is short one justice following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February. As a result the court is evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives.

The Senate passed it unanimously in May. 
""We are in the same place we were the last time,"" the White House official said on Friday. Both Obama and a White House spokesman said in April the president would veto the bill.

NEW YORK U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's spokeswoman said on Friday Clinton's plan to curb drug spending was not the blow to medical innovation that Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Ian Read described it as being on Thursday.""Throughout this campaign, Hillary Clinton has called for expanding investments in innovation for healthcare, from a cure for Alzheimer's to building on Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot initiative,"" campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood said in an emailed statement.""She's said clearly that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries are great sources of innovation and she wants to support their development of new treatments,"" she said.
Last week, Clinton unveiled a plan to create an oversight panel that would protect consumers from ""unjustified"" price hikes on life-saving drugs.On Thursday, while speaking at an investor conference, Read said Clinton's plan would be ""very negative for innovation."" A Pfizer spokeswoman had no further comment on Friday.
Drugmakers have been criticized for raising drug prices in the United States, where citizens pay the most worldwide for medicines.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The White House on Thursday named a retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general as the government's first federal cyber security chief, a position announced eight months ago that is intended to improve defenses against hackers.Gregory Touhill's job will be to protect government networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats as federal chief information security officer, according to a statement.The administration of President Barack Obama has made bolstering federal cyber security a top priority in his last year in office. The issue has gained more attention because of high-profile breaches in recent years of government and private sector computers. 
U.S. intelligence officials suspect Russia was responsible for breaches of Democratic political organizations and state election systems to exert influence on the Nov. 8 presidential election. Russia has dismissed the allegations as absurd.Obama announced the new position in February alongside a budget proposal to Congress asking for $19 billion for cyber security across the U.S. government. The job is a political appointment, meaning Obama's successor can choose to replace Touhill after being sworn in next January.
Touhill is currently a deputy assistant secretary for cyber security and communications at the Department of Homeland Security. He will begin his new role later this month, a source familiar with the matter said. Touhill's responsibilities will include creating and implementing policy for best security practices across federal agencies and conducting periodic audits to test for weaknesses, according to the announcement.
Grant Schneider, who is the director of cyber security policy at the White House's National Security Council, will be  acting deputy to Touhill, according to the announcement.   (Reporting by Dustin Volz; editing by Cynthia Osterman and Grant McCool)"	['Obama']	[]

By Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's U.S. military buildup plan would cost hundreds of billions of dollars - but with no apparent strategy, defense experts from across the political spectrum said on Thursday.""I haven't seen any kind of strategy,"" said William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. ""He (Trump) says nobody is going to challenge us because we will be so strong. But that's not a strategy. It's just a kind of wish-fulfillment.""U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a top Trump backer who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the proposal was based on recommendations from groups such as the National Defense Panel and served as a statement of Trump's commitment to build the military.""I believe this lays out a framework for rebuilding the military, and it represents a commitment by Donald Trump to make this a priority,"" Sessions said in an interview. ""If you don't have presidential leadership really defending the need for a robust national defense, you're not going to maintain the defense budget.""Trump's proposal, unveiled in a speech on Wednesday, did not spell out how he would accommodate the additional manpower and hardware as the United States shutters military bases, or where and for what purposes the larger forces would be employed. There were no cost estimates and Trump proposed revenue-raising steps that budget experts called insufficient.""He just called for higher defense spending without giving us a number and without telling us how he is going to pay for it,"" said Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan administration Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank aligned with the Obama administration.Trump's Democratic opponent in the Nov. 8 election, Hillary Clinton, advocates tough defense and foreign policies, but has yet to take a stand on the size of the Pentagon budget.Stephen Miller, a Trump policy adviser, said Trump's proposal came in contrast to Clinton, who he said has ""no military plan.""Trump pledged to expand the Army to 540,000 active-duty troops from its current 480,000, increase the Marine Corps from 23 to 36 battalions - or as many as 10,000 more Marines - boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise Air Force tactical aircraft from 1,100 to 1,200.
Trump said those numbers were based on assessments by the conservative Heritage Foundation and other groups. Heritage said in a report that it looked at the capacity needed to handle two major wars to determine its force-size recommendations.Trump said he would bolster the development of missile defenses and cyber capabilities. He made no mention of U.S. nuclear forces already in the midst of a modernization effort that will cost an estimated $1 trillion over 30 years.To pay for the buildup, Trump said he would ask Congress to lift a Pentagon budget cap and ""fully offset"" the increased costs by collecting unpaid taxes, cutting appropriations for federal programs operating without congressional reauthorization, cracking down on social welfare fraud and other fraud, and collecting additional taxes and fees from increased energy production.
'SOFT-PEDALING' THE COST
Writing in The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, Tom Donnelly, a defense scholar at the American Enterprise Institute think tank who opposes Trump's election, praised Trump for embracing a buildup that many mainstream Republicans advocate.""However, Trump undercut the power of his proposals by soft-pedaling the cost of such a buildup,"" he wrote.Independent cost estimates for Trump's plan range from $150 billion in additional spending over 10 years, according to the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, to as much as $900 billion over the same period, as assessed by Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
Harrison said that increase could be achieved only by raising the federal budget deficit, raising taxes, or cutting other spending, such as benefits programs for seniors and the poor. ""None of those things are politically popular,"" he said.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that lifting the cap would cost $450 billion over 10 years. The revenue-generating steps proposed by Trump would leave $150 billion of that amount uncovered, it said.Another flaw in Trump's plan is the assumption that Republican members of the House of Representatives who belong to the deficit-fighting tea party movement would agree to end the budget cap.In April, Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley told a Senate committee that adding more soldiers without a sufficient budget would be disastrous for the country and the Army. Bases would close and programs that support troops and their families would have to be curtailed to make up the shortfall, he said.The Navy already has launched a shipbuilding program to raise the number of vessels to more than 300 by 2021. Trump's plan fails to account for the country's limited shipbuilding capacity and the cost of manning, maintaining and basing the additional warships he proposes to build.""The whole thing is unrealistic,"" said Dov Zakheim, the Pentagon's top financial official under former President George W. Bush. Zakheim, who opposes a Trump presidency, estimates that Trump's plan would boost defense spending by roughly $300 billion over five years. ""It's a soundbite,"" he said.

By Jeff Mason
| KANSAS CITY, Mo.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reflected on her religious faith on Thursday during the first of a series of speeches her campaign said would focus on her values and vision rather than those of Republican opponent Donald Trump.The shift comes as opinion polls tighten between Clinton, the former secretary of state and U.S. senator, and Trump, a New York businessman, ahead of the Nov. 8 election.Clinton has focused many of her public remarks on criticism of Trump, including his provocative comments on illegal immigrants, Muslims and women. Trump has criticized Clinton's record in public office and questioned her honesty and qualifications for the White House.But the Clinton campaign acknowledged she had to spend more time focusing her remarks on herself so voters could see the ""aspirational"" vision she hopes to enact if she becomes the first woman elected U.S. president.""We believe we have to work extra hard to make sure that the positive notion of what she wants to do breaks through given the amount of interest that there is (in Trump) and what he says and also in what we say about him,"" Clinton's communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters on her plane.
Clinton will do that with speeches on the economy, children and families, and national service in the coming weeks. She started on Thursday night with an address to the National Baptist Convention, made up primarily of African-Americans, that focused on her own religious life.Clinton spoke of teaching the occasional Sunday school class and being married for more than 40 years to former President  Bill Clinton, a Southern Baptist, despite being a lifelong Methodist herself.
She told the crowd about her gruff Navy father praying by his bed every night and her mother, who experienced love during a tough childhood that grounded her faith.Reflecting on her Christianity, Clinton said Jesus Christ's greatest command was to love.""We're not asked to love each other. Not urged or requested. We are commanded,"" she said. ""Some days it's really hard for me,"" she said to laughter.
Clinton does not speak frequently about her faith, although she discussed its importance to her in a televised town hall event in February during her battle with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination.Her words on Thursday seemed to connect with members of the mostly black audience, who applauded and raised their hands in affirmation of many of her comments. Clinton polls strongly among black voters.""I've learned to be grateful not just for my blessings but also for my faults, and there are plenty,"" she said, noting the importance of humility among leaders.

By Dave Graham
| MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday replaced his close ally and finance minister, Luis Videgaray, after the two were heavily criticized for Republican U.S presidential candidate Donald Trump's controversial visit to Mexico last week.A somber-looking Pena Nieto told a news conference that Videgaray, who officials said was the architect of Trump's visit, would make way for former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade.Pena Nieto was widely pilloried for hosting Trump at short notice last Wednesday. The New York businessman has repeatedly vowed to build a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants - which he said Mexico would pay for.Trump has further infuriated Mexicans by threatening to carry out mass deportations and rewrite trade treaties crucial to their economy, and by referring to some immigrants from the United States' southern neighbor as rapists or drug runnersWith economic growth sluggish, the president's popularity at record lows and tensions palpable between the finance minister and other Cabinet members, rumors of Videgaray's impending departure had bubbled under the surface in Mexico for months.""The proverbial last straw was the Trump visit,"" said Agustin Barrios Gomez, a politician from the opposition leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, and a driving force behind a draft bill sent to Congress this week to empower the government to retaliate against Trump if he threatens Mexican interests.""(It) was seen as such a fiasco that he no longer had the credibility necessary to do his immediate job,"" he added.Senior diplomats said Videgaray, 48, had been instrumental in arranging the American's visit, in which the government had hoped to impress upon Trump the need to moderate his tone and reconsider his more divisive campaign proposals.But within hours of leaving Mexico, Trump was telling a cheering crowd of supporters in Arizona that Mexico would pay for the border wall ""100 percent,"" prompting fresh ridicule of Pena Nieto at home.
Instead of teaching Trump a lesson, the visit ""legitimized him as a potential head of state,"" said Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister. ""It just shows how little thought went into it.""Trump commented on the resignation during a forum with U.S. veterans on NBC television when he was asked if the United States could take a chance with him as commander-in-chief.""Well, I think absolutely,"" he said. ""I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day...I let them know where the United States stands. I mean, we've been badly hurt by Mexico...And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. That's how well we did.""PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Videgaray ran Pena Nieto's election campaign, and was long regarded as the most powerful Cabinet minister, with a huge influence on policy after orchestrating the country's landmark energy, telecommunications, tax and education reforms.Both men were embroiled in conflict-of-interest scandals in late 2014, after Pena Nieto's wife and Videgaray were found to have acquired property from a major government contractor. Pena Nieto ordered an inquiry, which cleared both of any wrongdoing.The respected new finance minister, Meade, is a friend of Videgaray and had started in the administration as foreign minister before moving to the social development ministry.Videgaray's departure from the Cabinet means Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, on whose watch capo Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman escaped from prison before being recaptured, is now the most visible potential presidential candidate in 2018 for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Polls show the main hopefuls for 2018 face a tough battle, with Osorio Chong leading prospective PRI contenders.Meade, who was also once energy minister, is among those hopefuls. He must now steer next year's budget through Congress, with the draft plan to be announced on Thursday.Senator Ernesto Cordero, a former finance minister from the center-right opposition, said he expected a smooth handover to Meade, whose experience in government he underlined.""He's been a minister five times, and on those five occasions he's done a good job,"" Cordero said.The economy has consistently fallen short of government growth forecasts during Videgaray's tenure, and contracted in the second quarter for the first time in three years.The new budget will be under close scrutiny after rating agency Standard & Poor's last month said it could cut Mexico's credit rating following a marked increase in debt.Videgaray, who has also been rumored as a potential 2017 gubernatorial candidate for the PRI in the State of Mexico, a populous region next to the capital, will not take another public post, a finance ministry spokeswoman said.
