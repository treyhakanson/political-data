Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said late on Sunday a bill to increase funding in the state will become law, about 24 hours before the 10-day period for him to veto the blueprint runs out.Pennsylvania lawmakers passed the $31.6 billion spending plan on Thursday, a day before the deadline for the start of fiscal 2017.
The state will still not have a complete revenue plan to pay for the increased spending, so the legislature will have to keep working on the same.

We have to do better, we have to learn from mistakes,"" Obama told a news conference in Madrid. ""We know that we have had hackers in the White House,"" he added. 
Concerns have been raised about the security of government information after the head of the FBI said presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's email servers may have been accessed by foreign actors when she was Secretary of State.

By James Oliphant
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, under consideration by Republican Donald Trump as a possible vice presidential choice, said on Sunday he favors a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion.That stance places Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, at odds with the official Republican Party position, which is firmly anti-abortion.Asked about his position on abortion on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Flynn, a registered Democrat, said ""women have to be able to choose"" and that women ""have to make the decision because they're the ... ones that are going to decide to bring up that child or not."" Trump, the presumptive Republican White House nominee, has said he will pick his vice president before the party's nomination convention opens on July 18. Flynn has been an adviser to the Trump campaign since early this year. 
The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Trump is becoming increasingly infatuated with Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012-2014 under President Barack Obama, because he believes national unrest and the threat of terrorism may demand a ""tough and steady"" presence on the ticket. As a businessman and real-estate developer, Trump also likes the idea of teaming up with another non-politician, the Post reported.
For weeks Trump has conducted a high-profile canvassing of Republican political stalwarts as part of his running mate search, but he has also made clear he is looking at what a military leader would bring to the ticket.A source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters on Saturday that Flynn had emerged as a possibility.
According to the source, Flynn is seen as someone who would be able to help Trump in the area of national security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from Islamic State militants.Trump is also considering more conventional vice presidential contenders, such as former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Indiana Governor Mike Pence or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

MADRID U.S. President Barack Obama has warned that attacks on police over racial bias would hurt the anti-racism Black Lives Matter movement, days after a sniper killed five police officers in Dallas in apparent revenge for police shootings of black people. Obama said although most activists from the Black Lives Matter movement wanted to see better relations between communities and law enforcement, violence and overly broad criticism against police undermined the protest movement.""I want to say to say to everyone concerned about ... racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful, serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize American society to bring about real change,"" Obama said.""Whenever those of us who are concerned about failures of the criminal justice system attack police, you are doing a disservice to the cause,"" he told a news conference in Madrid where he is on a one-day visit. 
Micah Johnson, a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war, opened fire on police officers on Thursday during a protest in Dallas against the fatal shootings of two black men by police in Louisiana and Minnesota the previous day.Johnson wanted to ""kill white people, especially white officers,"" Dallas Police Chief David Brown said after the attack on Thursday night.
The Black Lives Matter group said on Friday it advocated dignity, not murder, in response to the shooting that also left seven other police officers and two civilians wounded.Obama said there was legitimate criticism to be made of the criminal justice system and that citizens should continue to protest against it.
""I would hope that police organizations are also respectful of the frustrations that people in these communities feel and not just dismiss these protests as political correctness or politics or attacks on police,"" he said.

WASHINGTON Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is giving consideration to retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as a potential vice presidential running mate, a Republican source familiar with the process said on Saturday.For weeks Trump has conducted a high-profile canvassing of Republican political stalwarts as part of his running mate search, but he has also made clear he is looking at what a military leader would bring to the ticket.The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Flynn has emerged as a possibility, confirming reports in the New York Post and The Washington Post. The Trump campaign had no comment.The thinking is that Flynn, who has been a foreign policy adviser to Trump, would be able to help Trump in the area of national security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from Islamic State militants.
Trump is also considering a more conventional political choice for his running mate, such as former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Indiana Governor Mike Pence or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.Flynn was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014.
He has spoken in the past about wanting the United States to work more closely with Russia to resolve global security issues.Flynn told Russia Today in an interview published on Dec. 10 that the United States and Russia should work together to resolve the Syrian civil war and defeat Islamic State.
Flynn has a book coming out next week, co-written with Michael Ledeen, titled: ""The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies."" (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A trade deal fight led by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday failed to fully materialize as rival and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton announced a compromise to expand mandatory healthcare funding over the next decade.At a meeting of the Democratic Party draft platform committee in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday, supporters of Sanders were unable to influence the committee to adopt strong language opposing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, marking a powerful blow to the efforts by the U.S. senator from Vermont to push the party further to the left.""We did everything we could to win that vote,"" said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels. ""It was very disappointing.""Instead of a condemnation specific to the TPP, the committee reached language saying they would oppose ""trade agreements that do not support good American jobs.""Sanders has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it, which he says are unfair to American workers. Clinton has also come out as opposed to the agreement. Despite Clinton having already secured the requisite delegates to clinch the party's nomination at the July 25-28 convention, Sanders remains in the race to be the party's nominee. 
He has indicated that he would hold off on endorsing Clinton for the Nov. 8 general election fight against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump until she adopted policies and campaign language that more closely resembled his own more liberal tone.""I would like to say that while this vote was disappointing, we have won some tremendous victories,"" Gunnels said, including securing language in the draft supporting a federal $15 minimum wage, another trademark issue for Sanders.On the same day, the Clinton campaign announced changes to its healthcare policy proposal, including increasing mandatory healthcare funding under the Affordable Care Act by $40 billion over the next 10 years, highlighting the significant influence Sanders still yields over the party. ""We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable healthcare to everyone in America,"" Clinton said in a statement that included her intention to give Americans the choice of a public-option insurance plan and allow for individuals below Medicare age, beginning at 55, to opt in to the U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans' hospital bills.
Sanders has made combating healthcare costs a rallying cry of his campaign and often battled with Clinton during the primary race on how best to reach their shared goal of universal healthcare.On Saturday, Sanders praised the updates to Clinton's proposal as a step in the right direction to ""save lives and ease suffering,"" indicating, along with the more liberal tone in several parts of the 2016 platform draft, a growing compromise between the two camps.For Clinton, an endorsement from Sanders - seen as a champion of the progressive left - could open the door to many of his supporters who have been reluctant to support the more moderate Clinton.
""The proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America - and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans,"" he said in a statement.""I congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative.""The New York Times reported on Thursday that an endorsement is imminent, and Sanders is expected to officially throw his support behind Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire early next week.(This story corrects age at which individuals could opt in to Medicare under Clinton plan in paragraph 10) (Reporting by Alana Wise; editing by Leslie Adler, G Crosse)"

By Ayesha Rascoe
| WARSAW

WARSAW President Barack Obama pledged on Saturday to seek ways to calm racial tensions and reduce divisions between police and minorities during his final months in office, but he warned that easy access to guns nationwide exacerbated the problem.Obama spoke at the end of a week in which five policemen were killed by a sniper in Dallas and two black men were killed by police in Minnesota and Louisiana. He said he would bring together civil rights and law enforcement leaders for talks at the White House next week after returning from a trip to Europe.Obama, the first black U.S. president, has spoken out on racial issues throughout his time in the White House. He has also tried but failed to reform American gun laws, stymied by Republicans in Congress who have opposed any measures that they seen as impinging on the Constitutional right to bear arms, despite a series of mass shootings in recent years.Obama said the Dallas police force reduced murder rates and community complaints by taking the issue of race and police conduct seriously, and said he hoped that would inspire ""constructive actions"" in the coming weeks.""That's the spirit that we all need to embrace. That's the spirit that I want to build on,"" he said during a press conference in Poland.But the divisive issue of gun control could not be separated from the tension between police and local citizens, he said.  
Obama noted that Dallas police on Thursday had to protect themselves and citizens from sniper fire while deciphering who had guns among those taking part in a protest decrying police shootings of black men.The presence of a gun in the car where Philando Castile, 32, was killed by police in Minnesota on Wednesday contributed to that event, he said.""In Minneapolis, we don't know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed, but it caused, in some fashion, those tragic events,"" Obama told reporters. 
""We can't just ignore that and pretend that that's somehow political ... it is a contributing factor - not the sole factor - but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve.""Obama is very unlikely to succeed in reviving major gun control reform before he leaves office in January.Lawmakers in Congress have fought over three rival gun measures since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Democrats promised to put pressure on Republicans next week to win votes for measures to expand background checks and allow the Justice Department to block gun sales to people on government watch lists.
Obama said on Saturday he hoped his legacy on the issue of race would be one of urging Americans to listen to each other and understand the country's difficult relationship with race.""The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn't suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act or the election of Barack Obama,"" he said.He said he hoped his words as president had conveyed ""that things have gotten better, substantially better, but that we've still got a lot more work to do.""

WARSAW U.S. President Barack Obama said on Saturday he was concerned about how the State Department handles classified information but cast this as part of a government-wide challenge in the age of email, texts and smartphones.FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday recommended against prosecuting Hillary Clinton or her aides for their ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information on the private email server that she used as secretary of state.Comey said the FBI had found evidence that ""the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information that's found elsewhere in the U.S. government.""
Asked about the FBI director's assessment, Obama told reporters in a news conference: ""I am concerned.""""The advent of email and texts and smart phones is just generating enormous amounts of data,"" Obama added, saying that this, in turn was ""putting enormous pressure on the department to sort through it, classify it properly.""
Obama said that if one classified too much, the benefits of the information evaporated because it took too long to process. ""It reflects a larger problem in government,"" he added. Clinton has said her use of a private email server was a mistake.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Party chief Reince Priebus expressed confidence on Saturday that security will be able to handle any protests at the party's convention later this month in Cleveland, where Donald Trump is to be nominated as the Republican presidential candidate.Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the tragic shootings in Texas, Minnesota and Louisiana in recent days may lead to a more peaceful discourse in general across the country.Cleveland police on Friday tightened their security plan for the July 18-21 Republican National Convention in the wake of the shootings. They also increased surveillance and intelligence operations.The outpouring of grief among Americans after the bloodshed could lead to a ""more understanding and polite discourse and a feeling of support in communities and with police,"" Priebus said, and that this same feeling of understanding could also take place in Cleveland.
""We've been working really hard on security. I'm very confident that things are going to go very well in Cleveland. The police are there in full force to be helpful to protesters, but also to keep the event safe and free from incident,"" he said.Priebus, who has worked to rally Republicans behind Trump, said the convention should serve as a vehicle to unify more party loyalists behind the New York businessman whose incendiary rhetoric and policy positions have troubled some Republicans.Priebus added that the ""never Trump"" movement has ebbed and that he did not believe any rebellion among Republican delegates at the convention against Trump would succeed.
""It's one thing to be unhappy because your person didn't win. I get that part. But it's another step to now say because I don't like the way this is going, I'm going to take something away from someone who won it fair and square. There's just not a lot of people that are willing to do that,"" he said.Priebus, who has privately counseled Trump, said it is important for him to continue making the case against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton after the FBI concluded she had been ""extremely careless"" in handling some sensitive emails as President Barack Obama's secretary of state.
Trump, at a campaign rally in Ohio on Wednesday, had sharply criticized Clinton at the outset, but then diverted to attacking the news media for how it is covering his campaign.""In a 45-minute rally, he spent a long time on Hillary and I think it's OK for him to divert here and there, but I do think focusing on Hillary is important and a vision for America is important,"" Priebus said.

By Andrea Shalal
| RAF FAIRFORD, England

RAF FAIRFORD, England The U.S. Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin Corp are in the final stages of negotiations about two contracts for 160 fighter jets, tandem deals valued at more than $14 billion, the Pentagon's F-35 program manager said on Saturday.""We're in the end game,"" Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan said in an interview at the Royal International Air Tattoo the world's largest military airshow, where six F-35 Lightning II jets are flying this week.Bogdan said an agreement could be finalised soon, but declined to predict if it could be announced at the Farnborough International Airshow next week. He said all the major issues had been resolved and the fate of the deal was largely in Lockheed's hands at the moment.Lockheed's F-35 program manager Jeff Babione had told reporters on Thursday that he expected to reach an agreement soon about contracts for the ninth and 10th production contracts for the new warplane.
Sources familiar with the two contracts said they would likely be valued between $14 billion and $15 billion.Babione said the price of the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing version of the jet would drop to under $100 million per plane in the 10th low-rate production batch, including an engine built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.Bogdan said he was continuing to work on a block buy deal for international partners on the $379 billion warplane project, the largest arms program in the world, as part of a larger effort to drive down the jets' cost. 
Buying larger numbers of jets at a time -- starting with the 12th production batch of jets -- could generate savings of $2 billion to $2.8 billion, even if the U.S. military was not able to join in until it got congressional approval, he said. The U.S. military services would likely join in starting with the 13th and 14th production lots, which would reduce the initially anticipated savings by ""hundreds of millions of dollars,"" he said.
Bogdan told reporters the program office was carefully assessing any potential impact on trade and tariffs stemming from Britain's vote to leave the European Union, but the initial expectation was that it would not have much impact.A drop in the value of the British pound could help lower some costs, since 15 percent of the jet is built by UK firms.
