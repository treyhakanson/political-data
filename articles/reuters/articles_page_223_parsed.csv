SAN FRANCISCO The Vietnamese government restricted access to Facebook Inc inside Vietnam for several days this week as part of a broader crackdown on human rights and political dissidents during a visit by President Barack Obama, two activist organizations said on Thursday. Officials of Access Now, a digital rights organization, and Viet Tan, a Vietnamese pro-democracy group, said the social media site was restricted and at times blocked inside Vietnam from Sunday to Wednesday, citing reports from people inside the country on Twitter and to Access Now's digital security help service. The move coincides with a trend toward restrictions on Facebook in countries including China, Uganda and Turkey during politically sensitive times as the 1.6 billion-person social network grows more powerful. Obama's three-day visit to Vietnam ended on Wednesday. Obama largely focused on normalizing relations with Vietnam. But he also promoted human rights and chided Vietnam about restrictions on political freedoms after critics of its communist-run government were prevented from meeting him.The Facebook shutdown was part of a stepped-up campaign by the Vietnamese government to limit use of the social network for political protests, activists said in phone interviews. 
Facebook was blocked several times earlier this month as street protests erupted over an environmental disaster that resulted in mass fish deaths, the two groups said.The social media site was also unavailable inside Vietnam ahead of parliamentary elections on Sunday as pro-democracy activists called for a boycott, members of the two groups said.
Facebook declined to comment. Vietnamese government officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted via a government website. Uganda's government blocked Facebook and Twitter Inc in February during presidential elections. In March, after a deadly bombing in Turkey, an Ankara court ordered a ban on access to Facebook and Twitter.And during the 2011 Arab Spring in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, social networks were repeatedly shut down. 
Facebook is often shut down in Vietnam during politically sensitive times, Angelina Huynh, advocacy director for Viet Tan, which has members around the world, including in Vietnam, said in a phone interview. ""People were using Facebook to call for protests. They did not want people to take to the streets,"" Huynh said.  (Reporting By Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"	['Obama']	[]

By Brendan O'Brien

Five mayors in northern California on Thursday asked Governor Jerry Brown in a letter to have surveillance cameras installed on state highways in the area after a string of shootings that have gripped their communities.  The request came two days after a man was shot in the leg while traveling eastbound on I-80 in Hercules, California, the 28th such shooting on the state highway system east of San Francisco during the last six months, authorities said.  ""This is of increasing concern to our elected officials and residents who feel as if our communities are under siege,"" said the letter signed by the mayors of Pinole, Richmond and Hercules. The mayors of San Pablo and El Cerrito also signed the letter. 
Since November 2015, four people have been killed and 12 wounded in shootings that authorities believe are largely gang related, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement.Local and state law enforcement agencies began targeting known gang members and increased patrols since the shootings began along the freeways, the patrol said.        
The mayors asked Brown to support funding for the installation of surveillance cameras with recording capabilities on area freeway ramps and upgrades to current traffic cameras so they would be able to capture and retain images that could be used during investigations. 
The mayors wrote the situation is a ""grave and growing risk""  in their communities where freeways have become a ""battleground.""Officials in Brown's office were not immediately available for comment. San Pablo Mayor Rich Kinney said in an email to Reuters that the mayors, state transportation officials and governor staff are scheduled to meet to discuss the letter on June 6. The California Highway Patrol said five suspects have been arrested in connection with the string of shootings, some of whom may have been involved in more than one incident. "	['Richmond']	[]

| WASHINGTON/ SAN FRANCISCO

WASHINGTON/ SAN FRANCISCO After a rampage that left 14 people dead in San Bernardino, key U.S. lawmakers pledged to seek a law requiring technology companies to give law enforcement agencies a ""back door"" to encrypted communications and electronic devices, such as the iPhone used by one of the shooters.Now, only months later, much of the support is gone, and the push for legislation dead, according to sources in congressional offices, the administration and the tech sector. Draft legislation that Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Intelligence Committee, had circulated weeks ago likely will not be introduced this year and, even if it were, would stand no chance of advancing, the sources said.Key among the problems was the lack of White House support for legislation in spite of a high-profile court showdown between the Justice Department and Apple Inc over the suspect iPhone, according to Congressional and Obama Administration officials and outside observers.""They've dropped anchor and taken down the sail,"" former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden said.For years, the Justice Department lobbied unsuccessfully for a way to unmask suspects who ""go dark,"" or evade detection through coded communications in locked devices.When the Federal Bureau of Investigation took Apple to court in February to try to open the iPhone in its investigation of the San Bernardino slayings, the cause gained traction in Washington. The political landscape had shifted - or so it seemed.The short life of the push for legislation illustrates the intractable nature of the debate over digital surveillance and encryption, which has been raging in one form or another since the 1990s.Tech companies, backed by civil liberties groups, insist that building law enforcement access into phones and other devices would undermine security for everyone-including the U.S. government itself.Law enforcement agencies maintain they need a way to monitor  phone calls, emails and text messages, along with access to encrypted data. Polls show the public is split on whether the government should have access to all digital data.The legal battle between the FBI and Apple briefly united many around the idea that Congress - not the courts - should decide the issue. But the consensus was fleeting.
Feinstein's Democratic colleagues on the Intelligence Committee - along with some key Republicans - backed away. The House never got on board.The CIA and NSA were ambivalent, according to several current and former intelligence officials, in part because officials in the agencies feared any new law would interfere with their own encryption efforts.Even supporters worried that if a bill were introduced but failed, it would give Apple and other tech companies another weapon to use in future court battles.Burr had said repeatedly that legislation was imminent.    But last week, he and Feinstein told Reuters there was no timeline for the bill. Feinstein said she planned to talk to more tech stakeholders, and Burr said, ""be patient.""In the meantime, tech companies have accelerated encryption efforts in the wake of the Apple case. The court showdown ended with a whimper when the FBI said it had found a way to get into the phone, and subsequently conceded privately it had found nothing of value.
THE FBI GOES TO BATTLE
A week after the San Bernardino attack, Burr told Reuters passing encryption legislation was urgent because ""if we don't, we will be reading about terrorist attacks on a more frequent basis.""FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee soon after that encryption was ""overwhelmingly affecting"" the investigation of murders, drug trafficking and child pornography.A week later, the Justice Department persuaded a judge to issue a sweeping order demanding Apple write software to open an iPhone used by San Bernardino suspect Sayeed Farook, who died in a shootout with law enforcement.
Apple fought back, arguing, among other things, that only Congressional legislation could authorize what the court was demanding. Many saw the Justice Department's move as a way to bring pressure on Congress to act.President Obama appeared to tacitly support Comey's court fight and the idea that there should be limits on criminal suspects' ability to hide behind encryption. But even as the drive for legislation seemed to be gaining momentum, consensus was dissipating.Senator Lindsey Graham, an influential Republican, withdrew  support in a sudden about-face.""I was all with you until I actually started getting briefed by the people in the intel community,"" Graham told Attorney General Loretta Lynch during a hearing in March. ""I'm a person that's been moved by the arguments of the precedent we set and the damage we may be doing to our own national security.""On the Democratic side, Senator Ron Wyden vowed to filibuster what he called a ""dangerous proposal,"" that ""would leave Americans more vulnerable to stalkers, identity thieves, foreign hackers and criminals."" Senator Mark Warner advanced a competing bill to form a commission to study the issue. A half dozen people familiar with the White House deliberations said they were hamstrung by a long-standing split within the Obama Administration, pitting Comey and the DOJ against technology advisors and other agencies including the Commerce and State Departments.[L2N16C1UC]They also said there was reluctance to take on the tech industry in an election year.

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND The state of Ohio filed a federal court appeal on Thursday seeking to restore a Republican-backed limit on early voting and accelerated voter-registration measures that were seen by civil rights groups as boosting minority turnout.U.S. District Judge Michael Watson in Columbus ruled on Tuesday that Ohio violated voters' rights by reducing the period that ballots could be cast before an election to four weeks   from five weeks.Watson's decision also struck down Ohio's elimination of a seven-day window during which residents could both register to vote and cast their ballots all in the same week - a period known as ""Golden Week.""Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature abolished ""Golden Week"" and shortened early voting by seven days in 2014, drawing a legal challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.Watson sided with the ACLU and NAACP in finding that both changes, which critics said directly limited opportunities for minority participation in elections, violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and were unconstitutional.
On Thursday, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, petitioned the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review Watson's decision, which he said scrapped a court-approved settlement the state previously reached with the ACLU and NAACP on early voting.The settlement allowed voters to cast ballots on multiple Sundays leading up to a presidential election and provided for additional evening voting hours, according to ACLU documents.
Husted said Golden Week had become an administrative problem for state elections officials and increased the potential for voter fraud, arguing its elimination had broad bipartisan support.The Ohio Democratic Party countered with a statement accusing Republican state officials of ""defending a law that clear data showed imposed a stark discriminatory impact on Ohio's African-American voters.""The appeal came a day after the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation that would require any resident or organization to post a cash bond with a local court in order to keep polling stations open later than scheduled on election day.
Judges in Ohio have on occasion ordered some polls to extend their hours because of voting equipment problems, major traffic issues and severe weather, including during the 2016 primaries.Opponents of the bill have said it violates the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which expressly prohibits the imposition of a ""poll tax.""

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The rancorous political debate over sexual identity unexpectedly prompted the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to reject an energy and water spending bill on Thursday after Democrats attached an amendment to protect the rights of transgender people.The legislation, which would provide funds for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, failed on a 112-305 vote, with 130 Republicans and 175 Democrats opposing the legislation.The outcome was such a surprise that the House Appropriations Committee initially announced the bill had passed and was forced to retract the statement. Democrats blamed Republicans for opposing a Democratic amendment to bar federal contractors from government work if they discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Democrats failed to attach the same measure to a separate House spending bill last week.
""In turning against a far-reaching funding bill simply because it affirms protections for LGBT Americans, Republicans have once again lain bare the depths of their bigotry,"" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.But Republicans accused Democrats of working to sabotage the House appropriations process by voting 6-175 against the bill after they had succeeded in amending it.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said his own decision not to keep legislation under tight control had created conditions for ""more amendments from both sides of the aisle ... and, yes, more unpredictability.""  ""That's what happened here today. It's unfortunate, because this is a very good bill,"" Ryan said. He vowed to continue pushing the energy and water bill, along with other appropriations measures.
Democrats said they opposed two Republican amendments. One would prevent Washington from witholding federal funds from North Carolina over its law on LGBT bathroom use. The other would have stopped the Democrats' LGBT amendment from affecting religious workplace exemptions.The White House had already threatened to veto the legislation over other provisions that Democrats said would undermine the Clean Water Act.

Mississippi's Republican governor said on Thursday he planned to join a lawsuit by officials from 11 states to overturn an Obama administration directive that tells schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity.The lawsuit led by Texas, the most significant legal challenge to this month's directive, said the federal government and Obama administration officials overreached their authority by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states.""Our office has talked to the Texas attorney general's office and I intend, as soon as possible, to join the lawsuit against this latest example of federal overreach,"" Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement.As with some of the other states, Mississippi's governor and attorney general disagree on the suit, which challenges the administration's interpretation that federal civil rights laws against sex discrimination should apply to transgender people.Mississippi's attorney general, Democrat Jim Hood, declined to participate in the lawsuit, according to Clay Chandler, a spokesman for the governor. Chandler said Bryant will work with an attorney in the governor's office in joining the lawsuit.
Hood's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obama's administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority.
Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizona's Department of Education and Maine's governor.The lawsuit said the administration ""conspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.""
Transgender rights advocates criticized the suit as a malicious attack, saying there have never been public safety incidents or invasions of privacy related to protections for transgender people.""While the department will review the complaint, the federal government has strong legal foundations to uphold the civil rights of transgender Americans,"" the Justice Department said in a statement on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON An unconventional debate between a billionaire Republican and a democratic socialist is shaping up in California after presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders expressed an interest in squaring off against each other.Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is still in a primary battle against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, while Trump effectively clinched the Republican Party's nomination earlier this month when his two remaining rivals dropped out.In an appearance on ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" late Wednesday, Trump said he was willing to participate in such an event against Sanders.""If I debated him, we would have such high ratings,"" the New York developer and reality television star said. ""I think I should ... take that money and give it to some worthy charity.""Sanders appeared to agree in a post on Twitter on Thursday.
""Game on,"" he tweeted. ""I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.""Trump and Sanders have gone through a series of debates against rivals within their parties but Republican and Democratic presidential candidates usually do not debate each other until the parties have selected a nominee.The hashtag #BernieTrumpDebate began trending in the United States with news of the possible debate.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email to Reuters on Thursday there were no formal plans yet for such an event. Representatives for the Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Kimmel said he asked Trump about the debate at the suggestion of Sanders, who is scheduled to appear on the show Thursday night.
Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who was elected to Congress as an independent and has made economic equality a keystone of his campaign, had first challenged Clinton to a California debate. He said he was disappointed when the former secretary of state declined. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to a possible Trump-Sanders debate.Clinton has tried to woo Sanders supporters as she works to secure the party's nomination for the Nov. 8 election. But some worry his supporters - who are largely young, working-class and disillusioned with party establishment - will turn instead to political neophyte Trump, who has championed a populist agenda.Sanders has said he will do everything he can to ensure that Trump does not win the White House.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch wrote in an opinion piece published on Thursday that his meeting with Merrick Garland failed to change his view that the Senate should not act on President Barack Obama's U.S. Supreme Court nominee.The problem is that no such meeting had yet taken place. Later in the day, the Utah senator issued a statement announcing that he would meet with Garland on Thursday, calling the appeals court judge ""an honorable public servant who deserves our respect"" but reiterating that the Senate should not act now.Paul Edwards, executive editor of the Deseret News in Hatch's home state of Utah, said by email the article was a draft that was mistakenly published on newspaper's website, and apologized to Hatch and the newspaper's readers for ""this unfortunate error.""""Like many of my Senate colleagues, I recently met with Chief Judge Merrick Garland,"" Hatch wrote in the piece.""Our meeting, however, does not change my conviction that the Senate should consider a Supreme Court nominee after this presidential election cycle,"" Hatch added.
The 82-year-old Hatch, first elected to the Senate in 1976, is the longest-serving Senate Republican and is a long-time and influential member of the Judiciary Committee that considers Supreme Court nominees.Hatch has joined with the Senate's Republican leaders in asserting that Obama's successor, to be determined in the Nov. 8 presidential election, should fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February.
Democrats have accused Senate Republicans of ignoring their constitutional duties by refusing to consider Garland's nomination.A copy of the article was archived by Google after the Deseret News removed it. ""The electronic publication of this version, awaiting edits from the Senator following his meeting with Judge Garland, was inadvertent,"" Edwards added.The article illustrated how unshakeable Republican opposition has been to Obama, a Democrat, appointing a replacement for Scalia. If a Democratic president appoints Scalia's replacement, that would likely end decades of a conservative majority on the court.
Obama nominated Garland on March 16.Hatch helped break a partisan log jam in the Senate against Garland two decades ago when President Bill Clinton nominated him to an appeals court. Garland won Senate confirmation in 1997. (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"	['Obama', 'Paul', 'Lawrence', 'Clinton', 'Hatch']	[]
