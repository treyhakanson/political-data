A former top CIA official attacked Donald Trump on Friday as a danger to national security, saying President Vladimir Putin had made the Republican presidential candidate an ""unwitting agent"" of Russia.Putin had flattered Trump into supporting positions favorable to Russia, Michael Morell, a longtime CIA officer and former deputy director of the agency, said in an opinion piece in The New York Times.""In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation,"" Morell said, in an article in which he endorsed Trump's rival in the Nov. 8 election, Democrat Hillary Clinton.Morell did not provide evidence for his assertion, but he said Putin had used skills from his past as an intelligence officer to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in an individual.""That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump's vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated,"" Morell wrote.Trump's campaign dismissed Morell's criticism, linking the ex-CIA officer to the Obama administration's public response after the September 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.
""Count how many reporters will tweet today that Michael Morell lied for #CrookedHillary to cover up Benghazi,"" Trump's campaign said in a Twitter message. The incident, in which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed, occurred while Clinton was secretary of state, and Republicans have long criticized her handling of the attack and its aftermath.Critics say administration officials tried to play down the role of Islamist militants in the attacks. Morell approved talking points after the incident. U.S. officials have said any reference to militants taking part was initially dropped for classification reasons.
Morell is currently affiliated with Beacon Global Strategies, a consulting firm with ties to senior Democrats with national security expertise, including former defense secretary and CIA director Leon Panetta and former top Clinton aide Philippe Reines. Trump's vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, on Friday dismissed Morell's comments, saying that  ""standing up to Russian aggression is going to be really different under a Trump-Pence administration.""""These people are playing politics,"" Pence said of Morell in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" program. 
Morell's article, in which he also said Trump had undermined U.S. security with his campaign proposal to combat terrorism by imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, added to questions raised by some national security experts about the New York businessman's qualifications to be president.On Thursday, a bipartisan group of experts criticized Trump's lukewarm support for the NATO alliance, comments about Russia's annexation of Crimea and other matters as ""disgraceful.""Trump has also drawn criticism for his praise for Putin as a strong leader, particularly after Moscow came under suspicion from U.S. officials as being behind recent hacking of Democratic Party groups. Moscow has denied the allegations.  (Reporting by Emily Stephenson, Mark Hosenball and Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry)"	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Jill Serjeant

 (Please note strong language in paragraphs 3, 11)By Jill SerjeantClint Eastwood, the 86-year-old four-time Oscar winner, excoriated the current generation of Americans as weak and overly sensitive while backing Donald Trump even though the Republican presidential hopeful has ""said a lot of dumb things.""Eastwood, a prominent celebrity supporter of the Republican Party who appeared at its 2012 U.S. presidential nominating convention, offered a harsh assessment of Americans in an interview with Esquire magazine published on Wednesday.""He's onto something because secretly everybody's getting tired of political correctness, kissing up,"" the acclaimed actor and director said of Trump. ""That's the kiss-ass generation we're in right now. We're really in a pussy generation. Everybody's walking on eggshells.""""We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren't called racist,"" Eastwood added.Given the choice between Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Trump in the Nov. 8 election, the celebrated star of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" said, ""That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump ... you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps.""
In one of the most unusual speeches at a major U.S. party convention, Eastwood four years ago addressed an empty chair used to symbolically represent President Barack Obama on stage at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, in a rambling denunciation of Obama.Asked by Esquire what troubled him most, Eastwood referred to his chair speech.""What troubles me ... I guess when I did that silly thing at the Republican convention, talking to the chair,"" Eastwood said.
In the interview, Eastwood made reference to the uproar in May that followed Trump's comments accusing the judge overseeing a fraud lawsuit involving Trump University real-estate seminars of being biased against him because of Trump's pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to block illegal immigrants. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel is an American of Mexican descent.Eastwood told Esquire that Trump was portrayed as ""a racist now because he's talked about this judge.""""And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion on the fact that the guy was born to Mexican parents or something,"" Eastwood said. ""He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody - the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist,' and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.""
There were more than 100 tweets per minute about Eastwood on Twitter by Thursday afternoon. More than half of the tweets mentioning the Hollywood star were of negative sentiment, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.""Clint Eastwood was born in 1930. Let's start a list of things that weren't considered racist when he was growing up,"" tweeted Sarah McBride, the national press secretary of the Human Rights Campaign gay rights group.Others praised Eastwood, who rose to fame playing surly cowboys and cops. ""Thank you Clint Eastwood. You've always been a personal hero. You said what needed to be said,"" tweeted a person named Ruari.

By Steve Gorman

The mayor of Stockton, California, was arrested on Thursday on a felony eavesdropping charge stemming from a strip poker game he is accused of surreptitiously recording at a summer camp he hosts for disadvantaged inner-city children, prosecutors said.Mayor Anthony Ray Silva, 41, was also charged with three misdemeanor counts - contributing to the delinquency of a minor, child endangerment and furnishing alcoholic beverages to individuals under the legal drinking age of 21, according to a criminal complaint filed in court.Silva is accused of using his cellphone to make an audio recording of conversation among several young people, including a 16-year-old boy, who were playing strip poker with the mayor inside his cabin at the camp.Prosecutors said in a media statement it was evident that the participants, who were naked, were recorded against their will. Amador County District Attorney Todd Riebe said those present besides the mayor included two to three females and three males, all ranging in age from 18 to 20.The criminal complaint further accuses Silva of supplying alcohol to six underage youths. Prosecutors said some were camp counselors.
The incidents, according to prosecutors, took place last August at the Stockton Silver Lake Camp in Amador County, which lies in California Gold Country on the edge of the Sierras northeast of Stockton.In addition to hosting unprivileged children at the city-leased camp each summer, Silva has served as president of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Stockton for the past six years.
Silva's lawyer, Mark Reichel, told Reuters his client ""will be vindicated"" and suggested the case was politically motivated, noting that the mayor, a Republican, faces a tough election run-off in November against a Democratic city councilman.Asked whether Silva was playing strip poker with youths from his camp, Reichel replied, ""I highly doubt it."" Reichel added, ""I can't wait to fight them in court, so we can expose the epidemic of kids at summer camp playing strip poker.""Silva was elected mayor of Stockton, a city of about 300,000 east of San Francisco, in November 2012, months after the municipality filed for bankruptcy. The city emerged from bankruptcy protection in February 2015.
Silva, who is not married, was arrested by FBI agents Thursday morning at the camp and released on $20,000 bond later in the day. His next court date is Aug. 18. If convicted of the charges, he could face up to three years in prison. (Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Tom Brown, Bill Rigby and Bernard Orr)"	[]	[]

By Jeff Mason and Timothy Gardner
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama confirmed on Thursday that Donald Trump will get national security briefings ahead of the November election, but he warned the Republican candidate, whom he has called ""unfit"" for office, that information from the meetings must be kept secret.Obama, a Democrat who endorsed his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 White House race, has made clear his dismay over Trump, a New York businessman who has proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States and building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.On Tuesday Obama questioned why leading Republicans have not withdrawn their support for their presidential nominee. On Thursday he dismissed as ridiculous Trump's claims that the election may be rigged.""Of course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?"" Obama said with exasperation. ""If Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on Election Day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. That doesn't seem to be the case at the moment.""Trump is trailing Clinton in polls.
Despite his disdain, Obama said Trump would get the top secret briefings on world crises and security threats to which he, Clinton and their respective vice presidential running mates are entitled.Some Republicans have said Clinton should be denied access to such briefings because of her handling of classified material on a private email server while she was secretary of state. Obama on Thursday, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, made clear that both candidates would be treated equally.
""We are going to go by the law, which is that, in both tradition and the law, that if somebody is the nominee ... they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared,"" Obama said.""What I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings,"" he added, in response to a question about whether he was concerned about Trump obtaining the classified information. ""And if they want to be president, they got to start acting like president, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.""Trump has placed blame on Clinton and Obama for the rise of Islamic State, also known as ISIS.
""The Obama-Clinton foreign policy gave rise to ISIS, made Iran flush with cash, and is now admitting vast numbers of refugees and migrants into the United States from some of the most volatile regions in the world,"" Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement.""But none of this is surprising from an Administration that allowed its Secretary of State to threaten the country with a private email server, delete her records, and lie about it to us all,"" Miller said.Obama, who was meeting with his national security advisers about the fight against Islamic State, also made a subtle jab at Trump for his dispute with a Muslim couple whose U.S. Army captain son died in Iraq. Obama lauded ""patriotic Muslim Americans"" who fight in the U.S. armed forces.

By Steve Holland and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON/PORTLAND, Me.

WASHINGTON/PORTLAND, Me. Supporters of Republican Donald Trump urged him to get back on message on Thursday after a week of dropping opinion poll numbers and a war of words with ranking Republicans over his U.S. presidential campaign.In response to the criticism, Trump pledged to focus more on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who emerged from last week's Democratic National Convention with a lead in the polls and who has been consistently attacking him as temperamentally unfit for the presidency.At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday, Trump kept his attention on trying to undermine Clinton's candidacy. He said the fact that she has moved past a scandal over her use of a private email server as President Barack Obama's secretary of state was ""probably the greatest accomplishment that she has ever had in politics.""Since formally accepting the Republican nomination two weeks ago, Trump has exasperated many supporters by getting bogged down in a public spat with the parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq and some fellow Republicans.Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross said he still backed Trump, but urged him to stop engaging in exchanges that benefit the Democrats and make the real estate mogul's behavior the issue in the campaign.""This election is Donald's to lose and so far the Democrats have been clever about baiting him and he generally has bitten,"" Ross said in an email to Reuters late on Wednesday.U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed Trump but has not received a reciprocal endorsement from the New York businessman in his re-election bid, told WTAQ radio host Jerry Bader in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that Trump has ""had a pretty strange run since the convention.""""You would think we ought to be focusing on Hillary Clinton, on all of her deficiencies. She is such a weak candidate that one would think we'd be on offense against Hillary Clinton, and it is distressing that that's not what we're talking about these days,"" he said.Michael Caputo, a former Trump adviser who still supports him, said Trump still has time to right the ship.""Staying on message is absolutely key,"" Caputo told Reuters. ""After 30 years of speaking his mind, Mr. Trump has to understand that the general election for president of the United States is all about staying on message.""Actor and director Clint Eastwood, a prominent celebrity supporter of the Republican Party who appeared at its 2012 U.S. presidential nominating convention, offered an alternative view, saying Trump says some ""dumb things"" but that Americans should get over it.
""He's onto something because secretly everybody's getting tired of political correctness, kissing up,"" the acclaimed actor and director told Esquire magazine. ""That's the kiss-ass generation we're in right now.""At the same time, Trump's lukewarm support for the NATO alliance drew criticism from 37 national security experts from both Democratic and Republican administrations.""We find Trump's comments to be reckless, dangerous, and extremely unwise,"" they wrote in a statement.Obama, at a Pentagon news conference, dismissed Trump's statements that the election could be ""rigged"" against him.""Of course, the elections will not be rigged,"" he said.
Trump's rough patch has contributed to a dip in support in some battleground states. A WBUR/MassINC poll in New Hampshire showed Clinton leading Trump, 47 percent to 32 percent.Other polls showed Trump down 11 percentage points to Clinton in Pennsylvania and 6 percentage points in Florida, two states that are important to his chances of winning the election.Trump's troubles are emboldening Democrats to think big.Speaking with reporters after a Clinton campaign event in Las Vegas, U.S. Senator Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, said he believed traditionally Republican-leaning states such as Arizona and Georgia are going to be competitive this election, and he expects Clinton to campaign there.In Portland, some people at Trump's rally said the candidate should stop getting distracted.""I don't like how he gets off track,"" said Bill Devine, 65, of Bath, Maine. ""He needs to stay focused on his campaign.""
Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told CBS's ""This Morning"" that the campaign is comfortable where it stands now and said the news media have built a false narrative in which Democrats are controlling the race to the Nov. 8 election.Manafort said that Trump's dropping poll numbers ""were expected"" and that he expected the numbers to even out soon.""The framework of this election favors Donald Trump. If we run the campaign that we plan on running, we think we're going to win,"" he said. Concern about Trump has spilled into at least one congressional race.U.S. Representative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, has released a campaign ad in his own re-election bid promising to ""stand up"" to Trump if Trump is elected.""People ask me, 'What do you think about Trump?' Honestly, I don't care for him much. And I certainly don't trust Hillary,"" Coffman said in the ad.U.S. Representative Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican, told MSNBC he could not endorse Trump because of ""all these unforced errors"" that Trump was making.""It just seems that he's, at times, hell-bent on losing a very winnable election to a very seriously flawed candidate: Hillary Clinton,"" Dent said.

By Olivia Oran and Amanda Becker
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Groups of wealthy Republicans unhappy with Donald Trump have been privately courting prominent peers to join them in backing Democrat Hillary Clinton's U.S. presidential bid, several people involved in the effort told Reuters.They say they are seeking money and endorsements from other Republicans disillusioned by Trump, their party's candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Some have received encouragement from Clinton and members of her campaign staff. ""I made the decision that I wouldn't be able to look at my grandkids if I voted for Trump,"" said Dan Webb, a former federal prosecutor and a self-described ""Republican for decades"" working to win over prominent Republican business people in Chicago.Trump, a New York developer making his first run at public office, has made traditional Republican donors uneasy with inflammatory statements about women, Mexicans, Muslims and war veterans, among others. Big-name Wall Street donors can make a difference for Clinton. They could inject big money into a campaign. They might influence moderate Republicans to switch sides. Their support of Clinton challenges Trump's assertion that his business successes make him a better candidate for president.With the political conventions barely over, the Republican effort to fundraise for Clinton is at an early stage. Some of the groups have yet to receive contributions because they must still file paperwork under campaign finance rules.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to comment for this story. Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said business leaders are supporting Clinton because of her economic plan and because Trump ""cannot be trusted to lead our economy.""
WARY OF TRUMP
Groups formed to support Clinton include Republicans for Her 2016, run by Republican lobbyist Craig Snyder; a grassroots organization called R4C16, led by John Stubbs and Ricardo Reyes,  officials in former President George W. Bush's administration; and the Republican Women for Hillary group co-led by Jennifer Pierotti Lim, an official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The first two groups are acting independently of Clinton's own effort. The third is acting in concert with her campaign.""We wanted to go out there and be the voice for Republicans who were feeling wary about Trump and weird about publicly endorsing Hillary,"" said Pierotti Lim, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention at the Clinton team's invitation.Webb, a partner at law firm Winston & Strawn, said he began his outreach after being approached by billionaire investor J.B. Pritzker and longtime Clinton associate Lanny Davis. Pritzker and Davis could not be reached for comment.
On Wednesday, billionaire hedge fund manager Seth Klarman said he would work to get Clinton elected because of comments by Trump he found ""shockingly unacceptable."" Although Klarman, who is the president and chief executive of The Baupost Group, is a registered independent, a review of filings shows his political giving has largely benefited Republicans over the years, including some of Trump's rivals in the state-by-state nominating contests this year.Jim Cicconi, a former Reagan and George H.W. White House staff member and lifelong Republican, said he went public with his decision to support Clinton ""to encourage others in my situation to do the same thing.""""I feel like I need to do something more than quietly pulling the lever,"" he said. ""I'm willing to assist the campaign in any way that they want me to help."" 
WHITMAN, BLOOMBERG BACK CLINTON
Spearheading in part the Clinton effort to woo Republicans on Wall Street is Democratic strategist Leslie Dach, a former Walmart executive and aide to Bill Clinton, sources close to the Clinton campaign said. People familiar with the Clinton drive say the Democratic nominee herself has spoken to Republican business leaders, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise Chief Executive Meg Whitman, who endorsed Clinton on Tuesday.Clinton deputies courted former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ahead of a rousing speech he gave at last month's Democratic National Convention that urged Wall Street to support her.Whether Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire media mogul and an erstwhile Republican, will play a role in courting other Republican business leaders has yet to be determined, a source close to the discussions said.While some major donors are hesitant to back Trump, the candidate over the last month has pulled in millions of dollars in small-money donations to boost total contributions to more than $80 million for Trump's campaign and the Republican Party, nearly matching Clinton's $90 million haul during the same period.

WASHINGTON A group of former U.S. national security officials, including some who have worked for top Republicans, called Donald Trump's recent comments about NATO, Russia's annexation of Crimea and other matters ""disgraceful"" in a letter released on Thursday.In the last month, the Republican presidential nominee has suggested he might not defend NATO allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite Russia to hack the emails of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and suggested he might accept Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.""These are disgraceful statements that betray our longstanding values and national interests embraced by presidents of both parties,"" said the open letter first reported by The Washington Post.Most of the 37 who signed the letter appear to be Democrats, including Madeleine Albright and Leon Panetta, respectively former secretaries of state and defense, but others served under Republican presidents and lawmakers.
Among these, John Bellinger was State Department legal adviser for former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Randy Scheunemann, a neoconservative political operative, was foreign policy advisor to Republican John McCain's presidential campaign.
Other signatories included former career diplomats Tom Pickering, Bill Burns, Nicholas Burns and Marc Grossman, all of whom served as undersecretary of state for political affairs, effectively the third-ranking U.S. diplomat.  The letter is the latest in a series from former national security officials dismayed at the thought of a Trump presidency. In March, more than 90 Republican foreign policy veterans, including former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, signed a letter pledging to oppose Trump and saying his proposals would undermine U.S. security.

WASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that he saw no point in bringing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal for a vote in any ""lame duck"" session of Congress later this year after November elections, because ""we don't have the votes.""""As long as we don't have the votes, I see no point in bringing up an agreement only to defeat it,"" Ryan, a Republican, said in an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio. Despite both U.S. presidential candidates bashing the 12-country Pacific trade deal on the campaign trail, Obama administration officials have pledged to make a major push in coming months to persuade the Republican-majority Congress to pass TPP. Backed by dozens of business and industry groups, officials  from the U.S. Commerce Department, the U.S. Trade Representative's office and the White House say they are continuing to talk with individual lawmakers about the merits of the deal, including its consequences for U.S. leadership in Asia. 
But Ryan said the Obama administration had negotiated a deal that ""cost them dozens of votes in Congress,"" and said the Democratic president needed to renegotiate some components. The speaker said some agricultural and labor provisions needed fixing, and he also believed the deal would reduce intellectual property rights for biologic drugs and pharmaceuticals.
For U.S. drugmakers the deal could reduce the patent protection period to eight years from the current 12. Senator Orrin Hatch, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has also raised this as a major problem with the deal.""They have to fix this agreement and renegotiate some pieces of it if they have any hope or chance of passing it,"" Ryan said in the radio interview, but added that he was doubtful this could happen. ""I don't see how they'll ever get the votes for it.""
