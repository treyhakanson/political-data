WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday rejected criticism of his campaign tactics, in a wide-ranging speech defending his team's use of a Jewish star and his own praise of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.At a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, Trump vented his frustration at a news media he feels is out to derail his candidacy and help Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, deriding CNN, in particular, as the ""Clinton News Network.""Trump's hour-long performance was unlikely to reassure those Republicans who would like to see the New York businessman focus his message on attacking Clinton to rally the party behind him at the Cleveland convention from July 18 to 21 where he is to be formally nominated.He was particularly animated in defending his campaign's use of what was seen to be a Jewish star in a tweet last week that described Clinton as corrupt. The star was replaced with a round emblem after the criticism, but the incident has generated days of controversy.Trump said he thought the star was more the shape of a sheriff's badge. He described as ""sick people"" those in the news media who called it a Jewish Star of David.
Later, Trump tweeted an image of character from a book linked to Disney's movie, ""Frozen"", that used a similarly shaped star on its cover.""Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also? Dishonest media! #Frozen,"" he tweeted.
In his Ohio speech, Trump also returned to the subject of Saddam after generating controversy on Tuesday by complimenting him for his handling of militants.Irritated by the criticism, Trump brought up Saddam again.""So I said bad guy, really bad guy, but he was good at one thing: Killing terrorists... I don't love Saddam Hussein. I hate Saddam Hussein. But he was damned good at killing terrorists,"" Trump said.
Trump also reacted to a mosquito that buzzed near his hand at the podium.""I don't like mosquitoes, I never did. Speaking of mosquitoes, hello Hillary, how are you doing?"" he said. (Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"

By Ginger Gibson and Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee raised nearly $51 million for his presidential campaign in June, after he launched his first aggressive effort at raising cash, Trump's organization reported on Wednesday.The most recent haul dwarfed the $3.1 million the Trump campaign raised in May. That low number prompted widespread concern among Republicans that the New York businessman, a newcomer to politics who largely bankrolled his primary campaign, would be unable to compete with Democrat Hillary Clinton's massive fundraising operation.For June, fundraising emails circulated by the Trump campaign attracted $26 million, in addition to more than $25 million raised in conjunction with the RNC through joint fundraising events in June and the last week of May. The joint funds are intended to help both Trump and candidates in other races, such as people running for Congress, in the Nov. 8 election.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, personally contributed $3.8 million in June, the campaign said, bringing the total contributions for the month to about $55 million.""We just started our fundraising efforts in the last week of May and we are extremely pleased with the broad-based support in the last five weeks for the Trump Campaign and Trump Victory,"" the campaign said in a statement.In June, Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, raised $68.5 million, including $40 million for her campaign and $28 million for the DNC and state victory funds. She began July with $44 million in cash on hand.While Trump's June total far eclipsed the candidate's past hauls, Lisa Spies, a Republican fundraiser who worked for Mitt Romney in 2012 and raised money for Jeb Bush in the 2016 primary, said the dollar count was much lower than the $106 million that Romney, the party's standard-bearer in 2012, brought in during the same month four years ago.""This is his low-hanging fruit, and it's good, I'm not putting it down. But it needs to get much better than this quickly. He's playing a game of catch-up right now,"" Spies said.
Clinton's fundraising advantage has allowed her to build a vastly larger campaign infrastructure.Clinton already has extensive staff operations in the most important battleground states and has begun to run paid advertising. Trump has only a handful of staffers and has made no large television ad purchases.Trump beat 16 rivals in the Republican presidential race, but his free-wheeling style and some of his campaign pledges, such as his plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, have long worried some in the party establishment and he has struggled to unify Republicans behind him. CLINTON'S SUPER PAC ADVANTAGE

The Super PACs supporting Trump, which are permitted to raise and spend unlimited sums but are not allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign, have also struggled to get organized. While there was once a constellation of more than a dozen Super PACs backing him, most of his support has consolidated around Great America PAC, which is being run by veteran political operative Ed Rollins.The PAC is on target to raise $10 million before the July 18 start of the Republican National Convention, said Eric Beach, a top PAC official. They have already seen an uptick in fundraising, bringing in $5 million in June, doubling the May haul of $2.5 million.Great America PAC is using that money to run television ads, and plans to attack Clinton over her use of personal email servers during her time as secretary of state.The Super PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities USA, had raised $88 million by the end of May and had $51 million to spend. The group is already running ads attacking Trump.
Trump got off to a slow start in fundraising, funding much of his primary campaign with his personal wealth in loans that totaled about $50 million. He announced last month he would forgive the loans to his campaign, intending to signal to potential donors that he would not use their funds to repay himself.He held his first fundraiser in late May and had several in June, including a high-dollar event in New York City and several fundraisers in Texas.Trump continues to promise to make contributions to his own campaign. In June, he launched an online fundraising effort by promising to match donations up to $2 million.Trump and Clinton both use joint fundraising agreements with their respective parties.The agreements allow the candidates to accept checks larger than the $5,400 limit that an individual can give to a campaign. Instead, the larger donations are divided up among the campaign, the national party and various state victory funds. All the money is then used to help elect the presidential candidate as well as other candidates.The campaigns and the political parties are permitted to coordinate how they spend that money.

WASHINGTON Republican lawmakers in U.S. Congress on Wednesday rejected two Democratic amendments to provide nearly $1 billion in funding for bipartisan legislation intended to combat America's opioid epidemic, aides said.The rejection, which came during a meeting of U.S. House of Representatives and Senate negotiators on the measure, could undermine Democratic support for final legislation that could come up for a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Friday. The House and Senate each passed its own versions of the legislation in the last few months.House and Senate Democratic lawmakers are now withholding their support for the final version of the bill, according to two Democratic aides.Democratic opposition could prove to be an obstacle, especially in the Senate, where lawmakers need 60 votes to move legislation forward. 
Two amendments, from House and Senate Democrats, would have provided $920 million up front to finance program grants for states. Aides said the programs otherwise require completion of a lengthy appropriations process that could stall in a congressional session shortened by this year's election campaign.
Republican aides were not immediately available for comment. But House Republicans are separately considering a health spending measure that would provide more than $581 million to address opioid abuse.House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra said on Wednesday it was only the latest instance in which legislation with bipartisan backing fell short on funding. ""It's becoming a bit of a joke to say we're concerned and want to do something, when the only thing we'll do is shell of what it actually takes,"" he said.

By Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump's list of potential vice presidential running mates got a little shorter on Wednesday when one prominent U.S. senator withdrew from consideration and a second said she wanted to focus on her home state.The moves by Bob Corker of Tennessee and Joni Ernst of Iowa could complicate Trump's efforts to rally establishment Republicans behind his presidential bid.With Trump looking at a self-imposed deadline of July 15 to announce his pick, there was no indication that the wealthy businessman was anywhere close to reaching what is perhaps the most important decision he will make as the presumptive Republican nominee.Trump is looking to announce his running mate just ahead of the Republican National Convention, to be held July 18-21  in Cleveland, where he is expected to become the party's official nominee.In Cincinnati, Ohio, on Wednesday, Trump campaigned with potential vice presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House of Representatives who is popular in conservative circles.Introducing Trump, Gingrich tried out the role of the No. 2 with a robust attack on presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her email practices, on the same day the Justice Department decided not to levy criminal charges over what the Federal Bureau of Investigation called her ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information when she was secretary of state.""There are two Americas. There's the corrupt Washington of the old order. And there's all the rest of us. I say to you, Enough!"" Gingrich said.
Trump liked what he heard.""I'm not saying it's Newt, but if it's Newt, nobody is going to be beating him in those debates,"" Trump said. Trump told Fox News he has 10 candidates on his vice presidential list, including two generals. One source said Indiana Governor Mike Pence is being pushed internally by some members of Trump's inner circle. A former congressman, Pence met with Trump on Saturday.Corker, from Tennessee, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had wrestled privately over whether to be a contender for the No. 2 position, telling friends he had never been a surrogate for another politician.
Corker spent eight hours at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, then campaigned with Trump in Raleigh, North Carolina. He told reporters he withdrew because ""I just felt like I was far more suited for other types of service.""""You know, it's a highly political role for the next four months,"" he said. ""I view myself as deep in substance and policy, and I just think there are better ways for me to serve in the public arena.""His withdrawal eliminates an important party establishment figure as Trump tries to broaden his appeal with plans to visit Republicans in the Senate and House on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
""Corker's withdrawal could be considered a canary in the coal mine with establishment Republicans who are convinced that Trump cannot stay on message and can't stay focused on attacking Hillary Clinton without doing some type of damage to his campaign,"" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean.Some Republicans felt Trump erred by not taking full political advantage of FBI Director James Comey's statement on Tuesday that Clinton mishandled classified emails.In Raleigh, Trump sharply attacked Clinton but strayed from the message by saying the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had done a good job cracking down on militants.Ernst, a rising figure in the Republican Party, spent part of the Fourth of July holiday on Monday meeting with Trump.She seemed to be leaning against the vice presidential position, and told Politico, ""I made that very clear to him that I'm focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is."" (Reporting by Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Leslie Adler)"

By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Allen
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The FBI's harsh criticism of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email system as U.S. secretary of state could make it difficult for some of her closest aides to keep or renew government security clearances, but it would not affect Clinton herself if she is elected president, experts said.Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Tuesday an FBI investigation had found evidence that Clinton, now the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, and her aides ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information"" at the State Department. Comey said he would not recommend that the Justice Department bring criminal charges - a recommendation accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday - but the FBI director noted that people found to have been similarly careless often face consequences in the form of ""security or administrative sanctions."" Most administrative sanctions, anything from a reprimand to a dismissal, can't be imposed on Clinton and three of her closest aides Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin as they have already left government, experts of the government's classified information regime said.But legal experts said that if Clinton aides were found to have treated classified material with extreme carelessness that could give the government reason to consider denying them a security clearance in the future or suspending or revoking one they may currently have. ""If the system is fair and equitable, then they should all have difficulty maintaining or obtaining a security clearance in the future,"" said Mark Zaid, a Washington D.C.-based attorney who specializes in national security matters.Steven Aftergood, a Federation of American Scientists expert on national security and classification policy, noted, however, that Comey had highlighted what he called a problematic security culture at the State Department. ""So it might be hard to penalize individuals for this episode if their entire agency embraced similar practices,"" Aftergood said. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to elaborate on Comey's statement, which did not name any of the aides. The Clinton campaign did not respond to questions about the security clearances of Clinton, Mills, Sullivan and Abedin, nor did lawyers for the three aides. 
Abedin, who has been a personal aide to Clinton for about 20 years, and Sullivan, Clinton's policy director at the State Department, sent information the government now says is classified to Clinton's unauthorized private email account, according to email records released by the State Department.It remains unclear if they sent any of the 110 emails that Comey said contained information that was classified at the time they were written. The only author of such emails he identified was Clinton herself.A small number of other department colleagues sent  information the government has since marked as classified to Clinton's account less frequently, the records show. The government forbids handling classified government secrets outside secured channels it controls. Clinton has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information through her private email server.Both Abedin and Sullivan now hold senior roles in Clinton's presidential campaign and are widely expected to join a Clinton administration if she is elected on Nov. 8. Mills, who also passed along information the government now deems classified, has continued to work as a lawyer for Clinton but has no formal role in the campaign. It unclear if she will seek a role in a Clinton administration.
SENATE BLOCK?
Some presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, and lawmakers could use any past criticism of an aide's handling of government secrets as a reason to block their appointment to a Senate-confirmed job, said William J. Leonard, a former director of the federal government's Information Security Oversight Office.The State Department declined to discuss individual cases and said that as a matter of policy it does not publicly disclose who has a security clearance. But it said it can apply security sanctions, such as putting a black mark on a person's permanent personnel file that would come up in future background checks, even against former employees.
For those former officials who maintain an active security clearance, they could lose it.""Department policy is to maintain files on personnel who are found to have mishandled information to guide current and potential future decisions about employment and security clearances,"" John Kirby, a department spokesman, said in a statement. Without knowing precisely what the FBI found about the actions of specific Clinton aides, it is impossible to say what  effect there may be on their current or future security clearances.Paul Ryan, the House Speaker and the most senior elected Republican official, said on Wednesday that Clinton should be denied the security clearance required to receive the customary intelligence briefing that government officials give to presidential nominees before the election.Presidents and other elected national officeholders are not required to have background checks to receive government secrets, according to experts and the Central Intelligence Agency.""It would roil our system of representative democracy if a security official could say that the president ... can't have a security clearance,"" said McAdoo Gordon, an attorney with extensive experience in security clearance matters.

By John Whitesides
| ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton visited the famous boardwalk in Atlantic City on Wednesday to highlight Republican rival Donald Trump's casino bankruptcies, warning he would bring the same cutthroat approach to managing the U.S. economy.Clinton, standing next to the shuttered Trump Plaza casino that Trump once owned, said the real estate developer routinely profited from the financial ruin of workers in the economically depressed seaside resort town.""The people he's trying to convince to vote for him are the same people he's been exploiting for years - working people, small-business people,"" Clinton said.Clinton said Trump's casino bankruptcies and numerous complaints against him by contractors showed he cannot be trusted to set economic policy from the White House.""He makes over-the-top promises and says if people trust in him, put their faith in him, he'll deliver,"" she said. ""Then everything falls apart, people get hurt, and Donald gets paid.""The Trump Plaza was one of four casinos Trump once owned in Atlantic City. He left the city after his last bankruptcy.Clinton frequently uses criticism of Trump's business record to illustrate a principle campaign theme - that the wealthy New Yorker is only interested in boosting his financial bottom line, and not concerned about the economic struggles of working Americans.Clinton reminded supporters who gathered on the boardwalk under a boiling sun, within steps of the city's beach, that Trump had promised to ""do for the country what I did for my business.""
She said Trump intentionally ran up hundreds of millions of debt on his companies, borrowed at high rates, defaulted on the loans, and left in the lurch the workers and contractors who relied on his casinos for income.""That says everything you need to know about Donald Trump,"" Clinton said. ""It's not about what he can build. It's about how much he can take.""ECONOMIC STRUGGLES

Atlantic City has struggled economically in recent years as a series of casinos have closed. The city's 10 percent unemployment rate is nearly double the national average, and closed buildings pockmark its boardwalk.In an emailed statement, Trump defended his bankruptcy filings on casinos and other projects as a commonly used practice to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs.""I created thousands of jobs and made a lot of money in Atlantic City, which was what, as a businessman, I am supposed to do for my company and my family - and as President I will make America rich again,"" he said.""Nobody understands the economy like I do and no one, especially not Crooked Hillary Clinton, will do more for the economy than I will."" 
After the speech, Clinton drove a few blocks to shake hands with dozens of striking workers outside the Trump Taj Mahal, another of the casinos that Trump once owned.Her attack on Trump's business dealings came as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee blasted her integrity following an FBI report that criticized her use of private email during her tenure as secretary of state.Clinton did not address the email issue during her stop in Atlantic City.On Tuesday, FBI Director James Comey said the agency would recommend no criminal charges against Clinton for her use of private email servers. But Comey rebuked her for what he said was ""extremely careless"" handling of classified material on her email servers, and contradicted her claims that she never transmitted or received classified material on that email system.Republican lawmakers criticized Comey for what they saw as lax treatment of Clinton, and on Wednesday, committee chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, announced that Comey will testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday to explain the bureau's ""surprising and confusing"" recommendation.The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of personal email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, including whether she mishandled classified information on the servers.

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign laid out states critical to the U.S. presidential election in a memo to supporters dated Wednesday, including six with key minority populations - Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, Colorado and Nevada.The memo, sent to ""interested parties"" from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, also set a goal of raking in $4 million a day between now and the Nov. 8 election, or around $500 million total.The memo, which was shared with Reuters by a Clinton supporter, emphasized the importance of boosting turnout among minority voters in the race against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.""If we fail to turn out African-American voters in Ohio, North Carolina or Virginia, we will lose. If we fail to turn out Hispanic voters in Florida, Colorado or Nevada, we will lose,"" Mook wrote.  
""If we fail to turn out Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters in Nevada or Virginia, we will lose. Plain and simple,"" he added.The memo emphasized the need for ""the most aggressive Get-Out-The-Vote (GOTV) program in history"" across the country and named other states, such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, as key to the campaign's efforts.
The campaign declined to comment.Clinton's lead over Trump widened to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.
The poll showed 46 percent of likely voters supporting Clinton, with 33 percent backing Trump. But 22 percent said they would not support either candidate.That support is lopsided among different racial and ethnic groups. Among the smaller sample of black voters, for example, Clinton has a whopping 80 percent support, while with white voters the two candidates are just about even, according to the poll.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. House of Representatives panel will debate legislation on Thursday intended to block Boeing Co's planned sale of dozens of commercial aircraft to Iran, which could also affect other planemakers, including Airbus if they became law.A Financial Services subcommittee will debate three measures, including one that would prohibit the U.S. Treasury from licensing the sale announced last month. Another would bar the Treasury secretary for authorizing transactions by U.S. financial institutions connected to the export of aircraft.A third measure would bar the Export-Import Bank from financing involving any entity that does business with Iran or provides financing to another entity to facilitate transactions with Iran.""I am extremely concerned that by relaxing the rules, the Obama administration has allowed U.S. companies to be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian regime,"" Representative Bill Huizenga, chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, said in a statement on Wednesday.
If the bills became law, they would affect other firms' sales to Iran because virtually all modern jets have more than 10 percent U.S. content, the threshold for requiring export licenses.A House committee aide said the full financial services committee was likely to approve the bills, but a vote had not yet been scheduled. However, the measures showed the extent of concern by Republicans, who control majorities in both the House and Senate, about the Iran deal and the potential Boeing sale.Democrats, including President Barack Obama, are expected to oppose the legislation.
While most congressional Democrats backed the Iran deal announced a year ago, every Republican U.S. lawmaker opposed the pact in which the United States and international partners agreed to ease crippling economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curtailing its nuclear program.When news of the Boeing deal emerged, several Republicans in Congress worried that it could threaten U.S. national security. Asked about those concerns last month, a Boeing executive noted last month that the Obama administration considered implementation of the nuclear pact ""critical"" to national security.
A ""memorandum of agreement"" (MOA) calls for IranAir to buy a total of 80 aircraft from Boeing and lease a further 29 with Boeing's support. Deliveries of the purchased jets are scheduled to start in 2017 and run through 2025.An Iranian official told Reuters some officials in Tehran are concerned about the legislation, arguing that if such measures become law they could endanger implementation of the nuclear deal by intensifying pressure on Iran President Hassan Rouhani to take a harder line in his dealings with the United States and its allies.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday said lawmakers are examining whether there is any action they can take over Hillary Clinton's email practices while secretary of state, saying it appeared she had received preferential treatment from the FBI.Ryan, a Republican, said the House of Representatives would not ""foreclose any options"" when asked whether a special prosecutor was necessary to get to the bottom of the Democratic presidential candidate's use of a private email server while she ran the State Department.The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Tuesday it would not recommend charges regarding Clinton's email, although FBI Director James Comey rebuked the Democratic U.S. presidential candidate for ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information. The FBI decision, Ryan said, ""looks like"" preferential treatment for Clinton. Ryan, who was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, said Director of National Intelligence James Clapper should deny Clinton access to classified information during the campaign, although presidential candidates normally get such access once they are formally nominated.Clinton's campaign, responding to Ryan's remarks, said House Republicans appeared to be trying to launch another ""sham of an inquiry"" against Clinton now that they had ended their two-year probe of the deaths of four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi while Clinton was secretary of state.
""For weeks Republicans have said they trusted FBI Director Comey to lead an independent review into Secretary Clinton's emails, but now they are second-guessing his judgment because his findings do not align with their conspiracy theories,"" campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said in an emailed statement.The campaign said on Tuesday it was pleased with the FBI's decision, noting that the candidate has said repeatedly that it was a mistake to use her personal email while secretary of state.
Ryan noted that two House committees are looking into the Clinton email matter -- the Judiciary committee and the Oversight Committee, where Comey has been invited to testify on Thursday.""He (Comey) did say that short of prosecution, some kind of administrative action might be in order,"" Ryan said, adding: ""I think it's the least we can do, given how she was so reckless in handling classified material and sending classified information on insecure servers.""""So look, I think that's something that the administration should do on its own, but we'll look into seeing if that's something we can do as well,"" Ryan said.
Senate Republican leaders said they thought Clinton's testimony to the FBI should be released to the public. But Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid dismissed as political the Republican calls for Clinton to stop getting classified information.""The Republicans are in such desperate shape because of (Republican presidential candidate Donald) Trump, they would seize upon anything,"" Reid told reporters. He said the FBI investigation had been thorough. ""It's over and it's time to move on."" (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Kouichi Shirayanagi; Editing by Bill Trott and Tom Brown)"
