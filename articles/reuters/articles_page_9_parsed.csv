By Karen Pierog and Renita D. Young
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO The Chicago City Council on Wednesday approved Mayor Rahm Emanuel's fiscal 2017 budget which calls for a tax on plastic bags and the first phase of hiring more than 900 police officers.The council voted 48-0 for the budget which begins on Jan. 1.Emanuel last month unveiled his $9.8 billion all-funds spending plan, which includes $3.7 billion for operations. The budget relies on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies, and a few one-time measures - but no big tax hike.""To think that we're on the verge today of passing a budget with almost unanimity is remarkable,"" Alderman Ed Burke said just before the vote.
Emanuel last year pushed through a $543 million phased-in property tax increase for police and firefighter retirement systems. The city enacted a new tax on water and sewer usage in September to rescue its largest pension fund for municipal workers from insolvency. The council previously increased a telephone surcharge for laborers' pensions.Credit ratings for the nation's third-largest city have been deteriorating due largely to an unfunded pension liability that stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for Chicago's four retirement systems. The new budget includes a 7-cent fee on store bags and parking rate hikes. It also accommodates the initial phase of the mayor's two-year plan to add 970 police positions to address the city's sharp spike in violence.
""This is the first year in recent memory that we've made investments in public safety with the addition of 1,000 police officers,"" said Alderman Jason Earvin. ""And we can direct investment in some of the most challenged communities ... and with our youth in some of the most troubled parts of the city.""After the vote, Emanuel noted record-high summer job creation for youth, record-high project starts in commercial and residential real estate and the city using reforms to place pensions on the path to solvency.
""Chicago's employment is at a 15-year high that we haven't seen since 2000 since the tech bubble,"" Emanuel said. ""What we have done, not just today, but over the last five years is give people confidence in the city that we are going to take care of our business, get our fiscal house in order.""

By Jeff Mason
| ATHENS

ATHENS President Barack Obama extolled the strengths of democracy from its Greek birthplace on Wednesday in a valedictory speech aimed at highlighting the values he sought to respect in office and prodding his Republican successor, Donald Trump, to follow suit.On a farewell trip to Europe, Obama tried to reassure allies that core U.S. priorities, including a commitment to the NATO military alliance, would continue under Trump, despite the New York businessman's campaign trail statements that called that commitment into question.Obama portrayed the United States as an example of democracies prizing the peaceful transfer of power, even when ideas between the incoming and outgoing leaders are opposed.""The next American president and I could not be more different,"" he said to an audience in Athens. ""We have very different points of view, but American democracy is bigger than any one person."" Obama took care of some local business in his speech. He urged creditors to help Greece dig out of its mountain of debt and called on young people to stay in the country to spur its economic recovery.But his broader message extended beyond Athens. Step-by-step, Obama listed the values of U.S. democracy that he and fellow Democrats in the United States have accused Trump of violating during his presidential campaign, an implicit call on his successor to change course.
In the same way that democracies are based on the peaceful resolution of disagreements within society, so cooperation is  the best way to resolve conflicts with nations, he said.""That's how with diplomacy we were able to shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot (and) with diplomacy the United States opened relations with Cuba,"" Obama said, referring to two important milestones of his presidency.He noted how U.S. democracy had evolved to provide rights to women, African Americans, people with disabilities, and the gay community.Trump has been criticized for his attitudes toward women and for making fun of a disabled reporter. He has pledged to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to deport undocumented immigrants who are living in the country illegally.
Democracy is why the United States welcomes ""people of all races, and all religions and all backgrounds and immigrants who strive to give their children a better life,"" Obama said.""Our democracies show that we are stronger than terrorists, fundamentalists and absolutists, who can't tolerate difference. ""Democracy is stronger than organizations like ISIS,"" he said, using one of the names for Islamic State.
""Because our democracies are inclusive, we are able to welcome people, and refugees in need, to our countries. And nowhere have we seen that compassion more evident than here in Greece,"" he said, referring to the Greek response to Europe's migrant crisis.Obama highlighted the importance of a free press to expose injustice. Trump banned certain news outlets from his campaign events for writing stories he did not like. The Obama administration has been criticized for its record on press freedom as well, particularly for prosecuting government sources who leak information to journalists. In his speech, Obama highlighted the importance of an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law. During his campaign, Trump accused a U.S. judge of not being able to be impartial because of his Mexican heritage.Obama also noted that elections hold leaders accountable.""Any action by a president or any result of an election or any legislation that is proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy,"" he said.

By Eric Onstad
| LONDON

LONDON Investors who sent copper to a 17-month peak on hopes for a splurge of U.S. infrastructure spending by Donald Trump may end up underwhelmed given that the plans, even if successful, would add only modestly to world demand. China dominates the global copper market, accounting for half of all demand, and an uptick in consumption there following further stimulus is much more relevant to the market.That, together with less mine supply than expected, would support slightly firmer prices, but not the wild frenzy that erupted after the U.S. election last week, investors and analysts said.""The infrastructure ambitions of Trump I think are meaningless in terms of the course and direction of commodities,"" said Scottish hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry, founder and chief investment officer of Eclectica Asset Management, which has around $200 million under management. Copper prices soared about 25 percent from the start of the month to a peak of $6,025 a ton last Friday, but have since retreated to $5,466 by Wednesday - still nearly a fifth higher since the start of 2016.Experts brush off the impact on copper of plans by the incoming U.S. president to spend $1 trillion over 10 years on building infrastructure, even as they are more upbeat on the plan's impact on the U.S. steel sector.Unlike copper, steel prices are set regionally, and an infrastructure spending spree coupled with even stronger trade protectionism would initially be a big boost for the U.S. steel market, even though longer term the fear is that steel price inflation will cripple demand growth.
U.S. COPPER DEMAND SLIDES
Copper consumption in the United States has slid 40 percent over the past 15 years to 1.8 million tonnes last year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That compares to 10 million in China, Thomson Reuters GFMS data shows.""Even an assumed 10 percent increase in infrastructure-related copper consumption would hardly matter on a global scale,"" said analyst Carsten Menke at Julius Baer in Switzerland.
""This is not least due to the fact that part of the increase in copper demand would be met by increasing recycling, considering that existing infrastructure would be replaced rather than expanded.""A position paper by Trump's advisors about his infrastructure plans (bit.ly/2eBQB1Y) published before the election did not mention specific projects, but referred to the broad sweep of possibilities including bridges, airports and digital superhighways.""Even if Trump's infrastructure plan goes ahead, the impact on physical markets is likely to be only modest,"" said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale.""If spending goes toward building roads and bridges, this wouldn't be as beneficial for metals demand as extra spending on sectors such as power, transportation and capital infrastructure projects,"" Bhar said in a note.
More important is whether stronger demand in China on the back of stimulus earlier this year persists.China's real estate sector is a prime driver of demand for industrial metals including copper, but investment has slowed and builders started fewer new homes year-on-year in September, the first such decline since December. ""These are lead indicators for copper demand by six to 12 months, but have clearly turned sharply negative,"" Liberum analyst Richard Knights said in a note.Hendry, although dismissing the impact of infrastructure spending on commodities, says a wider fiscal stimulus could boost overall economic growth and give the sector a lift.""A trillion plus tax cuts are not (meaningless) and would certainly seem to be the first dramatic and politically supported step,"" he told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit.""That's a world where commodities, you have to imagine, retain their outperformance.""

BERLIN German and U.S. employers, workers, consumers and farmers would ""without doubt"" benefit from a free trade deal being negotiated between the European Union and the United States, U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.Their comments were in sharp contrast to those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump who made attacks on international trade deals a cornerstone of his election campaign, saying they have cost U.S. jobs. ""An agreement that links our economies more closely and that builds on rules that comply with our shared values would help us to grow over the coming decades and to remain competitive at the global level,"" Obama and Merkel wrote in a joint article for German magazine WirtschaftsWoche.Defying Trump's protectionist rhetoric, Merkel and Obama said the United States and Germany were stronger if they worked together and stressed that cooperation is now more important than ever before because the global economy is developing more rapidly than ever before while global challenges are developing at the same speed.""There will be no return to a world before globalization,"" they wrote, according to an advance extract of their article that is due to be published on Friday.
The two leaders added that Germans and Americans needed to take the opportunity to shape the way globalization happens according to their own values and ideas.""We owe it to our companies and our citizens - and in fact to the whole international community - to broaden and deepen our cooperation,"" Obama and Merkel said.
Given that decisions in one country are felt in other countries, it is crucial to have rules like those being negotiated in the EU-U.S. trade deal called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), Obama and Merkel said.Merkel was the driving force in Europe behind TTIP, which has been under negotiation for more than three years. Brussels and Washington both realize it will not now be completed under Obama's term as earlier envisaged.
""We're campaigning for international laws and norms around the world to be respected - as a prerequisite for stability and prosperity,"" Obama and Merkel wrote.

By Jonathan Stempel
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK President-elect Donald Trump will last no more than four years in the White House, a period when corporations and Wall Street will retain the upper hand over the struggling workers who helped elect him in a populist wave, bond manager Bill Gross of Janus Capital Group Inc (JNS.N) said on Wednesday.In his monthly investment outlook, ""Populism Takes a Wrong Turn,"" Gross also said ""there is no new Trump bull market in the offing,"" and that global diversified investors should be ""satisfied"" with 3 percent to 5 percent annual returns.""The Trumpian Fox has entered the Populist Henhouse, not so much by stealth but as a result of Middle America's misinterpretation of what will make America great again,"" Gross wrote.""[Trump's] tenure will be a short four years but is likely to be a damaging one for jobless and low-wage American voters,"" Gross added. ""I write in amazed, almost amused bewilderment at what American voters have done to themselves.""Gross became the world's most famous bond fund manager at Allianz SE's (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co, where he ran Pimco Total Return (PTTRX.O) and worked until 2014, when he joined Janus.
He now oversees the $1.7 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund (JUCAX.O).In his outlook, Gross said he did not vote for the Republican Trump or Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and admitted that Clinton probably would not have done much better redistributing wages toward the working class.He said it was ""doubtful"" that Trump's plan to repatriate huge corporate profits to the United States for infrastructure spending would succeed, saying that a similar effort in 2004 resulted in large stock buybacks, dividend payouts and corporate bonuses, but no noticeable pickup in investment.
Gross said Trump's policies mark a ""continuation of the status quo,"" and that government could step in with a ""Help America"" jobs program to bolster labor in ways that overleveraged, cost-conscious corporations might not.Regardless, Gross said ""populism is on the march"" and could last for decades unless workers' share of gross domestic product reverses its downward trend. Trump's immigration, tax and trade policies might not promote that outcome, he said.
""Global populism is the wave of the future, but it has taken a wrong turn in America,"" he wrote.""Investors must drive with caution, understanding that higher deficits resulting from lower taxes raise interest rates and inflation, which in turn have the potential to produce lower earnings and P/E (price-earnings) ratios,"" Gross added.Gross' fund through Monday returned 4.5 percent this year, outpacing 68 percent of its peers, according to Morningstar Inc data. Janus last month announced a plan to merge with London-based Henderson Group Plc (HGGH.L). (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

WASHINGTON Republican President-elect Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was not trying to get security clearance for his children, which would allow them access to classified government information. ""I am not trying to get 'top level security clearance' for my children. This was a typically false news story,"" the New York real estate magnate said in a Twitter post.Trump was referring to media reports that he was seeking security clearance for his three oldest children - Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka - as well as Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump also was not trying to get clearance for Kushner.
""No paperwork has been completed or sent,"" he said.Clearances for the family members would allow Trump to discuss matters of national security with them. Federal law prohibits him from hiring family members to serve in his administration, but all four played important advisory roles through the campaign.
Trump has insisted that to avoid conflicts of interest, his children would run his sprawling business operations once he assumed the presidency.

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. advisory commission warned on Wednesday that China's growing military might may make it more likely to use force to pursue its interests and called for a government probe into how far outsourcing to China has weakened the U.S. defense industry.The annual report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission pointed to a growing threat to U.S. national security from Chinese spying, including infiltration of U.S. organizations, and called on Congress to bar Chinese state enterprises from acquiring control of U.S. firms.The release of the report to Congress comes a week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Trump, an outspoken Republican who has vowed to take a tougher line in trade and security dealings with China than President Barack Obama, will take office on Jan. 20.The panel is a bipartisan body set up in 2000 to monitor the national security implications of the U.S. trade and economic relationship with China and to make recommendations to Congress for legislative and administrative action.Its report also called on Congress to back more frequent U.S. Navy freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest trade routes where China's building of artificial islands with military facilities has raised concerns about future freedom of movement. Beijing and its neighbors have conflicting territorial claims there.
The commission said ongoing reforms of the People's Liberation Army would strengthen Beijing's hand and noted that China was close to completing its first domestically produced aircraft carrier.""China's pursuit of expeditionary capabilities, coupled with the aggressive trends that have been displayed in both the East and South China Seas, are compounding existing concerns about China's rise among U.S. allies and partners in the greater Asia,"" the report said.
""Given its enhanced strategic lift capability, strengthened employment of special operations forces, increasing capabilities of surface vessels and aircraft, and more frequent and sophisticated experience operating abroad, China may also be more inclined to use force to protect its interests,"" it said.The panel said that U.S. responses to the threat from Chinese intelligence gathering had suffered from a lack of a coordinated effort by U.S. intelligence agencies.It said Congress should also direct the U.S. Government Accountability Office to prepare a report ""examining the extent to which large-scale outsourcing of manufacturing activities to China is leading to the hollowing out of the U.S. defense industrial base.""
""This report should also detail the national security implications of a diminished domestic industrial base (including assessing any impact on U.S. military readiness), compromised U.S. military supply chains, and reduced capability to manufacture state-of-the-art military systems and equipment,"" it said.The commission's report also recommended that Congress call on the U.S. State Department to produce educational materials to alert U.S. citizens overseas and students going to China to the dangers of recruitment efforts by Chinese agents.

8	8	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sec-analysis-idUSKBN13B0E2	A post-Trump SEC could shake up current policy	"


By Sarah N. Lynch
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON It will be a new day at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after President-elect Donald Trump installs his choice to run the agency.With Trump's transition team already in regulatory-relief mode and promising to revamp the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, some rules already are marked for death or dialback.Expected on the chopping block soon after Trump takes the oath of office is a proposal that would require companies to disclose pay ratios between their CEOs and employees. Another would require companies to disclose whether their products contain conflict minerals -- minerals that were mined in a war-torn region of Africa.Dead for now is any prospect of the SEC approving a tough fiduciary rule for financial advisers, say policy experts.Trump's decision to tap former Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to help manage the Trump team's transition efforts at the SEC and other financial agencies offers a window into some other changes that could be in store. Atkins, the founder of the regulatory consulting firm Patomak Global Partners, is viewed by some to be a top contender for the position of SEC chairman itself, though as the transition head he could also recommend someone else for that job.  Atkins' well-known conservative views on everything from enforcement penalties to corporate governance are likely to be reflected in the SEC's agenda.Here are five policy areas likely to change.CORPORATE AUDITING RULES COULD GET LOOSER
Paul Atkins was a staunch critic of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a body created after the Enron accounting scandal to police and write new rules for corporate auditors.Atkins raised concerns about the board's budget and high salaries, and advocated against prescriptive accounting rules that he felt constrained auditors from making professional judgments.Recently, Republicans have criticized the PCAOB for taking on more progressive causes, such as proposing companies rotate auditors to reduce conflicts or requiring accounting firms to disclose the name of individual partners working on company audits.The PCAOB's chairman Jim Doty, who advocated for the controversial reform measures, will almost certainly not be re-appointed by the incoming SEC chair.
""I expect that a new Chair will refocus the Board's standard-setting agenda on the core audit function,"" said Hunton & Williams Partner Scott Kimpel. ""I would expect a return to the basics.""PENALTIES COULD SHRINK; PEOPLE COULD PAY
The topic of whether to impose corporate penalties against a company would come under scrutiny.During his time at the SEC, Atkins advocated for an enforcement approach that he said did not unduly punish corporate shareholders that had already suffered from the misconduct. He called for the SEC to carefully weigh who had profited from the bad behavior, and urged the SEC to hold individuals accountable for their actions.
STOCK MARKET TRADING WOULD GET SECOND LOOK
Atkins has long opined that the SEC's rules requiring ""best price"" execution of stock trades actually skews the market by causing fragmentation and harming price discovery by directing orders away from traditional stock exchanges into ""dark pool"" trading platforms.As a commissioner, Paul Atkins was critical of the rule called Regulation National Market System (NMS), saying it could impede true price discovery and encourage gaming of the system.In January 2016 he wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal calling for the SEC to do major surgery on the rule, allowing considerations beyond 'best price' and speed to determine order flow.WHISTLEBLOWERS COULD FACE MORE HURDLES
The Dodd-Frank law gave the SEC newfound powers to reward whistleblowers who come forward with tips of corporate malfeasance.
From August 2011 through fiscal year 2015, the SEC has received more than 14,000 tips, and by August of 2016, the program had given out more than $100 million in rewards.But corporate America has long disliked the part of the rule that protects whistleblowers from having to report wrongdoing to their own companies before they tip off the government.In 2011, Atkins urged the SEC to require whistleblowers to report internally first, saying a failure to do so could undermine compliance programs.Whether this will change remains to be seen, especially in the wake of the Wells Fargo & Co scandal, where employees who reported internally about the opening of unauthorized accounts were fired.Atkins ""cares deeply about the commission and its enforcement program,"" said Jordan Thomas, a whistleblower attorney at Labaton Sucharow who previously worked in the SEC's enforcement division during Atkins' tenure.""I find it very hard to believe that he would support undermining such a successful program.""CAPITAL FORMATION COULD GET A BOOST
Atkins was a strong proponent of the 2012 Jump Start Our Business Startups Act, which scaled back some SEC rules to help smaller companies raise capital.In testimony on Capitol Hill, Atkins advocated for additional steps to be taken to help smaller companies, including rules to help create venture exchanges for mid-cap stocks and broadening efforts to exempt private capital-raising rules from regulation by states.

By Jeff Mason
| ATHENS

ATHENS U.S. President Barack Obama, stung by the surprise victory of Donald Trump in last week's U.S. election, warned on Tuesday against a rise in nationalism and said a backlash against globalization had stoked populist movements at home and abroad.Obama said distrust of elites and governing institutions had  fed success in the U.S. election for Senator Bernie Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton in a drawn-out Democratic primary contest, and for Trump, a former reality TV star who bested the former secretary of state in the U.S. presidential race.""When you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders, very unconventional candidates, have considerable success, then obviously there is something there that's being tapped into: a suspicion of globalization, a desire to rein in its excesses,"" Obama said in Greece at the start of a farewell tour of Europe.Though he rejected a direct comparison between the U.S. election and Britain's ""Brexit"" referendum in June to leave the European Union, Obama said the common theme of antipathy to globalization was at play, spurring populist movements on the left and right in Europe.Trump garnered support on the back of promises to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and rip up trade deals that he said had hurt American workers.
Obama, who campaigned vigorously for Clinton, opposed those positions and is fighting now to keep his legacy accomplishments on healthcare, climate change, and nuclear diplomacy alive in the face of Trump's promises to dismantle them. ""DANGEROUS"" DIVISIONS

Since the election, however, Obama has promised to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition of power, largely backing off his criticism that Trump is unfit to serve as U.S. commander-in-chief. While reiterating that commitment about a transition on Tuesday, Obama seemed to renew his criticism of some of Trump's electoral tactics with a warning about divisions worldwide.""I do believe, separate and apart from any particular election or movement, that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an 'us' and a 'them,'"" he said.
""I will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the future of the world is going to be defined by what we have in common as opposed to those things that separate us,"" he said.Unity in Europe in the aftermath of World War Two has created five decades of unprecedented peace and prosperity, he said.""In the United States, we know what happens when we start dividing ourselves along lines of race or religion or ethnicity. It's dangerous,"" he said. (Reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Gareth Jones)"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
