| HOUSTON/WASHINGTON

HOUSTON/WASHINGTON The top executive at the company behind the embattled Dakota Access Pipeline has donated more than $100,000 to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump since June, according to campaign finance disclosure records.The donations by Kelcy Warren, chairman and chief executive officer at pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners, support the candidate seen by many as more likely to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry than his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.Warren donated $300 to the Trump campaign during the primaries, and $2,700 to Trump during the general election phase of the campaign, for the maximum contribution allowed by a single individual during an election. He also gave $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that includes the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee, the Republican Party of Arkansas and the Connecticut Republican Party. The donations, first reported by the British newspaper The Guardian, were made before the U.S. government halted construction on a segment of Energy Transfer Partners' 1,100-mile (1,770-km) Dakota Access Pipeline in early September following protests by Native American and environmental groups. 
The project, which would move oil from the highly productive Bakken shale formation to the Midwest and Gulf Coast, sparked violent clashes between security officers near the construction site and Native American tribe members and other protesters. Opponents have said the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and pollute the area's drinking water. Warren has also given $66,800 to the Republication National Committee since Trump secured the nomination for the Nov. 8 election, The Guardian reported.Trump has not yet taken a position on the Dakota Access Pipeline, but supports the development of oil and gas and related infrastructure, including pipelines.
Asked about Trump's position on the Dakota Access Pipeline in a policy debate this week, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the candidate's main energy advisers, declined to answer, saying he did not want to get ahead of Trump.He added, ""I'm not sure he (Trump) is aware of it."" 
If elected, Trump in his first 100 days will ask TransCanada to renew its permit application for the Keystone XL Pipeline, according to his campaign website. U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposed pipeline from Canada last November.Trump has holdings in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66, a joint owner of the Dakota Access Pipeline, through mutual funds, according to financial disclosure records.U.S. oil and gas industry workers have contributed slightly more to Clinton, with employees giving $114,141 to the Democratic candidate and $99,302 to Trump since July, according to a Reuters review of federal campaign finance disclosures.

BOSTON Democratic White House candidate Hillary Clinton is leading among likely voters aged 18 to 29, according to a Harvard University opinion poll released on Wednesday.The former U.S. secretary of state had the support of 49 percent of likely voters, ahead of Republican rival Donald Trump's 28 percent support, a substantially wider lead than Democratic President Barack Obama had over Republican former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney at the same point in 2012.National polls of voters of all ages also show Clinton leading, though by a substantially narrower margin.Some 14 percent of respondents said they planned to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson, with 5 percent supporting the Green Party's Jill Stein and 11 percent still undecided. More than one in three self-described Johnson voters said they were likely to change their minds before Election Day.
A majority of respondents, 51 percent, described themselves as ""fearful"" about the future of America, with just 14 percent of the 2,150 respondents saying they believed the country was headed in the right direction.The sense of fearfulness was most predominant among white respondents, though 85 of black respondents said they believed they were ""under attack"" in modern American society.
Some 62 percent of respondents said they believed race relations in the United States would worsen if Trump was elected president. Twenty-two percent thought race relations would deteriorate if Clinton won the Nov. 8 election, with the plurality, 36 percent predicting they would stay the same.
The survey, conducted Oct. 7-17 has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way. (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Karen Pierog
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO The Republican Party's grip on U.S. state legislatures could loosen in next month's election as Democrats seek to link Republican candidates to the sinking fortunes of the party's White House candidate, Donald Trump.Republicans, who have dominated control of legislatures since the mid-term election in 2010, currently hold the majority in 67 of the country's 98 partisan legislative chambers, while Democrats have 31. Nebraska's single chamber is nonpartisan.More than 80 percent of the nation's 7,383 state legislative seats are up for grabs on Nov. 8 and the race between Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is expected to influence races further down the ballot papers. (See related graphic tmsnrt.rs/2ePmLDI)The bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) estimates 18 legislative chambers in 12 states could switch party control, including in Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Washington and Wisconsin.""More than three-fourths of the time the party winning the White House also makes gains in state legislatures. So the odds are Democrats would pick up chambers and seats on the whole if (Clinton) wins,"" said Tim Storey, a NCSL elections analyst.National opinion polls show Clinton leading Trump with just under two weeks to go until Election Day.Democrats are also getting a big boost for down ballot races with Clinton surrogates such as President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and first lady Michelle Obama on the campaign trail stumping for party candidates. Trump, on the other hand, is openly feuding with Republican leaders, many of whom distanced themselves from the candidate after a 2005 video surfaced earlier this month in which he is heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances.Storey said while Trump has his pockets of popularity, the top Republican on the party's ticket has become a main line of attack by Democrats in swing districts. 
""Instead of taxes or health care or public safety or education, Trump has been an issue in many places,"" he said.According to Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), which is working to elect Democratic state lawmakers, ""Trump is quicksand for legislative Republicans.""But Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), which hopes to spend $40 million on legislative and other state races this election cycle, said the Democrats' strategy of using Trump to campaign against Republicans is not working. He contended his party's candidates can win even without presidential coattails.""A good candidate who understands her district, who presents viable solutions for that district in that state has a better than even odds of winning in any type of environment,"" he said.
REPUBLICANS TRY OFFENSE
In addition to defending legislative turf, Republicans are trying to play offense, targeting 13 chambers in 10 states for seat gains, including Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Vermont, Colorado and Oregon.Post said Democratic candidates are offering voters ""a crucial firewall against Republican overreach"" in states dominated by Republicans, like North Carolina, where there has been a backlash against a law on use of public bathrooms that critics say discriminates against transgender people.  With all of Minnesota's legislative seats up for election, Democrats need a net gain of seven seats to take control of the House and turn the state, which has a Democratic governor, in their favor.
Larry Jacobs, a University of Minnesota political science professor, said a Democratic sweep could open the way for  legislation funding capital projects and transportation as well as early childhood education.In Illinois, Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, his wife and two of his wealthiest donors have contributed a combined $18 million since the March primary to House Republican leader Jim Durkin and to a super-PAC devoted to chipping away at Democrats' veto-proof majorities in the state's House and Senate.Democrats have been in a political stalemate with Rauner for nearly two years over the budget and other issues.In West Virginia, historically a Democratic stronghold state, Republicans took control of the state's House, Senate, and governor's office in 2014 for the first time in 83 years. This election, Democrats want the Senate back.Tom Susman, president of TSG Consulting, a Charleston, West Virginia-based government affairs public relations firm, said the likely scenario is the Senate remains Republican, with much of the power ceded to a growing fiscally conservative faction.""Moderate Republicans are in trouble,"" said Susman. ""We could be looking at a Kansas-like situation. Then, it would basically be the Tea Party running the state Senate. No new taxes. All cuts.""

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. policy of trying to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons ""is probably a lost cause"" and the best that could be hoped for is a cap on the country's nuclear capability, the Director of U.S. National Intelligence James Clapper said on Tuesday.However, underscoring conflicting views in the Obama administration, the State Department said U.S. policy was unchanged and continued to be to seek the ""verifiable denuclearization"" of the Korean peninsula.President Barack Obama has repeatedly stated that the United States will never accept North Korean as a nuclear-armed state.Clapper made clear at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in New York he did not think that the policy the administration has stuck to, in spite of repeated North Korean nuclear tests, was realistic.""I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause,"" Clapper said at the  Council on Foreign Relations think tank in New York. ""They are not going to do that - that is their ticket to survival.""Pyongyang has persisted with its missile and nuclear weapons programs, including a Sept. 9 nuclear explosion, despite strong international sanctions.Clapper said he got a good taste of how the world looks from North Korea's viewpoint when he went to Pyongyang on a mission in 2014 to secure the release of two Americans.""They are under siege and they are very paranoid, so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a non-starter with them,"" he said.
""The best we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap, but they are not going to do that just because we ask them. There's going to have to be some significant inducements.""CHINA PRESSES NEED TO TALK
U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said he had not seen Clapper's remarks but told a regular news briefing in Washington that the administration did not believe denuclearization was a lost cause.
""No, nothing's changed ... that's not our position. Our policy objective is to seek to obtain a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. That is the policy; that is both the goal and what we want to see and there is a way to do that.""Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked on Wednesday about Clapper's remarks, said the best way to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue was still via talks.China and Russia have pushed for a resumption of six-party talks on denuclearization in North Korea. The talks, which also involve Japan, South Korea and the United States, have been on hold since 2008.Clapper also said it bothered him that the United States was not capitalizing on using information as a weapon against North Korea.
""That's something they worry about a lot ... That is a great vulnerability I don't think we have exploited. Right now, we are kind of stuck on our narrative and they are kind of stuck on theirs.""Clapper was asked if he thought North Korea could mount a nuclear warhead on a missile that could reach the West Coast of the United States and reiterated the intelligence assessment that this had to be a ""worst-case assumption.""He said North Korea had yet to test its KN08 intercontinental ballistic missile, so neither North Korea nor the United States knew whether it worked.""Nevertheless, we ascribe to them the capability to launch a missile that would have a weapon on it to reach parts of the United States, certainly including Alaska and Hawaii,"" he said.""They could do it. We have to make the worst-case assumption here.""

By Steve Holland
| DORAL, Fla.

DORAL, Fla. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clinton's plan for Syria would ""lead to World War Three,"" because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.Trump questioned how Clinton would negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin after demonizing him; blamed President Barack Obama for a downturn in U.S. relations with the Philippines under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind his candidacy, and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders would support him.""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he said.On Syria's civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict.Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ""safe zones"" on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ""You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.""You're not fighting Syria any more, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said.
Clinton's campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement.Trump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago and said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" he said.
 


SLIDESHOW: Two weeks to Election Day
OBAMA FOCUSED 'ON HIS GOLF GAME'
On Russia, Trump again knocked Clinton's handling of U.S.-Russian relations while secretary of state and said her harsh criticism of Putin raised questions about ""how she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil,"" if she wins the presidency.On the deterioration of ties with the Philippines, Trump aimed his criticism at Obama, saying the president ""wants to focus on his golf game"" rather than engage with world leaders.
Since assuming office, Duterte has expressed open hostility toward the United States, rejecting criticism of his violent anti-drug clampdown, using an expletive to describe Obama and telling the United States not to treat his country ""like a dog with a leash.""The Obama administration has expressed optimism that the two countries can remain firm allies.Trump said Duterte's latest comments showed ""a lack of respect for our country.""The interview comes two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, with Trump trailing badly in the polls. He repeated his assertion that the ""media is rigging the polls"" and said his supporters were upset with Republican Party leadership.""The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win 100 percent if we had support from the top. I think we're going to win it anyway.""He said if he wins he would not consider putting Democrats in his cabinet but would work with them on legislation.READ MORE: Commentary: How Clinton could lose even as she wins(Additional reporting by Amanda Becker, Emily Stephenson, Alana Wise and Ginger Gibson in Washington and Emily Flitter in New York, editing by Paul Thomasch and Ross Colvin)"

By Steve Holland and Emily Stephenson
| DORAL, Fla./WASHINGTON

DORAL, Fla./WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday that President Barack Obama should be investigated over a private email server Hillary Clinton used while secretary of state, saying Obama ""knew all about"" her email arrangements.""That's why he stuck up for Hillary, because he didn't want to be dragged in. Because he knew all about her private server,"" Trump said of the Democratic president in an interview with Reuters. ""This means that he has to be investigated.""The White House declined to comment on Trump's allegations. Spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters earlier on Tuesday that while the president had Clinton's personal email address, which she used instead of government systems, he did not know where her server was located or other details.Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, was Obama's first secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.
WikiLeaks on Tuesday released a batch of hacked emails from the account of Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta, which showed her Democratic presidential campaign reacting after Obama said in a television interview that he learned of the private email server through news reports. ""We need to clean this up - he has emails from her - they do not say state.gov,"" Cheryl Mills, a longtime Clinton aide, wrote in an email to Podesta after Obama made the comments in a March 2015 television interview. ""State.gov"" is the State Department's internet domain name, and its presence in the sender's email address would indicate it came from an official account.The State Department said in January it found 18 instances  of messages between Clinton and Obama among the roughly 30,000 work emails Clinton returned to the department in 2014. None have been released because of a law that protects presidential communications from becoming public for several years.  
WikiLeaks has been releasing hacked emails in chunks for several weeks, but the Clinton campaign has not officially confirmed their legitimacy.U.S. officials have said they believe Russia is behind recent hacks of Democratic Party systems, and reports have indicated the theft of Podesta's emails may be related. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country is not to blame.Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey in July said Clinton was ""extremely careless"" with her emails but that no ""reasonable"" prosecutor would bring charges.

By Steve Holland

Below are the highlights from Reuters' Oct. 25 exclusive interview with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. SYRIA
""(Hillary Clinton) has no plan for Syria. Look, with her you'll end up in World War Three. She doesn't know what she's doing, just like with Libya, just like with everything else she's done. So Syria now is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and the new Iran that we built through the Iran deal, which is one of the worst negotiated deals I've ever seen. So you're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, alright. Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk.""""I say the first thing we have to do is get rid of ISIS before we start thinking about Syria."" ""(Syrian President Bashar al-)Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS.""MOSUL
""If Hillary Clinton ended the war and left troops behind, we wouldn't even be fighting for Mosul right now, OK. She gave them Mosul. She didn't know what she was doing. The woman is incompetent.""""One of the reasons we were going in was to get the ISIS leaders. But if that's the case, why didn't we go in as a surprise attack instead of - you know, with the element of surprise - instead of announcing three months ago that we're going into Mosul?""RUSSIA
""I would hope to have a good relationship with Russia. And I would hope to have a good relationship with Putin.
""I'm not friends or enemies with the Russians. I have nothing to do Russia.""""(Clinton) always casts Putin as a bad guy and a bad light. If she won, how is she going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil. He's not going to want to negotiate with her, number one. Number two, I don't believe he has any respect for Hillary Clinton whatsoever. PHILIPPINES
On Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte saying he was against the presence of any foreign troops in his country: ""He probably made a deal with China... He's dealing with China and Russia so he probably made a deal with China and Russia.""
""The Philippines are a very important strategic location. He has no respect or liking of Obama ...""""I think it's a horrible thing that the United States is reduced to being thrown out of a country.""""There's a big group of people that are in that category (of world leaders who dislike Obama) because Obama wants to focus on his golf game. He doesn't want to take the time necessary to get along with people. It's too bad.""CLINTON PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER
Wikileaks on Tuesday released a batch of hacked emails from the account of Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta, that shows her Democratic presidential campaign reacting after President Barack Obama said in a television interview that he learned of her private email server through news reports.
Trump's response: ""Well, I now see why the president stuck up for Hillary, because he didn't want to be dragged into it... Because he knew all about her private server.""""This is a big thing. This means that he has to be investigated.""REPUBLICAN UNITY
""Thousands of people are standing there to vote. I think those people are very, very disappointed that the leaders (of the Republican Party) aren't helping us win.""""I know this: If the leaders were helping me, we couldn't lose this election. It would be an impossibility.""""RIGGING""
""The media's rigging the system. It's never been a pile on like this ... I mean, they're rigging the polls. The polls are ridiculous. Look at that one poll that came out, ABC/Washington Post. That was a Democratic poll. They're rigging the system.""An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday showed Clinton leading Trump by 12 percentage points among likely voters.
