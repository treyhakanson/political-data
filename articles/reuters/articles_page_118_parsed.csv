By Emily Stephenson
| EVERETT, Washington

EVERETT, Washington Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday night called Democrats the ""party of slavery"" and praised what he called the millions of African Americans with career success, as he tries to revamp his outreach to minority voters.Trump has made much-maligned efforts to appeal to black and Hispanic voters, groups that generally support Democrats and are expected to vote heavily for Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.""The Republican Party is the party of Abraham Lincoln,"" Trump said at a rally in Everett, Washington. ""It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow and the party of opposition,"" he said, referring to racial segregation laws that once existed in the American South.
The Republican nominee has said Democrats failed minority voters with economic policies that have not improved their job prospects, but his attempts have been criticized for painting a bleak view of the lives of all black and Hispanic Americans.Clinton last week released an ad mocking Trump's attempts to reach those groups and showing headlines about a racial discrimination lawsuit the New York real estate mogul faced in the 1970s.
A prominent supporter of Trump's apologized on Tuesday for sending out a tweet that showed a cartoon image of Clinton in blackface.Trump sought to correct course in Washington state on Tuesday, saying millions of black Americans ""have succeeded greatly"" in art, science, sports and other endeavors.
""But we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities,"" he said.  (Reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"	['Abraham', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

PHOENIX The Arizona sheriff famous for his tough stance on illegal immigration and keeping jail inmates in tents easily won his Republican primary on Tuesday.Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is seeking election to a seventh term as the top lawman for the area around Phoenix, won about 66 percent of the vote, well ahead of ex-police chief and three-time opponent Dan Saban, according to unofficial election results posted online by the county.Also on the Republican primary ballot were Wayne Baker, a retired deputy sheriff, and Marsha Ann Hill, an ex-sheriff's volunteer. Arpaio is slated to face Democrat Paul Penzone, who was unopposed in his party's primary, in the general election. Penzone, a former Phoenix police officer who is expected to present a tough challenge to Arpaio in November, lost to the longtime sheriff in 2012 by six percentage points.Arpaio, 84, was expected to win his primary despite a judge's request that criminal contempt charges be brought against him stemming from a 2007 racial profiling case where he was found to have violated the constitutional rights of Latino motorists.
    The investigation and possible prosecution was turned over to the U.S. Justice Department last week. It was not clear when a decision would be made.Arpaio, who styles himself as America's toughest sheriff, said his looming legal battles apparently had no effect on the primary race. ""I think the people understand that they should not believe everything they hear,"" Arpaio told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""They support me as they always have and that feels good.""
    Saban has called on Arpaio to resign, saying the sheriff has ""soiled his badge"" and made himself ineffective as a lawman.Saban declined comment on the election results through a spokesman, adding that he would issue a statement on Wednesday morning. 
    Arpaio, along with three others, could face incarceration and fines if convicted of any criminal charges. Arpaio and his second-in-command, Gerard Sheridan, already have been cited and admitted to civil contempt.    The charges center on unlawful traffic stops and detentions by deputies of Latino drivers for 18 months after the judge ordered them to cease.Opponents also have targeted the profiling lawsuit's high cost to the county, which will have spent an estimated $54 million on the case by next summer.

BOSTON (Editor's note: This story contains language that may offend some readers in the sixth and final paragraphs adds no comment from Gattine spokesman)Combative Maine Governor Paul LePage told a radio host on Tuesday that he was considering not finishing his term in office, amid a wave of criticism after he left a lawmaker a profanity-filled voicemail.But the two-term, Tea Party-backed Republican governor subsequently appeared to backtrack on the idea, paraphrasing Mark Twain in a tweet that read in part: ""The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated.""That message came hours after he told an interviewer on Maine's WVOM-FM radio that he was ""looking at all options,"" when asked if he would finish his term, which extends through 2018.LePage's latest outburst came in response to a report that state Representative Drew Gattine had described him as racist for focusing on black people as bearing primary responsibility for the drug trade in the state. LePage responded to Gattine with a blistering, profanity-laced voicemail that has been widely circulated.""I'm not going to say that I'm not going to finish it; I'm not saying that I am going to finish it,"" LePage said on Tuesday in the radio interview, in reference to his term in office. ""What I'm going to do right now is I'm taking one step at a time. I want to meet with Mr. Gattine and then I want to meet with my team at my office and we're going to look at what the proper steps are to move the state forward.""In last week's voicemail, LePage called Gattine a ""little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker"" and encouraged him to share the message publicly ""because I am after you.""A LePage spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the governor's Twain tweet. A spokeswoman for Gattine said he would not comment until after he met LePage on Wednesday.
LePage has repeatedly described himself as a less-than-polished, plain-speaking politician.""It's possible it was a screw-up,"" said Michael Franz, chairman of the government department at Maine's Bowdoin College, referring to the radio interview.""My first inclination is that this is not serious and that he's just attempting to establish his regret.""
APOLOGY TO MAINE, FAMILIES
LePage, 67, said he had lost his temper when he was told that Gattine had described his views as racist. He told reporters he would like to engage in a duel with Gattine, a remark he later described as metaphoric.""I just want to apologize to the Maine people, to Gattine's family and most of all to my family,"" LePage said in the 15-minute interview. ""And we will take action.""Some Democratic lawmakers have called for a special session of the legislature to censure LePage, who earlier this year fought off an impeachment effort.""A half-hearted, partial apology on a radio show does not get remotely close to addressing the core issue: Maine faces serious issues and its government is not functioning,"" the state's Democratic House leadership said in a statement on Tuesday.
State Senate President Michael Thibodeau and other Republican legislative leaders convened a closed-door meeting with LePage late on Monday to discuss his future.The governor told the group he was going to talk to friends and family about what he would do next and respond to them on Tuesday, said Jim Cyr, a spokesman for Thibodeau.Controversial outbursts have marked LePage's six years in office. Earlier this year, he said he did not mean to sound racist when he said drug dealers ""with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty"" were coming to the state to impregnate ""white girls.""Last week at a news conference LePage compared Maine's efforts to thwart heroin dealers to war.""Look, the bad guy is the bad guy,"" he said. ""I don't care what color he is ... You try to identify the enemy and the enemy right now, the overwhelming majority of people coming in, are people of color or people of Hispanic origin.""In 2013, he told a television interviewer that a political rival ""claims to be for the people but he's the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline.""

By Diane Bartz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Elizabeth Warren and 19 other U.S. senators voiced concern to the chief executive of Mylan NV (MYL.O) about the high cost of its EpiPen on Tuesday, calling the device used in the case of life-threatening allergies ""exorbitantly expensive.""Mylan has been under fire for steadily raising the price of the device from about $100 in 2008 to about $600 currently.In a letter to Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, the daughter of Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the lawmakers asked the company to spell out the company's programs to provide some people with lower cost EpiPens.Such discount programs are often an ""industry tactic to keep costs high through a complex shell game,"" the letter said.""Insurance companies, the government and employers still bear the burden of these excessive prices. In turn, those costs are eventually passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums,"" the senators wrote.
Mylan said this week it would launch the first generic version of its allergy auto-injector EpiPen for $300, half the price of the branded product, the drugmaker's second step in less than a week to counter the backlash over the product's steep price. It also reduced the out-of-pocket costs of EpiPen for some patients last week.EpiPen has a 94 percent market share for auto-injector devices, which jab a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, other foods and bee stings.
Asked about the letter, Mylan spokeswoman Lauren Kashtan said in an email statement: ""We have acknowledged receipt of letters from congressional offices and intend to respond to them.""Mylan has defended EpiPen's high price, saying it spent hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the product since acquiring it in 2007. It has also said it recoups less than half the list price for EpiPens.In their letter, the lawmakers asked Mylan how much insurers paid for the EpiPen in 2009 and how much they pay now. They also asked how many EpiPens Mylan provided to low income, uninsured consumers and how many schools purchased EpiPens versus how many received them for free.
In addition to Warren, other signatories included Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee; Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat; Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat; Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, both Democrats from Rhode Island and Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.

By Emily Stephenson and Ginger Gibson
| EVERETT, Washington/WASHINGTON

EVERETT, Washington/WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump, who has made his criticism of a pending Pacific trade agreement central to his campaign, on Tuesday visited a Seattle suburb home to a large Boeing Co plane manufacturing facility that depends heavily on Asian sales.Trump vowed at his rally that he would win Washington state, even though the state tends to support Democrats and that party's nominee, Hillary Clinton, leads by large margins in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election.The Republican nominee, however, presents a conundrum for the unions that represent workers at Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company. He has courted manufacturing workers with vows to tear up trade agreements and scrap the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership. ""The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved,"" Trump said on Tuesday, referring to a separate deal with Canada and Mexico reached in the 1990s. He also has vowed to renegotiate that agreement.Supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) point to Boeing's aircraft sales to Asia to tout the benefits of the agreement. Secretary of State John Kerry visited a nearby plant earlier this year to rally support for the pact.Manufacturing unions agree with Trump on his opposition to TPP and the export of jobs overseas, but officials said they find his track record unconvincing.""The fact is that Trump has had the opportunity to bring jobs to Americans, and he's chosen to outsource them,"" said Larry Brown, legislative and political director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 751, which represents about 32,000 workers in the state, mostly at Boeing.Boeing produces some of its largest planes only miles from where Trump spoke Tuesday night. As they are assembled, the painted tails of the planes show the airlines that ordered them, and many are Asian. Major components of each plane come from overseas: South Korea, China and Europe.
Over the next 20 years, Boeing projects that Asian customers will account for 40 percent of the total global jetliner's market, the company said in a recent report.""Trade is a huge part of the success of manufacturing in Washington,"" said Linda Dempsey, vice president of international economic affairs for the National Association of Manufacturers, which Boeing belongs to. ""They are exporting $73 billion in manufactured goods.""But Trump offers a more dire outlook, arguing that only he can keep Boeing from moving those high-paying manufacturing jobs from Washington to China.""They'll start taking your business away, and you won't have much of Boeing,"" Trump told Seattle's KIRO radio on Monday.
RALLYING WORKERS
Trump has broken with the Republican Party's traditional embrace of free trade. He has vowed to rip up the TPP and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, an existing deal with Canada and Mexico which he blames for the loss of U.S. jobs.The Republican Party's support for free trade has put it in sync with large business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.Tony Fratto, a former official in the administration of Republican George W. Bush, criticized Trump as out of step with the party.
""Trump's policies in this area are really dumb generally, but are particularly dumb for a major exporting company,"" said Fratto, who worked on behalf of a coalition of large companies, including Boeing, that were pushing for renewal of the Export-Import Bank.Some voters in Washington state remain divided. Kirk Hoeppner, 53, a business analyst at Boeing who lives in Granite Falls, Washington, said he will vote for Trump and he agrees with his business views. But he was not sure closer ties to other countries would hurt jobs there.""Even if we ally with other countries, we're still going to sell more airplanes,"" Hoeppner said.Corey McNally, 40, of Whidbey Island, Washington, has not decided whom he will vote for.""The union members love Hillary just because they're supposed to because she's a liberal,"" said McNally. And Trump, whom he called ""just kind of a big show,"" may be too late to change anything.""This company's been outsourcing jobs for years,"" he said of Boeing.

In addition to the notes, CNN said the FBI will give the news outlets the roughly 30-page report it sent to the U.S. Department of Justice last month when it recommended against pursuing criminal charges against Clinton, who is vying for the White House in the Nov. 8 U.S. election.The Clinton campaign, which had expressed concern about selective leaks from the notes, welcomed the release. 
""This is something that we wanted to have happen,"" campaign spokeswoman Kristina Schake told CNN in an interview.  Several media outlets, including Reuters, have made FOIA requests for a summary of the interview. Such requests are often returned with sensitive information redacted.

WASHINGTON Pastor Marks Burns, a prominent supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, apologized on Tuesday for sending out a tweet that showed a cartoon image of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in blackface.Burns, an African-American who is frequently one of the warmup speakers at Trump rallies, sent out the tweet on Monday to bolster the Trump campaign's contention that Clinton is pandering for the black vote but will ignore the community if elected on Nov. 8.""I ain't no ways pandering to African Americans,"" the cartoon image says. The tweet emerged at a time when Trump has been trying to broaden his appeal to African-American voters by saying he wants to create more jobs and make black neighborhoods safe so people can walk down the street without getting shot.
After Burns began taking fire for the tweet, he deleted it and apologized for the image but not his message.""I'm so sorry for the offensive #Blackface image of @HillaryClinton but stand by the message that we Blacks ARE being Used by #Dems for VOTES,"" Burns said.
