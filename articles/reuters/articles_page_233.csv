AUSTIN, Texas A Texas-based LGBT advocacy helped spark a grammar debate this week over whether an errant comma in the stridently anti-homosexual Republican Party of Texas platform can be read as saying the majority of Texans are gay.The plank that was approved by delegates at the party's convention this month reads: ""Homosexuality is a chosen behavior that is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that has been ordained by God in the Bible, recognized by our nations founders, and shared by the majority of Texans.""Lone Star Q, which describes itself as the state's No. 1 source for LGBT news, asked on Twitter on Wednesday to have a ""grammar debate"" over the wording.In response, grammarians pointed out that placement of the final comma in the plank could lead to understanding it to mean  that homosexuality is a chosen behavior shared by the majority of Texans. They also noted that ""nations"" should have an apostrophe and that by using ""has been,"" the plank gives the impression that homosexuality has been ordained by God. 
Party officials did not respond to requests to comment.
The party, which dominates Texas politics, has been hostile toward homosexuality for years. Its platform has said homosexuality must not be presented as an acceptable lifestyle and gays should not be allowed to marry.Over the years, the party's platforms have favored a number of hard-right positions, such as cutting off funding for about a dozen U.S. government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, abolishing the Federal Reserve, a return to the gold standard for the U.S. dollar and U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Thursday approved nominees for the two vacant spots on the five-member Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the highest ranking Democrat on the committee.The nominations of Democrat Lisa Fairfax and Republican Hester Peirce now go to the full Senate.The Republican-led Congress has been slow to fill empty seats at agencies and boards, and many of the nominations made by outgoing President Barack Obama, a Democrat, have stalled. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, said the committee has yet to hold hearings for nominees to the Federal Reserve Board or the board of the Export-Import Bank. ""It is disgraceful that the Senate still hasn't confirmed any of the 20 nominations that the Banking Committee has received since the start of last year,"" said Brown in a statement. ""These nominees are essential to promoting financial stability, protecting national security, and ensuring that American businesses of all sizes can compete on a level playing field with foreign competitors.""The two SEC nominees were part of a block of five nominations that were approved by a single voice vote in a room near the Senate floor. 
The committee also approved Jay Lerner as inspector general of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, Amias Gerety as assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department and Rhett Jeppson as director of the U.S. Mint. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, dissented in the hastily scheduled vote in protest over the Export-Import Bank board nominees.""Despite the fact that Congress finally passed my bill to reauthorize the agency last December, the Ex-Im Bank has still been hamstrung from supporting American jobs and businesses because there isn't a majority on the board,"" she said in a statement. ""I don't have strong concerns with the nominees we voted on today."" 
The committee attempted to approve the nominees last month, but opposition from Democrats over corporate political disclosure threw the vote into disarray. The Democrats had pressed the SEC nominees to support a requirement that corporations disclose political donations.Obama put the two names forward in October. 
Peirce once worked on the Senate Banking Committee staff and then became a senior research fellow and director of the financial markets working group at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Fairfax is a law professor at George Washington University, and has written a primer on shareholder activism. (Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Bernard Orr and Steve Orlofsky)"

By Daniel Trotta

The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday accused the city of Cleveland of taking too long to issue permits to protesters planning demonstrations at the Republican National Convention in July and threatened to sue if the city delays further.""Delays by the city are effectively blocking groups from exercising their fundamental right to political expression,""  Christine Link, executive director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. ""Cleveland is using security planning as a mask to suppress political speech.""Thousands of demonstrators are expected to converge outside the convention from July 18 to 21 when presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is likely to receive the party's nomination for the Nov. 8 general election.Raucous protests for and against the candidate have erupted at Trump events during the primary campaign.Large groups require a parade permit in Cleveland for demonstrations that would obstruct traffic or occur during special events.
City spokesman Dan Williams said permits would be issued ""in time for the convention"" but he declined to say what date it considered appropriate. He said he was unaware of any permits issued so far.The normal permitting process could not be expected for the convention because ""this is not normal,"" Williams said.The city of Philadelphia, which will host the Democratic convention a week later, has already begun issuing permits, and Cleveland has told protesters they should wait until two weeks before the convention, the ACLU said.
Undue delays may infringe on protesters' rights to free speech, the ACLU said, suggesting a deadline of June 1.If Cleveland delays too long, the ACLU would file a lawsuit in federal court and ask for an expedited hearing, Link said in a telephone interview.Protesters need adequate time to make travel arrangements and rent needed materials such as portable toilets and sound stage equipment, Link said.
The ACLU wrote on behalf of Citizens for Trump, which applied for a permit one month ago, and the liberal activist group Organize Ohio, which has been waiting two months for a permit.Citizens for Trump anticipates 104 cars and trucks, 100 motorcycles, four horses and at least 5,000 people to participate in its event, while Organize Ohio expects 3,000 to 5,000 marchers, the ACLU said.Another attorney represents an individual, John Penley, who has said the city has yet to even respond to his request for a permit application, the ACLU said.

By Dustin Volz and Sweta Singh

The Senate Homeland Security Committee's top Democrat sought information Thursday from global financial network SWIFT and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on steps being taken to bolster cyber security in the wake of the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh.Senator Tom Carper of Delaware requested that both answer questions and brief his staff by June 17 on how they were handling issues following the February heist, during which hackers wired money out of an account at the New York Fed held by Bank Bangladesh, as well as how they were safeguarding against other potential cyber threats.""These cyber attacks raise important questions about the security of the SWIFT system and the ability of its members to prevent future attacks,"" Carper wrote in his letters.The inquiry comes as policymakers, regulators and financial institutions around the world increase scrutiny into the heist at Bank Bangladesh and a separate attempt to use fraudulent SWIFT messages to steal from a commercial bank in Vietnam.The Association of Banks in Singapore told Reuters it had invited SWIFT for a meeting in June to discuss the latest cyber attacks. The Bank of England last month ordered British banks to provide documentation on SWIFT security measures. 
In his letters, Carper said there appeared to be no evidence the Federal Reserve systems were penetrated or compromised in the Bangladesh attack. The New York Federal Reserve has denied responsibility for the intrusion, which some security researchers have said was due to a flaw in the SWIFT bank messaging network.The identity of the Bangladesh hackers remains unknown.
Brussels-based SWIFT is a cooperative owned by some 3,000 global financial institutions.A representative for SWIFT could not immediately be reached for comment. The New York Fed plans to respond, a representative said.Carper asked SWIFT how it shares information about cyber security threats against member banks, whether there were consequences for members who did not follow security standards and if it plans to revise its cyber security policies in response to the Bangladesh attacks, among other questions.
He requested similar information from the Federal Reserve, including steps it has taken to coordinate with SWIFT, Bangladesh Bank, the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Treasury since the heist.Major U.S. banks are scrutinizing security of the SWIFT messaging network following the cyber attacks, according to media reports.

By Emma Batha

COPENHAGEN (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - U.S. presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton called for renewed efforts to ""break down the barriers holding back women and girls around the world"" on Thursday.In a video address to Women Deliver, a major women's health and rights conference, she said gender equality must be made a priority in the drive to meet new U.N. development goals.""Two decades ago at the U.N. fourth world conference on women in Beijing we came together and said with one voice that women's rights are human rights. And the gains we've made since then prove that progress is possible,"" she said.""But as you all know too well, our work is far from finished. This is an important moment as we chart a course to meet the new Sustainable Development Goals. We have to break down the barriers holding back women and girls around the world.""More than 5,500 delegates from over 160 countries  - including world leaders, ministers, health experts, economists, business leaders, activists, royalty and celebrities - have attended the four-day conference in Copenhagen.
Discussions focused on how to put girls and women at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed by world leaders last year to fight inequality and extreme poverty.""Gender equality, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, must be a core priority,"" Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in the race to the White House, said in the unscheduled video address.""To get there we need greater political will and resources, and we need to continue to invest in more and better data to measure progress.
""The Women Deliver summit is critical to this work,"" Clinton added. ""You carry the spirit of Beijing forward bringing in new voices and lifting up the next generation of leaders.""Mogens Lykketoft, president of the U.N. General Assembly, said he hoped a woman would become the next head of the world body when Ban Ki-moon steps down later this year.
""It would be symbolically and of real value very important that at the end of 2016 we will have the first ever elected female U.N. secretary general, and the first ever female president of the most powerful of nations - the United States.""What a way to demonstrate that our shared vision can become a reality,"" he said.Women candidates in the running include former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova of Bulgaria.

| DETROIT

DETROIT United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said on Thursday the union will endorse either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders for U.S. president ""soon,"" and called for unity among Democrats behind the eventual nominee.Williams, head of the richest U.S. union, vowed that the labor group will be ""all in"" to support the eventual Democratic nominee. The UAW has more than 1 million current and retired members.In a news conference at UAW headquarters, Williams did not say whether the UAW would endorse a candidate before the June 7 Democratic primary in California, but said he and top union leaders could decide quickly over the phone when the time comes to announce a decision.In early polling of UAW members, 28 percent preferred Donald Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee. Williams said the poll was conducted at a time when Trump talked about bringing jobs back to the United States and before the union distributed comments Trump made last August in a Detroit News interview when he said U.S. automakers should shift production from Michigan to states where wages could be lowered.Williams would not reveal how Clinton or Sanders fared in the early polling among UAW members when Trump received about 28 percent of the support.
Williams said he did not know the current level of support among UAW members for Trump, but he indicated that he is confident most of the onetime Trump supporters would side with a Democratic candidate. Williams said the Republican Party is for ""free trade"" and not ""fair trade"" and that the result of a Republican presidency would be lower wages for U.S. workers.""I don't want a president that has a good line,"" said the UAW chief. ""I want to know what the detail is.""
Williams said, ""It's not a game show.""Separately, he said he may seek a meeting with Tesla Motors Inc's Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk when he calls on other corporate leaders.Williams said he met twice with Musk five years ago, before he became UAW president in mid-2014. Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, which is nonunion, has increased production and the number of employees greatly since then.
Williams said the UAW continues to work to organize the Tesla plant but he would not give any details on how intense that effort is.""It's still a priority,"" he said. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A small group of bipartisan senators introduced a bill Thursday that would block a pending judicial rule change allowing U.S. judges to issue search warrants for remote access to computers in any jurisdiction, even overseas, arguing the change would expand the FBI's hacking authority.The one-page legislation from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Republican Senator Rand Paul would undo the change, adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in a private vote last month and without congressional involvement, to procedural rules governing the court system.Republican Senator Steve Daines and Democrats Tammy Baldwin and Jon Tester are co-sponsoring the Stopping Mass Hacking Act.Magistrate judges currently can only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, typically limited to a few counties.""This is a dramatic expansion of the government's hacking and surveillance authority,"" Wyden said in a statement. ""Such a substantive change with an enormous impact on Americans' constitutional rights should be debated by Congress, not maneuvered through an obscure bureaucratic process.""
Companion legislation is expected in the House soon,  Wyden's office said.The U.S. Justice Department has pushed for the rule change since 2013 and has portrayed it as a procedural tweak needed to modernize the criminal code to pursue sophisticated 21st century criminals.Congress has until Dec. 1 to vote to reject, amend or postpone the changes to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure. If lawmakers fail to act, the change will automatically take effect, a scenario seen as likely given the short timeline. 
But civil liberties groups and Alphabet's Google  have argued the change should be properly authorized by Congress  and could violate the U.S. Constitution's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Many organizations have vowed to lobby Congress intensely in the coming months to block it.
The change would permit judges to issue warrants in cases where a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnot.Tensions over the FBI's secretive hacking tools, also known as ""network investigative techniques,"" have played out in a number of recent cases involving the bureau's covert seizure of a dark web child pornography website in February 2015 to track thousands of the site's visitors.Two defendants in the investigation secured rulings last month declaring the warrants used in their cases were invalid under current limitations of Rule 41.

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives' information technology team this week reinstated access on its internet network to software applications hosted on a Google cloud service after the company addressed potential security fears, according to an email seen by Reuters.Yahoo Mail remains inaccessible, however, and has been blacklisted since the House Information Security Office said in an April 30 memo it had detected an increase of ransomware attacks on the network. The two restrictions were not related, but came within days of each other and made some communication among lawmakers and their staff more difficult, several congressional aides said.
Devices connected to the House's internet via Wi-Fi or ethernet cables were barred from accessing appspot.com, the domain where Alphabet Inc's Google hosts custom-built apps, on May 3 due to concerns about a potential security vulnerability identified publicly by the FBI in June 2015.	""Based on Google's corrective actions of removing suspicious applications from appspot.com, InfoSec has unblocked access to appspot.com on the House Network,"" an email sent by the House's technology service desk on Monday said.
It is unclear if that apparent appspot.com flaw caused any damage or presented any actual threat. The House Information Service Office did not respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, a Yahoo spokesperson said it had been working with the House's technology staff to address their questions.""Unfortunately, we have been disappointed that they have not moved as quickly on recommended changes that would better protect its employees"" the spokesperson said.Two individuals fell victim to ransomware by clicking on infected Word document email attachments, sources familiar with the hacking said. The infected files were able to be recovered without paying any ransom, sources told Reuters last week."
