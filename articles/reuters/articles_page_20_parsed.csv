| SAN DIEGO

SAN DIEGO The U.S. judge overseeing a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump and his Trump University told both sides they would be wise to settle the case ""given all else that's involved.""Lawyers for the president-elect are squaring off against students who claim they were they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing ""secrets"" from his ""hand-picked"" instructors. Earlier on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel tentatively rejected a bid by Trump to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign out of the fraud trial.Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students' court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business. Trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 28, and Curiel told lawyers he was not inclined to delay the six-year-old case further. Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said he would ask to put the trial on hold until early next year, in light of the many tasks the magnate has before his inauguration.Curiel said he would allow both sides to file briefs on whether to delay the case. He also indicated they should consider making a deal. 
""It would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that's involved,"" Curiel said.Petrocelli told reporters after the hearing that Trump might have to be a ""little more flexible"" about settling the case now that he is president-elect, although the lawyer wasn't sure his client would was willing.Curiel said that he would allow Trump to testify via video given his presidential obligations. 
In the tentative ruling Curiel, based in San Diego, said Trump's lawyers can renew objections to specific campaign statements and evidence during trial. Trump's attorneys had argued that jurors should not hear about statements Trump made during the campaign, including about Curiel himself.Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trump's pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Trump's lawyers argued that Curiel should bar from the trial accusations about Trump's personal conduct including alleged sexual misconduct, his taxes and corporate bankruptcies, along with speeches and tweets. They argued the information is irrelevant to the jury and prejudicial to the case. 
In court papers, lawyers for the students claimed that Trump's statements would help jurors as they weigh the Republican's credibility.""Defendants have not identified specific evidence that they wish to exclude,"" Curiel wrote on Thursday. ""Accordingly, the court declines to issue a blanket ruling at this time.""The judge also barred Trump lawyers from telling jurors that the university had a 98 percent approval rate on student evaluations. That rating is irrelevant as to whether Trump University misrepresented itself, Curiel wrote.Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit by New York's attorney general is pending. (Reporting by Dan Levine in San Diego and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Cynthia Osterman)"	['Trump']	[]

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Some of the most controversial proposals Donald Trump made while running for U.S. president disappeared from his campaign website on Thursday, but a spokesman said what some observers took as a softening of Trump's policies was due to a technical glitch.The link to Trump's Dec. 7 proposal titled: ""Donald J. Trump statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration,"" in which he called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" vanished temporarily from the website but later reappeared.So too did a list of Trump's potential Supreme Court justice picks as president and certain details of his economic, defense and regulatory reform plans.""The website was temporarily redirecting all specific press release pages to the home page,"" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in an email. Links to Trump's policy proposals, including the Muslim ban, were working again by 3:30 p.m. EST (2030 GMT).The links, which had redirected readers to a campaign fundraising page, appeared to have been removed around Election Day on Tuesday, when Trump won a historic upset against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to a website that records historic snapshots of web pages.
In an appearance on CNBC on Thursday, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal praised Trump for removing the Muslim ban proposal from his website and also said Trump had deleted statements offensive to Muslims from his Twitter account.The prince could not be reached for comment after the links were restored.Several tweets attacking Muslims that Trump sent while campaigning for president remained in his feed on Thursday,  including a March 22 tweet in which Trump wrote: 
""Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in. No way!""After initially praising the removal of the Muslim ban proposal at a news conference with other civil rights leaders on Thursday, Samer Khalaf, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a follow-up interview the group was hoping to see better behavior from Trump.""False hope just came over us,"" Khalaf said, but ""we didn't really think it was monumental that they took down the language.""
Khalaf said Trump's policies were more important than any statements. ""He's elected, he said some horrible things, now we have to see what his policies are. If they're good policies we're going to commend him for it. If they're horrible policies we're going to challenge him on it.""Despite the temporary glitch, most of Trump's core policy positions had remained on his website, including his central immigration promise to build an ""impenetrable physical wall"" on the border with Mexico and make Mexico pay for its construction.It was not the first time the Trump campaign blamed technical difficulties for changes to its website. The campaign this year also replaced the part of the site describing Trump's healthcare policy with a different version. When contacted about it by Reuters in September, the campaign put the original page back up.

CHICAGO A former U.S. representative whose lavish office in Washington raised questions about use of taxpayer dollars was indicted on Thursday on charges of defrauding the federal government and campaign committees and attempting to cover it up, according to court documents. Aaron Schock, a 35-year-old former Republican congressman from Illinois, was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on 24 counts, including wire fraud, theft of government funds and filing false federal income tax returns. Schock maintained his innocence on Thursday before the indictment was announced. ""Neither I nor anyone else intentionally did anything wrong,"" he said in a statement. ""As I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes - no one intended to break any law."" Schock's position in public office did not put him above the law, the Department of Justice said. ""These charges allege that Mr. Schock deliberately and repeatedly violated federal law, to his personal and financial advantage,"" Jim Lewis, U.S. attorney for the Central District of Illinois, said in a statement on Thursday. 
""Mr. Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offenses, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds.""Schock, elected to the, U.S. House of Representatives in 2008 at the age of 27, gained a following for posting flashy photos on social media of himself traveling around the world. But he was hounded with questions after The Washington Post reported last year about lavish decorations in his Capitol Hill office based on the PBS period melodrama ""Downton Abbey."" 
Although staff told the Post that the interior design work had been done for free, the story prompted more investigations into Schock's spending habits, with several media outlets reporting he failed to disclose some expenditures and had to repay others after improperly using taxpayer funds.On Thursday, Schock said before the indictment that his faith in the Justice Department had been eroded.       
""This indictment will look bad, but underneath it is just made-up allegations of criminal activity arising from unintentional administrative errors,"" George Terwilliger III, Schock's attorney, said in a statement prior to the indictment.  A summons will be issued to Schock by the U.S. Clerk of the  Court for an arraignment date in Springfield, Illinois.

WASHINGTON Getting more Americans to enroll for health insurance under President Barack Obama's healthcare law known as Obamacare is a top priority of his administration until President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, the White House said on Thursday.""We would be focused on ... maximizing the opportunity that currently is available for millions of Americans to go to healthcare.gov during the open enrollment period and sign up for healthcare,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a news briefing.Sylvia Burwell, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, tweeted on Thursday that Nov. 9 was HealthCare.gov's best day with 100,000 sign-ups since it began selling the 2017 Obamacare plans on Nov. 1. The government's goal is for more than 13.8 million sign-ups initially.Trump has said that he plans to repeal Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Insurers have said that 2017 Obamacare plans will remain in place and that any changes would affect 2018 plans.
Earnest said that people should not worry about what could happen to the healthcare exchanges under the Trump administration.""These are benefits that are available to them today. We certainly would encourage people to sign up and capitalize on the good opportunity that's there,"" he said.
Obama met with Trump on Thursday for the first time in a one-on-one, 90-minute meeting in the White House Oval Office.    Trump also released a review of his goals to overhaul healthcare on his website, reiterating that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Trump's pledge to repeal Obamacare may not be easy. He does not have the votes in Congress for an outright repeal and will have to cut away at its financing first, health policy experts say.

By Andy Sullivan and Michelle Conlin

 (This November 9th story has been refiled to clarify that Keyes comment in 3rd paragraph from end was said in jest)By Andy Sullivan and Michelle ConlinWASHINGTON In a bitterly divisive presidential election, at least one thing united U.S. voters: a feeling that the country's economic and political systems were tilted against them.A Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll of 45,000 voters found an electorate burning with resentment against Wall Street, politicians and the news media, increasingly alienated from a country that is changing in ways it doesn't like.This sense of alienation transcended partisan boundaries, uniting supporters of Republican victor Donald Trump and his  Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.""This is rage against the machine,"" said Carrie Sheridan, a former supporter of Democratic President Barack Obama, as fellow Trump supporters celebrated the real-estate mogul's victory early Wednesday by pouring champagne on each other at his $200 million luxury hotel near the White House.Some 75 percent of poll respondents, Republicans and Democrats alike, agreed that the country needs a ""strong leader"" to take the country back from the rich and powerful. Seven out of ten agreed that the economy is ""rigged"" to benefit wealthy insiders. Most backed the notion that their leaders were out of touch: 77 percent of Trump supporters and 56 percent of Clinton supporters agreed that traditional politicians didn't care about people like them.(Graphic of Reuters/Ipsos poll: tmsnrt.rs/2ffJJ9A) This sense of disconnection ran deepest among Trump supporters. Some 73 percent agreed with the idea that ""more and more, I don't identify with what America has become,"" while 61 percent said they felt like strangers in their own country. Most Clinton supporters said they didn't share those sentiments.Nine out of ten Trump supporters said mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth. Trump, who travels in his own 757 jet, might seem like an unlikely candidate to benefit from this anti-elite sentiment. 
But by 8 p.m. Eastern time, lines had formed at the velvet ropes by 8 p.m. Eastern time outside Trump's new hotel in between the White House and the U.S. Capitol, where a steak costs $60 and wine is sold by the spoonful. ""These are shadow voters, voters who have never voted before,"" said Preston Parry, 20, who was watching the results with a throng of friends, all of them wearing suits and Trump campaign trucker hats.Despite his gilded lifestyle, Trump capitalized on working-class fears of a rapidly changing country. Styling himself as a ""blue-collar billionaire,"" he promised to bring back manufacturing jobs back to forgotten factory towns and sharply curtail immigration. He drew overwhelming support from white working-class voters in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, winning enough states to capture the White House even as he lost the popular vote.Trump's scathing characterization of Clinton as a corrupt career politician also resonated in an year when many voters said they were primarily casting a vote against one of the candidates.
VOTING AGAINST CANDIDATE
Some 46 percent of Trump supporters said they backed him because they didn't want Clinton to win, while 40 percent of Clinton supporters said they were motivated primarily to stop Trump from reaching the White House. Those who made up their minds in the last week of the campaign were more likely to cite opposition to one of the candidates as their main reason for voting.Politicians like Clinton are ""taking away from what we were as a country and saying we should change because of the people coming in, the immigrants and refugees,"" said John Scherer, a 57-year-old former maintenance worker in Portsmouth, Ohio.Scherer's sentiments were widely shared by Trump supporters, as 72 percent agreed with the idea that immigrants threaten traditional American beliefs and customs. Three-quarters of Clinton backers, by contrast, said immigrants strengthened U.S. society.
The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states, including more than 45,000 people who already voted in the presidential election.Voter dissatisfaction isn't exactly new. Surveys have consistently found since 2002 that most people believe the country is on the wrong track, a period that encompasses a Republican and Democratic president, two wars, a deep recession and a slow recovery.Trump supporters were more likely to share this frustration. Some 70 percent who backed the Republican real-estate mogul said they felt the country was on the wrong track, while only 23 percent of Clinton supporters agreed, according to the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.Those figures could quickly turn on their head as the reality of a Trump presidency sinks in. Across the country, Clinton supporters used unusually harsh language when describing the election result. In Washington, D.C., non-profit manager Trisha Postyuk said she saw her vote for Clinton as ""a triumph over evil."" In St. Petersburg, Florida, cafe owner Amanda Keyes, 33, said racist and sexist attitudes are going to take many years to overcome.""Misogyny will continue to bubble through the country but I can only hope that the old people will die,"" she said jokingly.At Trump's hotel, a couple from Atlanta looked at a text message from a friend who had bet them $100 that Trump would lose. ""Please don't ever text me again,"" the message said.     (Additional reporting by Emily Flitter in Ohio, Ian Simpson in Washington and Letitia Stein in Florida; editing by Stuart Grudgings.)"

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-putin-trump-idUSKBN1352J9	Trump's foreign policy approach almost same as that of Putin: Kremlin	"


By Andrew Osborn
| MOSCOW

MOSCOW The Kremlin said on Thursday U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policy approach was ""phenomenally close"" to that of President Vladimir Putin, giving Russia hope that tattered U.S.-Russia relations could gradually be improved.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking in New York, said he saw incredible similarities between the two men's foreign policy ideas, and this meant there was a solid basis to start a meaningful dialogue between Moscow and Washington.         Peskov, in the United States for a chess tournament, said he was struck by how similar parts of Trump's victory speech were to a speech Putin gave in southern Russia last month. Both men said they would put their own country's national interests first, but that they would be ready to develop ties with other nations, depending on how ready other countries were to deepen relations themselves.
""They (Putin and Trump) set out the same main foreign policy principles and that is incredible,"" Peskov said in comments broadcast by Russian state TV's Channel One on Thursday evening.""It is phenomenal how close they are to one another when it comes to their conceptual approach to foreign policy. And that is probably a good basis for our moderate optimism that they will at least be able to start a dialogue to start to clear out the Augean stables in our bilateral relations."" 
With Moscow and Washington now at odds over Syria, Ukraine and NATO, Peskov cautioned that it would take a long time before relations could return to a high level, however, because of how far they had been allowed to deteriorate.""An atmosphere of mutual trust takes years to achieve,"" he said. ""It's not possible to just declare that there is an atmosphere of mutual trust, especially after such serious damage was done in the last few years to our relations.""
Peskov told the TASS news agency separately that Putin was ready to be flexible when it came to mending ties which he wanted to improve, but that there was a limit to his flexibility and that he would need to see some U.S. reciprocity.Peskov spoke after one of Russia's most senior diplomats told the Interfax news agency earlier on Thursday that the Russian government had been in touch with members of Trump's political team during the U.S. election campaign and knew most of his entourage.
