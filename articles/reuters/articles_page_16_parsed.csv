TOKYO Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe aims to underscore the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance when he meets President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said on Sunday.""This is going to be an important meeting to build trust,"" Kishida told public broadcaster NHK. ""We also would like to use this opportunity to input the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance, as well.""With Abe set to meet Trump in New York on his way to an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru, Tokyo has been seeking clarity on what direction the Republican political novice wants for bilateral relations after he made comments on the campaign trail that were at odds with longstanding policies.
Kishida reiterated Japan's long-standing position that it has no plans to possess nuclear weapons. During his campaign, Trump left open the possibility that Japan - the only country to have suffered a nuclear bombing - might adopt nuclear weapons.""I don't believe Japan will possess nuclear arms. This principle won't change,"" Kishida said.
Trump's campaign comments on Japan's nuclear armament and his demand that Japan pay more for the upkeep of U.S. forces on its soil have worried Tokyo about a possible rift in a security alliance with Washington that has been the bedrock of its defense since World War Two.Defence Minister Tomomi Inada told the same NHK program that Japan is already shouldering enough financial burden to support U.S. troops deployed in Japan. 
""Japan is making sufficient contribution,"" she said. ""I would like to continue underscoring that Japan is going to strengthen its own defense posture both in quality and quantity, strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance and strengthen ties with other relevant countries.""

ANKARA Turkey warned its citizens about travel to the United States on Saturday in response to what the foreign ministry called increasingly violent protests against President-elect Donald Trump.""Within the context of risks caused by the incidents and of social tension, our citizens who live in the U.S., or who are considering traveling there, should be cautious,"" the ministry said in a statement.Demonstrators planned to gather again on Saturday in U.S. cities nationwide to protest against Trump, whose election they say poses a threat to their civil and human rights, a day after a protester was shot in Portland, Oregon.
Last month, the U.S. State Department updated its travel warning on Turkey, ordering family members of consulate employees in Istanbul to leave the country, citing threats against U.S. citizens.There has been growing tension between the two NATO allies after repeated calls from Turkey to extradite U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara blames for a failed coup in July.
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday he hoped for an improvement in bilateral ties after Trump's victory, and again called for Gulen's extradition.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Congressional Republicans are looking for the quickest ways to tear down Obamacare following Donald Trump's election as U.S. president, including rapidly confirming a new health secretary who could recast regulations while waiting for lawmakers to pass sweeping repeal legislation.Trump's victory on Tuesday means Republicans will control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. But congressional Democrats are expected to put up a huge fight against Republican efforts to repeal the 2010 law considered President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.The Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, has provided 25 million previously uninsured Americans with health coverage. Republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law, which they call a government overreach.Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, a member of Senate Republican leadership, said one way for the incoming president and Congress to attack Obamacare immediately after Trump takes office on Jan. 20 would be to quickly confirm a new secretary of Health and Human Services, the official who writes the rules and regulations that enforce the law.""We could confirm someone on Jan. 20 who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations to give more freedom and choice to the states, to insurance companies and to businesses that are trying to provide affordable care to their workers,"" Barrasso said in a telephone interview.Barrasso noted that the Senate needs only a simple majority vote in the 100-seat chamber to confirm Cabinet members, as opposed to 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles the Democrats could present to repeal legislation.Passing repeal legislation ""is not a 'Day One' activity. But a new secretary of HHS going after the regulations can be a 'Day One' activity,"" Barrasso added.Trump during the campaign called Obamacare ""a disaster"" and joined fellow Republicans in vowing to repeal and replace it with proposals like tax-free health savings accounts. His transition website says Trump wants a solution that ""returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states.""
In repealing Obamacare, congressional Republican may have to resort to a special procedure known as reconciliation to get around Democrats in the Senate, where rules protect the rights of the minority party.Republicans in Congress used reconciliation to try to undo large chunks of Obamacare in January, but Obama vetoed the legislation. The bill would have wiped out tax subsidies provided to help people afford insurance coverage, as well as tax penalties on people who do not obtain insurance as required by the law, and would have eliminated expansion of the Medicaid insurance health insurance program. Republican Representative Chris Collins of New York, one of Trump's earliest supporters on Capitol Hill, said he hopes Congress can pass a similar bill gutting Obamacare within Trump's first 100 days in office, a promise Trump made during the presidential campaign. But some changes will doubtless be phased in over time, Collins said.""There's nothing that we will be able to do or would want to do that would impact anyone's health insurance plan for 2017,"" Collins said in an interview.
""From a replacement standpoint, our position has always been as Republicans to move forward in a step-by-step fashion,"" Barrasso said.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Friday, Trump said he was considering retaining parts of Obamacare including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions.MORE FLEXIBILITY 

While waiting for Congress to act on legislation, the new HHS secretary could be reworking Obamacare regulations, Barrasso said. For example, regulations could give U.S. states more flexibility under a provision that lets states seek waivers from key provisions of the law, such as exemptions from the so-called individual mandate requiring Americans to obtain insurance and the employer mandate to provide it.Kim Monk, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, which provides policy research to financial institutions, said Trump's HHS might be able to tighten up the rules governing special enrollment periods for Obamacare. Insurers complain that these periods have allowed some people who initially skipped buying insurance to sign up after becoming ill.HHS might also be able to alter the language on ""essential benefits"" that the law requires insurance plans to cover, which include trips to the emergency room, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services, Monk said.""The law requires they have to cover 10 essential health benefit categories, but how that gets defined, a lot of that is interpretative,"" Monk said. ""And of course, everything the Obama administration interpreted was more, more, more, more expensive coverage, and all these things lead to premium increases.""Collins, a member of the Trump transition team's executive committee, said the job of HHS secretary or surgeon general ""would be great for Ben Carson,"" referring to the neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination and later endorsed Trump.

By Laila Kearney

Seattle financial worker Harrison Karlewicz had been considering joining an environmental activist group for a while. The day after Donald Trump won the White House, he signed up.""That was a big push for me, kind of a wakeup call,"" the 25-year-old said, after joining 350 Seattle, a group that stages mass protests against fossil fuel use. ""I thought, 'I don't feel involved. I want to get out there.'""During his campaign, Trump said global warming was a hoax and called for the Environmental Protection Agency to be gutted. He promised to ""cancel"" the Paris climate agreement between the United States and nearly 200 other countries to slow climate change, and he pledged to revive the coal industry.Karlewicz represents what environmental activists say is the silver lining of Trump's electoral victory: Environmentally minded people angered by the outcome are rallying to their cause.At 350 Seattle, people packed a volunteer drop-in meeting  after news of Trump's confirmed win, said organizer Emily Johnston. The group blocked a rail line in Washington state that transports oil to Shell and Tesoro refineries earlier this year.     ""This was surprising to me, because I personally was so shaken that I felt practically paralyzed, and I know many other people did, too,"" Johnston said. ""The fact that many others responded by immediately engaging is incredibly heartening.""Jay O'Hara, a Vermont-based climate-change activist with the Climate Disobedience Center and a mastermind behind a coal shipment blockade in 2013 that spurred more radical fossil fuel activism, said Trump's win represents an opportunity for environmentalists to focus on a clear enemy.""In some ways, it can almost be seen as a relief,"" he said of Trump's win. ""We are going to have a real fight here, or maybe an actual argument.""
Johnston, of 350 Seattle, who camped for a week at North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux reservation to protest pipeline construction, said that protesters would continue to take advantage of the vulnerability of energy infrastructure.""All these pipelines, all these tankers, all these trains have to go through thousands of miles"" and could be potential protest targets, she said.DEFENDING GAINS

Some of the well established national environmental organizations that helped draft the Obama administration's environmental initiatives, like the Clean Power Plan to curb carbon dioxide emissions, will be shifting to a defensive posture under Trump's leadership.""We'll be in the Congress, in the courts, in the boardrooms and in the streets,"" said Gene Karpinski, president of the Washington-based League of Conservation Voters, which backed Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and spent over $45 million to support candidates in the 2016 elections.Karpinski said he expected legal action to prevent Trump from following through on his agenda. Trump has appointed Myron Ebell, a known climate skeptic, to guide the reshaping of the EPA, and Trump energy adviser Kevin Cramer, a U.S. representative from North Dakota, said Trump is likely to target the Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rules during his first 100 days in office.
Dan Farber, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, said the best that advocates for climate change action could hope for from  courts is to ""play successful defense against an anti-environmental onslaught"" from the new administration.    ""It's a fairly grim situation,"" he added.Several groups also said they would put a greater focus on state-level environmental initiatives to sidestep Trump's administration. The Sierra Club, which is headquartered in California, said it would push ahead with its Beyond Coal campaign, which has led to the retirement of hundreds of coal plants since it was launched more than a decade ago. The campaign mobilizes local activists and lawyers to push utilities and state regulators to shutter older plants and replace them with renewable energy. ""Clearly, we are going to have to fight and resist the worst impulses of the next administration,"" said Michael Brune, Sierra Club's executive director. ""But we are also mindful that despite all odds, we were able to make great progress during the Bush administration and we hope to do it again.""

By Javier Galeano
| MIAMI

MIAMI Thousands of protesters took their frustrations over Donald Trump's election as the next U.S. president onto the streets on Friday and into Saturday in several cities, including Portland, Oregon, where one protester was shot.The unidentified man was wounded on Portland's Morrison Bridge at 12:45 a.m. local time as he and dozens of other protesters crossed it during their demonstration, one of several across the country denouncing Trump's campaign rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and women.In the Portland incident, police said in a statement that a man got out of a vehicle on the bridge where he confronted and then shot a protester, who was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The suspect is still at large, police added.Earlier in the night, protesters blocked traffic and threw objects at Portland police dressed in riot gear who responded with pepper spray and flash-bang devices. At one point, police pushed protesters back and appeared to take at least one person into custody, according to footage on a local NBC affiliate. Hundreds of protesters also marched through the streets of Los Angeles, blocking traffic as they waved signs in opposition of Trump and chanted ""We reject the president elect"" and ""Whose streets? Our Streets"". Several thousand activists marched through downtown Miami, with a few hundred making their way onto a highway, halting traffic in both directions.In New York, demonstrators again gathered in Washington Square Park and by Trump Tower, where the Republican president-elect lives, on Fifth Avenue.Trump, who initially denounced Americans who protested against his election, saying they had been ""incited"" by the media, reversed course and praised them on Friday.
""Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!"" Trump said on Twitter.The tweets were further evidence of Trump's mixed messages since he announced his candidacy 17 months ago. After Democrat Hillary Clinton conceded defeat early on Wednesday, he took a far more conciliatory tone than he had often displayed during his campaign and promised to be a president for all Americans. CIVIL RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS
Anti-Trump demonstrators have voiced concerns that his presidency, due to start on Jan. 20, would infringe on Americans' civil and human rights. 
They cited his campaign promises to restrict immigration and register Muslims, as well as allegations the former reality-TV star sexually abused women.Protesters in various cities have chanted slogans, including ""No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!"" and carried signs reading ""Impeach Trump"".White supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) have praised Trump's election, and some civil rights advocacy groups have reported a spike of attacks on minorities following Trump's victory on Tuesday.Trump has rejected the KKK's support.
Most of the protests across the country, which have also taken place in Washington, D.C., have been largely comprised of young adults and college students.With the country evenly divided, many voters were shocked by the result given that opinion polls failed to predict Trump's triumph. The Republican Party also managed to maintain its majorities in both houses of Congress in Tuesday's vote.More anti-Trump demonstrations were planned for the weekend, including in New York and Los Angeles. A group calling itself ""#NotMyPresident"" has scheduled an anti-Trump rally for Washington on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day, when the New York real-estate developer formally succeeds President Barack Obama.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus acknowledged on Friday the tight race with Clinton, but said anti-Trump protesters have to accept the election results. He pointed to Trump's call for unity and meetings on Thursday with Obama and Republican leaders as reasons for reassurance.Security barricades now shield some of Trump's most visible properties, including the newly opened Trump International Hotel near the White House and Trump Tower in New York.Trump's base of support in the election was the broad middle of the country, with voters in states that had long supported Democrats shifting to him after he promised to renegotiate trade deals with other countries.

By Steve Holland and Luciana Lopez
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK President-elect Donald Trump began laying the groundwork on Friday to take office on Jan. 20, 2017, gathering the most loyal advisers from his insurgent campaign and three of his children to plot his transition strategy.Trump put Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of his White House transition team, while demoting his former transition chief, tarnished New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, to one of the six vice-chair posts. Daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner accounted for a fourth of the 16-member executive committee, which was filled with politicians and advisers who stuck with Trump during his rollercoaster first run for public office. Aides huddled in the real-estate mogul's Trump Tower in New York City to begin prioritizing policy changes and considering Cabinet picks and other candidates for the 4,000 positions he will need to fill shortly after he takes the reins of the White House.A member of the Trump transition team told Reuters there were more than 100 people now involved in developing ""white papers"" on what regulations to roll back after Jan. 20. Some environmental measures and a rule requiring retirement advisers to act in their clients' interests could be among the first on the chopping block, an industry lobbying source said.Trump promised during his campaign to cut taxes, clamp down on immigration and repeal President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. But in interviews with the Wall Street Journal and CBS ""60 Minutes"" on Friday, he said he was open to keeping some provisions of Obamacare.James Woolsey, a former CIA director who has advised Trump on foreign policy, said several of Trump's campaign promises were ""advocacy of a general direction"" that may require compromise - including his signature pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico.Woolsey told CNN that border security could be achieved with a combination of fence and wall. ""I don't think we ought to fall on our sword about the difference between a wall and fence. Maybe this will be cheaper because it's mainly fence, but it's a good fence. I wouldn't have any problem with that myself,"" he said.Trump, a billionaire real estate magnate, also moved on Friday to extricate himself from his sprawling business empire, which will be overseen by his three grown children on the transition team. His company said it was vetting new business structures for the transfer of control to the three and the arrangement would not violate conflict-of-interest laws. But government ethics experts said the move would fall short of blind trust standards and was unlikely to prevent potential conflicts of interest.
Trump said that Pence - who has strong ties to Republican leaders in Congress - will build on work done by Christie and has the mission of assembling ""the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington."" Christie, once viewed as a top candidate for attorney general, is dealing with political fallout from the 'Bridgegate' lane closure scandal. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani is now the leading contender for the top law enforcement job, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.  'THERE'S A SCRAMBLE'
Trump's campaign spent relatively little time on transition planning during the campaign, and even his Republican supporters had been bracing for a loss to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's election.""I was on Romney's transition team, and it was a well-oiled machine months before the election. Now there's a scramble,"" said one Republican source, referring to the party's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.
Since Tuesday, dozens of possible cabinet appointees have been floated, from grassroots conservative heroes like Sarah Palin to seasoned Washington hands like David Malpass.During his campaign, many establishment Republicans condemned Trump's racially inflammatory rhetoric as well as his attacks on trade deals and the NATO alliance, which could take many traditional names out of the running.But outgoing Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte - who had distanced herself from Trump at points in her unsuccessful reelection campaign in New Hampshire - was being floated as a potential defense secretary on Friday, the Washington Post reported.Trump's relatively small cadre of steadfast supporters is expected to play a prominent role in his administration. Campaign sources say Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions could serve as Defense Secretary, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich might be named as Secretary of State and retired General Michael Flynn could serve as national security adviser. Those three, along with Giuliani and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, were named as vice chairs of the transition team.Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus is a strong candidate for White House chief of staff, according to sources close to the campaign. Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, a conservative provocateur, is also being considered for the job.
As Trump mulled his team, demonstrators hit the streets in major cities for the third straight night to denounce his election and the inflammatory campaign rhetoric on immigrants, Muslims and women. Thousands marched through Miami, Atlanta, Philadelphia, New York and San Francisco as night fell.ECONOMIC, FOREIGN POLICY
Trump appears to be leaning toward seasoned Republicans for many economic positions. David Malpass, a former Treasury and State Department official, and Paul Atkins, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official, are guiding the transition team on economic issues.""This is one area where the most Republican orthodoxy will come out,"" said Brandon Barford, a former Republican congressional staffer.The Trump transition website, www.greatagain.gov, picked up on the tone of legislation aimed at weakening Dodd-Frank financial regulations that was released this summer by Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling.Trump's victory is forcing President Barack Obama to scale back his ambitions for his final months in office. Obama, who is set to meet with key allies from Europe and Asia next week during his final foreign trip, is giving up on a last-ditch attempt to seek congressional approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal before leaving office.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a TPP partner, is slated to meet with Trump next week in New York, and the president-elect also fielded calls from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande on Friday.But EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had a blunter reaction to the Trump transition. ""I think we will waste two years before Mr. Trump tours the world he does not know,"" Juncker said on Friday.

By Scott Malone
| BOSTON

BOSTON The protests in major U.S. cities against Republican Donald Trump's surprise presidential election victory have been impromptu affairs, quickly organized by young Americans with a diverse array of backgrounds and agendas.But as they look out at the next four years with Trump in the White House while his party controls both houses of Congress, activists are starting to prepare for what they hope will be the nation's strongest protests since the Occupy Wall Street movement.Rallies scheduled for Saturday in New York and Los Angeles, and a protest planned for Washington on Jan. 20, when the New York businessman succeeds President Barack Obama, will be just the beginning, activists said in a series of interviews.The Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader from New York, said anti-Trump protesters should borrow a page from the playbook that Republicans used to oppose Obama's policies.That movement started organically, later developed as the Tea Party movement and eventually resulted in the election of Trump, said Sharpton, whose National Action Network plans to launch a new organizing effort at its New York headquarters on Saturday.""We are not going to be as ugly as them, but we are going to be just as persistent,"" Sharpton said. ""This is not going away."" Sizable protests sprung up this week in about a dozen major U.S. cities, including Boston, Baltimore and San Francisco. Demonstrations in Portland, Oregon, and Berkeley, California, turned violent, with protesters setting fires and clashing with police.Trump initially dismissed the crowds on Twitter, calling them ""professional protesters, incited by the media,"" but later reversed course, saying he admired their ""passion.""
PLANS TO BE 'FORCEFUL'
T.J. Wells, who had volunteered to work for Democrat Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign, said his decision to organize a Thursday night protest at Washington's Trump International Hotel near the White House was spontaneous.""I literally shared it with a few friends, and within a few hours I had a couple hundred people show up,"" said Wells, who is 27 and lives in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, where he works in human resources.
He said he hoped it would be the first of many such demonstrations.""From Inauguration Day to the time he's out of office, we have to make sure that if there's something he's going to pass that the majority of Americans who voted for Hillary Clinton are not OK with, that we are forceful about that,"" Wells said.Some 59.5 million people voted for Trump, fewer than the 59.7 million who cast ballots for Clinton, but Trump's strong showing in swing states, including Michigan, earned him a decisive victory in the Electoral College that ultimately picks the president.Opponents have cited Trump's history as a leader of the ""birther"" movement that claimed wrongly that Obama had not been born in the United States, his promises to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country and his calls to register Muslims.
Members of the ANSWER Coalition, a broad-based U.S. protest group, have marched in this week's protests and aim to draw tens of thousands to an anti-Trump Inauguration Day rally, said Walter Smolarek, an organizer.""The people are going to fight back against the Trump agenda from day one,"" Smolarek said. He said the group planned to continue to protest throughout Trump's four-year term.Since his victory on Tuesday, Trump has taken a more measured public tone than he had during the campaign. That has some civil-rights advocates ready to wait and see what Trump does before joining in protests.""I don't think that Donald Trump responds very well to protests, to be honest with you,"" said Brent Wilkes, national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens. He said he was willing to see whether Trump would be more moderate in his actions than he had been in the campaign, adding: ""If he doesn't, we'll be out there in the streets.""

By David Lawder
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama's administration has suspended its  efforts to win congressional approval for his Asian free-trade deal before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, saying on Friday that TPP's fate was up to Trump and Republican lawmakers.Administration officials also said Obama would try to explain the situation to leaders of the 11 other countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact next week when he attends a regional summit in Peru.  Obama's cabinet secretaries and the U.S. Trade Representative's office had been lobbying lawmakers for months to pass the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in the post-election, lame-duck session of Congress. However, Trump's stunning election victory that sends him to the White House in January and retains Republican majorities in Congress has stymied those plans.""We have worked closely with Congress to resolve outstanding issues and are ready to move forward, but this is a legislative process and it's up to congressional leaders as to whether and when this moves forward,"" USTR spokesman Matt McAlvanah said in a statement.
On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not take up TPP in the weeks before Trump's inauguration and said its fate was now up to Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan had earlier said he would not proceed with a lame-duck vote. Trump made his opposition to the TPP a centerpiece of his campaign, calling it a ""disaster"" and ""a rape of our country"" that would send more jobs overseas. His anti-free-trade message and pledges to stem the tide of imported goods from China and Mexico won him massive support among blue-collar workers in the industrial heartland states of Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, helping to swing the election his way.
Trump has said he will scrap TPP, renegotiate the 22-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement and adopt a much tougher trade stance with China.The TPP agreement, negotiated for more than five years and signed in October 2015, was aimed at reducing trade barriers erected by some of the fastest growing economies in Asia and boosting ties with U.S. allies in the region in the face of China's rising influence.
White House Deputy National Security Advisor Wally Adeyemo told reporters on Friday that Obama will tell TPP member countries at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that the United States will remain engaged in Asia, and that it recognizes the benefits of trade and such deals still make sense.""In terms of the TPP agreement itself, Leader McConnell has spoken to that and it's something that he's going to work with the President-elect to figure out where they go in terms of trade agreements in the future,"" Adeyemo said. ""But we continue to think that these types of deals make sense, simply because countries like China are not going to stop working on regional agreements.""
